Mr. President, today is the 10th anniversary of the \nExxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska.\n  I want to use this opportunity to reflect on the impact that disaster \nhad on the land and people of my State.\n  I still remember traveling to Alaska to view the damage caused by the \nExxon Valdez in Prince William Sound.\n  Believe me, Mr. President, it is a sight I never want to see again.\n  At that time, I referred to the huge oil slick battering against the \nshoreline as ``the black blanket of the Exxon Valdez.''\n  And while that spill caused serious damage to our wildlife, our \nenvironment and our people, that black blanket has had somewhat of a \nsilver lining.\n  I refer to the Oil Pollution Act of 1990--OPA '90.\n  Congress and the Department of Defense are currently looking at \nimplementing a ``national missile defense system'' to protect the \nUnited States from incoming ballistic missiles.\n  I consider OPA '90 to be the ``National Oil Spill Defense System'' \nthat protects the United States from future oil spills.\n  OPA '90, as many Senators will recall, was signed into law on August \n18, 1990.\n  It is important to note that OPA '90 has not been significantly \nrevised since 1990--and at present, there has not been any push for \ncomprehensive revisions.\n  It is a testament to the act itself that it has not needed major \nrevisions.\n  Some of the provisions of OPA '90 were under consideration prior to \n1989, but unfortunately, it took the Exxon Valdez spill to bring about \na comprehensive approach to our national system of oil spill prevention \nand response.\n  Congress enacted OPA '90 only 17 months after the spill--a very short \nperiod of time given the scope of the legislation.\n  That landmark piece of legislation created a new national framework \nthat focuses on both the prevention of spills and the response to \nspills.\n  It was written to reduce the chances we will ever have another spill \nof the magnitude of the Valdez--anywhere.\n  That act, and the actions it mandates, has already vastly improved \nthe response system for lesser spills.\n  On a national level, OPA '90--\n  (1) Required the phase-in of double-hull oil tankers--which has begun \nand will be completed by the year 2015;\n\n[[Page S3160]]\n\n  (2) Required improvements to vessel traffic systems and to vessel \ncommunications and warning equipment;\n  (3) Brought about stringent background checks and manning standards \nfor tank vessels;\n  (4) Required the United States to seek better international oil spill \nprevention and response measures;\n  (5) Clearly defined the liability of tank vessel owners and \noperators;\n  (6) Required the creation of a national contingency plan and response \nsystem, as well as area contingency and response plans.\n  These prevention measures are vitally important if we are to ensure \nthe safe transportation of oil in our waters.\n  As a result of OPA '90 spill response equipment must be pre-\npositioned in strategic locations all over the country.\n  By doing this, we greatly increase the response time for a future oil \nspill, God forbid it ever happens again.\n  The national and area contingency plans required by OPA '90 are the \nprimary reason the response to oil spills has become so quick.\n  Unlike when the Valdez disaster occurred, if a spill occurs today, it \nshould be literally a matter of minutes before a response plan is \nexecuted.\n  By requiring contingency plans, OPA '90 forces planning for potential \nspills in a comprehensive manner.\n  A large part of the credit for the implementation of the new plans \nshould go to the Coast Guard and I have commended it for the tremendous \nwork it has done in the past 10 years in developing the national and \narea plans.\n  In addition to the national measures put in place by OPA '90, it \ncontained a number of measures specific to Alaska and Prince William \nSound.\n  The act required the installation of a marker and light on Bligh \nReef.\n  It required tankers in Prince William Sound to be escorted by at \nleast two tugs and to have two local pilots on their bridge.\n  It required the creation of a vessel traffic system for Prince \nWilliam Sound--including an alarm system to warn if vessels deviate \nfrom the designated navigation routes.\n  It prevents the Exxon Valdez tanker from ever entering Alaska water \nagain--no matter what name it sails under or how many structural \nimprovements it undergoes.\n  While this provision is largely symbolic, it goes to the heart of how \nAlaskans feel about the disaster and our state.\n  We take pride in keeping our environment and wildlife clean and safe, \nand we expect visitors to our state to do the same.\n  In addition to the regulatory requirements set forth in OPA '90, the \nact created two regional citizens' advisory councils.\n  These councils give Alaskans a voice in the development of oil spill \nprevention and contingency measures.\n  Over the past 10 years these councils provided dialogue allowing \nAlaskans and the oil industry to work beyond differences in a positive \nmanner.\n  The main goal of all parties involved is the prevention of further \ndisasters.\n  That is the only true way to ensure that we never have to clean oil \noff Alaska beaches again.\n  I have thanked the many Alaskans who have served on the regional \ncitizens' advisory councils for the improvements they have helped bring \ninto being.\n  They could have turned their backs on the oil industry, but they \ndeserve a great deal of credit for choosing to work with the industry \nrather than trying to make a bad situation worse.\n  OPA '90 also required the creation of the oil spill recovery \ninstitute in Cordova.\n  The institute's mission is to evaluate the long term effects of the \nExxon Valdez oil spill on the environment and the people and animals of \nPrince William Sound--and to refine the world's knowledge about arctic \nand subarctic oil spills.\n  Incidently Mr. President, I have been to that institute in Cordova, \nand I must say that they are doing great things, and I encourage them \nto keep up the good work.\n  It took a number of years to secure the funding for the institute, \nbut in 1996 we managed to create a dedicated fund.\n  For a 10 year period that began in 1996, the Oil Spill Recovery \nInstitute will receive the annual interest from $22.5 million that is \ncurrently on deposit in the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund.\n  The Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund was a centerpiece of OPA `90.\n  The law made ``responsible parties'' liable for the costs of cleaning \nup oil spills.\n  As you know, Mr. President, it is not always possible to obtain \nclean-up funds from responsible parties in time to adequately respond \nto spills.\n  The Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund was created to ensure that funds \nare available to respond to oil spills in the United States.\n  This is another area where the Coast Guard deserves credit for its \nsuperb efforts in recovering costs from responsible parties.\n  You will be glad to know that many of the species negatively affected \nby the oil spill are making a strong comeback.\n  Mother nature is responding.\n  I am pleased with the environmental efforts and the progress made in \nputting new prevention measures in place.\n  It is my hope that one day my grandchildren will be able to ask me \n``Grandpa, what's an oil spill?''\n  I think OPA '90, and the efforts of everyone involved in the oil \nindustry, will help to bring about that wish.\n  Mr. President, I do not normally come before the Senate to talk about \na terrible day, but I come today to talk in the spirit of remembrance. \nAs I said, this is the 10th anniversary of the Exxon Valdez oilspill in \nmy State. I want to use this opportunity to reflect on the impact that \ndisaster had upon the people of my State and on Prince William Sound.\n  I remember that was just the beginning of the Easter recess and I had \nleft for vacation with my family when I got that call that told me of \nthis disaster, and I had to fight to get reservations to get back, but \nI did get back to my State. I flew to Prince William Sound to view the \ndamage that was there. I had talked to my good friend, former Senator \nHenry Bellmon, Governor of Oklahoma, about that, and asked him if he \nhad any advice. He said find some way to burn it.\n  I went down to the Valdez to see if there was something I might do to \nencourage that, following that advice. At the time I flew down by \nhelicopter with the Commandant of the Coast Guard, Admiral Yost. We \nflew over a sickening black blanket on the Nation's largest inland \nsound. Prince William Sound is a place where I have spent a lot of \ntime, fishing and traveling with friends. It is a beautiful place. Yet \nthat day, that black blanket oozing out of the Exxon Valdez left a \nmemory I shall never forget. That spill caused serious damage to our \nwildlife, to our environment, and to our people. It is hard, today, to \nremember anything except that great tragedy.\n  The wind kept spreading that oil. As a matter of fact, I flew up to \nAlaska with our friend, the oceanographer from the University of \nAlaska, Mr. Royer, who told me what was going to happen. He predicted \ncorrectly that that oil would go out of the Prince William Sound and \nstart down the Aleutian chain. If it went through the pass in the \nchain, it was going to cause enormous damage to the breeding grounds \nfor Alaska's fisheries.\n  It was a sad day, and I come today with a feeling of sadness.\n  In view of all the publicity that has been given to this terrible \ntragedy, I also want to talk about what I call the silver lining that \ncame as a result of that spill. That silver lining was the Oil \nPollution Act of 1990. We call it OPA '90. Congress and the Department \nof Defense are currently looking at implementing a national missile \ndefense system to protect the United States from incoming ballistic \nmissiles. I consider OPA '90 to be the national oilspill defense system \nthat protects our Nation from future oilspills.\n  It was as a result of the terrible tragedy in our State that Congress \nenacted these provisions. As many Senators here will recall, that law \nwas signed on August 18, 1990. It has not been revised since that time. \nI do not know of any push for any revisions. That is a testament to \nthat act in itself, that it has not needed major revisions in this \nperiod.\n  Some of the provisions of OPA '90 were under consideration prior to \nthat act, but unfortunately, they had no impetus. It took the Exxon \nValdez disaster to bring about a comprehensive\n\n[[Page S3161]]\n\napproach to our national system of oilspill prevention and response. We \nenacted that bill just 17 months after the spill, really a very short \ntime, given the scope of the legislation.\n  This landmark piece of legislation created a new national framework \nthat focuses on both prevention of spills and response to spills. It \nwas written to reduce the chances that we will ever have another spill \nof the magnitude of the Valdez anywhere under the American flag. That \nact, and the actions it mandates, has already vastly improved the \nresponse to lesser spills.\n  I want to point out some of the things it has done. We have greatly \nincreased the response time--that is, decreased the time it takes--we \nhave increased the ability to respond in time to spills that may take \nplace in our waters. As a result of that act, we have spill response \nequipment pre-positioned in strategic locations all over the Nation. \nThe national and area contingency plans required by OPA '90 are the \nprimary reasons the response to oilspills has become so quick. Unlike \nwhen the Valdez disaster occurred, if a spill occurs today, it should \nliterally be a matter of minutes before a plan is put into effect and \nexecuted. By requiring contingency plans in advance, OPA '90 forces \nplanning for potential spills in a comprehensive manner.\n  Mr. President, the main goal of all parties involved in that act was \nthe prevention of future disasters. That is the only true way we can \nensure that we will keep the beaches in Alaska and throughout our \nNation free of oil.\n  I have thanked many Alaskans who have served on the regional citizens \nadvisory councils for the improvements they have helped bring into \nbeing.\n  Mr. President, at my request, that act was amended to assure that \nthere would be specific Alaska provisions in it. In addition to the \nnational measures put into place by OPA '90, it contained, at my \nrequest, a number of measures specific to Prince William Sound in \nAlaska. It required the installation of a marker and light on Bligh \nReef. It required tankers in Prince William Sound to be escorted by at \nleast two tugs and to have two local pilots on the bridge. It required \nthe creation of a vessel traffic control system for Prince William \nSound, including an alarm system to warn if vessels deviated from the \nroutes they had designated at the time they left the pier.\n  It prevents the Exxon Valdez tanker from ever entering Alaskan waters \nagain, no matter what name it sails under or how many structural \nimprovements it undergoes. That provision is largely symbolic, but it \ngoes to the heart of how Alaskans feel about that disaster.\n  The only true way to ensure that we will never have to clean Alaskan \noil off Alaska beaches again is to implement the plans and maintain the \nsystems that OPA '90 requires.\n  I hope that the Nation will not lose heart, that it will continue to \nfund the facilities and the pre-positioned equipment that we require. \nFor a 10-year period that began in 1996, we have created in Alaska an \nOilspill Recovery Institute in Cordova. We also have an oilspill lab \nwith a trust fund created to assure that funds are available to respond \nto oilspills throughout the United States.\n  Let me close by saying that I want to report to the Senate that many \nof the species that were affected by the oilspill are making a strong \ncomeback. Mother Nature in the sound is responding. The environmental \nefforts that we have made and the progress we have made with putting \ninto effect the new prevention measures have, in fact, deterred future \nspills.\n  It is my hope that one day one of my grandchildren will ask me, \nGrandpa, what is an oilspill? I believe that we have gone a long way to \nmaking oilspills of the magnitude that I saw 10 years ago today a \nmemory. I hope it remains a memory.\n\n  Mr. President, I thank my friend for yielding.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/24/senate-section/article/S3161-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3161]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard).

We have gone through the Budget Committee and most of the major \nissues have been debated there and amendments offered--some accepted, \nsome failed. I don't think there is really any reason we cannot finish \nat a reasonable time and take this recess if Senators on both sides \ncooperate.\n  I urge that on my side also. There is tentatively, on my side--I know \nwhen we talk to them that it is not going to\n\n[[Page S3162]]\n\nremain this way, but they are talking about 30 or 40 amendments, almost \nall of which are sense-of-the-Senate amendments. We will never get out \nof here if that happens. Normally the minority has about twice as many. \nSo add that up and we will have 120. We could just start voting now and \nwe would not go home for the recess. So I urge we consider our own \nwell-being and what is really necessary to get this job done.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am constrained to say to the Senator \nfrom New Mexico, I thought I had problems on the supplemental bill.\n  To hear about this number of amendments is staggering.\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, bad national defense policy is about to \nget us into serious trouble--again. As I speak, United States Armed \nForces are in direct danger because they are being used as social \nworkers in a very dangerous country--Haiti. Most Americans will be \ngreatly surprised that I am saying the United States Army is still in \nHaiti. Why are most Americans surprised? Because it has been more than \n4 years since the September day in 1994 when the President sent a force \nof 20,000 troops to this island. Despite what the United States did in \nHaiti, not much has changed, except that the United States force has \nbecome tiny and in a great peril. No elected official has been able to \nbring peace or democracy to Haiti. Factional fighting has immobilized \nthe government and stymied efforts at economic recovery. The \nfactionalism has provoked assassinations and bombings reminiscent of \nthe bad old days.\n  Fortunately, Congress has been put on-call by a voice of honesty \ncoming from our uniformed ranks. Last month, General Wilhelm, Commander \nof the U.S. Southern Command, directly and honestly described the \nmounting danger surrounding his troops. The 500 United States military \npersonnel left to help prop up Haiti are doing mostly social work and \nspending much of their time defending themselves from attack. Let me be \nclear about what kinds of work our troops in Haiti are doing. They are \nnot fighting an enemy. They are involved in tasks like digging wells, \nproviding medical services, and training police and military officers. \nSuch work might be understandable if it contributed to stability. It is \nnot. The 500 United States troops still in Haiti spend much of their \nenergy just trying to protect themselves against those they came to \nhelp. Unfortunately, it is now difficult for the administration to \naccept a clearheaded understanding of these dire circumstances and call \nfor a pullout. Doing so will concede the failure of a peacekeeping \nmission regularly touted as one of the shining achievements of recent \nyears.\n  The list of the administration's failed peace missions is long and \ngrowing. I am unconvinced that trying to resuscitate these failed \nnation-states is in the U.S. vital interest. The costs of U.S. \ninvolvement in peacekeeping are not in our national interests and \nshould be reduced. The price tag of the Bosnia mission, for example, \nhas already hit $12 billion, with no end in sight. Haiti has cost more \nthan $2 billion. However, today the 500 soldiers in Haiti--mostly Army \nreservists rotating through on short-term assignments--remain in Haiti \nat a cost of about $20 million last year.\n  The question is simple: Is it in the United States' best interest to \nhave our troops in imminent danger, preoccupied with defending \nthemselves against people whom they have come to help, who have shown \nlittle inclination for reform at a cost of $20 million annually to \nAmerica? This is the path down which the administration has taken the \nUnited States. We are now involved in a steady run of civil wars \nwithout clear solutions which involve failed nation-states. We will \nsoon drown in this kind of foolishness. Stemming civil wars should not \nbe the main strategic challenge for the United States. These kinds of \nmisadventures do not really engage the strategic interest of the United \nStates. Certainly, such ill-conceived adventures do arrogantly endanger \nour troops.\n  Because of this, I call on the administration to swiftly withdraw the \n500 service men and women who are currently in Haiti.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, today we begin our annual pilgrimage \nto establishing a budget for the next fiscal year. The first year of \nthe new millennium is almost upon us, and we are moving at a fairly \nrapid pace to get this budget into place, as contrasted to some of the \nexperiences we have had in the past. I commend our chairman, Senator \nDomenici, for his lending the urgency that he has to getting this job \nunderway.\n  Lest it be misunderstood, Mr. President, that does not mean I agree \nwith everything that we have come up with. But we are moving the ball, \nas they say, and we will have a chance to amend or debate the budget \nresolution as it passed the Budget Committee.\n  As we begin our work on a budget for a new century and a new era in \nour Nation's economic history, we do it with the knowledge and the \nsatisfaction that at long last, America has put its fiscal house in \norder.\n  At the same time, we still face serious long-term questions. The key \nquestion facing Congress is whether we meet those challenges and \nprepare for the future, or whether we will yield to short-term \ntemptation at tomorrow's expense.\n  Democrats are committed to focusing on the future. Our top priority \nis to save Medicare and save Social Security for the long term by \nreducing our debt and increasing national savings. We also want to \nprovide targeted tax relief for those who need it most, and that is the \naverage middle-class family in America. We want to invest in education \nand other priorities.\n  Our friends, the Republicans, have a different view. Their plan \nfocuses on tax breaks, largely for the wealthy. These tax breaks, whose \ncosts would increase dramatically in the future, would absorb resources \nthat are needed to preserve and to save Medicare.\n  That, when you get right down to it, is really the main issue before \nthe Senate: Should we provide tax cuts, many of which will benefit the \nwealthy, or use that money to save Medicare? It is as simple as that.\n  Of course, there is a lot more to the budget resolution before us, so \nlet me take some time to explain why I, like every other Democratic \nmember of the Budget Committee, strongly opposed this resolution. There \nare four primary reasons.\n  First, as I have suggested, it fails to guarantee a single extra \ndollar for Medicare. Instead, it diverts the funds needed for Medicare \nto pay for tax cuts that, again, benefit the wealthy fairly generously.\n  Second, it does nothing to extend the solvency of the Social Security \ntrust fund. In fact, it could block President Clinton's proposed \ntransfer of surplus funds to help extend solvency.\n  Third, I think it is fiscally dangerous. The resolution proposes tax \ncuts that begin small but that explode in the future. Some are around \n$13 billion in the first year the budget goes into place, up to $180 \nbillion--$177 billion--expected in the tenth year, just when the baby \nboomers are beginning to retire.\n\n  And fourth, it proposes extreme and unrealistic cuts in domestic \nprograms. These could devastate public services if\n\n[[Page S3163]]\n\nenacted. More likely, Congress, in my view, is going to be unable to \npass appropriations bills, and we will face a crisis at the end of this \nyear that could lead to a complete Government shutdown.\n  I want to address each of these problems in turn, Mr. President.\n  Medicare's hospital insurance trust fund is now expected to become \ninsolvent in the year 2008. It is critical that we address this problem \nand we do it soon. We need to modernize and reform the program to make \nit function more efficiently, but it is clear that also we will need \nadditional resources.\n  As part of an overall solution, President Clinton proposed allocating \n15 percent of projected unified budget surpluses for Medicare. This \nwould extend the solvency of the trust fund for another 12 years, to \n2020. Unfortunately, the budget resolution rejects that proposal. \nInstead of using projected surpluses for Medicare, it uses almost all \nof them for tax cuts. The budget resolution does not specify the \ndetails of the tax cuts because they will be drafted later in the \nFinance Committee. However, the chairman of the Finance Committee, \nSenator Roth, has said recently that he wants to provide a 10-percent \ncut in tax rates.\n  Under that proposal, the top 1 percent of Americans with incomes over \n$300,000, and average incomes of more than $800,000, would get a tax \ncut of more than $20,000. And those in the bottom 60 percent, incomes \nunder $38,000, would wind up with $99, less than 100 bucks.\n  Other major GOP proposals for tax cuts, which involve estate taxes \nand capital gains taxes, are similarly regressive and unfair. Giving \naway disproportionate tax breaks to the wealthy would be bad enough, \nbut the GOP tax breaks would come at the direct expense of Medicare, \nand that is wrong.\n  Under the Republican plan, not one penny of projected surpluses is \nguaranteed for Medicare. The resolution does reserve about $100 billion \nfor unspecified uses over 10 years. But that is far less than the $350 \nbillion the President wants for Medicare over 10 years. More \nimportantly, none of the $100 billion is actually reserved for \nMedicare.\n  In fact, the chairman indicated that this amount may be used for \nunexpected emergencies or contingencies, and those alone could easily \nuse up all this money. Emergency spending averages $9 billion a year, \nmore than the resolution's annual reserve for each of the next 5 years. \nEven over 10 years, we can expect to consume at least 90 percent of \nthis projected reserve to respond to emergencies.\n  Mr. President, the Republican refusal to provide additional resources \nfor Medicare would have a direct impact on the millions of Americans \nwho will depend on Medicare for their health services in the future. \nThe resolution almost certainly would mean higher health care costs, \nhigher copayments for the individuals, their share of the bill, higher \ndeductibles--that means it does not kick in until the levels of costs \ndirectly to the individual have risen--and potentially lower quality \nhealth care services, and probably fewer hospitals, all because the \nmajority insists on providing huge tax breaks for wealthier Americans.\n  Beyond Medicare, the second major problem with the Republican \nresolution is that it does nothing to extend the solvency of the Social \nSecurity trust fund. Currently, Social Security is projected to become \ninsolvent by the year 2032. President Clinton is determined to extend \nthe solvency until 2075 and has proposed specific policies to get us to \nthe year 2055, as certified by Social Security actuaries.\n\n  The Republicans have been critical of the President's proposals to \ninvest some of the Social Security funds in the private market and to \ntransfer debt held by the public to the trust fund. Unfortunately, they \npropose nothing to increase the resources available to Social Security. \nIn fact, their resolution is specifically designed to block the \nPresident's proposed transfer of surplus funds for Social Security.\n  The bottom line, when it comes to Social Security, is clear. \nPresident Clinton's budget extends solvency through the year 2055. The \nRepublican plan does not add a single day of security.\n  The third major problem with the resolution is that it is fiscally \nrisky. The resolution calls only for small tax cuts in the first year \nor two. But the cost of those tax cuts explode in the future. And by \n2009, as I said earlier, when the baby boomers will begin retiring, the \ntax cuts will drain the Treasury of more than $180 billion in that \nyear. That is not fiscal responsibility.\n  The final problem with the Republican plan is that it includes \nextreme cuts in programs for Americans here at home. Total nondefense \ndiscretionary programs--to be absolutely clear, the discretionary \nprograms include defense and nondefense--total nondefense discretionary \nprograms would be cut in the first year from $266 billion in the \ncurrent year, not including emergency spending, to $246 billion in the \nyear 2000.\n  One does not have to be a mathematician to recognize that is a \nsignificant change--from $266 billion to $246 billion in 1 year. \nArithmetically, it looks like a 7.5-percent cut--and that does not \nsound like a lot--but the real cut in most programs would be much \ndeeper. And I assure you that 7.5-percent cut, at a minimum, is a very \nsignificant, painful exercise for those who are depending on some of \nour Government programs. And I am not talking about wasteful programs; \nI am talking about fundamental programs like WIC and border guards and \nFBI agents and DEA agents.\n  Keep in mind, the resolution claims to increase or maintain funding \nfor a handful of favored programs, like new courthouses, TEA 21, our \ntransportation program, for the next 6 years, the census, National \nInstitutes of Health, and some crime and education programs. Those are \nthe protected programs.\n  That leaves the other unprotected programs facing cuts of about 11 \npercent--everything from environmental protection to the national \nparks, the FAA, the Coast Guard, the Immigration and Naturalization \nService Border Patrol, FBI, NASA, job training, and Head Start. These \nare successful and important programs.\n  When we say that these cuts are going to be 11 percent in the first \nyear, that is being pretty conservative, because we are ignoring the \nfact that the cuts increase significantly in the future to 27 percent \nin the year 2004, a 27-percent cut for the American people.\n  Just to put the picture straight, imagine a 27-percent cut in wages, \na 27-percent cut in spending power. It would be an awful tragedy for \nmost families.\n  Second, the 11-percent figure that we talked about in the first year \nrepresents a cut from 1999 levels. To make it clear, our fiscal year \nends September 30 for 1999; and on October 1 we kick in with the budget \nfor the year 2000. That does not anticipate any inflation impact.\n\n  Thirdly, there is another problem with the Republican budget. It \nsignificantly underestimates the outlays that would flow from its \npresent levels of defense appropriations. If those outlays are \nestimated to be consistent with historical levels, the cuts in \nnondefense discretionary outlays would be as high as 21 percent in the \nfirst year.\n  I know that we are talking about a lot of different changes in the \npercentages. But it looks like the minimum could be 11 percent, and we \ncould be looking at a figure as high as 27 percent in the nondefense \ndiscretionary programs.\n  Mr. President, I am going to give our Republican friends, the \nmajority, the benefit of the doubt. I am going to, for the moment, not \ntalk about the deeper cuts in the outyears. I am going to leave out, \nignore, the effects of inflation. And I am not even going to consider \nthis dramatic underestimate of defense outlays. I am going to start \nwith this very conservative figure of 11 percent and consider what a \ncut of this magnitude would mean for domestic programs next year. Next \nyear, again, starts October 1.\n  Here are a few examples, based on administration estimates:\n  That we would lose 2,700 FBI agents. I ask you, is this a time when \nit seems appropriate to be cutting back on FBI agents? When terrorism \nin this country is a real threat? When we are trying to stop crimes? We \nare adding crimes to the list of crimes that are going to be tried in \nFederal courts. So 2,700 FBI agents.\n  Thirteen hundred and fifty Border Patrol agents. We have heard from\n\n[[Page S3164]]\n\nmany of our colleagues, Republican and Democrat, who live in border \nStates and talk about the problems they have from California, through \nNew Mexico, through Arizona, Texas, about those who illegally cross the \nborder, pleading for more help, pleading for an opportunity to contain \nthis illegal immigration flow. We are talking about reducing Border \nPatrol agents to the tune of 1,350? How do our friends who represent \nthose border States feel about this?\n  Drug agents: 780 DEA drug enforcement agents would be lost. Now, if \nthere is a more distracting problem in our society than drugs, I don't \nknow what it is. The overrunning of our young people by drug influences \nis something that we can't tolerate, that we search for solutions to, \nat our wit's end.\n  One thing we know: While having enough drug enforcement agents alone \ndoesn't solve the problem, take them away and we will see what happens \nto the flow of illegal drugs into this country.\n  Ninety thousand, two hundred fewer workers, dislocated as a result of \nindustry shifts, plant closings, et cetera, would receive training, job \nsearch assistance, and support services--90,000 people would be left \nwithout the training necessary to move to different job situations if \ntheir job is lost.\n  Thirty-four thousand low-income children would be without child care \nassistance.\n  Over 1.2 million low-income women, infants, and children would lose \nnutrition assistance every month. That program is commonly known as the \nWIC Program. It is a very effective program. In a country like ours, \nwith the bounty that we have from lots of natural resources, industry \nprogress, people who are skillful, intelligent, who are hard working, \nlots of people making money--we talk today about the billionaire class \nas we used to hear 40 years ago about the millionaire class--and we \nwant to permit 1.2 million low-income women, infants, and children who \nneed the nutritional assistance that this program offers to lose it? I \nwill not stand by and let that happen.\n\n  FAA operations: Our aviation industry is booming. People cannot get \nseats in lots of situations. What do we worry about? We have lots of \ndelays, we have concerns about safety and security and the lack of \ncritical modernization technologies. FAA operations would be cut by \nalmost $700 million. If we think the delays are bad now, hold on to \nyour seat, because they are going to get worse.\n  Safety: We will focus on safety to make sure things are maintained, \nbut we also want to protect ourselves against possible terrorist \nattacks, keeping people off the airplanes to make us more secure.\n  On the environment, roughly 21 Superfund toxic waste sites would not \nbe cleaned up as a result of these cuts. They needlessly jeopardize \npublic health.\n  Up to 100,000 children would lose the opportunity to benefit from \nHead Start. Head Start is an early preschool program that gives \nchildren who are typically from a disadvantaged situation a chance to \nunderstand the learning process, to get incentives to learn, to \nunderstand that learning is fun, that knowledge is beneficial. Take \naway that from 100,000 children? I don't know how we can do it. I don't \nknow how, with a clear conscience, we can say, ``Go ahead, listen, too \nbad, take your chances.'' We know who pays the price. All of us pay the \nprice. It is only a matter of when. It is much cheaper to give these \nkids a head start than to later deal with those who might turn to crime \nor drugs as a way to work their way up the social and economic ladder.\n  We would eliminate 73,000 training and summer job opportunities for \nyoung people.\n  As I earlier said, these are conservative figures, yet these types of \ncuts are clearly painful. In my view, they are dangerous. \nUnfortunately, under this resolution, the problem gets dramatically \nworse in later years. By the year 2004, the nondefense reductions grow \nto about 27 percent. Again, that doesn't include the effects of \ninflation nor any underestimation of defense outlays which loom large \nin front of us now. We have to wonder whether the Republicans are \nserious about cutting domestic programs by 27 percent. It is hard to \nbelieve, especially when there are virtually no details provided about \nwhere those cuts would fall.\n  Some Republicans have argued that these cuts are required because of \nthe discretionary spending caps which remain in effect through the year \n2002. That is not true. Much of the program for domestic programs is \ncreated because the resolution increases military spending by $18.2 \nbillion over last year's level. Since all discretionary spending is now \nunder a single cap--that is, defense and nondefense--that extra money \nmust come directly from domestic programs.\n  President Clinton has also made it clear that we should increase \nfunding for high-priority discretionary programs such as education and \nthe military once we save Social Security. By contrast, the Republican \nplan establishes unrealistically low discretionary spending levels that \nwould apply, regardless of whether we approve Social Security reform \nlegislation.\n  Cutting domestic programs by 27 percent in 2004 is not realistic. \nWhen it comes to cutting specific programs, Congress almost certainly \nwill not follow through. The votes won't be there to do it.\n  In other words, this budget resolution is a roadmap to gridlock. The \nresults could be disastrous. If we can't pass appropriations bills, we \nface the prospect of yet another Government shutdown. Nobody wants \nthat, of course, but it could happen.\n  Why, then, are we considering a budget resolution that even some \nRepublicans admit can't be enacted into law? The answer is simple: They \nare desperate to claim that they are for tax cuts. They just don't have \na clue on how to pay for them. They don't want to guarantee Medicare a \nsingle new dollar, but they are still not even close to identifying \nsufficient offsetting savings to pay for their tax cuts.\n  We are left with a budget that deals with fantasy, a budget that \neverybody knows isn't going to be worth the paper it is written on. In \nthe end, there is only one way out. The majority party, the \nRepublicans, have to get real. They can't continue to insist on huge \ntax cuts if they are not willing to pay for them.\n  So, in sum, Mr. President, let me quickly recount the four reasons \nwhy I oppose this budget. I do it with respect for the chairman. We \nworked hard together, but we just could not agree on what a budget \nwould look like.\n  First, it doesn't guarantee a single additional penny for Medicare. \nInstead, it takes money needed for Medicare and uses it for tax cuts \nthat will benefit the wealthy.\n  Second, it does nothing for Social Security. In fact, it doesn't \nextend Social Security's solvency by a single day.\n  Third, it is fiscally risky. It calls for huge tax cuts whose costs \nexplode in the future, just when the baby boomers will be retiring.\n  Finally, its cuts in domestic programs are extreme. If they were ever \nenacted, they would seriously disrupt important and essential public \nservices. But, more likely, Congress will never really approve them and \nwe will again be facing a disastrous threat of a Government shutdown.\n  For all of these reasons, Mr. President, I am deeply disappointed by \nthis budget resolution. I hope that we are going to be able to work \ntogether and make what I consider badly needed improvements. We have 35 \nhours in which to determine what the outcome of our budget discussions \nare going to be like, what the result is going to be. I hope that we \nwill be able to strike a balance that can get us a budget that can pass \nboth Houses, which can also be approved by the President.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President I rise today to talk about the great \nprogress we have made reducing our federal deficits. I am proud to have \nparticipated in and voted for three budget acts--in 1990, 1993, and \n1997--which have radically altered the fiscal condition of the Federal \ngovernment and the debate about how the public's hard-earned tax \ndollars should be spent.\n\n[[Page S3165]]\n\n  When I arrived in the Senate 10 years ago, we had a deficit of $205.2 \nbillion. We were awash in a sea of red ink. Budgeteers were predicting \ndeficits as far as the eye could see. In fact, since 1989, our \npublicly-held debt has increased from $2 trillion to $3.7 trillion. \nHundreds of billions of dollars of borrowing was needed every year to \nfund the Federal budget. This borrowing had two effects: it kept \ninterest rates for all public borrowing higher than necessary and it \ncaused the net interest costs of the U.S. government to rise as a share \nof total Federal spending.\n  After the enactment of these three budget acts--particularly the 1993 \nand 1997 budget acts--and on account of impressive gains in private \nsector productivity and growth, we were able to reverse the deficit \ntrend. Deficits have continued to shrink since 1994--and we were able \nto celebrate our first unified budget surplus (counting Social \nSecurity) of $70 billion last year. I am hopeful that the Congressional \nBudget Office's August re-estimate will allow this Congress to \ncelebrate its first real budget surplus since 1960.\n  Deficits are yesterday's problem. Today, budgeteers are telling us to \nexpect budget surpluses as far as the eye can see. I am proud to say \nthat we are able to celebrate the fruits of our fiscal restraint--not \nbecause we had to abide by an inflexible constitutional amendment--but \nbecause we had the sheer will and political courage to put ourselves on \na spending diet. Americans should feel good about that. And my \ncolleagues who took the tough votes on fiscal restraint should also \nfeel good about the budget surpluses we are now enjoying.\n  Through our progress on controlling spending, we have also made some \nprogress on entitlement and net interest expenditures. Back in 1994, I \nco-chaired the National Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform. In \nits final report, the Commission predicted that ``without changes to \nprograms or increased taxes, entitlements and interest on the national \ndebt are projected to consume all federal revenues by 2012. In 2030, \nentitlement spending alone will exceed all Federal receipts.'' The \nfiscal restraint that we have displayed in the succeeding 5 years has \nchanged the short-term picture of entitlement and interest expenditures \ndramatically.\n\n  Today, about 53% of our Federal budget is spent on mandatory programs \nlike Social Security and Medicare; 34% of our budget is dedicated to \ndiscretionary spending (like NASA, NIH, roads and bridges, and the \narmed forces); and 13% of the budget is spent on interest on our \nnational debt. Depending upon whose numbers you look at--the Republican \nBudget Resolution, the President's budget, or the CBO projections--our \nfiscal discipline will allow us to pay down our publicly-held debt and \nreduce our net interest costs. These interest payments will continue to \ndecline as a percentage of our total spending--from about 13% today to \nsomewhere between 3 and 5 percent by 2009. Although discretionary \nspending will continue to decline as a percentage of total spending--\nthis decline will occur more slowly than previously predicted. Over the \nnext decade, discretionary expenditures will decline from about a third \nof total expenditures to about a fourth of total expenditures by 2009. \nAnd although mandatory spending will continue to rise as a percentage \nof total expenditures--from 53% today to 70% of spending by 2009--it \nwill grow at a slower rate than we had previously predicted.\n  The strong growth in our economy and the subsequent strong growth in \nthe taxable wage base has increased the solvency of our Medicare HI and \nSocial Security OASDI Trust Funds. That same report from the Bipartisan \nCommission on Tax and Entitlement Reform predicted back in 1994 that \nwith no changes, the HI Fund would be insolvent in 2001. But the latest \nstatistics show that the HI Fund will be solvent until somewhere in the \nyear 2010. Our 1994 report also noted that the Social Security would \nbecome solvent in 2029. In 1998, the Trustees of the Social Security \nTrust Funds announced that our strong growth would extend the solvency \nof the OASDI Trust Funds to 2032--and I have reason to believe that the \nshort-term solvency of the Trust Funds will be extended even further \nafter the Trustees release their 1999 report next week.\n  While we should pat ourselves on the back for our tough votes in \n1990, 1993, and 1997, we must remember that our agenda remains \nunfinished. Today, I want to challenge the Senate to start tackling the \nlast piece of unfinished business. I am, of course, referring to the \nbiggest political problem facing our generation of legislators: how do \nwe work together in a bipartisan manner to modernize, reform, and \nimprove the Medicare and Social Security programs for our children and \ngrandchildren? Our demonstrated fiscal responsibility has bought us \nsome time--and some breathing room--to think about how we want to \nreform our safety net programs, restore solvency to our entitlement \nTrust Funds, and reduce the out-year proportions of the budget which \nfinance our entitlement programs.\n\n  Although we've slowed the growth in our entitlement programs, it must \nnot go unnoticed that this year we will spend $20 billion more in \nMedicare and Social Security benefits than last year--and next year we \nwill spend $30 billion more than this year. That $30 billion increase \nin Medicare and Social Security benefits is more than our total \ncombined expenditures on the State, Justice, and Commerce Departments \nduring 1999. The additional money we will spend each year on Social \nSecurity and Medicare benefits will only begin to increase as the first \nBaby Boomers start retiring during the next decade.\n  The President's own budget outlines for us the troubling long-run \nbudget projections for the Social Security and Medicare programs. Right \nnow, we spend the equivalent of 4.5% of GDP on Social Security benefits \nand about 3.6% of GDP on Medicare and Medicaid. By the year 2050, we \nwill be spending about 7.2% of GDP on Social Security benefits and 9.7% \nof GDP on Medicare and Medicaid benefits. This is a dramatic increase \nin entitlement expenditures--a doubling from 8.1% of GDP today to 16.9% \nof GDP in 2050. My Nebraska constituents need to know that the more we \nspend on entitlements, the fewer tax dollars will be available for the \neducation and training of our children, or the research and development \nof new medicinal drugs, or space exploration. The analytical tables in \nthe President's budget show that discretionary expenditures will \ncontinue to decline from about 7.6% of GDP today, to about 3.6% of GDP \nin 2075.\n  I want to challenge my colleagues to seize upon the opportunity to \nmodernize, reform, and improve Medicare and Social Security during this \nera of budget surpluses. We need to think about helping people become \nless dependent on the government for their retirement security. For \nexample, I support the idea of allowing individuals to have a payroll \ntax cut of 2 percentage points, which they could invest in individual \naccounts. But these individual accounts are not the end in itself--but \nthe means to an end. The means to a more independent retirement--a \nretirement that involves the ownership of wealth and the creation of an \nasset that can be passed on to heirs. We need to decrease the demand of \nfuture retirees on the government by making changes to Social Security \nthat reduce costs--but also provide retirement security.\n\n  Efforts to reduce the costs of the program are made harder by changes \nto the Social Security program enacted back in 1983. Some of my \ncolleagues--particularly Senator Moynihan--may remember that back in \n1983, Congress agreed to ``pre-fund'' the Social Security benefits of \nthe Baby Boom generation by allowing the program to take in more income \nthan it needed to pay the benefits of current beneficiaries. This \nexcess payroll tax money was supposed to flow into a Social Security \nTrust Fund. As we all know, this money was borrowed from the Trust Fund \nthroughout most of the Reagan, Bush and Clinton years to finance the \ngeneral operations of government. When Treasury starts paying back the \nmoney it borrowed from the Trust Fund in 2013, it will pay these IOUs \nwith general revenues--meaning individual and corporate income tax \ndollars.\n  Most of my constituents are probably not aware that these changes in \n1983 will give beneficiaries from the Baby Boom generation a claim on \n$6.85 trillion of income tax revenues--in addition to the payroll tax \nclaim they already have on tomorrow's workers. The\n\n[[Page S3166]]\n\nPresident is proposing to increase the Baby Boomers' claim on income \ntax dollars to over $30 trillion. I do not support this change--I \nbelieve that we have an obligation to make structural reforms to the \nprogram within the current payroll tax structure. I applaud many of my \nDemocratic colleagues who have taken a courageous step in opposing this \nmisguided effort to ``save'' Social Security through additional income \ntax dollars. But I want to remind my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle that simply setting aside the surplus for Social Security or \nMedicare reform is not a reform plan--it is a debt reduction plan.\n  I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to have an \nhonest and open debate about the way we want to finance and reform the \nSocial Security program. I believe that Congress and the President can \nand should work together to achieve real structural reforms in the \nprogram--and do so in a way that helps low-income Americans and that \nshares costs across all generations.\n  In addition, I would argue that we need to modernize the Medicare \nprogram to expand choice, increase competition, and include \nprescription drugs. As those of us who served on the National \nBipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare know through painful \nexperience, Medicare poses an even more difficult problem than Social \nSecurity reform. By providing health care coverage, it provides a \nsecond essential element of retirement security for older Americans, as \nwell as serving as an important safety net for disabled Americans who \ncan no longer work. Medicare spending is unpredictable and, to a \ncertain extent, uncontrollable--spending growth is largely driven by \nthe amount of health services that beneficiaries use, technological \ndevelopments in medicine, and--particularly in the future--enrollment \ngrowth.\n  And to complicate matters further, the public is not yet ready to \nundertake a significant change to the Medicare program. They know how \nvaluable the current program is to themselves, their parents and \ngrandparents. They want to be sure that they have the same coverage, or \nbetter, when they retire. And they don't see the need to make hard \ndecisions about spending and benefits.\n  We need to look at these difficult dynamics and make the difficult \nchoices that are necessary to keep the Medicare program solvent while \nensuring that we have the flexibility we need within the Federal budget \nto address other national priorities. Last week, I voted with nine \nother Commissioners to adopt a more competitively-based model for \nfinancing and administering the Medicare program. I think this type of \nreform will move us in the right direction by helping us control costs, \nand ultimately helping us improve benefits. We can't simply pour new \ngeneral revenues into an un-reformed Medicare program, and wait to deal \nwith the larger problems at a later date.\n  The surpluses that have appeared, in part due to our fiscal \ndiscipline, provide us with a unique opportunity to reform our growing \nentitlements burden. The choices involved in achieving Medicare or \nSocial Security reform are tough--and may even require some tax \nincreases or benefit cuts. The pain of tax increases or benefit cuts \nwill be made much less harsh if we use these budget surpluses to help \nreform our Social Security and Medicare programs. I do not believe we \nshould use the on-budget surpluses for a debt swap or for a large tax \ncut that will primarily go to high income individuals. We must avoid \nthe instant gratification of a large tax cut at the expense of the \ndelayed gratification that comes with reforming our entitlement \nprograms and reducing the tax burden on future workers.\n  I look forward to working with the House, the Senate, and the \nPresident to complete this unfinished agenda.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, before the distinguished Senator from \nNebraska, Senator Kerrey, leaves the floor, I want to congratulate him \non his efforts on behalf of sound fiscal policy and good principles for \nthe future and a vision of the future which I believe is an exciting \none if we will just bear with it and do what we must do.\n  It is pretty obvious from the comments he has made here that we ought \nto be able to reform Medicare and make it live and available for many \ndecades to come. And we ought to do it this year. There is absolutely \nno reason why we cannot. All we need to know is what the President \nwants to do. The President has not told us what he wants to do. This \nbudget resolution contains a very valid program, very live and very \ncapable, if the committees can put it together. It doesn't put a plan \ntogether; it just says what the resources are and how much is \navailable. I will go into that in a little more detail in my opening \nremarks, which I will not give now.\n  There are two Senators who would like to speak now. I ask, on our \nside, if Senator Helms could proceed and then I see Senator Kennedy \nhere. I think he would like to proceed. I do not want to limit him. I \nwish to make my opening remarks after him and then we will try to stir \nup an amendment.\n  If others have opening remarks, I hope they will hurry down here, \nbecause I suggest we are talking about our recess. I want to tell you a \nlittle bit. What if we have 60 amendments? People will now say we have \nplenty of time; we have all day today, all day tomorrow, which is \nThursday. We have Friday. But people want to start leaving. They say \nthat is 35 hours, 15 each day; that will do it.\n  Mr. President, if we have 60 amendments, the vote time and the quorum \ntime surrounding them, since they do not count, the vote time does not \ncount and quorums do not count, that could be 20 hours on its own; 35 \nhours of debate plus 20 hours to vote, that is 55 hours. This would \nmean at least 5 full days, well into Sunday, because we do not actually \nuse 15 or 20 hours out of a day. We try to do 8 or 9 or 10. But even if \nyou stay late, you do not get in 15 hours.\n  So we have to limit our amendments. We are working on that on our \nside. We also, at some point, have to agree to take less time on \namendments than the 2 hours allowed under the statute.\n  With that, I yield whatever time Senator Helms needs and then a \nDemocrat can proceed. It will be Senator Kennedy. Then I would like to \nbe recognized after Senator Kennedy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Helms pertaining to the introduction of S. 693 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 15 minutes.\n  First of all, I want to express appreciation to the members of the \nBudget Committee and, in particular, to our ranking minority member, \nSenator Lautenberg, for the work that he and our other colleagues did \nin developing a series of positions in the Budget Committee. I will \naddress one of those this morning and refer to another which I hope, \nover the course of the next couple of days, to come back to.\n  I think those who are interested in the Nation's priorities, as \nreflected in the Budget Committee, should read the transcript of the \ndiscussion and debate. I had the opportunity to do so. I think they \nwill get a very clear indication, as a result of that review, as to \nexactly what the priorities were for the Democrats in the budget \nconsideration, which was the preservation of Social Security and the \npreservation of Medicare.\n  During the course of debate and discussion, it becomes quite clear--\nand also by the votes--as to those who are strongly committed to that \nprogram. Over the next several hours, we will have a chance to move \nbeyond the rhetoric and into the details of the budget itself. That is \ngoing to be quite revealing, Mr. President, because we will have a \nclear opportunity to make a judgment at the end of these 3 or 4 days as \nto the very strong position that has been taken by the Democrats in the \npreservation of Social Security and also the strong commitment that we \nhave in the preservation of Medicare.\n  I know there are those who have said, ``We have a certain amount of \nfunds\n\n[[Page S3167]]\n\nthat have been allocated within this budget for Medicare; all we are \nwaiting for is the President to make some judgment, make some \nrecommendation.'' The President has made the most important \nrecommendation, and that is to allocate 15 percent of the surplus to \npreserve the Medicare Program through the year 2020, some 12 additional \nyears of security for the Medicare Program.\n  That will be the longest period of time of solvency for the Medicare \nsystem since the enactment of Medicare. I will take a few moments later \non in the day to comment further on this when we talk about the \nparticular amendment that I will offer, but we have seen over the \nhistory of Medicare where there have been interventions for the \npreservation of Medicare to continue it and continue it in a \nfinancially sound way.\n  Now we have heard the President of the United States say we ought to \nallocate the resources that are going to preserve this for another 12 \nyears and give it the greatest solvency we have had in the history of \nthe Medicare Program, and then let's get about trying to put in place \nthe kind of reforms that will be sound, taking into consideration the \nvarious recommendations that have been made by the Medicare Commission, \na few which make sense and others with which I take serious issue. We \nwill have an opportunity to examine those.\n\n  I hope our Republican friends--who virtually have been silent in \nproposing Medicare recommendations, other than to use the 15 percent \nthat the President has recommended and allocate it for tax breaks for \nwealthy individuals--I hope that they will, during the time that we are \nout here at least, review with us what their recommendations are, what \ntheir proposals are, what their solutions are, rather than constantly \nharp on the President. He has taken a giant step forward in the \nallocation of solvency for the Medicare system, and he has also \nindicated, now that the Medicare Commission has reported, that he will \nmake future recommendations.\n  If we were to accept the recommendations of our Republican friends, \nthere will be very little in the till at the end of the day to provide \nprotections for our senior citizens. That, I think, is a glaring, \nglaring loophole in this budget proposal, and one which I know the \nranking member of the committee, Senator Lautenberg, will address with \nan amendment and Senator Conrad with another excellent amendment. And I \nwill offer an amendment, along with others, to give focus and attention \nto these issues.\n  There will be a very clear indication, hopefully at the end of the \nday, as to what really are the priorities for this body in terms of the \nfuture of the Medicare system.\n  Every budget is a statement of national priority. Every budget is \nreally the investment in the future, but the year 2000 budget is \nextremely important, not just because it is the first year of the new \nmillennium, but this budget will determine whether the large surplus \nwill be used wisely for the benefit of all or squandered on tax \npreferences that disproportionately benefit the few.\n  The President, in his program, after the preservation of funding for \nSocial Security and Medicare, also targeted tax programs that others \nwill address later in the course of this debate. I think those are in \nareas of very special needs--providing assistance to families with the \ndisabled, child care, and other areas. We will have a chance to review \nthose. They all recognize what is urgent and of great importance, and \nthat is the preservation of Social Security, the preservation of \nMedicare, and then the targeted tax cuts.\n  This budget will determine whether Medicare will offer the \nprotections that are so essential for senior citizens in the years \nahead. This is the budget that will determine whether we keep medical \ncare in Medicare.\n  The Republican budget resolution is a thinly veiled assault on \nMedicare and I think an affront to every senior citizen who has earned \nthe right to affordable health care through a lifetime of hard work. It \nis a proposal to sacrifice the future of Medicare in order to finance \nthe tax cuts for the wealthy.\n  Equally as serious is the Republican attempt to privatize Medicare, \nto misuse the current financial problems of Medicare as an excuse to \nturn the program over to the tender mercies of the private insurance \ncompanies. Of course, there is where the problem started in the 1960s.\n  This is the same extreme agenda the Republicans pursued \nunsuccessfully in 1995, 1996, and it was an agenda rejected by \nPresident Clinton and Democrats in Congress and the American people, \nbut now our Republican friends are at it again.\n\n  According to the most recent projections of the Medicare trustees, if \nwe do nothing else, keeping Medicare solvent for the next 25 years will \nrequire benefit cuts of almost 20 percent--massive cuts of hundreds of \nbillions of dollars.\n  The President's plan makes up most of that shortfall, without any \nbenefit cuts, by investing 15 percent of the surplus in Medicare. This \ninvestment avoids the need for any benefit cuts in Medicare for at \nleast the next 21 years. It also gives us the time to develop the \npolicies that can reduce the Medicare costs without also reducing the \nhealth care that the elderly need and deserve.\n  But Republicans in Congress have a different agenda for the surplus. \nThey want to use it to grant the undeserved tax breaks for the \nwealthiest individuals and corporations in our society regardless of \nwhat happens to Medicare. Republicans on the Budget Committee had a \nclear opportunity to preserve, protect and improve Medicare. All they \nhad to do was adopt the President's proposal for investing the 15 \npercent of the surplus in Medicare.\n  Instead of protecting Medicare, they use the surplus to pay for \nbillions of dollars in new tax breaks. You do not need a degree in \nhigher mathematics to understand what is going on here. The Republican \nbudget, I believe, is Medicare malpractice.\n  Every senior citizen knows and their children and grandchildren know, \ntoo, that the elderly cannot afford cuts in Medicare. They are already \nstretched to the limit, and sometimes beyond the limit, to purchase the \nhealth care they need. The out-of-pocket payments by those over 65 now \nis almost the same percent of what it was prior to the time of the \npassage of Medicare. They just cannot afford to have the significant \nand sizable increases that would be assumed if we are not going to \nprovide this 15 percent. Because of the gaps in Medicare and the rising \nhealth care costs, Medicare now covers only 50 percent of the health \nbills of senior citizens.\n  On average, senior citizens spend 19 percent of their limited income \nto purchase the health care they need, a larger proportion of what they \nhad to pay before Medicare was enacted a generation ago. Many have to \npay more as a proportion of their income. By 2025, if we do nothing, \nthat proportion will have risen to 29 percent--29 percent, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Too often, even with today's Medicare benefits, too many senior \ncitizens have to choose between putting food on the table, paying the \nrent, or purchasing the health care they need.\n  The typical Medicare beneficiary is a single woman, 76 years old, \nliving alone, with an annual income of approximately $10,000. She has \none or more chronic illnesses. She is a mother and a grandmother. Yet, \nwe want to cut her Medicare benefits in order to pay for tax breaks for \nthe wealthy.\n\n  These are the women who will be unable to see a doctor, who will go \nwithout needed prescription drugs or without meals or heat, so that \nwealthy Americans, earning hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, can \nhave additional thousands of dollars a year in tax breaks. This is the \nwrong priority. And America knows it is the wrong priority--even if \nRepublicans in Congress do not.\n  We all recall that 4 years ago Republicans in Congress also tried to \nslash Medicare to pay for new tax breaks for the wealthy. They tried to \nslash Medicare by $270 billion to pay for $240 billion in tax cuts for \nwealthy individuals and corporations. We all remember. It was not that \nlong ago.\n  Mr. President, under the GOP proposal, senior citizens would have \nseen their premiums skyrocket an additional $2,400 for elderly couples \nover the budget period. The deductible that senor citizens pay to see a \nphysician would have doubled. The Medicare eligibility age would have \nbeen raised to 67. Protections against extra billing by doctors would \nhave been rolled back.\n\n[[Page S3168]]\n\n  I can remember the debates we had on that, Mr. President, where you \neffectively have double billing, where they go on and they take what \nthey get from Medicare, and then they send you another bill on top of \nthat. We spent a long time to address that particular issue. And now it \nwould be reopened again.\n  Under the guise of preserving Medicare, Republicans had proposed to \nturn the program over to private insurance companies and force senior \ncitizens to give up their family doctors and join HMOs. But President \nClinton and Democrats in Congress stood firm against these regressive \nproposals, and they were not enacted into law.\n  Now the Republicans on the Finance Committee and Ways and Means \nCommittee are at it again. They are already drafting new so-called \nreforms for Medicare. No details have been revealed, but the funds \nalready earmarked for tax breaks for the wealthy under the Republican \nbudget mean there is no alternative to harsh cuts in Medicare.\n  As we debate these issues this week, the Republican response is \npredictable. They will deny they have any plans to cut Medicare. They \nwill talk about $190 billion additional over the period of time. The \n$190 billion they will say they are giving additional. That is just to \nkeep the program going. If you cut any of that, you are providing \nadditional kinds of cuts in Medicare. That is what the budget figures \nthemselves show.\n  Mr. President, they will deny they have any plans to cut Medicare. \nThe American people will not be fooled. They know that the President's \nplan will put Medicare on a sound financial footing for the next 2 \ndecades without the benefit cuts, tax increases, and raising the \nretirement age.\n  They also know the Republican plan will take the surplus, intended \nfor Medicare, and squander it on the tax breaks. They know that the \nRepublican plan for Medicare benefits means benefit cuts for the \nelderly, not the honest protection of our senior citizens.\n  This week the Democrats will offer amendments to assure this year's \nbudget protects Medicare, not destroys it. Under our proposal, all the \nfunds the President has proposed to earmark for Medicare will be placed \nin the Medicare trust fund.\n  Our proposal will assure the solvency of Medicare for the next 21 \nyears without benefit cuts or tax increases or raising the retirement \nage. Republicans will have a chance to vote on whether they are sincere \nabout protecting Medicare. The vote on our proposal will test whether \nthey care more about senior citizens or tax breaks.\n  The Republicans also try to confuse the issue. They will say it is \nwrong to put the surplus into Medicare. I say the workers of this \ncountry are the ones who earned this surplus. They want to use it to \nprotect and preserve Medicare.\n  Our Republican friends say that dedicating 15 percent of the surplus \nwill not solve Medicare's financial problems beyond 2020. That is true. \nBut assuring the solvency of Medicare for the next 21 years is a giant \naccomplishment and a clear statement of our national priorities, and it \ngives us time to develop longer-term programs that will bring down \nMedicare costs while protecting beneficiaries.\n  If we fail to dedicate the surplus to Medicare, the only alternative \nis harsh benefit cuts and steep payroll tax increases to make up the \nresources that our Democratic plan provides. The choice is clear. \nCongress must act to preserve the Medicare benefits that seniors depend \non.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Fine.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will give additional time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I see my friend and colleague on the floor, the Senator \nfrom California. I will come back later in the day.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, thank you for recognizing me.\n  I note the presence of Senator Boxer. I have not given any opening \nremarks, and we are trying to line up some amendments.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to wait. Please.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. But that will not preclude opening statements if the \nSenator has some.\n  Mrs. BOXER. No problem.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am convinced that, for some obvious \nreason, the President and some on the other side of the aisle do not \nwant to fix Medicare. I think it might be fair to say they would rather \nhave an issue than to fix it. It is not true of everybody, obviously. I \nhave heard a number of Senators on both sides saying this is the year \nto reform Medicare. And, clearly, it can be reformed and fixed. There \nis no question about it. We saw that 10 Members out of 17--bipartisan--\ncame up with a proposal.\n  I am hoping that after this budget resolution is completed--everybody \nknows there is plenty of latitude within this budget resolution to \nreform Medicare; there is nothing about this resolution that denies the \nopportunity to reform it, repair it, fix it, for many decades to come--\nI am hopeful that perhaps the White House will tell us what their plan \nis. I think some of us, in due course, might like to sit down and talk \nto the President about it. We have all been very, very busy, and \nclearly this issue has, instead of getting the attention it deserves, \nsort of slid by, and here it sits with accusations and insinuations \ninstead of reform.\n  Having said that, I would like to talk just a little bit before I \ngive my remarks about the policy for our Nation for the next 10 years. \nI would like to make sure that everybody understands this is the only \nbill or resolution that, under the law, has a time limit and has a \nlimit on how much you can speak on amendments.\n\n  That means that, literally, the time will run out, and the more \namendments we have, obviously, the more time it is going to take, \nbecause every vote and every quorum call does not count against this \nstatutory timeframe. So if we are not careful and do not try to work \ntogether, we could be here well into Saturday, which I do not think \nanyone wants. We want to get our work done.\n  I have just stated for the Record, so nobody will misunderstand, that \nwe have the rest of today and the rest of tomorrow--and then that is \nThursday night. Many think we want to be finished by that time. With \nthe amount of time it takes to vote and the amount of time for debate, \nwe could have very little done by tomorrow night and still have 20 \nhours left, I guess, or 25, 21. But clearly it puts us a long way from \nfinishing.\n  I hope amendments will be germane. I intend this year, in a way that \nwill challenge the Senate, to raise some issues about germaneness if \nsome of the proposals have no impact on the budget and are just here to \nbe provocative and to have a vote on something.\n  Having said that, Mr. President, fellow Senators, I suggest that the \nUnited States of America's fiscal policy, economic policy, as far as \nour Nation's jobs and there being an abundance of jobs for our people, \nas far as there being good and even better jobs for our people, if they \nare educated and have some basic skills, when we look at our policy \ntoday--our fiscal, economic, monetary policy--we are in absolutely \nfantastic condition versus the rest of the industrial world.\n  In fact, we read with genuine concern--not enthusiasm but concern--\nhow a great country like Germany is in the condition they are in. And, \nfrankly, it bears talking about for a minute, because the United States \nis, and our economy is, strong and vibrant, because essentially we have \na probusiness policy in many respects as compared with those who seek \nunder other policies to compete in this world.\n  We have low taxes compared to Germany. We have many things that \npromote our competitiveness and help our businesses, large and small, \ncompete, make money, hire people, pay them better, and pay more taxes.\n  We ought to look out and see what is going wrong in the other parts \nof the world where their economies aren't working. It is profoundly \ntroublesome to see that the third largest economy in the world, \nGermany, is floundering. Watch what people are saying. They are saying: \n``We are overtaxed. We don't have any freedom with reference to labor \npolicies.'' They are saying: ``We have the longest holidays, the \nlongest vacations, people retire the\n\n[[Page S3169]]\n\nearliest, they start to work later.'' That great productive country, \nbuilt mostly on the high productivity of their people, is faltering.\n  We ought to learn from that. We ought to look at the next decade and \nsay, How do we keep this prosperity going? I want to say right upfront, \nregardless of what the White House says about this budget, one way to \nmake sure this prosperity machine and our jobs continue into the next \ndecade is to recognize that there is a genuine surplus besides the \nSocial Security surplus, and we ought to think about how do we use that \nto make sure that America continues with a prosperity machine and \ngrowth.\n  I submit that to put on hold cutting taxes for the American people is \nthe wrong way to ensure that growth, prosperity, and the creation of \njobs. Our opposition, the Democratic Party and the White House, can use \nevery bit of language they can muster to talk about us having the wrong \napproach to tax cuts. Nobody knows what the tax cuts are going to be \nunder this budget resolution, because the committees of this Congress \nhave to make that decision.\n  They can get up and talk about tax cuts for the rich all they want, \nbut there is room in this budget resolution to fix the marriage tax \npenalty. There is room to fix the research credits that our American \nbusinesses ought to take. We ought to make it permanent and say they \nare there so you can grow and prosper and make more and more \nbreakthroughs. There is allowance there for a capital gains change. \nYes, there is money there, if it is the will of the Congress, to cut \nmarginal rates.\n  To say this budget resolution, in that regard, is to cut the taxes of \nthe rich is untrue. Unequivocally, we believe when there is a surplus \nthat is this big, and an American economy that we want to continue to \nflourish and grow--we have been told there are only three things you \ncan do with a surplus for the good of America.\n  They are, one, applying the surpluses to the debt to reduce the debt \nheld by the public. People such as Alan Greenspan say if you could find \na way to do that, that is the best way. We have put $1.8 trillion of \nthis surplus, every cent of the Social Security surplus, against the \ndebt.\n  The President bragged about his budget, reducing the debt held by the \npublic, and how putting money in trust funds but not spending it and \nwaiting to redeem it later with an IOU would reduce the public debt. He \nsaid it recently again as he summarized an answer to a question. He \nreduces the debt held by the public less than this budget because he \ndoesn't put it on the debt. He puts it somewhere where it can be spent. \nAs a matter of fact, in the first 5 years of the President's budget, he \nspends more than the whole surplus that was accumulated during that \nperiod of time, the whole onbudget surplus, that which could be used \nfor tax cuts. Because it doesn't necessarily belong to seniors, he \nspends more than the accumulation of that surplus in this budget.\n  Now, frankly, there are some who will say the President's budget \nisn't before the Senate. We are going to make sure it is brought before \nus. Let's see if we can vote on it, because the President has been \nclaiming things about his budget that are not true. Let me start with \none.\n  There is not one nickel, not one penny, not one dollar, in this \nbudget for prescription drugs. As a matter of fact, there are no new \nexpenditures for Medicare in his budget because he decided to put the \nsurplus away so you couldn't use it for anything else and put it in a \ntrust fund that is not spent for Medicare. Two Cabinet members have \ntold us there is not a nickel in here to be spent on prescription \ndrugs. You wouldn't believe that. That means you have to reform the \nprogram to get the prescription drugs.\n  Mr. President, the Republican budget does a great job with reference \nto Medicare as compared to the President's. We anxiously await a real \nplan. Since I don't think there really is one here, we anxiously await \nhis plan. We anxiously await the plan of those on the other side who \nare critical.\n  Let's see what their plan is. We increase Medicare spending $200 \nbillion more than the President over the next decade. He cuts about $20 \nbillion over the next 10 years, but he would say it is just removing \npayments from hospitals. That is where the money goes for the Medicare \npeople of this country: It goes to hospitals, doctors, x ray equipment, \nMRIs, and all the other things. We don't cut that $20 billion; it is \nstill in the budget. On top of that, about $100 billion of the surplus \nis left unused--$100 billion--to be used in our budget, if necessary, \nfor a Medicare reform package.\n\n  I remind Members that the 10 members of the special committee on \nMedicare, which the President wholeheartedly joined last year in saying \nlet's let them tell us how to do it, didn't even use any extra money \nand they covered the poor with prescription drugs through the reform of \nthe program. I am not suggesting that the whole thing can be fixed that \nway, but I give you that example, and we left $100 billion there for \nthat purpose.\n  We can go on. But I will proceed now to just evaluate our budget, \nlittle by little. First of all, we are beginning to ask the Senate to \nvote also on whether they want to save and apply to the debt 100 \npercent of the Social Security surplus. We do that. The reason it is \nimportant is because the President doesn't do it.\n  Now, the President, in the first few years of this, spends Social \nSecurity money. But he says if you wait 15 years, there will be enough \nof it to make Social Security's trust fund whole. Year by year, he uses \nportions of it until some point out in the future when the amount is \nsmall and then he leaves it all in the trust fund.\n  As I see it, we are going to confront the issue of Medicare here on \nthe floor. We are going to be delighted and pleased to tell the senior \ncitizens of this country that very major Medicare reform awaits the \ncooperation of the President and that there is ample resources in this \nbudget to take care of that.\n  I compliment the distinguished Senator from Maine, Ms. Snowe. She \nencouraged and got passed unanimously with every Democrat supporting it \nthis source of money that won't be used for anything else but can be \nused, if desired, to help reform the Medicare.\n  Let me quickly tick through what we do that we are proud of. One, the \nbudget accounts for every penny of the Social Security trust fund and \nleaves it in the budget unspent to reduce the debt. Later on, we will \nintroduce legislation to make it near impossible to spend it.\n  We followed the leadership of the President, the minority leader, and \nmany others, who said maintain the fiscal discipline established in the \n1997 agreement. The minority leader challenged us: Don't break the \ncaps, don't break the agreement we entered into 3 years ago. Stick to \nthe caps.\n\n  We did that. Now, watch, as the debate progresses; there will be \ninnumerable amendments saying they want more money in domestic \naccounts. Our question will be, if you are going to stick with the \ncaps, as recommended by your own leader on the minority side, what are \nyou going to cut to make sure you can pay for more than we provided? We \nprovided the caps, the exact amount required by law. Incidentally, some \nthink a budget resolution is in control of these budget spending \nlimits. That statute says if you violate them without changing the law, \nyou will cut every program in the Government. It is called a sequester \nto enforce the agreed-upon limits.\n  We return to the American taxpayer overpayments they made to the \nFederal Government, not only because they are entitled to it, but they \nshould not wait 15 years for a tax cut, as implied or recommended by \nsome. We create a non-Social Security surplus of more than $100 \nbillion, which I have just described. It preserves the Social Security \nsurplus balances of $1.8 trillion over the next decade. It is not \ntouched in the expenditure or the tax side of this budget because it \nbelongs to the Social Security trust fund for use in reform and \ncertainly not to spend.\n  It is interesting on that score, while I am moving along, that nobody \nis going to vote for the President's budget because, as a matter of \nfact, in the first 5 years he spends $158 billion of the surplus \nbelonging to Social Security. After they all vote down here to keep 100 \npercent, how are they going to vote for the President's budget when it \nspends it?\n  The budget resolution has another challenge in it for us. We do not \nput a\n\n[[Page S3170]]\n\nwall up between the defense expenditures and domestic expenditures \nbecause things are tight. Senators want the opportunity--and the Budget \nCommittee members wanted to preserve the opportunity--to argue over \ndefense numbers versus domestic numbers. We will see some amendments \ntoday that will seek to take money from defense and spend it on \nsomething else; that is, if the amendments offered in committee are \noffered here. That probably won't pass no matter on what you are going \nto spend the money on the domestic side because we are on the verge of \na war, and I am quite sure everybody would be frightened to take money \nout of defense for domestic programs at this point. But we will \nprobably hear the argument.\n  So we have increased spending on national security. And, yes, for \nthose who say it is too tight a budget, I repeat, we followed the \nadmonition of the minority leader who said, ``Don't break the caps,'' \nand it is a fixed dollar number. We used the number. We divvied it up \namong all the programs of Government. Some don't like the way we \napportioned it, but I will tell you that we decided to put more in \neducation, knowing that it will not go for categorical programs in \neducation of the past but will go down to the local level to be spent \non reform measures, so long as there is accountability as one of the \nqualities.\n  We put $3.3 billion more in the first year and $28 billion over the \nnext 5 years. That is over and above the $100 billion we would expend \nin the next 5 years. That is far in excess of what the President was \nable to do. Yet, the President said, ``I am bound by the same caps and \nI am following them.'' So we are following them also. We just decided \nother parts of Government could be cut more than he suggested, and we \nput it in priorities like defense and education.\n\n  And, yes, the President speaks of what values do you reflect in the \nbudget. I have just expressed them. The taxpayers--we worry about them. \nOne of our values is to see that they don't overpay their Government. \nSecondly, we want more for education. We are in an era of reform, and \nwe are willing to say let's put more in because it will be helpful to \nreform the educational process. We said the President didn't put in \nenough for veterans. We put in $1.1 billion more for veterans. That is \nour value. How can you take the medical system for veterans and cut it \nand not give it a slight increase, which everybody knows it needs? We \nfully funded all the crime prevention laws, the trust-funded money that \ngoes into crime prevention. These are good priorities.\n  There will be some who will stand up and say, yes, they are good, but \nyou had to reduce foreign aid. Well, so be it. If we are going to all \nlive by the same numbers, then let's all talk about priorities. I \nremind everyone, if they want to exceed the targets, those caps, those \nlimits on expenditures, clearly they need 60 votes to do it because it \nviolates the Budget Act. That is how important it is. It is a major \nhurdle because we wanted fiscal responsibility. I am willing to listen \nto how difficult it will be to live within those limits. I understand \nit is. I don't have a solution right now because I don't see how you \ncan report a budget resolution out that violates the budget law of the \nland. I don't see how you can do that. I choose not to do that. The \ncommittee chose overwhelmingly not to do that.\n  I might just suggest, if people are wondering about where the money \nmight come from to establish the right priorities and still have to \nreduce other programs, the GAO recently reviewed the budget and they \nhave a high-risk series which lists 26 areas in this budget this year--\nnearly 40 percent--which have been high risk for 10 years. High risk, \nby definition, is programs that are vulnerable to waste, fraud and \nerror. We leave them there. For the most part, we increase them every \nyear, and we ask GAO to tell us which are the risky programs that we \nprobably won't get our dollar's worth from. Then we do nothing about \nit.\n  Second, it is clear that some programs won't grow and will remain at \nthe 1999 level and will have to be reduced below a freeze, as the \nPresident's budget requested. We are going to take some of where he cut \nand reduced. I suggest that the committees and the administration take \nto heart the Government Performance and Results Act, which specifically \nidentifies low-performing and inefficient programs. I am sure some \nSenators are hearing for the first time that such lists and assessments \nand evaluations exist.\n  This resolution assumes reduced funding for political appointees in \nthe administration. It assumes some mandatory savings scored to \nappropriators in the area of the SSI Program and child support and \nenforcement.\n  The resolution assumes repeal of the depression era and arcane Davis-\nBacon and Service Contract Act and other administrative savings.\n  The resolution assumes that Ginnie Mae will become a private \noperation and its auction creates nearly $2.8 billion in offsets next \nyear.\n  And, yes, the resolution assumes some of the administration's \nproposed offsets, fees, are assumed for various agencies in the Federal \nGovernment--FSIS and the President's proposed $200 million broadcasters \nlease fee.\n  In the area of mandatory savings. The resolution does not assume any \nof the President's nearly $20 billion reductions in Medicare over the \nnext five years. Medicare spending will indeed increase from $195 \nbillion this year by over $200 billion to a total of $395 billion in \n2009, an annual increase of 7.3 percent.\n  And the resolution assumes $6.0 billion in additional resources will \nbe allocated to the Agriculture Committee to address the issue of \ndepressed incomes in that sector.\n  Finally, the resolution assumes that expiring savings provisions in \n2002, that were enacted in the 1997 Balanced Budget agreement, will be \nextended. This applies to all such provisions except expiring Medicare \nsavings provisions. Between 2003 and 2009 these provisions would save \nless than $20 billion.\n  For revenues the resolution assumes that tax reductions will be \nphased in and over the next five years will return overpayments to the \nAmerican public of nearly $142 billion and $778 billion over the next \nten years. For 2000, paid for tax cuts of up to $15 billion are \npossible.\n  How these tax reductions are carried out will of course be determined \nby the Finance Committee and ultimately the Congress and the President.\n  However, I believe elimination or reduction in the marriage penalty \ncould easily be accommodated within these levels as well as extension \nof expiring R tax credits, self employed health insurance deductions, \ncertain education credits and or general reductions in tax rates phased \nin over time.\n  Finally, the resolution, being cautious, over a 10 year period, \nprojects a non-budget surplus of over $100 billion. This money could be \nneeded for unexpected emergencies or contingencies, it also could \nsupport the cost of funding transition costs for Medicare reform, or if \nnothing else it will continue to further retire debt held by the \npublic.\n  Two procedural issues need to be noted--a rule change as it relates \nto defining emergencies and a clarification that when there is an on-\nbudget surplus, those amounts are not subject to pay-go rules.\n  Let me close by saying that under this resolution, debt held by the \npublic will decline by nearly $463 billion more than under the \nPresident's budget.\n  This is true even if one treats the President's government equity \npurchases as debt reduction.\n  Why do we reduce debt more than the President?\n  First, the President spends $158 billion of the Social Security \nsurplus over the next 5 years. In contrast, the committee reported \nresolution saves the entire Social Security surplus.\n  And second, let me remind the Senate of one other thing about the \nPresident's spending proposal which may surprise many--his spending \ncosts more than the resolution's assumed tax reductions. This is true \nover both the 5 year and 10 year period.\n  The President's budget spends 35 percent of the Social Security \nsurplus over the next five years on programs unrelated to Social \nSecurity or Medicare.\n  The resolution before us today assumes that we return to the American \ntaxpayer their overpayments and this sum of money is less smaller than \nthe President's spending increases.\n  That is why we can save the entire Social Security surplus and why he \ncan not.\n  That is also why the administration is opposed to the Social Security \nlock\n\n[[Page S3171]]\n\nbox idea, because that would stop them from spending the Social \nSecurity surplus.\n  We will have more to say about the President's budget plan later in \nthe debate, when we let the full Senate consider whether they want to \nsupport his budget plan or not.\n  For now however, what is before the Senate is S. Con. Res. 20. It is \na good resolution. It is a reasonable resolution.\n  Once again it does four things:\n  It protects 100% Social Security surpluses.\n  It maintains the fiscal discipline this Senate overwhelmingly \nsupported in 1997 and was most recently reaffirmed by the minority \nleader.\n  It returns to the American public their tax overpayments.\n  And finally, it prudently and cautiously projects on-budget surpluses \nfor further debt reduction or for supporting unexpected emergencies, \nand possible transition costs for true Medicare reform like the one \nrecently voted on by 11 of the 17 members of the National Commission on \nthe future of Medicare.\n  It is a good start on budgeting into the next century.\n  Mr. President, I will also comment on those from the agricultural \nsectors. We got your letter and your concerns of a bipartisan nature. \nThe resolution assumes $6 billion in additional resources to be \nallocated to the Agriculture Committee to address issues of the \ndepressed parts of the agricultural community.\n  I am going to stop at this time and merely indicate that this debate \nwill proceed. Amendments will be forthcoming. I am hopeful that when \nthe day ends, we will have a budget resolution similar to this one, and \nlet's see how the year evolves as we try to implement it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the chairman. I have an \nunderstanding that we are going to go from side to side. At this point, \nI yield to the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you so much, Mr. President. I thank the chairman \nand the ranking member, Senator Lautenberg.\n  I was so pleased to be a member of the Senate Budget Committee in the \nHouse. I was on the House Budget Committee for 6 years. To me, the \nBudget Committee is very important, because what we in essence do is \npresent a roadmap for the priorities of this country. I think it is key \nto the people, the decisions we make here. How much are we going to \nspend on education? How much are we going to spend on Social Security, \nMedicare? How much are we going to spend on the military? And on and \non--Border Patrol. Every single item comes under scrutiny in the Budget \nCommittee. Although we may not make detailed recommendations, we \nessentially say to the American people--and we have to feel good about \nwhat we do--this is how we are going to spend the taxpayers' money and \nwe hope you will be pleased with it.\n  Mr. President, I am not pleased with what we do about Medicare in \nthis budget. That is what brings me to my feet today.\n  The President took the leadership on this budget when he challenged \nCongress--Members on both sides of the aisle--to save Social Security \nand Medicare and to do something about the low rate of savings in \nAmerica today. So he came forward with a very good suggestion. He said \nset side 62 percent of the surplus for Social Security, set aside 15 \npercent of the surplus for Medicare, and set aside 12 percent of the \nsurplus for targeted tax cuts, which will help our people increase \ntheir savings for the future.\n  The good news is that both sides of the aisle have agreed on Social \nSecurity. Both sides in the Senate have agreed to set aside every penny \nof the Social Security surplus every year for Social Security. The bad \nnews is that nothing--I say ``nothing''--was done for Medicare by the \nRepublicans in this committee. We tried to work with them. Senators \nLautenberg and Conrad spoke eloquently on the point and offered a \nnumber of amendments. They will do so again. Yet, on a straight party \nline vote, we were unable to budge our Republican friends.\n\n  I have to say this: Having seen a parent wind up in a very difficult \nposition in a nursing home and having seen her be able to hold her head \nup high because she has Social Security and Medicare, they are twin \npillars of the social safety net. Why do I say this? Because if you ask \nour elderly what they fear, what they fear is getting sick and they \ncannot rely on their Medicare. If their Medicare becomes out of reach \nfor them, if it no longer protects them, then they will have to use \ntheir Social Security to pay for their health care costs, and they will \nwind up in very bad shape.\n  So, to me, you can't stand up with a straight face and say you are \nhelping seniors in this country, you are helping our people get through \ntheir golden years, if you do not help Medicare, as well as Social \nSecurity.\n  There are those on the other side who we will hear say, ``Oh, these \nDemocrats. All they want to do is throw money at Medicare. They don't \nwant to reform it.'' That isn't so. But we do know we need to do both. \nWe need to set aside funds from the surplus to get us through these \nyears coming for Medicare; also, let's look at the reforms of the \nprogram.\n  As Senator Kennedy said, the proposal we will put before the Senate \nwill save Medicare through the year 2020. That is nothing to scoff at. \nThen we have the time to work on the reforms. We need to make sure that \nthose reforms, in fact, are good reforms and that ``reform'' does not \nbecome another word for ``repeal.'' We don't want to repeal Medicare. \nWe don't want to change Medicare in such a way that it no longer is \nthat peace of mind for our seniors. We want to fix it so that it \ncontinues to work.\n  I hope it will be different on the Senate floor than it was in the \ncommittee. Shockingly, almost every vote, almost every vote--I will not \nsay every amendment, but certainly every vote--to save Medicare was a \nstraight party line. We see more and more of it. I see Senator Murray \non the floor, a member of this committee, who was talking to me about \nhow shocked she was that in the markup of the Patients' Bill of Rights \nit was party line all the way. What has become of us?\n  These are issues we should work together on. I am sad that we are not \nable to do it. On the other hand, I recognize that there are legitimate \ndifferences between the parties. It is for the people to judge as to \nwho they feel is going to keep Medicare going.\n  I want to share a couple of charts with you. It seems to me that what \nwe ought to be doing in this budget is securing America's future. In \nthe budget we envision, and the kind of amendments we will be offering, \nwe want to do a few things. We want to save Social Security. I again \ncredit my Republican friends. We have worked together. This is done.\n  We also want to strengthen Medicare. Mr. President, it is not done in \nthis budget. There isn't a slim dime set aside for Medicare, despite \nthe fact that we were talking about last year what we would do with the \ntobacco tax, should it be enacted. Members on the other side of the \naisle said: If you have extra funds, save Medicare. I don't know what \nhappened. We will hear more about that in the debate as it unfolds.\n  Also, we should cut taxes to help ordinary Americans save. Those \nkinds of targeted tax cuts, more modest than the ones in the budget \nbefore us, are the ones we ought to be supporting. So, yes, we support \ntax cuts, but we want them to go to ordinary Americans who need those \ntax cuts. Yes, we want to strengthen Medicare by setting aside 15 \npercent of the surplus for Medicare.\n  I think it is stunning to look at this budget. This is what this \nbudget does with the surplus vis-a-vis Medicare and tax cuts. My \nRepublican friends will say, ``Well, we do spend money on Medicare.'' \nYes, they spend the money. But nothing out of the surplus--nothing to \naddress the problem in the future once we have a problem.\n  The good news story is that we are living longer. This is good. All \nthe work we do around here to increase spending on health research is \npaying off. All the investment we make in the private sector and make \nin high technology is paying off. People are living longer. This is \ngood; this isn't something to be sad about. But yet it has to be \naddressed. If we don't address it, we not only hurt the aging \npopulation, but\n\n[[Page S3172]]\n\nthe children of the aging population whose problem it will be when mom \nand pop can no longer afford health insurance--and they may be \nuninsured--or have to dip into their pocket to a great extent when hit \nwith a disease.\n  Just take a look at this. I ask the question, Is it fair? Is it fair? \nTax cuts--$1.7 trillion; zero investment in Medicare out of the \nsurplus. I don't see how this could be supported. Senators Lautenberg, \nConrad, Kennedy, and others will be offering us an opportunity to do \nsomething about this. I hope we will.\n  I have a final chart that I want to show.\n  So you say to yourself, OK, the Republicans are giving these tax cuts \nout of the surplus; not a dime for Medicare. Who is getting the \nbenefit? My friends, I have to tell you, if you earn over $833,000 a \nyear, you are going to get a good benefit from this Republican tax plan \nbecause you are going to get an average of $20,697 back a year.\n  In other words, the top 1 percent will average $20,697 a year back in \ntheir taxes. That is twice as much almost as the minimum wage. And we \ncan't get support from the other side of the aisle to raise the minimum \nwage. People who get up and work hard, get dirt under their fingernails \nevery day, earn about $11,000 a year. We can't get anyone to raise it \nagain.\n  But look at this, folks: $20,697 average back to the top 1 percent \nevery year, and the bottom 60 percent of taxpayers, that is, whose \nincome is below $38,000, get back $99. This is paid for by essentially \nignoring Medicare. I say to my friends: $99 a year; yes, it is good to \nget that back. But how far does that go when mom and dad call you and \nsay, ``My Medicare premiums just went up a huge amount. You have to \nhelp me; I can't pay the premium''? I say that $99 will be gone pretty \ndarned quick.\n  So I just don't think it is fair. I respect my friends. They think \nthis is good policy. I know they believe it in their hearts. As a \nmatter of fact, shockingly--I had an amendment in the committee. Do you \nknow what it said? It said that the substantial benefits of the Tax \nCode, of any Tax Code that winds its way through here, should go to the \nfirst 85 percent of taxpayers rather than the top 15 percent. And to my \nshock, my dear colleagues on the other side would not even let us vote. \nThey had a substitute. They did not like it. They supported it last \nyear, but they said this year times are different. They do not support \nit now.\n  So the reason I love this debate, on the one hand, is there are such \nclear differences in the philosophy of the parties, as evidenced by the \nvotes that were taken in the Budget Committee. But I have to say I was \ndisappointed. Even an amendment I offered--and I know, again, my \ncolleagues will speak on their own amendments--that simply said without \nadding a penny let's make sure we fund afterschool programs out of the \nincrease in the education budget, except for one colleague, every \nRepublican voted it down. One Republican colleague joined me, but it \nfailed on an 11-11 vote. They will not even say that afterschool care \nshould be a priority within the education budget, because the \nphilosophy is let the local government decide.\n  What if the local government decided to spend it to put a shower in \nthe principal's office instead of on afterschool? I think there ought \nto be some accountability for the tax dollars we send back. We are not \nsaying you have to use it. We are saying if you apply for the funds, \nwhether it is for afterschool or more teachers in the classroom--we \ncould not even get a vote ``yes'' on that one. So I am proud to be here \ntoday to stand up for the priorities I started off talking about: \nSaving Social Security--which I give my friends credit for, we do--or \nstrengthening Medicare, which they do not do. We are going to offer \nsome amendments, so we hope they will do it. And to cut taxes, not for \nthe wealthiest Americans, but for ordinary Americans.\n  I want to say a word to my colleague, Senator Lautenberg. He and \nSenator Domenici may not agree, but they get along and it is a \nwonderful thing for us to see. Because, as tough as it is to disagree \non these issues, there is a certain friendship and comity that pervades \nthat committee because of their example. I thank them for that. I hope \nmy colleague, Senator Lautenberg, will rethink his decision to retire \nbecause we will miss him too much.\n  But the amendments that he will offer symbolize what he is about, \nwhich is standing up and fighting for the little people, the people who \nneed us. Before Medicare, we had old men and women destitute, \ndestitute. And my friend, Senator Lautenberg, is an example of the \nAmerican dream when he tells me the story of his mother who ran a \nbakery. She was widowed and she raised her family.\n  He served his country. He became a very successful businessman, and \nagainst his own economic interests, takes positions here that are for \nthe good of the people. As he stands up and talks about Medicare, I \nknow it is from the heart. I hope we will follow his leadership. I hope \nwe will get a bipartisan vote to save Medicare.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am going to yield as much time to \nSenator Gramm as he would like, although I am going to ask him in the \ninterest of others to do a little less than the 1 hour he would give to \nhis class in economics over there at Texas A\n  But I want to read something to the Senate before I yield to him, \njust in response to my good friend, Senator Boxer from California. She \nsuggested we would not accept her resolution with reference to what the \ntax cut should be all about. Let me read what the committee adopted \nunanimously. I think it is a pretty good definition of what we ought to \ndo with the tax cut:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that this concurrent \n     resolution on the budget assumes any reductions in taxes \n     should be structured to benefit working families by providing \n     family tax relief and incentives to stimulate savings, \n     investment, job creation, and economic growth.\n\n  I think those are the kinds of things we all ought to be looking at \nin a tax package as it moves its way through.\n  I yield to Senator Gramm.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. BURNS). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am going to talk mostly about Social \nSecurity and Medicare, but I want to answer two of the points that our \ndear colleague from California raised. First, she says, Is it fair to \ngive a tax cut and to give nothing to Medicare? The Domenici budget \ngives this big tax cut and gives nothing to Medicare. Let me just \nchange the question a little. It is not, Is it fair? The question is, \nIs it true? And the answer is no.\n  Let me just ask our colleagues to look at page 54 of the report on \nthe concurrent budget resolution for the fiscal year 2000. This is the \nbudget reported from the Budget Committee. It provides, beginning this \nyear, for Medicare, $194.6 billion, and by 2009 that has risen to \n$394.2 billion. So the Domenici budget provides $199 billion of \nadditional money for Medicare by the end of the 10-year period.\n  Let me just make two points. No. 1, Medicare has never grown by more \nthan it grows under the Domenici budget. No. 2, no program has ever \ngrown as much as Medicare grows over this 10-year period. There is not \none cut in one Medicare benefit in the Domenici budget. In fact, the \nPresident's budget cuts the Medicare Program. The Domenici budget fully \nfunds it.\n  So we all have a right to our opinions, but we do not have a right to \nour facts.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a retort?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. What I said clearly is of course there is funding there \nfor Medicare. I said: Out of the surplus. There was nothing out of the \nsurplus. I was very clear to state of course the committee takes care \nof Medicare under the current condition, but doesn't take anything out \nof the surplus.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I thank the Senator for the clarification, but the point \nis every penny of this $199 billion is out of the surplus because, if \nit were not provided, that money would be in the surplus. The point is, \nand I want to be sure nobody is confused, the Domenici budget provides \nfull funding for Medicare over the next 10 years. It has not one cut in \none benefit anywhere for Medicare. In fact, no budget in the history of \nAmerica has provided the funding increase for Medicare that is provided \nin this budget, and no program, except the buildup for a war effort, in \nthe history of mankind has ever provided the\n\n[[Page S3173]]\n\nincrease we provide for Medicare. So no one should get the impression \nthat in any way this budget does not fully fund Medicare. It does.\n  Second, and I do not want to get off on this same old debate, \ndragging the same old dead cat across the table, but it is always an \namazing thing to me that when Democrats talk about tax cuts, they think \nit is always for rich people. When I heard the story, that Senator \nDomenici's mama was out picking lettuce and she started having Senator \nDomenici, and they took her in the house and Senator Domenici was born \nin this house. I don't know why anyone would think Senator Domenici \ndoes not love working people. I don't know why our Democrat colleagues, \nmost of whom are very wealthy people, why they have this monopoly on \nloving poor people and Senator Domenici, the child of an immigrant \nfamily, somehow he does not love working people.\n  Let me tell you what the whole paradox is about. Our colleagues on \nthe Democrat side of this body have discovered that we have a \nprogressive income tax. Senator Domenici, what that means is that \nAmerican workers in the bottom half of the income scale pay virtually \nno income taxes. And people who are in the higher income brackets pay \nvery high levels of income taxes.\n  So, for example, if we had an across-the-board tax cut where we \nreduced everybody's taxes by 10 percent, a proposal that was made by \nJohn F. Kennedy who, last time I looked, was a Democrat--of course he \nbelieved that rising tides lift all boats. I don't know if Democrats \nstill believe that. It was President Kennedy, in 1961, who proposed an \nacross-the-board tax cut. ``Let's get America moving again'' was the \nKennedy slogan.\n\n  When you cut taxes across the board, there are two things that \neverybody ought to understand, because our Democrat colleagues are \ngoing to go on and on and on about it. No. 1 is, some people do not get \na tax cut if you cut income taxes across the board. Why? Because they \ndon't pay income taxes. Some people don't get Medicare because they are \nnot senior citizens. Some people don't get welfare because they are not \npoor. Some people don't get Senate salaries because they don't work for \nthe Senate. But tax cuts are for taxpayers. You don't pay taxes, you \ndon't get a tax cut.\n  Secondly, some people will get a bigger tax cut with an across-the-\nboard tax cut than others. That shouldn't come as any shock, because \nsome people pay more income tax than others. This budget does not make \nthis judgment; this budget simply provides money for a tax cut. We will \ndecide in the Finance Committee what it is.\n  I personally support an across-the-board tax cut. If you want to \nfigure out how much you get--it is very simple and couldn't be fairer, \nin my opinion--take the amount you pay, take 10 percent of it, that is \nhow much you would save if we had a 10 percent across-the-board tax \ncut. If you don't pay any income taxes, you don't get any tax cut. If \nyou pay a little income taxes, you get a little tax cut. If you pay a \nlot of income taxes, you get a lot of tax cuts, but you don't get back \nwhat you don't pay. Simple formula.\n  Let me talk about my two issues.\n  The President, 2 years ago, said in the State of the Union Address a \nbrilliant line--``Save Social Security first.'' It was a brilliant \nline. Everybody stood up and applauded. We waited a whole year and the \nPresident never told us how to save Social Security first, last, or \never--never had a program. It was simply a bumper sticker, a slogan. \nThen this year the President said, ``Oh, the year has come for us to \nsave Social Security.'' He said, ``Don't just save it first; save it \nnow.'' We all stood up, standing ovation. We all applauded.\n  And we had a big conference down at the White House. One of my \nDemocrat colleagues was smart enough not to go. He had already figured \nout that this was a political sham. But I went. I sat through all these \nmeetings. I sat in a meeting with the President. We had about 60 \nMembers of Congress there. He went around the room and asked people \ntheir opinion, agreed with everybody. Then, when we left, we waited for \na program.\n  Finally, the program came. Let me say, not to mince words but to be \nprecise with the English language, it was a total and complete \npolitical cop-out. It was a political punt. It was a program that \nbasically said: We are not going to make any decision other than we are \ngoing to claim that we are locking all this money away for Social \nSecurity. I am going to explain how the hoax works.\n  The second issue that is a major disappointment in the President's \nbudget and the President's proposal is Medicare. I was appointed to the \nMedicare Commission led by Senator Breaux, a Democrat. We put together \na bipartisan coalition to save Medicare. The President killed the \nCommission. Then he makes a proposal that does not give Medicare a \ndime, not a dime of new resources. It simply reduces debt and gives \nMedicare credit for it in a sort of nebulous IOU that can't be spent \nfor 15 years, and can only be spent then if we raise taxes or cut other \nspending to redeem the IOUs.\n  I want to talk about Social Security and Medicare the way Bill \nClinton does it. A lot of my colleagues have racked their brains to try \nto figure out how the President saves Social Security. Let me explain \nit to you. I have a chart here, and I hope people can follow it.\n  What I show on the first chart is plotting out over time the Social \nSecurity surplus, which starts out here at the current level of $137.6 \nbillion and then it grows over time. That is the amount of money we are \ntaking in, in Social Security taxes, that we are not spending on \nbenefits, plus the interest we are earning on the IOUs that Social \nSecurity has from the Federal Government.\n\n  In addition to the Social Security surplus, we have a general budget \nsurplus from the rest of government that is shown here as B. The total \nbudget surplus, counting the Social Security surplus and the non-Social \nSecurity surplus, is the combination of the two I have shown in blue \nhere.\n  Here is what the President does. The President takes the Social \nSecurity surplus, which this year is $137.6 billion. They have a guy \nover in the Treasury who puts into a computer the number $137.6 \nbillion, and out in West Virginia there is this little Federal office \nwith a steel filing cabinet. They have a printout machine, and this \nprints out this IOU for $137.6 billion. I have seen them on \ntelevision--at least a man and a woman working there. They may have \n10,000 people, but I have seen only 2. The guy normally does it. He \ngoes up and he takes it off the machine, tears it off, takes the \nperforated edges off, and takes the carbon copy off. Then he puts it in \nthat metal filing cabinet. This is an IOU from the Government to the \nSocial Security Administration. This literally happens. That is the \n$137 billion.\n  The problem is, we do not have $137 billion, because the unified \nsurplus, when you add the two together, Social Security and non-Social \nSecurity, is only $134.6 billion, because we are running an actual \ndeficit in the non-Social Security part of the budget of $2.9 billion.\n  What the President does is, he takes the $134.6 billion we have in \ncash and he says: Let's take 62 percent of that. That 62 percent is \nshown in light green here. That is 62 percent of the total budget \nsurplus. He says: Let's spend 38 percent of that. Now, that is $52.3 \nbillion.\n  Remember, every penny of this surplus is Social Security, but in his \nbudget he spends $53 billion of this surplus. Then he says: We are \ngoing to give Social Security $83.5 billion. So they already have this \nIOU in West Virginia for the blue, the Social Security surplus, and now \nwe are going to give them an IOU for the green, 62% of the unified \nsurplus, which of course came from the Social Security surplus.\n  So what we do, we start with $137.6 billion in Social Security \nsurplus. We don't really have it. We are $2.9 billion short, because we \nalready spent that. The President prints out an IOU in West Virginia, \nand then he takes $134 billion, every penny from Social Security, and \nhe spends $52 billion of it. Then he takes $83 billion that is left and \ngives it to Social Security again.\n  You might ask, how, with $134 billion, do you give Social Security \n$221 billion? Well, how you do it is, you give them $137.6 billion and \nyou already have spent $2.9 billion so you have $134 billion. You spend \nanother 38 percent of it, and that leaves you with $83 billion, and you \ngave that to Social Security.\n\n[[Page S3174]]\n\n So what the President has done is double-counted $83.5 billion of the \nSocial Security surplus.\n  The amazing thing to me is that Senator Domenici, Senator Lautenberg, \nand I have seen many budgets come and go, and we know we have seen \nadministrations, Democrat and Republican, who made rosy assumptions \nabout the future--of course, nobody knew what was going to happen in \nthe future--that did all kinds of things, but nothing of the scale of \ndouble-counting the Social Security trust fund. In the 20 years in the \nHouse and the Senate that I have watched budgets come and I have \nwatched them go--more go than come, in many cases--I have never before \nseen the level of dishonesty that exists in the budget President \nClinton has submitted this year.\n  It is not rosy assumptions about the future, it is plain fraudulent \nbookkeeping.\n  The amazing thing to me--having appeared on television with senior \nofficials of the Clinton administration to talk about this issue, \nhaving listened to them in testimony--is how educated people who have \ncredibility independent of serving in the Clinton administration can \ncome before the public and come before the Congress and defend this; it \nis totally beyond my comprehension.\n  It is totally beyond my ability to understand the willingness of \npeople to say something that they know, because every one of them took \nfreshman accounting in college--if a freshman economic student at \nHarvard had proposed this double-counting scheme, our dear colleague, \nLarry Summers, the smartest guy in the Clinton administration, would \nhave given him an F. And yet poor Larry Summers is dragged on CBS \ntelevision to defend double-counting bookkeeping.\n  Having gone through it, let me just show you some of the \nmanifestations of it. If you take the President's budget, he claims \nthat he is locking away $5.8 trillion for Social Security in the \nfuture. Remember, these are all IOUs, and it does not make any \ndifference whether you have one or you have a cigar box full. They all \nare commitments for which we are going to raise taxes, cut spending, or \nborrow money in the future. But I am simply talking about gimmicks.\n  The President claims $5.8 trillion that he has put in the Social \nSecurity trust fund. But yet when you look at what he has actually \nlocked away, it is only $2.2 trillion. Let me just show you the numbers \nfrom his own budget.\n  This is the first document that comes from the Social Security \nAdministration, and it shows the President's proposal:\n\n       Under the President's plan, the Social Security trust fund \n     will rise from $864 billion to $6.6 trillion, an increase of \n     $5.8 trillion during the year 2000 to 2014.\n\n  That is what the President says he is doing, locking away $5.8 \ntrillion for Social Security. But when you actually look, I say to \nSenator Domenici, at the President's budget from the Office of \nManagement and Budget, there is a ``Social Security lockbox transfer \nused to redeem debt.'' They are not redeeming $5.8 trillion, the amount \nset aside for Social Security, they are redeeming $2.183 trillion.\n  What happened to the other $3.6 trillion? It is missing. You cannot \nfind it in their books. What happened to it? It is a funny thing about \ndouble-counting bookkeeping, you can double count all you want, but \nwhen you finally open up the box, you only have in there what you put \nin there. That is basically what the President does.\n  When our colleagues on the Democratic side of the aisle say the \nPresident does these great things for Social Security, what he does for \nSocial Security is double count the entries he is making in the Social \nSecurity trust fund, but nothing the President does in any way will pay \nany benefit past 2012 because at that point we open this box, and all \nit has is IOUs. Then we have to raise taxes or cut spending or cut \nSocial Security benefits, or we have to borrow money to pay for it.\n  Finally, let me read you a quote. Probably the best summary of the \nClinton Social Security proposal was in a major article by David E. \nRosenbaum in the New York Times on March 24. Here is his summary of \nwhat he calls ``the shell game'' in the Clinton Social Security \nproposal. Listen to this quote. He is talking about the Clinton plan on \nSocial Security:\n\n       The plan does nothing more than throw new IOUs at the \n     problem and avoids tough choices needed to keep subsequent \n     generations from having to pay the bills for the retirement \n     of the baby boomers.\n\n  What is being called a plan to save Social Security is, in fact, a \nphony bookkeeping scheme to double count the number of IOUs put into \nSocial Security. Not only is it fraudulent, but it is a hoax, because \nthe IOUs in Social Security do nothing to pay benefits. You cannot pay \nbenefits with IOUs. You have to have money, and the only way you can \nget money is to tax or to cut spending or to borrow the money from the \ngeneral public.\n\n  The second hoax in the Clinton budget is the hoax of Medicare. This \nyear, the President killed the Medicare Commission report, and his \nalternative to it was to send an IOU to Medicare. He said, going back \nto this surplus, ``Look, we started out with $134 billion and we gave \n$221 billion of it to Social Security. That worked great. Having taken \n134 and given 221 of the 134 to Social Security, why don't we give 15 \npercent to Medicare? It worked great for Social Security, let's do it \nfor Medicare.''\n  So what he does is he sends this meaningless IOU to Medicare only, as \nSenator Domenici was the first to discover, there is a big caveat on \nthis IOU, and that is, you cannot spend it. He does not provide any new \nbenefits.\n  He talks about drug benefits and how wonderful it would be to have \nthem, but he provides not one penny for drug benefits. None of this \nmoney can be spent under the President's budget. It is simply a \nmeaningless IOU. I guess we will open another office in West Virginia \nand we will hire people and they will print out the IOU for Medicare \nand put it in a metal filing cabinet, but does it fund one prescription \ndrug? No. Does it pay for one day in the hospital? No. Does it pay for \none home health care visit? No.\n  If it does not do any of those things, what good is it? It is good \nbecause it is a political weapon. The President can say, ``I gave 15 \npercent of the surplus to Medicare.'' You cannot spend it. It will not \nbuy any of these things, but I did it.\n  The point is, Senator Domenici could have done all these things, and \nmore, if he were willing to use phony bookkeeping. But thank goodness \nhe is not willing to use phony bookkeeping. He did fund--fully fund--\nfor 10 years Medicare.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me make a concluding point, and then I will be happy \nto yield.\n  The President had a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to save Social \nSecurity this year, and he did not do it. The President had a once-in-\na-lifetime opportunity with a bipartisan commission to plant the seeds \nto save Medicare, and he did not do it. To use a parody on a very \nfamous commercial, the Presidency is a terrible thing to waste, and \nPresident Clinton has wasted Presidential leadership on Medicare and \nSocial Security with phony programs that serve no purpose except to \nmislead the American public and to prevent real debate on these issues.\n  I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to ask the Senator, in terms of \nthe President transferring some balances into the Medicare trust fund \nand taking IOUs back, we all know right now there is an assessment of \nwhen the Medicare Program will stop generating enough money to pay its \nbills. Remember, that date is 2008----\n  Mr. GRAMM. That is right.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. When there will be less money coming in than the bills \ncalling for it.\n  Does the President's plan change that fact?\n  Mr. GRAMM. No. In fact, it provides no new money in the year 2008 to \ncover that deficit.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I say, in conclusion, that the Domenici budget has a real \nprocess to lower the debt limit that the Government operates under to \nassure that not one penny of Social Security money will be spent on \nanything else. We will have a vote on that lockbox. Many people who \nsay, ``We want to stop the plundering of Social Security,'' will have \nan opportunity to do it, because the Domenici proposal will stop Social \nSecurity money being spent\n\n[[Page S3175]]\n\nfor any other purpose. I intend to support it.\n  I congratulate Senator Domenici. And I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I ask that Senator Murray of Washington be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington, Senator Murray, \nis recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank my colleague from New Jersey, the ranking member \non the Budget Committee, who has worked with us for a number of years \nin putting together these budgets. I join my colleagues in wishing him \nwell on his retirement and thank him for the work he has done for so \nmany people throughout his career.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong opposition to the \npending fiscal year 2000 budget resolution that is before us here today \nand my deep concern and disappointment with the priorities that have \nbeen laid out in this budget. I remind my colleagues that budgets are \nnot about today; they are about tomorrow. Failure to establish a \nframework for Federal spending that focuses on the future is a serious \nmistake.\n  Last week during the consideration of the resolution in the Budget \nCommittee, I was really amazed at our lack of focus on investing in our \nfuture and our complete disregard for the impact of the decisions we \nwere making on hard-working families. The mistake that we all made \nduring committee consideration was our failure to put a human face on \nour discussions. We simply lost sight of the human and social costs of \nour decisions.\n  The focus of this budget that is before us and the focus of the \ndebate in committee seemed to be based solely on politically expedient \ntax cuts. There was no discussion on extending the solvency of Social \nSecurity or Medicare and what our failure to address these issues will \nmean for working families. There was no attempt to address the \nshortfalls in our investment in public education, our public health, \nenvironment, veterans health care, child care, food safety, Older \nAmericans Act, Medicare, Medicaid. These are not just spending \nprograms, these are investments in our quality of life and in our \nfuture economic security.\n  When we talk about education, a lot of the talk we hear on the floor \nis jargon--jargon--about flexibility and block grants and Federal \nmandates. No one talks about walking into a classroom of 40 young \nchildren and looking into their faces as they struggle to learn. I \ncannot say strongly enough, there are human costs to the decisions that \nwe are making in this budget.\n  I have talked to children our decisions affect. I have talked to \ntheir teachers and their parents. I know they are not interested in \npolitical double-talk. What they want to know is, What are we doing to \nprepare them for the challenges of the next century? What are we doing \nto invest in our young children so that they have the ability to get a \njob when they graduate? Are we addressing the huge class sizes that our \nchildren face every day and their inability to learn math and reading \nand science? Are we addressing the issue of the crumbling schools that \nmany of our children go to every day? Are we addressing the fact that \nour teachers need to be educated and trained to be able to teach the \nskills that we require of them today?\n\n  That is what parents and students and communities and business \nleaders are looking for in this budget. That is what we have failed to \naddress.\n  I see the same lack of focus in dealing with Medicare. I am glad \nthere is a bipartisan agreement to protect the Social Security trust \nfund. That one step alone will do a lot to restore integrity to the \nprogram and return confidence to the Social Security system. However, I \nam very troubled by the lack of commitment to Medicare.\n  In reviewing the committee's report to accommodate the resolution, \nthe priority appears to be one thing, and that is tax cuts. The \nresolution assumes tax cuts totaling almost $700 billion over 10 years \nbut very little mention of how we are going to invest the surplus in \nproviding equal, affordable health care for our Nation's senior \ncitizens. Again, this resolution places a higher priority on \ncompensation as opposed to investment.\n  I want to know how we are going to explain to an 83-year-old widow \nthat Congress has decided that a tax cut is more important than \nproviding her with quality, affordable health care.\n  The fastest growing segment of our population living in poverty is \nthose over the age of 65. All of the investments we have made, from \nSocial Security to Medicare to the Older Americans Act, that have \nensured a quality standard of living for those over 65, are jeopardized \nby a simple fact, and that simple fact is that the population over 65 \nis increasing faster than we are ready for. We have an opportunity, \nwith the surplus in front of us, to invest a portion of that into \nMedicare in order to extend the solvency without making devastating and \ndangerous cuts.\n  Reform of Medicare must be carefully considered and executed. We \ncannot change the program overnight without harmful implications. The \nbudget resolution we are dealing with here today fails to address the \nimmediate and long-term problems of Medicare, and, once again, there is \nno discussion of the human cost of the decisions we are making.\n  I have spoken with that 83-year-old widow who sometimes has to choose \nbetween hundreds of dollars a year in prescription drugs and food. How \ndo I explain that, under this, she could face an additional $2,498 a \nyear in Medicare premiums? How do you justify increasing the burden on \nindividuals whose average income is slightly less than $13,000 a year?\n  I ask my colleagues to stop and reconsider their priorities. I have \nheard some of my colleagues talking about the need to return the \n``people's money'' to the people. Well, I agree. Families have worked \nhard and paid their taxes with the belief that Medicare would provide \nfor their parents as well as themselves when they retire. Medicare \nallows the elderly independence and dignity in the final years of their \nlives. I believe investing the surplus into Medicare is returning the \npeople's money to the people.\n\n  As I stated earlier, I am pleased that there is a bipartisan \ncommitment to save the Social Security trust fund surplus. This will \nallow greater flexibility in reforming the system and improving current \nbenefits. And I was pleased with the bipartisan support for the \namendment I offered in committee regarding the impact of Social \nSecurity reform on women.\n  Up until now, the only discussion about women and Social Security \nreform has been very vague statements about ``taking care'' of them. I \nbelieve that very few understand the unique circumstances of women who, \nthroughout their working life and in retirement, face very different \ndecisions and circumstances, where women tend to be out of the \nworkforce to raise their children, or later on in life to take care of \nelderly parents, where women earn, on the average, 75 cents on the \ndollar of what men do; when we look at Social Security reform and \nrealize right now that Social Security is based on the top 35 years of \nincome, and for many women who do not work 35 years, their income is \naveraged by adding a number of zeros into that calculation because they \nhave not worked those years.\n  We have to use this opportunity to make sure that how these decisions \nare made does not negatively impact women. It is actually this lack of \nunderstanding of women in the workforce that has resulted in many more \nwomen who are living in poverty today after the age of 65. Single older \nwomen are more than twice as likely as men to face poverty today.\n  The bipartisan support of my amendment in committee has encouraged me \nto offer an amendment to the pending resolution which I hope my \ncolleagues will again support. We have to use reform and this added \nfinancial flexibility to address the specific shortfalls in the current \nstructure that penalize women and oftentimes leave them in poverty \nfollowing the death of their spouse.\n  My amendment would simply illustrate the support of the Senate for \nusing reform as a mechanism, not just at protecting the status quo but \nactually improving the economic security of older women. I hope that \nthe same commitment to address the needs of women in reform prevails \nwhen I offer\n\n[[Page S3176]]\n\nthis amendment in the next several days.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to caution my colleagues about the \ndangers we face when fiscal policy development breaks down into \npartisan politics. We will not be successful unless we have a \nbipartisan effort. I urge my colleagues to think carefully about the \nconstituents they have met and the people who have come to them asking \nthem for help and support. We need to stay focused on these faces and \nremember that the budget is not just about economic or policy decisions \nbut about decisions with real consequences and real human costs.\n\n  I am hopeful that as this budget process continues we can redirect \nour efforts and shift our priorities from short-term diversions to \nsavings and investing in the future. We have made the tough decisions \nthat have given us a budget surplus today. Like every family, we cut \nback and for several years maintained strict fiscal discipline. Let's \nfollow the example of many families and use our surplus to invest and \nsave--not to rush out to spend on lavish vacations or luxury items. \nLet's use basic common sense in deciding on the priorities of the first \nbudget of the millennium.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Senator Abraham will have some comments \nand then our first amendment. How much time does the Senator desire?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, 15 minutes. I believe I can make an \nopening statement and comments on the amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, let me begin by acknowledging, as others \nhave, the work and accomplishment of our Senate Budget Committee, and \nparticularly the work of our chairman, in putting together this budget \nwhich we are debating today.\n  A lot of people have tried to take credit with respect to the \nremarkably strong fiscal position we find ourselves in today. But I \nremind all of our colleagues that when, in 1995, this Senator arrived, \nnotwithstanding tax increases and other such devices, we still were \nconsidering budgets with deficits as great as $200 billion for as far \nas the eye could see. We had one leader in the Senate, the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee, who said, We are not going to allow that to \nhappen; we are going to begin to strengthen the economy and tighten the \nbelt in ways that eliminate the budget deficit.\n  I am proud to be a member of the committee and never to have voted \nfor anything but a balanced budget since I became a part of that \ncommittee. I attribute that to our chairman and his staff for the hard \nwork they have done to craft documents that have moved us in this \ndirection.\n  Let me just briefly outline the budget we are looking at here today \nfor the benefit of our colleagues who may be perhaps reaching the wrong \nconclusions as to what it contains on the basis of some of the speeches \nwe have heard today. I want to set the record straight. Our budget \naccomplishes a number of important priorities. First, it sets aside \nevery single dollar of the Social Security surplus so that we can use \nthat Social Security surplus for exactly what the public expects us to \nuse it for, and that is to fix Social Security and to ensure its long-\nterm solvency. Later, I will offer an amendment here which will ask the \nSenate to take a position in support of the kind of protection and \nlockbox mechanism that will guarantee that every one of those Social \nSecurity dollars is used for that purpose.\n  Second, this budget makes important investments in two areas of \npublic policy where I think there is a broad consensus of support, both \ninside the Senate as well as across America. One of those areas is \neducation. This budget acknowledges a greater Federal investment in the \nsupport of education in our country. It does not dictate how those \ndollars will be spent, obviously. I think a lot of us feel they ought \nto be spent in the classroom.\n  With the budget chairman here, I ask if he could respond. I believe, \nMr. Chairman, that this budget, in fact, increases education spending \nnot only over its baseline increase but even beyond what has been \nproposed by prominent education advocates such as the President, is \nthat not correct?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator is absolutely correct. In the first year, \nwe recommended that $3 billion, in addition to what the President \nrecommended, be spent for education, and over 5 years, $28 billion in \nnew money on top of about $100 billion in the programs today.\n  We do express our concern in the event this money were used in the \ntraditional way that we have done for the last 25 years of telling them \nexactly how to do it with a lot of strings. We are hoping it will move \ndown to the classroom level with only accountability as to what the \nFederal Government requires.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the Budget Committee chairman. I ask our \ncolleagues to take note of this.\n  We have already heard people come to the floor and talk about how \nthis budget doesn't do enough for education, while at the same time \nthey are now saying it is the President who cares about investment in \neducation.\n  This budget invests more in education than the President of the \nUnited States has proposed by a very substantial amount over the next 5 \nyears. We will have a chance later to debate how that investment should \nbe made.\n  I agree with the chairman of the Budget Committee--we want fewer \n``Washington knows best'' solutions and more people at the local level \nmaking decisions as to how to use the dollars. It is the Republican's \nbudget, not the President's, that puts more money in education.\n  Another investment that I think we all, particularly today, have to \nacknowledge is important is a greater investment in national security. \nObviously, the current events in the Balkans once again remind us that \nAmerica must have a sufficient investment in our security to be able to \nmeet international challenges we confront.\n  To give the Senate an idea of exactly what we confront with respect \nto national security today, let me use one statistic. That is the \ndecrease in levels of manpower and weaponry in just the last 8 years. \nEight years ago, we engaged in Operation Desert Storm, an \naccomplishment of great military significance. If we had to do that \nagain today, we would find ourselves severely strapped both with \nrespect to the percentage of our total Armed Forces that would be \nneeded to initiate that effort, as well as the amount of weapons from \nour total arsenal that would be needed. In fact, I believe it would \ntake about 90 percent of today's Army, two-thirds of our fighter wings, \ntwo-thirds of our aircraft carriers, and the entire U.S. Marine Corps \nbased on those current sizes today to replicate what we did in 1991.\n  If that doesn't demonstrate to us the need for a greater investment \nin national security, I don't know what does. If we need further \narguments, I think we need only to look so far as the reinlistment \nrates which are, as everyone in this body knows, not at the level we \nrequire. We need to have better pay and better benefits, pension \nbenefits, and so on, for our Armed Forces in order to encourage more \npeople to join and to stay in the Armed Forces. We have already taken a \nstep in that direction earlier this year, but we need to back up \nthe Soldiers' Bill of Rights with budget authority to be able to move \nforward. That is what this budget does over the next few years.\n\n  Finally, I want to talk about two other things. This budget sets \naside money not at all connected to Social Security, but, rather, \nsurpluses wholly unrelated to our Social Security payroll taxes for the \npurpose of reducing the tax burden on the people who pay taxes in this \ncountry. What we are talking about is very simple: More money is coming \ninto the Federal Treasury than even the biggest liberal spenders \nanticipated. It is coming faster than the IRS can count it. It is \nbuilding up a surplus that is wholly unconnected to Social Security.\n  The question is, What should we do with some of those dollars? This \nbudget sets aside a very substantial amount of money, but certainly not \nall of that money, for tax relief. Some say this isn't right; the money \nshould be used for more spending programs, new spending programs, or it \nshould go in some way to reduce the tax burden of people who are \nalready paying the taxes. We don't agree. We think this money \nconstitutes an overpayment. It is more money than we expected. If you \nmake an overpayment, you ought to get a refund. That is what this \nbudget\n\n[[Page S3177]]\n\nreflects. The refunds ought to go to the people who are making the \noverpayment. In my judgment, at least in some way, it ought to reflect \napproximately the percentage of their overpayment. To treat this as \nsuddenly a tax break for a special interest group is simply missing the \npoint.\n  We didn't just shut down a program to be able to finance a tax cut. \nWe didn't make a transfer from one beneficiary group to another in \norder to be able to afford a tax cut. We said we are taking the money \nthat is coming in and returning it to the American public. The Finance \nCommittee, not the Budget Committee, will make that decision. We think \nat least a very substantial part of those surplus dollars ought to be \nused to help allow the people who created this surplus the chance to \nkeep a little bit more of what they earn.\n  Finally, I want to talk about Medicare briefly, because I find the \nrepeated comments with respect to this budget's failure to address \nMedicare to be so erroneous that they require a response. This budget \nputs more money into Medicare over the next 5 years than I believe was \nproposed by the President, and I will defer, again, to the Budget \nchairman when I have a chance here to clarify that. Unlike the \nPresident, we don't cut Medicare over the next 5 years. Furthermore, we \nset aside over $130 billion in this budget to be used precisely on \nthings like fixing Medicare, that so many of our colleagues seem \ninterested in doing.\n  The one thing we haven't done here that I want to address, we didn't \nsay that we are just sort of going to use general tax revenues in order \nto stabilize and offset or postpone the insolvency of the Medicare Part \nA trust fund. We didn't do that here. I don't think that would be an \nappropriate precedent for us to set. We need to fix the Medicare Part A \ntrust fund to make it work. It is broken. We all know that.\n  There was a Medicare commission and 10 out of 17 people, on a \nbipartisan basis, agreed that there was a way to do that--in fact, a \nway that wouldn't even cost as much with respect to Medicare \nexpenditures. They couldn't get 11 votes for that final outcome, but \nthey got 10--including two Members of this body, including the Member \nselected by the President to chair the Medicare commission, and in my \njudgment--I am sorry, four Members of this body and two on each side of \nthe aisle.\n\n  The point is this, Mr. President. The idea that instead of putting \ntogether a plan to reform and make Medicare work, the idea to say we \nare simply going to throw more money into this without any concrete \nproposal as to how to spend the money, I think is a mistake.\n  In any event, I think this budget addresses the priorities. It locks \naway money for Social Security and every single penny that Social \nSecurity generates in surplus. It increases our investment in education \nand in national security. It allows us to give people who have paid \nmore taxes than we expected the chance to get a little bit of that \nback. Finally, it sets aside considerable amounts of money to address \nour Medicare problems. For that reason, I support it.\n  How much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 143\n\n (Purpose: Providing a framework for the protection of Social Security \n            Surpluses for current and future beneficiaries)\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Abraham], for himself, Mr. \n     Domenici, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Lott, Mr. Roth, Mr. Voinovich, \n     Mr. Grams, Mr. Gregg, Ms. Collins, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Santorum, \n     and Mr. Craig, proposes an amendment numbered 143.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE PROTECTION OF THE \n                   SOCIAL SECURITY SURPLUSES.\n\n       (a). The Congress finds that--\n       (1) Congress and the President should balance the budget \n     excluding the surpluses generated by the Social Security \n     trust funds;\n       (2) Reducing the Federal debt held by the public is a top \n     national priority, strongly supported on a bipartisan basis, \n     as evidenced by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's \n     comment that debt reduction ``is a very important element in \n     sustaining economic growth,'' as well as President Clinton's \n     comments that it ``is very, very important that we get the \n     Government debt down'' when referencing his own plans to use \n     the budget surplus to reduce Federal debt held by the public.\n       (3) According to the Congressional Budget Office, balancing \n     the budget excluding the surpluses generated by the Social \n     Security trust funds will reduce debt held by the public by a \n     total of $1,723,000,000,000 by the end of fiscal year 2009, \n     $417,000,000,000, or 32 per cent, more than it would be \n     reduced under the President's fiscal year 2000 budget \n     submission;\n       (4) further according to the Congressional Budget Office, \n     that the President's budget would actually spend \n     $40,000,000,000 of the Social Security surpluses in fiscal \n     year 2000 on new spending programs, and spend \n     $158,000,000,000 of the Social Security surpluses on new \n     spending programs from fiscal year 2000 through 2004; and\n       (5) Social Security surpluses should be used for Social \n     Security reform or to reduce the debt held by the public and \n     should not be used for other purposes.\n       (b) It is the sense of Congress that the functional totals \n     in this concurrent resolution on the budget assume that \n     Congress shall pass legislation which--\n       (1) reaffirms the provisions of section 13301 of the \n     Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 that provides that \n     the receipts and disbursements of the Social Security trust \n     funds shall not be counted for the purposes of the budget \n     submitted by the President, the congressional budget, or the \n     Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, \n     and provides for a Point of Order within the Senate against \n     any concurrent resolution on the budget, an amendment \n     thereto, or a conference report thereon that violates that \n     section.\n       (2) Mandates that the Social Security surpluses are used \n     only for the payment of Social Security benefits, Social \n     Security reform or to reduce the Federal debt held by the \n     public, and not spent on non-Social Security programs or used \n     to offset tax cuts.\n       (3) Provides for a Senate super-majority Point of Order \n     against any bill, resolution, amendment, motion or conference \n     report that would use Social Security surpluses on anything \n     other than the payment of Social Security benefits, Social \n     Security reform or the reduction of the federal debt held by \n     the public.\n       (4) Ensures that all Social Security benefits are paid on \n     time.\n       (5) Accommodates Social Security reform legislation.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, this amendment attempts to embody a \nprinciple I discussed in my remarks and which we in the Budget \nCommittee, I think, within the committee at least, indicated we desired \nto see happen, which is the creation of a lockbox mechanism into which \nwe would make sure every Social Security surplus dollar would go, so it \ncould not be used for any purpose other than to fix Social Security or, \nuntil such a Social Security fix was developed and passed, to reduce \nthe national debt.\n  This is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment. I want to make that clear. \nIt is not a substantive amendment, per se. But, Mr. President, we all \nagree that saving Social Security is our No. 1 priority in this \nCongress. The President, both in his 1998 and his 1999 address, said we \nshould save the Social Security surplus and use it--in this year's \nspeech, he said we should use it to reduce Federal debt, to ensure that \nit is not squandered on other spending. This amendment embodies that \nprinciple in the form of a sense-of-the-Senate amendment and outlines \nthe course by which I think we can accomplish that in the most \nappropriate fashion.\n  Indeed, Mr. President, this budget resolution agrees with that \nprioritization and allows for the entire surplus of Social Security to \nbe protected and to substantially reduce the Federal debt held by the \npublic. I thank the chairman of the Budget Committee with whom I have \nworked on this amendment, and I thank Senator Ashcroft who joined me in \noffering that, who I think will both speak to this at some point.\n  This is a very straightforward proposal, one I think will best \nprotect the surplus and strengthen our economy so that the future of \nSocial Security can be best ensured.\n  Let me outline some of the provisions. It would strengthen the off-\nbudget status of Social Security as well as provide for additional \npoints of order\n\n[[Page S3178]]\n\nagainst any bill, amendment, resolution, or conference report that \nwould violate this off-budget treatment.\n  Second, it would create a subcategory of the gross Federal debt \nlimit, the debt held by the public. If this proposal were ultimately \nput into effect through law, we would then cap that publicly held debt \nat the current level of $3.6 trillion. We would also then mandate the \nreduction of that debt level in fiscal years 2000, 2001, and every 2 \nyears thereafter, by the same amount as the Social Security trust fund \nsurplus in those years.\n  These limits would be automatically adjusted as projected Social \nSecurity trust fund surpluses change, so as to ensure that we do not \nforce ourselves to reduce the publicly held debt by a greater amount \nthan we actually have available in the Social Security surplus, as well \nas to ensure that windfall Social Security surpluses would be protected \nfrom being raided. The proposal would also allow for a one-time \nadjustment to accommodate Social Security reform, should the Congress \nenact such reform.\n  This proposal, if it were actually passed into law, would reduce \npublicly held debt from $3.6 trillion to $2.4 trillion by the year \n2009. I believe that is an even greater reduction than what the \nPresident's framework proposal suggested. It thereby locks away a \nlarger portion of the Social Security surplus.\n  To that end, I might add that the budget resolution we have before us \ncontains advisory caps on the publicly held debt limits which mirror \nthose contained in this proposal. However, I believe it is necessary \nfor the Congress to go beyond those advisory caps and to commit itself \nto reducing this publicly held debt and locking away the Social \nSecurity surplus from being spent on other programs. That is why I am \njoined by 11 colleagues, including Senators Domenici and Ashcroft, as \nwell as the majority leader and the chairman of the Finance Committee, \nSenator Roth, in offering a sense-of-the-Senate amendment which will \nstate that it is our intention to pursue such a course of action.\n\n  This amendment would state that it is our intention to pass \nlegislation to reaffirm the off-budget status of the Social Security \ntrust fund, mandate that the Social Security surplus only be used for \nthe payment of Social Security benefits, Social Security reform, or the \nreduction of debt held by the public, and provide for protection such \nas points of order against any legislation which would try to \ncircumvent those protections, ensure the Social Security benefits \ncontinue to be paid in full and on time, and accommodate Social \nSecurity reform.\n  We think this makes sense. We think it is consistent with colleagues \non both sides of the aisle who have been talking about it for an \nextensive period of time. We think it made sense in this budget \nresolution to go on record saying this is the direction in which we are \ngoing to head. It is one thing to talk about saving Social Security and \nmaking sure that Social Security surpluses aren't spent, making sure we \nreduce the public debt with Social Security surpluses, and so on; but I \nthink talk is one thing, action is another.\n  I suggest that the passage of this amendment which I have offered \nwith my colleagues would be the sort of action that would set us on the \nright course to make sure that ultimately we do in fact protect the \nSocial Security surpluses so they can only be used to fix Social \nSecurity or to pay down the national debt.\n  With that, Mr. President, I will yield the floor. I know other \ncolleagues here want to speak on this issue, and in due course, as we \ngo back and forth, I am sure they will. I thank the budget chairman and \nthe current occupant of the manager's chair, and I thank our ranking \nmember as well, for the opportunity to speak.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise not to rebut the amendment by the \nSenator from Michigan but to make an opening statement about this \nbudget and certain very crucial items in it.\n  I compliment Senator Lautenberg for his strong advocacy as the \nranking member of the Budget Committee and his longstanding \nchampionship for those people who have been left out and left behind. \nSir, I thank you for your role not only in this budget but what you do \nevery day in the Senate.\n  Through the best efforts, I am very concerned that the fiscal year \n2000 budget resolution really does not adequately address the solvency \nof Social Security, nor does it address adequately the solvency of \nMedicare--the two most important programs that the United States has, \ndomestically, and the ones that Americans universally rely upon and \nplan their life around having in a reliable way, that has reliability \nand continuity, and that the entire private sector assumes will be \nthere as they plan private sector products.\n  Now, preserving Social Security and Medicare must be our Nation's top \npriority, and I believe the original efforts by the Lautenberg group \nwere there. What we have before us today, I believe, does not protect \nSocial Security.\n  Now, we say a lot in the Senate about family values. Well, I believe \nthere is a value that comes out of the Judeo-Christian ethic I believe \nin, and it is called honor your father and honor your mother. I believe \nit is not only a good commandment to live by, I think it is a good \ncommandment to govern by.\n  We should not only have it in our prayer books. We should have it in \nthe Federal checkbook. This is why I am so adamant that we must save \nSocial Security first and preserve the solvency of Medicare.\n  When we look at Social Security, we want to make sure that we protect \nthose who have the least resources with them--those without pensions, \nthose without IRAs, those without 401(k)s. These are the people who we \nknow represent, as we speak, now, over 40 million people. If there are \n40 million Americans without health insurance, you had better believe \nthey are going to be the same 40 million who do not have 401(k)s. To \nthem ``K'' means Kellogg, and it is a cereal. It is not a life security \nsystem.\n  I am particularly concerned about women. And I am particularly \nconcerned about both men and women who, at the end of the day and near \nthe end of their lives, will have no reliable pension program to look \nout for them.\n  This is what the Social Security issue is all about. I want to be \nsure that in any debate we have--whether it is on the budget, or \nwhether it is the Social Security bills--I want to ensure that Social \nSecurity is universal and portable, that it is a guaranteed benefit, \nthat it is inflation proof, and looks out, as I said, for those who do \nnot have anything else going for them.\n  I have a particular interest in this as it affects women. That is \nbecause I truly believe that Social Security is a woman's issue. \nWithout it, over half of all elderly women would now be living in dire \npoverty. Yes. Women today are working more outside the home, yes, and \nearning more than past generations. But in reality, their lifetime \nearnings, access to pensions, and ability to save continues to be less \nthan men. That is why Social Security is a woman's issue. Let me \nelaborate.\n  First of all, women live longer. The life expectancy rate for women \nis 65, 4 years longer than for men. That means they will need income \nsecurity for a longer period of time. Also, the equity that we placed \nin Social Security is absolutely crucial. Why? Because right now women \ndo not get equal pay for equal work, making 70 percent of what men make \nfor similar jobs. They will get less Social Security because their \nbenefits are based in part on wages. That means the hard-working female \nx ray technician who puts in 40 hours a week might take home $28,000 a \nyear instead of the financial worth that her male counterpart has.\n  We need a Social Security system, too, that women can count on, that \nrespects values of work inside the home and acknowledges it in \nretirement. This is why the spousal benefit is so crucial and why we \nneed to preserve it. Women move in and out of the paid marketplace to \ndo some of the most important work--raising children and caring for \nelderly parents and their relatives. Take, for instance, someone who \nworks in an office as an executive assistant. She got her high school \ndiploma, didn't go to college, worked full time for 5 years, but leaves \nthe workforce to raise her children. She might do that for 7 years and \nthen return part time. Notice that she lost 7 years in\n\n[[Page S3179]]\n\nher contribution, and then is a part-time wage earner, and then often \nhas to go back at an entry wage. This woman needs to know that Social \nSecurity is there for her, and that she is not penalized for what she \ndid, which was the unpaid work for providing the most invaluable \nservice to America; that is, raising America's children.\n\n  Certain ideas have been proposed to reforming Social Security which \nwould have a devastating impact on women. Having reliance on private \nretirement accounts would hurt women disproportionately. Again, women \nearn less money, unequal pay, leave the paid workforce to raise \nchildren, or care-give, and would have less to ``invest.'' Reducing the \nSocial Security COLA would hurt women. And there are other reforms.\n  But the point that I make is that Social Security as it now stands is \nthe best deal for women. Sure, we need to make reforms. Sure, we need \nto look at the other ideas. That is why we should not cut or \ndramatically alter Social Security. Sure, it can pay benefits into \n2032. But we have to look ahead to be sure that there is solvency of \nSocial Security.\n  That is why we support the Lautenberg effort. We want to be sure that \nfor women who have worked all of their lives, in the home or outside \nthe home, there will be a guaranteed benefit with a full cost of \nliving, that it will have a progressive benefit formula that helps the \nlow-income wage earners, and that there is a spousal and survivor \nbenefit for married women, divorced and widowed. The only way we can do \nthat is if we take the surplus and put 62 percent aside, and also 15 \npercent for Medicare. Otherwise, this is a hollow budget full of \npromise and hollow on opportunity.\n  Mr. President, I salute the efforts of Senator Lautenberg. I am \ndeeply disturbed that we are not setting aside 62 percent as we talked \nabout. I do not believe the other party adequately protects Social \nSecurity, adequately protects Medicare, and I believe that ultimately \nthe American people will wake up to this.\n  As it stands now, I will vote no for this budget.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I will take a couple of minutes with \nthe agreement of the Senator from Minnesota just to respond, A, to say \nthank you to my dear friend and colleague for her complimentary \nremarks, but even more importantly than that--because flattery is nice, \nbut effectiveness is even better--and the Senator from Maryland has \nbeen a known, strong advocate for the things that she believes in.\n  I greet Senator Mikulski each time I see her with the knowledge that \nshe has enhanced our view of what life is really about by bringing a \nperspective that comes from the women's side that is so often left out. \nShe knows also too well that she hits a familiar tone with me when she \ntalks about Social Security, because my father died before my mother \nwas 36 years old. She had nothing but bills and an obligation to my 12-\nyear-old sister and an 18-year-old son who had already enlisted in the \nArmy to support her. She did it by sheer dent of hard work and will.\n  If we had in that family, going back now--we are talking about 1943--\nthe benefit of a Social Security Program, a check coming in that would \nkind of help relieve not only the fiscal financial obligations, but the \nanxiety that accompanies the worry about that, if we had Medicare or \nMedicaid in those days when my father died at the age of 43, a \nstrapping handsome man--cancer overtook him, and he died leaving \ndoctors bills. So we had not only enormous grief, but the obligation to \npay off the doctor and hospital bills that were accumulated with no \ninsurance program.\n  So when we talk about Social Security, we talk about women who are \ntypically those left most often with the smallest share of assets, \nbecause of the way we are structured. We need to make sure that Social \nSecurity is going to be there. We need to make sure that Medicare is \ngoing to be solvent for a number of years. Yes. We are not disagreeing \nwith the need to reform and improve, if possible, but to make sure that \nit is equitably distributed. We need time. We need the assurance that \nthe programs are going to be there.\n\n  I for one will jump on the reform-and-improve bandwagon as soon as we \nhave a good vehicle to take us along.\n  So I thank the Senator from Maryland for her comments.\n  I see my friend also from California was so nice before to give me \ncredit for some things I probably don't deserve. But, nevertheless, the \ncredit is nice to get.\n  I thank both Senators.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I wanted to take about 15 seconds.\n  We have heard time after time from speaker after speaker on the other \nside of the aisle that somehow the Republican budget doesn't protect or \nset aside money for Social Security. We set aside all the Social \nSecurity surpluses. It is earmarked in a lockbox for Social Security. \nSo that is not what we are saying. One good thing about our budget is \nwe don't spend it. The President, under his budget, spends $158 billion \nof the Social Security surplus. Our budget doesn't. So I think we do a \nbetter job on securing and saving Social Security.\n  I would like to yield to my friend from Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I thank the Senator \nfrom Minnesota.\n  I rise in support of the resolution offered by Senator Abraham that \nhas been called the Abraham-Domenici-Ashcroft Social Security \namendment. That protects our strong support for saving Social Security.\n  It expresses our strong support for protecting Social Security. I am \ngrateful for the opportunity to cosponsor this amendment, which will \nput the Senate on record in favor of protecting the Social Security \nsurplus and not invading it for spending for other Governmental \nprograms.\n  The Senator from Minnesota is absolutely correct. The President's \nbudget over the next 5 years would spend $158 billion of the Social \nSecurity surplus--not the general Governmental surplus but the Social \nSecurity surplus. Social Security is a national, cultural and, I might \nadd, legal obligation. Social Security is our most important social \nprogram, a contract between the Government and its citizens. Americans, \nincluding 1 million Missourians, depend on this commitment. This is \nmore than just a Governmental commitment. We have a responsibility as a \nculture to care for the recipients of Social Security--the elderly and \nother individuals in regard to Social Security who are its \nbeneficiaries. Social Security is the only retirement income for most \nof the seniors in this country. It is our obligation, passed down from \ngeneration to generation, to provide retirement security for every \nAmerican.\n  As individuals, all of us care about Social Security because we know \nthe benefits it pays to our mothers and fathers, relatives and friends. \nAnd we think of the Social Security taxes we and our children pay--up \nto 12.4 percent of our income. We pay these taxes with the \nunderstanding that they help our parents and their friends, and we hope \nthat our taxes will somehow, someday make it possible to help pay for \nour own retirements.\n  In my case, thinking of Social Security brings to mind friends and \nconstituents such as Lenus Hill of Bolivar, Missouri, who relies on her \nSocial Security to meet living expenses. Billy Yarberry lives on a farm \nnear Springfield and depends on Social Security. And there is Reverend \nWalter Keisker of Cape Girardeau, who will be 100 years old next July \nand lives on Social Security. The faces of these friends make Social \nSecurity have a special, personal meaning to me.\n  Whenever I meet with folks in Missouri, I am asked, ``Senator, you \nwon't let them use my Social Security taxes to pay for the United \nNations, will you?'' Or, ``Why can't I get my full benefits if I work \nafter 65?'' Or, ``You know I need my Social Security, don't you?''\n  And then there are the letters on Social Security I get every day.\n  Ed and Beverly Shelton of Independence, Missouri, write:\n\n       Aren't the budget surpluses the result of Social Security \n     taxes generating more revenue than is needed to fund current \n     benefits? Therefore, the Social Security surplus is the \n     surplus! . . . Yes, we are senior citizens and receive a very \n     limited amount of Social Security. We are children who \n     survived the\n\n[[Page S3180]]\n\n     Great Depression and World War II so we know how to stretch a \n     dollar and rationed goods--just [listen to this] wish \n     Congress were as careful with spending our money as we are!\n\n  These concerns are why I am cosponsoring this amendment, which will \nexpress the Senate's view that we must put an end to the practice of \nusing surpluses in the Social Security trust funds to finance deficits \nin the rest of the Federal budget.\n\n  This resolution--the Abraham-Domenici-Ashcroft resolution--puts the \nSenate on record as supporting legislation that would accomplish the \nfollowing:\n  (a) Reaffirming the provisions of section 13301 of the Onnibus Budget \nReconciliation Act of 1990. This section provides that the Social \nSecurity trust funds shall be off budget.\n  (2) Mandating that the Social Security surpluses are to be used only \nfor the payment of Social Security benefits, Social Security reform, or \nto reduce the federal debt held by the public, and not spent on non-\nSocial Security programs or used for tax cuts.\n  (3) Providing for a Senate super-majority point of order against any \nbill, joint resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report that \nwould use Social Security surpluses on anything other than the payment \nof Social Security benefits, Social Security reform, or to reduce the \nfederal debt held by the public.\n  That is very important. We include in this proposal not just a \nstatement that we want to reserve Social Security for the right \npurposes, but we want to create a point of order that makes out of \norder a proposal that we spend Social Security to cover deficits in \nother parts of the Government.\n  Additionally, this particular measure ensures that all Social \nSecurity benefits are paid on time.\n  I am in favor of two provisions that will accomplish these \nobjectives. First, I am a cosponsor of the Abraham-Domenici lockbox \nprovision, which will lock away Social Security surpluses by ratcheting \ndown the publicly held debt by the amount of our Social Security \nsurpluses. This resolution puts the Senate on record in favor of this \nlegislation.\n  In addition, Senator Domenici and I have introduced the Protect \nSocial Security Benefits Act, which would make it out of order for the \nSenate to pass, or even debate, a budget that uses Social Security \nsurpluses to finance deficits in the rest of the budget.\n  Under this proposed legislation, a three-fifths vote in the Senate \nwould be required to overcome this point of order, thereby making it \nextremely difficult to use the Social Security surplus to fund new \ndeficit spending. We must make clear that the Federal Budget should be \nbalanced without counting any Social Security surpluses.\n\n  Social Security should not finance new spending. But that is exactly \nwhat has happened in the past, is now happening, and will continue \nhappening in the future, unless changes are made. The funding of \nFederal deficits in Government spending generally by consuming Social \nSecurity surpluses must end.\n  Walling off the trust funds is the first step, not the only step, \nneeded to protect Social Security. This is the right way to start the \neffort to improve Social Security so it is strong for our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  To do this, we need to be honest, realizing that, for now, time is on \nour side to make thoughtful improvements. Social Security does now and \nwill in the near future accumulate annual surpluses.\n  Together, income from payroll taxes and interest is greater than the \namount of benefits being paid out. The Social Security trustees believe \nthat these surpluses will continue each year for the next 14 years. In \nthat time, a $2.8 trillion total surplus will accumulate.\n  In the year 2013, however, when more baby boomers will be in \nretirement, annual benefit payments will exceed annual taxes received \nby Social Security through taxes and interest to the fund. As a result, \nSocial Security will run an annual deficit. By 2021, annual benefit \npayments will exceed annual taxes received by Social Security and \ninterest earned on the accumulated surpluses. Then, by the year 2032, \nSocial Security payroll taxes will not only be insufficient to pay \nbenefits; the surpluses will be used up. Social Security will be \nbankrupt. That is, even counting the notes in its fund, incapable of \nmeeting the demand for benefits.\n  In recent years, Social Security surpluses have been used to finance \ndeficit spending in the rest of the Federal budget. Take fiscal year \n1998 for example. The Social Security surplus was $99 billion. The \ndeficit in the rest of the Government budget was $29 billion. So $29 \nbillion--or 30 percent of the Social Security surplus--financed other \nGovernment programs that were not paid for with general tax revenues. \nThis occurred despite President Clinton's promise to save ``every penny \nof any surplus'' for Social Security.\n  For next year, this money shuffling is even greater. According to \nCBO, the President's budget dips into the Social Security surplus to \nthe tune of $158 billion over 5 years to pay for government spending.\n\n  This kind of money shuffling must end. I cannot go back to Lenus Hill \nor Billy Yarberry and tell them that I stood by silently as the \ngovernment devoted spent $158 billion of their retirement money to pay \nfor the President's new spending initiatives somewhere else. We must \nstop the dishonest practice of hiding new government deficits with \nSocial Security surpluses.\n  This amendment is designed to express the sense of the Senate that we \nmust not use surpluses in the Social Security trust funds to pay for \ndeficits in the rest of the federal budget. Three times Congress has \npassed laws that tried to take Social Security off-budget. These \nefforts have called for accounting statements that require the \ngovernment to keep the financial status of Social Security separate \nfrom the rest of the budget. But these efforts are inadequate unless \nCongress puts in place safeguards that protect surpluses in Social \nSecurity from financing new government spending.\n  This amendment will put the Senate on record in favor of helping us \nsave the trust funds, by directing the entire Social Security surplus \nto shrink the publicly held federal debt. Reducing the publicly held \ndebt would cut annual interest costs that now cost $200 billion and 15 \npercent of entire federal government budget. Eliminating this interest \ncosts would provide more flexibility to address the long-term financing \ndifficulties Social Security now faces that could someday jeopardize \npayment of full benefits.\n  This amendment is designed to express our support for protecting the \nSocial Security system. More importantly, it is designed to protect the \nAmerican people from attempts to spend our retirement dollars on \ncurrent government spending. While I value the Social Security system, \nI value the American people, people like Lenus Hill and the 1 million \nother Missourians who receive Social Security benefits and depend on \nthem more. I value those individuals far more than I value the system. \nMy primary responsibility is to them. This amendment will protect the \nSocial Security system and the America people first.\n  Mr. President, I send another amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a pending amendment, the Chair would \ninform the Senator.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, being made aware of the pending \namendment which is now before the Senate, I withdraw my request to send \nan amendment to the desk.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Kriz \nArdizzone, Tevi Troy, and Jim Carter, members of my legislative staff, \nbe granted the privilege of the floor during the pendency of the budget \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota for \nhis excellent work. I look forward to working with him as we bring this \nbudget to the American people. I believe it has the potential of being \nthe best budget in years.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I appreciate the kind words of the Senator \nfrom Missouri.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/24/senate-section/article/S3180-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3180-S3182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             NATIONAL SCHOOL VIOLENCE VICTIMS' MEMORIAL DAY\n\n  Mr. GRAMS.

Res. 53 be\n\n[[Page S3181]]\n\ndischarged from the Judiciary Committee and the Senate now proceed to \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the resolution.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 53) to designate March 24, 1999, as \n     ``National School Violence Victims' Memorial Day.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nSenate Resolution 53, which declares March 24, 1999 as ``National \nSchool Violence Victims' Memorial Day.''\n  As a number of my colleagues noted, the past year has been a grim one \nfor educators, parents, and students. The tragic events in schools in \nArkansas, Kentucky, and Oregon shocked the conscience. I'm thankful \nthat in my home state of Virginia, no one was killed at school in 1998. \nBut this past summer in Richmond, a volunteer and teacher were wounded \nby gun fire from a fourteen-year-old student. All of these events were \nterrible blows to families and friends in each community. I hope \ntoday's resolution will give some solace to those communities, who will \nknow that the Congress has not forgotten them.\n  For the nation as a whole, these events were a terrible blow as well, \nand I believe Congress has an obligation to follow up with a commitment \nto preventing future school violence because while schools are a \nrelatively safe place for our children, the events of the past year \nhave shaken our confidence. School children have written to me \nexpressing the fear that they will be attacked, and I know their \nparents have similar fears. We cannot expect our children to achieve \ntheir best in such an environment.\n  We've already taken a number of steps that I hope will help allay \nthese fears. Later this year, more than $165 million in school safety \ngrants will be awarded by the Department of Justice's Community \nOriented Policing Services program. I want to thank my colleagues, \nparticularly Senators Gregg and Hollings, for supporting efforts last \nyear to increase funding for this program, which I initiated in 1997. I \nask my colleagues to support funding for this important program again \nthis year.\n  Later this year, as we consider juvenile justice reform legislation \nand the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Schools Act, I \nwill be looking at other ways to help make our schools safer, and I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues on that effort as well. \nStudents should worry about their next test, not about their safety. \nFear should not be a part of any school's curriculum.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to take just a brief moment to \nthank my colleagues for passing this resolution marking today as \nNational School Violence Victims Memorial Day.\n  Let me tell you why this day is so important to me and to the \ncitizens of Butte, Montana.\n  Butte fifth grader Jeremy Bullock was 11 years old when he and his \ntwin brother Joshua left for school together as they always did. The \nday was April 12, 1994. Jeremy didn't come home from school that day. \nHe was shot and killed on the playground, leaving family and a \ncommunity forever changed.\n  By recognizing March 24th as National School Violence Victims \nMemorial Day we will be honoring the memory of Jeremy Bullock and \ncountless other children, families and communities by saying clearly, \nwith one voice that we as Americans will meet the challenge of \neradicating violence from our schools.\n  So, today and every day, let us always remember Jeremy Bullock. For, \nthough he is gone, his memory will always linger and help to fuel our \nwork.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise this evening to join my \ncolleague, Senator Lincoln, my other colleague in the Senate, to honor \nour Nation's children and citizens who have been victimized by school \nviolence.\n  The Senate just adopted Senate Resolution 53 which designates March \n24, today, as ``National School Violence Victims Memorial Day.'' As you \nknow, 1 year ago today at the Westside Middle School in Jonesboro, AR, \nfive children and one teacher lost their lives to an inexplicable and \ncowardly act of violence. Ten others were left wounded, and countless \nparents, relatives, and friends were left permanently scarred. In \naddition, the entire State of Arkansas was left numb with shock, \nhorror, and grief.\n  I cannot express the loss and the pain that we feel as a result of \nthis tragedy. But I ask you and my fellow colleagues in the Senate to \nreflect on the loss of Natalie Brooks, Paige Ann Herring, Stephanie \nJohnson, Britthney Verner, and Shannon Wright.\n  We hurt for these families. I know that the simplest things in life \nwill forever cause them pain. For instance, I know that Floyd Brooks \nwill never see another frog without thinking of the frog collection \nwhich his daughter Natalie was so proud of.\n  We remember that Paige Ann Herring was a very bright, intelligent 12-\nyear-old girl who loved life and enjoyed it to the fullest through such \nactivities as playing the piano, softball, volleyball, basketball, \nsinging in the school choir. It saddens me, and I think all of us, so \nmuch that we will no longer hear her voice.\n  It is the little things. Stephanie Johnson believed that a ladybug's \nlanding on her brought her good luck. And her mother knew that her \nprayers for peace were answered when she asked God for a sign that \nSteph was OK and then upon her next visit saw ladybugs on Stephanie's \ngravestone.\n  We remember today that Britthney Varner was an extremely caring and \nloving little girl who got good grades and loved daffodils.\n  I know that Mitchell Wright will never look at his son, Zane, without \nthinking of Zane's mother, Shannon, who gave her life to save the lives \nof her students.\n  I want these families to know that while we can never fully know the \npain they feel today, we will certainly never forget their loved ones.\n  As I close, I want to give a special message to Zane Wright, Shannon \nWright's infant son Zane.\n  Your mother was a genuine heroine. Scripture teaches us that there is \nno greater love than the love it takes to lay down your life for \nanother. So whenever you wonder what you mother was like, remember her \nas an incredibly brave woman who loved others like few others in this \nworld ever have.\n  In addition, to the families of the victims of school violence in \nBethel, AK; Pearl, MS; West Paducah, KY; Edinboro, PA; Pomona, CA; \nSpringfield, OR; and the rest of the Nation--we want them to know that \nwe stand today to honor their loved ones.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor to my colleague from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Thank you, Mr. President. And I thank my colleague from \nArkansas.\n  Mr. President, I join my colleagues, all of my colleagues, here \ntoday, but especially my fellow colleague from Arkansas, Senator \nHutchinson, in a very special effort to designate March 24, 1999, as \nNational School Violence Victims Day.\n  As mentioned by my colleague, a year ago today the peaceful routine \nof a small middle school just outside of Jonesboro, in my home State of \nArkansas, was forever changed. People across our country still grieve \nover the tragic shooting of four 11-year-old children and one 32-year-\nold schoolteacher of Westside Middle School.\n  The heartbroken families of victims Natalie Brooks, Paige Ann \nHerring, Stephanie Johnson, Britthney Varner, and teacher Shannon \nWright still question why it happened. What prompted two boys at the \ntender ages of 13 and 11 to violence? What spurred them to shoot their \nschoolmates and their teacher? The answers may be beyond our \ncomprehension.\n  Mr. President, the shooting at Westside Middle School is one of the \ngravest tragedies in the history of our State and our country. Though \ntime has evoked some healing and renewed confidence, the children and \nteachers of Westside Middle School were apprehensive when returning to \nschool last fall. Teachers had to comfort nervous children. Parents had \nmisgivings. And playmates longed for their young friends. Having seen \nsuch young children fall to their death at the hands of classmates \nright before their very eyes, this brave community is having a hard \ntime making sense of it all. We all are having a hard time making sense \nof it all.\n\n[[Page S3182]]\n\n  Sadly, last year's tragedy in my home State is not an isolated event. \nOver the past 18 months, gun violence has claimed lives at schools in \nPearl, MS, as mentioned by my colleague; West Paducah, KY; Edinboro, \nPA; Fayetteville, TN; Springfield, OR; and Richmond, VA. Each time as \nour country watched in horror, we wondered if this senseless violence \nwould ever stop.\n  Mr. President, the picture painted by these images is ghastly indeed. \nOur Nation's schools are not just buildings where children and teachers \nspend their days. They are the cornerstones of our communities and the \ncenters of young precious lives. Parents send their children to school \nday after day with the expectation that they will learn and that they \nwill be safe. There are many things we can do in the Senate to curb \nschool violence. We must not allow schools to become places to fear.\n  I urge this body to examine this escalating problem. And I urge each \nSenator to use National School Violence Victims Day to create a \ndialogue with school communities in their States. When an entire \ncommunity works together to improve its schools, everyone benefits. \nEvery child deserves the opportunity to attend a safe school where he \nor she may worry about math and science, not guns and violence.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor on the \nresolution offered by both of our colleagues from Arkansas. I commend \nthem highly for this. I hope all of our colleagues will join them.\n  This is the kind of issue we need to speak out on. Incidents like \nthese have caused great pain across the country. Yet, too often, the \nproblem of school violence only receives attention at the moment a \ntragedy occurs.\n  So I commend both of my colleagues and ask to be added as a \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to S.Res. 53 \nappear at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.Res. 53) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                               S. Res. 53\n\n       Whereas approximately 10 percent of all public schools \n     reported at least 1 serious violent crime to a law \n     enforcement agency over the course of the 1996-97 school \n     year;\n       Whereas in 1996, approximately 225,000 students between the \n     ages of 12 and 18 were victims of nonfatal violent crime in \n     schools in the United States;\n       Whereas during 1992 through 1994, 76 students and 29 non-\n     students were victims of murders or suicides that were \n     committed in schools in the United States;\n       Whereas because of escalating school violence, the children \n     of the United States are increasingly afraid that they will \n     be attacked or harmed at school;\n       Whereas efforts must be made to decrease incidences of \n     school violence through an annual remembrance and prevention \n     education; and\n       Whereas the Senate encourages school administrators in the \n     United States to develop school violence awareness activities \n     and programs for implementation on March 24, 1999: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates March 24, 1999, as ``National School \n     Violence Victims' Memorial Day''; and\n       (2) requests the President to issue a proclamation \n     designating March 24, 1999, as ``National School Violence \n     Victims' Memorial Day'' and calling on the people of the \n     United States to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies \n     and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/24/senate-section/article/S3182-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3182-S3225]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2000\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the concurrent \nresolution.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 143\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise to strongly support the safe-deposit \nbox amendment to lock in any future Social Security surpluses to be \nused only for Social Security benefits, Social Security reform and \nnational debt reduction. I am pleased to join Senators Abraham, \nDomenici, and Ashcroft in offering this amendment.\n  Mr. President, we all agree that Social Security is facing a fast-\napproaching crisis and fundamental reforms are needed to save and \nstrengthen the nation's retirement system. The question is, how do we \nproceed?\n  President Clinton unveiled his Social Security proposal under his FY \n2000 budget. The bottom line on his plan is that it allows the \ngovernment to control the retirement dollars of the American people by \ninvesting it for them.\n  It does nothing, however, to save Social Security from bankruptcy. \nWorse still, despite his rhetoric of saving every penny for Social \nSecurity, President Clinton has proposed to take $158 billion in Social \nSecurity dollars to finance government programs unrelated to Social \nSecurity. Let me say that again--under the President's budget, he \nproposes to take $158 billion from the Social Security surplus fund and \nspend it on other unrelated government programs. That is not saving \nSocial Security first.\n  The only positive aspect of his proposal is that the President has \nadmitted the insolvency of Social Security and has recognized the power \nof the markets to generate a better rate of return, and therefore \nimprove benefits.\n  The fundamental problem with our Social Security system is that it's \nbasically a Ponzi scheme--that is, a pay-as-you-go pyramid that takes \nthe retirement dollars of today's workers to pay benefits for today's \nretirees.\n  It has no real assets and makes no real investment. With changing \ndemographics that translate into fewer and fewer workers supporting \neach retiree, the system has begun to collapse.\n  Social Security operates on a cash-in and cash-out basis. In 1998, \nAmerican workers paid $517 billion into the system, but most of the \nmoney, $391 billion, was immediately paid out to 44 million \nbeneficiaries the same year. That left a $126 billion surplus. The \ntotal accumulated surplus in the trust fund is $750 billion.\n  Unfortunately, this surplus is only on paper. The government has \nconsumed all the $750 billion for non-Social Security related programs. \nAll it has is the Treasury IOUs that fit in four ordinary brown \naccordian-style folders that one can easily hold in both hands.\n  So when Social Security begins to run a deficit, the government has \nto do a couple of things. The government has to either tighten its \nbelt, raise taxes, or borrow more from the public, or it has to lower \nbenefits or raise the retirement age.\n  There is a lot of double-counting and double talk in President \nClinton's Social Security framework. The truth of the matter is the \nPresident spends the same money twice and claims that he has saved \nSocial Security.\n  All the President has done is create a second set of the IOUs to the \ntrust fund. It is like taking the money he owes Paul out of one pocket \nand applying it to the money he owes Peter in the other pocket, and \nthen pretending that he has doubled his money and is now able to pay \nthem both.\n  In addition, the President has proposed to spend $58 billion of \nSocial Security money in FY 2000 for his new government spending. Over \nthe next five years, he will spend $158 billion of Social Security \nmoney.\n  President Clinton's plan does not live up to his claim of saving \nSocial Security. He has not pushed back the date for when the Social \nSecurity trust fund will begin real deficit spending. That date is \nstill the same--2013. Social Security will have a shortfall that year \nand it the shortfall will continue to grow larger year after year.\n  By 2025, the shortfall will be over $360 billion a year and by 2035, \nit will explode to $786 billion, but by 2055, the deficit will run as \nhigh as $2.07 trillion.\n  Since the government has spent the surplus and has not set aside \nmoney to make up for this shortfall, it will have to raise taxes to \ncover the gap--something that economists estimate will require a \ndoubling of the payroll tax.\n  The proposal by the President to have the government invest a portion \nof the Social Security Trust Funds is no solution. It would give the \ngovernment unwarranted new powers over our economy, and it will not \nprovide retirees the rate of return they deserve.\n\n[[Page S3183]]\n\n  In last year's Humphrey-Hawkins hearing, I asked Federal Reserve \nChairman Alan Greenspan whether we should allow the government to \ninvest the Social Security Trust Funds in the markets, and if this is \nthe right direction in which we should be going. Here are his exact \nwords:\n       No, I think it's very dangerous . . . I don't know of any \n     way that you can essentially insulate government decision-\n     makers from having access to what will amount to very large \n     investments in American private industry . . .\n       I am fearful that we are taking on a position here, at \n     least in conjecture, that has very far-reaching, potential \n     danger for a free American economy and a free American \n     society.\n       It is a wholly different phenomenon of having private \n     investment in the market, where individuals own the stock and \n     vote the claims on management, (from) having government \n     (doing so).\n       I know there are those who believe it can be insulated from \n     the political process, they go a long way to try to do that. \n     I have been around long enough to realize that that is just \n     not credible and not possible. Somewhere along the line, that \n     breach will be broken.\n\n  Mr. President, Chairman Greenspan is right. We should never venture \nout onto what the Chairman calls ``a slippery slope of extraordinary \nmagnitude.''\n  It is going to take real reform, not Washington schemes, to help \nprovide security in retirement for all Americans. The first essential \nstep is to stop raiding from the Social Security Trust Funds, and truly \npreserve and protect the Social Security surplus to be used exclusively \nfor Social Security. This is exactly what this safe-deposit box \namendment will achieve. This amendment would first take Social Security \ncompletely out of the Federal budget and it requires the surplus to be \nused only for Social Security benefits, Social Security reform and debt \nreduction. It creates a super-majority point of order for using this \nsurplus for other purposes. The amendment also ensures all Social \nSecurity benefits will be paid in full.\n  Many of us in Congress agree with the President that we should, and \nindeed must, devote the entire Social Security surplus to saving Social \nSecurity, not just to talk about it, but do it; not spend the money, \nbut to set it aside. However, his plan does not do what he says while \nours does. Again, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Abraham amendment. \nThis amendment expresses the sense of the Senate that the Social \nSecurity surpluses be used only for preserving and protecting Social \nSecurity, and that new procedural safeguards be enacted to ensure this \noutcome.\n  The Abraham amendment provides an important first step in saving \nSocial Security, and is an excellent occasion to reflect on the issues \nbefore the Congress in preserving Social Security for the long-term. \nSocial Security's financial problems of Social Security are well known, \nbut bear repeating. In just 15 years, in 2013, Social Security benefit \npayments will exceed revenues, and Social Security will need to tap its \nTrust Fund.\n  Today's Trust Fund is relatively small, equal to about a year-and-a \nhalf benefits and intended as a cushion in an economic downturn. \nHowever, the Trust Fund will swell over the next 15 years because of \npayroll tax surpluses and interest. Between 2013 and 2032, Social \nSecurity Trust Fund will need to spend over $6 trillion for benefits. \nBut the Trust Fund is simply a claim on the U.S. Treasury. Future \ntaxpayers--our children, our grandchildren, even our great \ngrandchildren--will have to pay off this debt. Even so, the Trust Fund \nwill be empty in 2032, and Social Security can pay only 75 percent of \nbenefits from annual revenues.\n  Worse yet, the President has proposed to add even more debt to the \nTrust Fund. Although the President claims his plan would extend \nsolvency to 2050, in fact the President would simply commit another $24 \ntrillion of future Federal budgets to Social Security. David Walker, \nhead of the General Accounting Office, delivered this stark assessment \nof President's proposal at a February 9th Finance Committee hearing: \n``It would be tragic indeed if [the president's] proposal, through its \nbudgetary accounting complexity, masked the urgency of the Social \nSecurity solvency problem and served to delay much-needed action.''\n  Most traditional fixes won't work, either. Social Security has faced \nfinancial crises before--in 1977 and again in 1983. Both times, the \nbiggest part of the solution was a hike in payroll taxes. The result? \nToday, 80 percent of American families pay more in payroll taxes than \nincome taxes (with the employer share factored in). And let's remember, \nSocial Security taxes are on the first dollar of income--no deductions, \nno exemptions.\n  Mr. President, there is broad bipartisan agreement that there may be \nanother way to preserve and protect Social Security benefits--personal \nretirement accounts. While proposals differ, personal retirement \naccounts would provide each working American with an investment account \nhe or she owns. With even conservative investment in stocks and bonds \nand the power of compound interest, personal retirement accounts can \nprovide a substantial retirement nest egg.\n  As Senator Pat Moynihan, my colleague on the Senate Finance \nCommittee, has pointed out, with annual deposits equal to just 2 \npercentage points of the current payroll tax, ``A worker who spent 45 \nyears with the Bethlehem Steel Company could easily find himself with \nan estate of half a million dollars. The worker could pass on that \nwealth to his or her heirs.''\n\n  How remarkable!\n  Personal retirement accounts embody other enduring American values as \nwell. Creating these accounts would give the majority of Americans who \ndo not own any investment assets a new stake in America's economic \ngrowth--because that growth will be returned directly to their benefit. \nMore Americans will be the owners of capital--not just workers.\n  Creating these accounts may encourage Americans to save more. Today, \nAmericans save less than people in most countries, and even this low \nsavings rate has declined in recent years. Personal retirement accounts \nwill demonstrate how even small personal savings grow significantly \nover time.\n  Creating these accounts will help Americans to better prepare for \nretirement. According to one estimate, 60 percent of Americans are not \nactively participating in a retirement program other than Social \nSecurity. Indeed, most Americans have little idea of what they will \nneed in order to retire when and how they want. Personal retirement \naccounts can help Americans--particularly Baby Boomers--better \nunderstand retirement planning.\n  And these accounts may point the way to a more flexible Social \nSecurity program. Today, Social Security is a ``one-size-fits-all'' \nprogram. People receive a fixed benefit based on earnings and the \nnumber of years worked, with the earliest benefits available at age 62. \nBut if an individual takes early retirement but still wants to work, \nSocial Security cuts his or her benefits. Personal accounts can be \ncrafted to give individuals more control over retirement decisions, and \neliminate the penalty for working.\n  Setting up a personal retirement accounts program will be a big job. \nWho will hold, manage, and invest the accounts? How much will it cost \nto run the program? What kinds of investment choices should be allowed? \nHow to finance the accounts? The White House Conference should tackle \neach of these issues. Fortunately, there are proven models, such as the \nFederal Thrift Savings Plan, a pension savings and investment plan for \nFederal employees.\n  Indeed, I have introduced legislation, S. 263, the Personal \nRetirement Accounts Act of 1999, that would get accounts up and running \nwith a portion of the budget surplus to answer just these questions.\n  Mr. President, personal retirement accounts have one other big \npromise. Poll after poll find that Social Security is the most popular \nFederal government program, deservedly so. But the same polls also show \nthat many Americans, particularly young Americans, doubt they will \nreceive benefits when they retire. Personal retirement accounts can \nprovide the accountability and assurances that Americans are asking \nfor, and restore the confidence of the American people in Social \nSecurity.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senator from\n\n[[Page S3184]]\n\nArizona, Senator McCain, be added as a cosponsor of the Abraham \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I want to start by commending the \ndistinguished chairman of the Budget Committee for his outstanding work \nin producing this budget. He has been such a leader in fiscal \nresponsibility. Once again he has done an outstanding job in crafting \nthis budget resolution. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the amendment \noffered by my friend and colleague from Michigan, Senator Abraham. This \namendment would preserve and protect Social Security. I also commend \nSenator Domenici for his very innovative work in crafting this very \nimportant amendment.\n  President Clinton has proposed devoting 62 percent of the surplus \nover the next 15 years to shoring up Social Security. On the surface, \nthat sounds good. After all, we are all committed to protecting Social \nSecurity. But let's take a closer look at the President's proposal.\n  On closer examination, the President's plan is nothing but a shell \ngame. First, he devotes to the Social Security trust fund trust fund \npayroll taxes that already belong to Social Security. Then he lends \nthis money to the Federal Government for new programs. The bottom line \nis that instead of preserving the money for Social Security, President \nClinton actually ends up spending $158 billion of Social Security's \nmoney for programs completely unrelated to Social Security. Both the \nGeneral Accounting Office and the Congressional Budget Office have \npointed out the double counting and the other significant flaws in the \nPresident's proposal.\n  Social Security is currently running a surplus because the program is \ntaking in more in payroll taxes than it is paying out in benefits. But, \nas the Presiding Officer well knows, this will not always be the case.\n  In 2013, payroll taxes will not be sufficient to pay benefits and the \nSocial Security program will either have to raise taxes, cut spending, \ngo further into debt, or use more general fund money, if we are to \ncontinue to meet our full obligation to Social Security beneficiaries. \nBy the year 2030, the trust fund will be completely exhausted if we do \nnot take steps to save the program. We certainly, given this dire \npicture, cannot afford to squander the Social Security surpluses by \nspending them on other programs.\n  The current Social Security surplus conceals the true picture of our \nnational budget. But for the temporary Social Security surplus, the \nFederal Government would actually be running a $6 billion deficit this \nyear. I want to repeat that. There is a lot of misunderstanding. A lot \nof people think that we actually have a surplus in this upcoming year. \nThe fact is, the surplus is due entirely to the surplus in the Social \nSecurity trust fund. If we take out the Social Security surplus, we \nwould in fact be running a $6 billion deficit.\n  The fact is, there is no real surplus in fiscal year 2000. We do not \nstart to see real surpluses in the rest of the Government programs \nuntil the fiscal year 2001.\n  The amendment that I have cosponsored, which is before us today, \nexpresses the sense of the Senate that we pass legislation that would \nlock in Social Security surpluses by mandating that trust fund dollars \ncould be spent only for the payment of Social Security benefits for \nSocial Security reform or to pay down our national debt. Under this \nlockbox proposal, Social Security funds could not be spent on non-\nSocial Security programs. They also could not be used to finance tax \ncuts.\n  This legislation would establish in law a declining limit on the \nlevel of debt held by the public. These limits would decline in 2-year \nintervals by an amount equal to the Social Security trust fund \nsurpluses for those years. Under this proposal, trust fund balances \ncould be used to retire the debt, but not for new spending on programs \nunrelated to Social Security. The result of this innovative program is \nthat public debt would decline by $417 billion. That is 32 percent more \nthan it would under the President's proposal.\n  Mr. President, in 1998 alone, the Federal Government spent nearly \n$162 billion to make interest payments on our national debt. That \namounts to more than 6.7 percent of total Federal spending. In passing \nthis important legislation, we would free up this money that otherwise \nwould have to be spent on interest payments on our national debt.\n  This amendment clearly affirms our commitment to preserving and \nprotecting Social Security. It safeguards the Social Security trust \nfund from spending raids. It reduces our public debt. It lowers our \ninterest payments.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this very \nimportant initiative.\n  Once again, I commend the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Abraham, and the \nSenator from New Mexico, Mr. Domenici, for their innovative approach in \ncoming up with a program that will truly protect our Social Security \nsurpluses.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I will be offering an amendment. Have we dealt with \nthe amendment of the Senator from Minnesota? I ask unanimous consent \nthat the amendment be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CRAPO. Reserving the right to object, I want to speak briefly on \nthat amendment before we lay it aside, if possible, or can we come back \nto it?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my good friends, \nSenators Abraham, Domenici, and Ashcroft, in supporting this amendment. \nI appreciate the courtesy allowing me to make these remarks before we \nset the amendment aside.\n  I particularly thank Senator Domenici for putting together a well-\ncrafted budget that achieves the important principles of protecting \nSocial Security, paying down the debt, and staying within the budget \ncaps.\n  I have a very specific interest in the lockbox legislation that is \nbeing proposed, because over the last 6 years as I served in the House \nof Representatives, I advocated a lockbox concept which was, at that \ntime, focused on taking the spending we save through budget battles and \nlocking it away for paying down the national debt or reducing the \ndeficit at that point in time, rather than allowing it to be spent on \nfurther Federal spending.\n  This lockbox legislation which I worked on in the House for the last \n5 or 6 years passed the House four times, never to make it through the \nSenate or signed into law. So it is particularly pleasing to me to see \nthe concept now being used as we move into a surplus environment in our \nbudget process to allow us to lock away the Social Security surpluses \nand make sure that Congress does not continue the practices of the past \nin spending those surpluses on other Federal spending.\n  This amendment which is being discussed in this proposal recommends \nlocking the Social Security surpluses by requiring that they are to be \nused to pay down the public debt, rather than allowing Congress to \ncontinue to spend those funds elsewhere. It is no different from what \nshould happen under current practices when the entire Government runs a \ntotal surplus, but there is no mechanism to lock these funds away and \nprevent Congress from spending them.\n  Social Security surpluses help to pay for the rest of Government when \nit runs a deficit. Starting in 2001, it is expected that the Federal \nGovernment will run surpluses in the rest of the Government and will \nnot rely on Social Security surpluses.\n  The amendment recommends establishing a declining limit on the level \nof debt held by the public. These limits would decline in 2-year \nintervals by the amount equal to the Social Security trust fund \nsurpluses for those years, and those declining limits would dedicate \nSocial Security surpluses to reducing the public debt, thereby not only \nreducing our debt but strengthening and stabilizing the Social Security \ntrust funds at the same time.\n  The amendment also recommends establishing a 60-vote point of order\n\n[[Page S3185]]\n\nagainst any legislation which results in the public debt limits \nspecified in the law being exceeded.\n\n  This amendment reaffirms the off-budget treatment of Social Security \nand prohibits the inclusion of Social Security funds in budget totals.\n  A point I think that needs to be made is this: Today, across America, \nyou hear many, many people calling for us to strengthen and protect \nSocial Security. There are lots of different ideas being discussed \nabout how we should accomplish that, but this proposed amendment does \nwhat everyone else is talking about. It makes it absolutely clear that \nthose Social Security trust fund dollars will be set aside, they will \nbe locked up, so they can be used for nothing other than reducing the \npublic debt or funding a Social Security reform piece of legislation.\n  I do not see how anyone who professes to support stabilizing and \nstrengthening our Social Security system cannot support this amendment. \nIt is time we put into effect a lockbox mechanism to assure that \nneither this Congress, nor future Congresses, can take the Social \nSecurity trust funds and use them for any purposes other than that for \nwhich they were intended.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Does the Senator from Illinois want to respond to \nthis amendment?\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, yes, I would like to speak to Senator \nAbraham's amendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I will be happy, Mr. President, to yield to the \nSenator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of Senator Abraham's \namendment to ban our Government from continuing to plunder the Social \nSecurity trust funds. For many years, our Government has taken all of \nthe money that goes into the Social Security trust funds, taken every \ncent and spent it on other programs. The fact of the matter is, there \nis now no money in the Social Security trust fund. There is just a pile \nof IOUs, and those IOUs do our country no good when we hit 2013 and \nSocial Security taxes are insufficient to pay current benefits.\n  Come 2013, no matter what the balance of IOUs is in the Social \nSecurity trust fund, we are either going to have to cut benefits or \nraise taxes or dramatically increase our Government's borrowings in \norder to pay Social Security benefits. I applaud Senator Domenici, \nSenator Abraham, and those who are working to ban our Government from \nplundering the Social Security trust fund.\n  I want to show the Senate what the President's budget projections are \nfor the next few years and to raise some questions about those \nprojections.\n  The President claims the budget will be in surplus through the year \n2004 and is suggesting in the current fiscal year we will have a $79.3 \nbillion surplus; next year, $117 billion; rising to a surplus of $207 \nbillion in 2004.\n  There is a problem with this. As some may have noticed, our national \ndebt is continuing to grow despite these proposed budget surpluses. In \nfact, if you look at the appendix to President Clinton's budget, which \nhe claims is going to be in surplus from now until 2004, if you look in \nthe back, you will find that our national debt is going to continue to \nrise.\n\n  I ask the Members of this body, Does it make any sense for our \nnational debt to continue to rise when we have surpluses? How can our \nnational debt rise if we have surpluses? Well, the answer to that \nquestion is, we do not really have surpluses. They are borrowing all of \nthis money from the Social Security trust fund.\n  If you look back in history, we have borrowed $1.67 trillion from \nGovernment trust funds. And to date, as of the end of the last fiscal \nyear, our Government had borrowed $730 billion from the Social Security \ntrust fund. All that money that people all across the country have been \npaying for years in Social Security taxes, they knew some of it was \ngoing out to pay current benefits, but they also thought some of it was \nbeing set aside in a trust fund.\n  It turns out they have plundered that trust fund. There is no money \nin it except a bunch of IOUs. And when we borrow from these trust \nfunds, it gets added to our national debt. So right now, people in this \ncountry are being told that we are running surpluses, but what they are \nnot being told is that we are continuing to borrow from Social Security \nand other trust funds and that we are digging our hole deeper. We are \nmaking the national debt worse.\n  These are the amounts the President proposes to continue borrowing \nfrom the Social Security trust fund in his budget which makes \nprojections out through 2004. This year he proposes borrowing $121 \nbillion from the Social Security trust fund and $67 billion from other \ntrust funds. That is the source of the surplus they have. But when you \ntake that out, if you had an honest accounting, if the Government were \nnot allowed to use deceptive accounting practices, it would be forced \nto show that, in fact, there is an ongoing deficit.\n  In any case, I applaud Senator Abraham. He is absolutely on the right \ntrack. We need to protect the Social Security trust fund. That Social \nSecurity trust fund lockbox idea that Senator Domenici has worked on \nwith many others is worthy of our pursuit. This is the only plan out \nthere that will protect 100 percent of the Social Security trust fund.\n  I come from a banking background. For many years I worked in banking \nin my home State of Illinois. There is nothing more abhorrent to me \nthan the notion of a trust fund being managed by the Government that is \nbeing raided by the Government. In our law in the private sector, the \nhighest burden is imposed upon those who manage trust funds. Anybody \nwho plundered a trust fund in the private sector would be sent off to \nprison. Any private employer in the United States who reached into \ntheir employees' pension fund and took all that money out and spent it \non other programs would, under Congress' own laws, go to jail.\n  It is high time that Congress stop itself from raiding the Nation's \npension funds, from raiding Social Security, and instead try to save \nthe money that is going in there; do not spend it on other programs; do \nnot touch it but treat it like a real trust fund. And I am delighted \nthat we have made this effort. I think it will be a great fundamental \nbreakthrough.\n  I applaud Senator Domenici and look forward to working with the rest \nof the Members of the Senate to achieve this very important goal.\n\n  Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). Who yields time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we are going to offer an amendment, \nand we had worked out an understanding, one where we would have two \nMembers on the Democrat side with an opportunity to speak. I expect to \nhear from Senator Durbin after I am done.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask the Senator, are you going to offer an amendment \nwhile this amendment is still pending?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We will set this aside. I ask----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder if you could tell us, if we leave things like \nthey are, there is about how much time left on this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 21 minutes 10 seconds. The \nSenator from New Jersey has 45 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Forty-five minutes on----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. This amendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We looked at the amendment. I have not worked out an \nunderstanding yet. Why don't we take a couple minutes to see what we \nhave there so we can be responsive. Is the debate wrapped up on your \nside?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. One more Senator wants to make brief comments, but that \nwill be brief.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Is that Senator here now?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am willing to set it aside. I just wanted to see if \nwe could understand how much time was still on it when we got back to \nit. But we can resolve that later.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I assume this is working off a 2-hour \nor 1-hour----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. First-degree amendments are covered by 2 \nhours.\n\n[[Page S3186]]\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Two hours. All right.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we lay aside the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to speak before I offer my \namendment, so I ask my time be taken off the bill itself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank you, Mr. President.\n  I want to try to organize a point of view here that is substantially \ndifferent than we have heard for the past while, and I say that with \nall due respect to my colleagues. And I mean that sincerely.\n  We have developed in the Budget Committee, I think, an operating mode \nthat says that everybody, every member of that committee, is entitled \nto respect for their point of view, with adequate time to discuss it. I \nhave served on that committee for many years, and I think it is perhaps \nthe most amiable, the most cooperative operation of the Budget \nCommittee that I have seen. I commend the chairman, Senator Domenici, \nfor his effort.\n  We have struck an agreement, kind of informally, about it, but it has \nworked. And we disagree sharply on points of view. And sometimes, as \nSenator Domenici has said, our faces get red. But he was warned, he \ntold me, that red faces do not win amendments or win points of view. So \nwe kind of dropped the red-face approach, the swollen veins, that kind \nof thing.\n  But here I will venture a little bit into dangerous territory, \nbecause what we have heard so far is the accusation of double counting \nand talking about the structure, not the significance, not the meaning, \nnot the value of the program, but whether or not this counts doubly \nwhen we credit Social Security or credit Medicare by giving them \nGovernment IOUs. The U.S. Government IOUs have the full faith and \ncredit of the U.S. Government.\n  I do not know where it is better, because I have met lots of people \nwho have made lots of money. I was in the business world for years \nbefore I came to the Senate. I ran a big company, and a lot of the \npeople I know who got surpluses, significant surpluses, invested them \nin Government bonds because they wanted to know that a certain part of \ntheir portfolios are protected by the full faith and credit of the U.S. \nGovernment.\n  So even though interest rates are lower than you might normally get, \nthat is the reserve, the kitty, as we call it sometimes, that they can \nalways count on, no matter what happens with the stock market. So I do \nnot know why it is such a sin to say to the Medicare trust fund or the \nSocial Security trust fund, ``Hey, invest your money in Government \nIOUs,'' because they are protected--first line--by the full faith and \ncredit of the U.S. Government.\n  To me, it makes sense, because to have the money lie there, funds lie \nthere fallow, without gathering interest or return on the funds, \ndepreciates the amount of spending that can be offered to beneficiaries \nin the later years.\n  I don't understand some of the scorn with which Government IOUs are \ntreated. It doesn't make sense to me. I know and meet rich folks who \nkeep much of their money in the U.S. Government IOUs.\n  In order to make the argument, there are some negatives applied with \nreference to those who made money paying the biggest taxes. If we have \na tax reduction of 10 percent, why shouldn't the people who make all \nthat money get a commensurate reduction, an equal reduction?\n  I want to confirm something because there is a question raised about \nwhether a 10-percent tax cut is really there by direction of the Budget \nCommittee. It certainly is not, because the Budget Committee doesn't \nhave the right to do that; the Finance Committee does. And the chairman \nof the Finance Committee, the distinguished Senator from Delaware, Mr. \nRoth, told Reuters that he was very much in favor of using the bigger-\nthan-expected budget surplus to fund across-the-board income tax of 10 \npercent or more.\n  He goes on to say, ``I don't think it's too big [the 10 percent \nincome tax cut]; if anything, I would like to see it bigger.''\n  That says something about someone of influence in the Republican \nParty and in this Senate. Again, he is a very distinguished Senator, \nlong-serving Senator, and chairman of the Finance Committee. He is \nprobably the most powerful Chair position that we have in the Senate.\n  He said it, 10 percent.\n  Now, back to where we were. Someone who earns an average of $800,000 \na year, the top 1 percent of the income earners in the country, would \nget $20,000; and someone who earns $38,000 would get $99. The sarcastic \nor the sardonic tone that was used was if they made more, why shouldn't \nthey get more? The difference is that when someone has earned $800,000, \nthey don't need the $20,000 as much as the person who is making $38,000 \nor $39,000 needs some relief. Any family that has a $38,000-a-year \nincome is not looking at luxury. They are not looking for a tax cut so \nthey can buy a car or a boat.\n\n  I have heard it said that a rising tide lifts all boats. I know if \nyou want to buy an expensive yacht, one that is over 100 feet long, the \ntypical wait is 2 to 3 years. If someone has to wait 2 or 3 years to \nbuy a yacht, I assure you that is quite a different position than \nsomeone who is making $700 or $800 a week supporting a family of four, \ntrying to make sure that the kids can get an education, make sure there \nis a roof over their heads, and a decent homelife so they can enjoy \nsome degree of the comforts of life. They can use the tax cuts.\n  Boy, I am for it 100 percent--targeted tax cuts to people who work \nhard and who need the money. I approve of the tax cuts that would \nsupport long-term care. I approve of the tax cuts that would support \nchild care for modest-income people. Those are the kinds of tax cuts \nthat distinguish this side of the aisle, the Democrats, from those on \nthat side of the aisle.\n  I heard someone say something that struck me as being rather \namusing--that the Democrats are the ones with the personal money. Some \nhave it and some don't. That is true on both sides of the aisle. I am \ntrying to think it through, but those I know who have worked hard to \nmake their fortune earn respect for having done that, whether they are \nRepublicans or Democrats. Some Members who didn't work hard but have \nmoney anyway are also decent people. It doesn't matter how much money \nyou have; it is how much you have in your heart.\n  I come from a poor family, a family that hardly ever had a dinner \ntogether because we were always working in the store; one of us would \nbe standing while the others were sitting and eating.\n  I have an understanding of what poverty or small incomes mean. I \nalways thought that a good idea for incoming Senators and \nCongresspeople would be to spend a month or two in poverty, live in the \nkind of circumstances that we see in our cities and our rural \ncommunities. Live where you don't know what kind of food you will be \nable to give your children. Live where you don't know whether you will \nbe dispossessed because you haven't paid the rent, and live where the \nbest fun a child can have is to play ball in the street. We need a \nsprinkling of that in this place to bring an element of reality about \nwhat life is about and not talk about tax cuts for the rich in the same \nterms that we discuss tax cuts for hard-working people who need a \nlittle help with long-term care for a sick relative or an elderly \nparent. It is quite a different thing when we discuss things from that \npoint of view.\n  The thing that matters most to modest-income people who have worked \nhard all their lives is to save Social Security. Turn the promise into \nreality, the promise that was made in 1935 when Social Security was \nconceived, the program that was conceived that said to people, work as \nhard as you can. Whether you work for a company and you lose your job \nalong the way or you don't lose your job, Social Security is there for \nyou. Full faith and credit of the U.S. Government will pay for it.\n  One of the worst afflictions we have in our society today, one of the \nworries we have, is that people are afraid they will lose their health \ninsurance. It was said by one of my colleagues before, over 40 million \npeople in this country are without health insurance. It is a \ndevastating thought--the prospect of someone getting sick and not being\n\n[[Page S3187]]\n\nable to maintain their health care coverage, watching not only their \nhealth go down the drain but their finances as well.\n\n  We have an obligation, I think, to make sure that every one of our \ncitizens in this country has a chance at some kind of minimum health \ncare, so they don't have to worry about going bankrupt if they run into \nan illness along the way.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 144\n\n(Purpose: To ensure that Congress saves Social Security and strengthens \n Medicare before using projected budget surpluses for new spending or \n                              tax breaks)\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk, and I \nask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 144.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following new section:\n\n     SEC. ____. SAVING SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE FIRST.\n\n       (a) In General.--It shall not be in order in the Senate to \n     consider--\n       (1) any bill, resolution, motion, amendment, or conference \n     report that would reduce revenues without offsetting them in \n     accordance with the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 until \n     Congress first enacts legislation that--\n       (A) ensures the long-term fiscal solvency of the Social \n     Security Trust Funds and extends the solvency of the Medicare \n     Hospital Insurance Trust Fund by at least 12 years; and\n       (B) includes a certification that the legislation complies \n     with subparagraph (A); or\n       (2) any bill, resolution, motion, amendment, or conference \n     report that would increase spending above the levels provided \n     in this resolution, unless such spending increases are offset \n     in accordance with the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 until \n     Congress first enacts legislation that--\n       (A) ensures the long-term fiscal solvency of the Social \n     Security Trust Funds and extends the solvency of the Medicare \n     Hospital Insurance Trust Fund by at least 12 years; and\n       (B) includes a certification that the legislation complies \n     with subparagraph (A).\n       (b) Supermajority Waiver.--\n       (1) Waiver.--The point of order in subsection (a) may be \n     waived or suspended only by the affirmative vote of three-\n     fifths of the Members, duly chosen and sworn.\n       (2) Appeals.--An affirmative vote of three-fifths of the \n     Members, duly chosen and sworn, shall be required to sustain \n     an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a point of order \n     raised under subsection (a).\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this amendment stands for the \nproposition that before we spend a penny of any surplus we ought to \nwork hard to save Social Security and Medicare. That is what our \nprimary obligation ought to be.\n  This amendment would make it out of order to consider any new \nspending or revenue reductions before we have enacted legislation to \nensure the long-term solvency of Social Security, and to extend the \nsolvency of the Medicare hospital insurance trust fund by at least 12 \nyears.\n  It has been said by our friends on the other side that we don't add a \npenny. Well, it is not so. We can disagree. I wouldn't call my friends \non the other side dishonest if they disagree with me. I don't like it \nwhen we are called dishonest or deceptive or that the President of the \nUnited States is lying when he lays down a budget.\n  You can argue this thing from all sides of the discussion. Some think \nthat OMB has a more reliable forecasting ability; some think CBO. We \nare obliged to respond to our needs by using CBO as a reference. The \nfact of the matter is, if there is a difference, it is not because \nsomeone is trying to cheat here or someone is being dishonest; it is a \ndifference of view. Let the public hear it. Let the public listen to \nthis debate.\n  As I look at things now, times are good today, but we still face \ntremendous long-term challenges. This is the time to deal with those \nchallenges. We don't know how much of projected surpluses we will need. \nThe Social Security trust fund is projected to become insolvent in \n2032, and I don't hear many arguments about that.\n  At that point, revenues will only be sufficient to fund about three-\nquarters of the benefits that were initially promised. Mr. President, \n2032 is not a long time in the scheme of things. It is long when you \nhave as much white hair as I have, or as much as the chairman has, but \nit is only three decades away. Relatively small changes today can have \na significant impact in the long run. If we wait too long, the changes \nnecessary to establish long-term solvency may be too wrenching and too \ndifficult to accomplish.\n  Meanwhile, Mr. President, Medicare's problems are even more urgent. \nThe program's trust fund faces insolvency in 2008. That is not a long \ntime away. We can't afford to wait much longer before we act to extend \nits life and to make those changes that would prolong the life of \nMedicare beyond even 2020, which we are trying to establish here.\n  This amendment simply asks the Senate to set its priorities straight. \nIt says our first priority should be to save Social Security and \nMedicare. It says before we squander surpluses on new initiatives, on \nmajor tax cuts, let's do first things first and prepare for the future, \nbecause the retirement of millions of baby boomers and other younger \nAmericans depends upon it. Once we have protected Social Security and \nMedicare, we can consider using any remaining surpluses for other \npurposes.\n  Mr. President, I want to be clear that this is not an anti-tax-cut \namendment. Like the President, I strongly support targeted tax relief \nfor middle-class families. I hope we are going to approve the child \ncare and long-term tax credits that the President proposed, along with \nfurther tax cuts to promote savings. Nothing in this amendment would \nblock those or any other tax cuts. The amendment simply says that \nbefore we use any of the surpluses--and I have to take one moment to \nremind everybody about where we were and where we are. In 1992, when \nPresident Clinton won the election, we were $290 billion in annual \ndebt. Despite the optimistic forecasts of some, nobody really who \nthought a lot about the budget a year or two ago would have thought \nthey would be looking at a potential budget surplus of over $100 \nbillion in this year--$100 billion.\n\n  So I want to give credit where it is due. I don't always agree with \nthe President. I don't agree, necessarily, with some of the budget \nproposals that his budget laid out before us. We voted against it in \nthe Budget Committee. But the fact of the matter is, yes, with the work \nof people like Senator Domenici and others on the Republican side, as \nwell as those of us on the Democratic side, we worked together in 1997, \nas I think we had never done before--at least in my memory here--to get \na balanced budget in front of us, to get our fiscal house in order. It \nwas a tremendous accomplishment. It is reflected in the confidence that \npeople have in our stock markets and in investments in the country.\n  Mr. President, we can pass all kinds of tax cuts, but we must \nremember that all of these things come in priority order. This \namendment, again, says before we use our surpluses, we should save \nSocial Security and Medicare. So Congress can still pass as many tax \ncuts as it wants, even before we address those long-term problems--we \nwould just have to pay for them--just so we don't use up projected \nsurpluses. That should help give us the incentives we need to get the \njob done.\n  I also point out, Mr. President, that this amendment applies not just \nto tax cuts but also to new spending. We should not go on any big \nspending binges, even for worthy causes, until we know we have saved \nSocial Security and Medicare. That is done in a prospective manner. It \nis a point in time when we can say with a degree of confidence that \nthis is going to take care of the elongation of the life of Medicare; \nthis is going to take care of the solvency of the Social Security \nprogram until 2075. That is what we want to do. We want to know that \nthose things are accomplished, and it doesn't matter whether the \nspending on top of that is pursued through direct appropriations or \nthrough the Tax Code.\n  So, Mr. President, this amendment says let's keep our focus on the \nfuture, let's keep our priorities straight, let's save Social Security \nand Medicare first--that we do that before we pass either new spending \nor tax cuts that use projected budget surpluses. I hope we can assemble \na point of view that constitutes agreement in that direction, and that \nwe will join together and\n\n[[Page S3188]]\n\nget enough votes from our friends on the other side of the aisle. I \nhope we can do it.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Yes, I am delighted to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I found the presentation interesting. I ask the Senator \nfrom New Jersey, is it not the case that both of the proposals, the one \nfrom the majority side and the one from the minority side, coming from \nthe Budget Committee, save all of the Social Security surplus, but the \nmajor difference is that the proposal offered by the Senator from New \nJersey also proposes to move some resources to help deal with the \nMedicare issue?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. That is right.\n  Mr. DORGAN. As I ask that question, I intend to come to the floor \nfollowing the Senator from Illinois and make a presentation on this \nissue of saving Social Security. I can recall a few years ago when \ndozens of people on the floor stood up and said that proposition is \nnothing but a gimmick. In fact, the proposal was to put in the \nConstitution a requirement that the Social Security revenues be \nconsidered part of ordinary revenues for the purpose of determining \nwhether or not you have a budget surplus. I will come to the floor to \ntalk about that.\n\n  I just say I am delighted that everybody apparently has now come to \nthe same position on this question of whether we ought to save the \nSocial Security surpluses for the purpose which they were intended in \nthe first instance. But those of us who insisted that be done, against \nthe wishes of those who wanted to put that practice in the Constitution \nabout 3 or 4 years ago, were told our position was gimmickry.\n  It not only was not gimmickry, it was transcendental truth about what \nwe ought to do with these resources. The Senator has it right, as does \nnow the Senator from New Mexico: Let us save the Social Security \nsurplus, but let us at the same time allow room, as the Senator from \nNew Jersey does, to invest and strengthen Medicare at the same time. \nThat is, I think, the purpose of the alternative offered by the Senator \nfrom New Jersey, which I think should commend it here to the Senate.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank my friend from North Dakota.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor. There is an \nunderstanding--just to confirm it--that the next speaker will also be \nfrom this side of the aisle. I assume the Senator from Illinois would \nhave our amendment laid aside. Is that the idea?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe laid aside and I be allowed to address the bill.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I didn't hear the request.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I asked that the amendment be laid aside for the purpose \nof a statement in support of the bill.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Of course.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the ranking Democrat on the \ncommittee, Senator Lautenberg from New Jersey, for his leadership. I \nalso thank Senator Domenici for his leadership. We have disagreed, and \nin the course of my speech you will hear our areas of disagreement. My \nrespect for him has not been diminished by those disagreements, and I \ncontinue to believe he is making a good-faith effort, as we all are, to \ncome up with a responsible way to deal with our Federal budget in this \nchallenging year. Oh, what a different challenge it is.\n  It was only 2 years ago on the floor of the Senate, we must recall, \nthat we initiated the session by Senator Orrin Hatch, chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, coming to the floor and stacking up over the top \nof his head all of the deficit-ridden budgets of the last 30 years. He \npointed scornfully at these budgets and said, ``This Congress cannot \ncontain itself and control its spending, and only with a constitutional \namendment, the balanced budget amendment, giving to Federal judges and \nthe courts the authority to stop Congress from spending, can we ever \nhope to reach the day where we will put deficits behind us and live in \nthat wonderful land of milk and honey called surplus.''\n  Well, here we are 24 months later with no constitutional amendment, \nno balanced budget amendment, no new authority in the Federal courts to \nrestrain congressional spending, and we are debating a surplus. Now, I \nwill concede, as my colleague from Illinois mentioned earlier, that the \nsurplus in the initial years we are discussing is a surplus in trust \nfunds, particularly the Social Security trust fund.\n  What that means, of course, is that employers and employees across \nAmerica are paying more into the Social Security program than is needed \nto pay out to the beneficiaries. The excess is being saved for the \neventuality that people like myself--the baby boomer generation--will \nlive long enough to go to the Social Security window and pick up a \ncheck. We want to make sure there is some money there not only for \nourselves but for others. The question is, What to do with the \nremainder of the surplus? If we are going to dedicate 62 percent of any \nsurplus in the future to the Social Security trust fund, what will we \ndo with the rest?\n  That is what this budget resolution debate is all about, because it \ncomes down to some very basic choices. As a family's budget is a series \nof choices, so the Nation's budget is a series of choices. The choices \nthat have been made by the Republican majority in presenting their \nbudget resolution are different than those of us on the Democratic \nside. We believe, as they do, that at least 62 percent of all of the \nsurpluses in the near future should be dedicated to making sure that \nSocial Security is solvent. Not good enough that the program will be \nsolvent until the year 2032. We want to have an extended life beyond \nthat.\n  Then we get into our areas of controversy--a significant controversy \nfor American families--because we believe on the Democratic side that \n15 percent of any surpluses should then be dedicated to reducing the \ndebt in Medicare, the health insurance program for the aged and \ndisabled, a program that is literally a lifeline--for 40 million \nAmericans will go broke in the year 2008 if Congress does not act. The \nDemocrats believe that we need to commit ourselves to Medicare solvency \nand, therefore, we seek in our budget resolution to dedicate 15 percent \nof future surpluses to Medicare.\n  On the other side of the ledger is a stark contrast, because the \nRepublican budget resolution does not dedicate one penny--not one \npenny--to Medicare. Instead, they want the money to go toward tax cuts. \nThere can't be two more appealing words in the English language for a \npolitician to utter than ``tax cuts.'' To think that you could stand \nbefore an audience and say to them, ``We are going to let you keep more \nof your money, the Government won't take it,'' is appealing.\n  I suppose we on the Democratic side could join in that chorus, but we \ndon't believe that is a responsible course of action. We believe that \nwe have an obligation to Medicare to make certain that its future is \nstrong and is right. Before we suggest a tax cut of any magnitude to \nany person in America, first we must meet our responsibilities. The \ngood part of meeting our responsibility is that we not only guarantee \nthe future solvency of Medicare but at the same time we pay down the \nnational debt.\n  Arranged before me here on the Senate floor are Senate pages, young \npeople from high school who come here and work in the Senate, and do a \ngreat job. I am glad they are here. I am sure they are hoping that some \nof the laws that we will pass will make America a better place for them \nto live. This is a law which I think addresses the concern that they \nmay not have today but they might in the future.\n  If we have our way, in the Democrat budget resolution, we will start \nreducing the national debt that we have to pay interest on every year. \nHow much is the interest payment this year on the national debt? It is \nabout $1 billion a day, $355 billion that we are paying with Federal \ntax dollars each year to service the national debt that has been \naccumulated over the history of the United States.\n\n  We believe on the Democratic side that we should set on a course of \naction dedicating money to Social Security and Medicare at the same \ntime bringing down that national debt, so that we can see in the \nlifetime of the young people who serve as pages here a\n\n[[Page S3189]]\n\ndramatic decline in the annual interest cost to the Federal Government. \nWhat it means for their generation is more money available, either for \ntax cuts or for programs they think are important for the future of \nthis country. But we hope to give them that choice.\n  On the other side of the aisle, the Republican budget resolution \nsays: ``No. Let's not save the money. Let's not put the money in \nMedicare. Let's give it away as tax cuts.''\n  In fairness to the chairman of the Budget Committee, he has not \nspecified what kind of tax cut package he has in mind. Some Members of \nhis party have already expressed themselves. For example, the House \nBudget Committee chairman, Mr. Kasich of Ohio, has suggested a 10-\npercent across-the-board tax cut. I want the American people to \nunderstand what that tax cut means to them as opposed to the Democratic \nbudget which seeks to bring down the national debt and to make sure \nthat Medicare is well funded.\n  The Kasich tax cut, the 10-percent tax cut, would mean for 60 percent \nof American working families an average of $8.25 a month in tax cuts. \nThat is a lot of money to put away and to save up for a vacation. In \nall honesty, it is not enough money to pay for the cable TV bill. But \nthere are those who believe--as I mentioned, Mr. Kasich, proposals on \nthe Republican side--that is preferable, to give that sort of tax cut \nas opposed to putting the money into Medicare, as opposed to paying \ndown the national debt. I think they are wrong.\n  I think, if you look at the alternatives, it is very graphically \ndemonstrated that in this budget that we are presently considering--the \nRepublican budget--there will be some $831 billion in tax breaks, and \nnothing for Medicare; not a penny for Medicare. That, I think, is a \nserious mistake. It is a serious mistake, because, frankly, for 40 \nmillion Americans it results in some very, very grave decisions. Some \npeople say, ``Well, Medicare is just a program for the elderly.'' I \nknow better. I think most families do. It is not just for the elderly. \nIt is for the children and grandchildren of the elderly to have the \npeace of mind that their parents and grandparents are going to have \ngood, quality, affordable medical care. It meant a lot to my family, \nand I think it means a lot to families across America.\n  If we don't take the money that the Democrats propose in their budget \nresolution and put it into Medicare, I would suggest to you that the \nalternatives for that program are grim--cutting benefits for seniors, \nasking seniors and disabled Americans who are often on fixed incomes to \nshoulder substantially higher costs, significantly reducing payments to \nproviders, well below the cost of providing quality medical care, or \nincreasing payroll taxes. I don't want to be a party to that. I think \nthat is one of the most onerous taxes in America. If we don't face our \nobligation to make sure Medicare is sound, it could lead to increases \nin payroll taxes.\n  There was a question raised by some as to whether or not the \nDemocratic budget resolution will, in fact, do any good for Medicare. I \nhave in my hand here a letter that was sent to Members of Congress that \nis offered by the Department of Health and Human Services, Health Care \nFinancing Administration, which says quite clearly, yes, the Democratic \nbudget resolution is good for Medicare. It will make sure that Medicare \nremains solvent up to 10 years beyond the date that we currently see \nsolvency ending.\n\n  And, of course, if we face Medicare without these additional funds, \ntake a look at what it does. In the area of provider cuts, to extend \nMedicare to 2020 without new investment, as the Democrats propose, and \nwithout benefit cuts of payroll tax increases, we would have to cut \npayments to providers by 18 percent or more. That is a cut in the \nNation of $349 billion, and over 10 years in Illinois alone $14.3 \nbillion.\n  I contacted the Illinois hospital administrators a few years ago when \nwe were in the midst of the same debate, and said to the Illinois \nhospital administrators, if we have this kind of cut in Medicare \npayments, what will happen? For many of the hospitals dependent on \nMedicare--these are hospitals in rural areas, hospitals in the inner \ncity--they would face closure. It is just that serious. The Illinois \nHospital Health System Association tells me that even before the last \nround of cuts, 25 percent of Illinois hospitals were taking a loss on \ntheir in-patient Medicare costs.\n  If we don't act responsibly and adopt President Clinton's approach \nand the Democratic budget approach, if we don't put money in Medicare, \nhospitals all across America--in New Jersey, in New Mexico, in Maine, \nin States across America--are going to face the same kind of pressure.\n  Second, there are those who suggest let's put the burden of the cost \nof Medicare reform on the backs of the seniors and disabled. That might \nextend the solvency of Medicare, but at a very high cost. To date, on \naverage, seniors pay 19 percent of their income to purchase the health \ncare that they need. And Medicare is currently only paying half of \ntheir bills. Many seniors live on fixed incomes. The median total \nannual income of Americans over the age of 65 is a mere $16,000. And \nthat is hardly a huge sum of money for people to survive. For seniors \nover 85 it plummets to $11,251. For the oldest and frailest in America, \nsuch as those using home health services, the average income is less \nthan $9,000.\n\n  Can someone with this level of income really afford to pay more for \nMedicare so we can give tax cuts to some of the wealthiest people in \nthis country? I think that is really not fair. I think most Americans \nwould react the same: $8.25 in tax cuts for 60 percent of America's \nworking families, is that really a valid tradeoff if we are going to \nimpose greater burdens on seniors under the Medicare program?\n  Medicare reform may involve tough choices but it should not involve \nmean choices. Reform and investment are needed to strengthen Medicare. \nThere are those who say if you just put the money in Medicare as the \nDemocrats propose, they are just never going to reform the system. But \nthe reality is, the Medicare program has grown. The number of \nbeneficiaries has doubled since the program was created, and Americans \nare living longer. I think there is a fair argument to be made that one \nof the reasons Americans are living longer is because they now have \naccess to quality health care after retirement.\n  There was a day, and I can remember as a child, when grandparents \nmoved into the homes of your parents. It was expected. Then we tried to \nscrape up enough money to make sure medical bills were paid, and often \nthey were not. Those days are behind us because of Social Security and \nMedicare. Before Medicare, less than 50 percent of retirees had health \ninsurance. Now virtually every elderly American has health insurance.\n  So here is the priority question for us. How much do we value \nincreased life expectancy? How much do we value the independence of \nseniors who can live confident that they will receive quality health \ncare under Medicare? Are the people of my generation, who are working \nand contributing to the surplus, hopefully soon, willing to defer \ngratification of a tax cut of small magnitude to invest in a retirement \ninsurance program for 40 million Americans? I think they are. The \nchoice, of course, is whether or not we forgo the Republican tax cut \nand put the money into Medicare and reducing the national debt.\n  I would like to take that question to the American people by way of \nreferendum. I think I know what the answer is. It is not just a \nDemocratic idea. It was Alan Greenspan who came to Congress and said: \nSuppress the urge to cut taxes or to increase spending. You should, \ninstead, reduce the national debt, the debt that is taking so much \nmoney in interest service payments each year. It is sound economics and \nit is sound for this country.\n  We need the strength to address the needs of the Medicare program. \nChanges will have to be made. But none of the programs being considered \npresently by the bipartisan Medicare Commission really save much money \nin the short term. Some of the proposals, such as raising the age of \nretirement, ask beneficiaries to pay a lot more. They even eliminate \ngraduate medical education, so important to medical schools across \nAmerica. We need to make sure there is an infusion of money into \nMedicare now to keep it strong. It is very unwise to enact large\n\n[[Page S3190]]\n\ntax cuts, to commit to those tax cuts before we secure both Medicare \nand Social Security.\n  Let me say a word about one Medicare reform, too, that I have \naddressed in the past. I, for one, am opposed to the concept of raising \nthe eligibility age for Medicare. Some have suggested we raise it to \nthe age of 67 as a way of reforming Medicare. The reason for my \nopposition is personal and it is strong. I had a brother who retired \nfrom a well-paid job, working for a major company. He retired early. \nThey promised him a pension and health care benefits. He ran into some \nproblems with his health. He was required to have some major surgery \nand after his retirement with his company his plan canceled his health \ncare benefits. It was before he reached the age of 65. He literally, \nthen, had everything at risk in terms of his family's life savings and \nhis plans for retirement because he had no health insurance protection \nand had to wait until he reached the age of 65 to qualify for Medicare.\n\n  There are too many Americans falling into this trap. I do not want to \nsee us extend it. Instead, I think we need to have reforms in Medicare \nthat are sensible and we need to have a budget that is dedicated to \nmaking certain that the surplus that we have now and in the near future \nis really focused on reducing the national debt and focused, first and \nforemost, on strengthening Social Security and Medicare.\n  Ask the American people: Would you give up the tax cut proposed on \nthe Republican side of the aisle to guarantee that Medicare is going to \nbe solvent for 10 more years? That we will not have to close hospitals? \nThat we will not have to increase payroll taxes for Medicare? That we \nwill not have to slash benefits? I think the answer will come back \nresoundingly: Stick with the programs that are so critical to millions \nof Americans. Make certain the Democratic approach in the budget \nresolution is the one that finally succeeds.\n  We can put off this tax cut debate to a later time, and let's hope \nour economy continues to grow so we can consider it. But before we do \nit, the tax cuts, if any, should be targeted to those who really need \nthem, and we should make sure that Social Security and Medicare are \nstill our highest priority.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute. I just want to \nsay to Senator Durbin, I did not know my colleague before he came to \nthe Senate. Obviously, we do not agree on a lot of things. But I \ncompliment him on his participation. He had, I think, many things going \non, but he is a valued member of the committee and I think he lent some \nof that atmosphere, that we were all working very hard to get our job \ndone. It was about as good a 3 days as I have spent on committee work, \nand I thank the Senator for his share in that.\n  Mr. President, this consent agreement has been cleared on the \nminority side and on our side.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at 3 this afternoon, the Senate proceed \nto a vote on or in relation to the Abraham amendment No. 143, to be \nfollowed by a vote on or in relation to the Lautenberg amendment No. \n144, with the time between now and then equally divided in the usual \nform. Finally, I ask that no second-degree amendments be in order to \nthe amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  Would the Senator like to use part of this 22 minutes? The Senator is \nfree to speak on whatever he likes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, we have a magnificent contrast in \napproaches to the budget here this year, as we often have in the past.\n  The budget resolution that the Senator from New Mexico has presented \nto us is, in fact, a true balanced budget. The budget resolution \npresented to us by the President of the United States, in fact, spends \nmore than 20 percent of the Social Security surpluses over the next 5 \nyears on programs that are totally unrelated to Social Security.\n  The President has promised that all of the Social Security surpluses \nwill go into the Social Security system. In fact, his budget does not \nkeep that promise. The proposal before us from the Budget Committee and \nfrom the Senator from New Mexico does keep that promise and calls for \nthe creation of a lockbox that prevents the spending of Social Security \nmoney for other purposes and for other programs.\n  Secondly, we do face a crisis in Medicare. The Medicare Part A \nhospital insurance trust fund will, in fact, go bankrupt in the year \n2008, postponed by actions taken by the Congress just a year ago.\n\n  We have had as our creation a bipartisan Medicare Commission work on \nlong-term solutions for Medicare over the course of the last year. A \nmajority of the members of that Commission, but not a sufficient \nnumber, have voted for true reform in Medicare. That true reform has \nbeen blocked by the President who instead proposes simply a paper \ntransfer, which will literally paper over the serious problems that \nMedicare faces until they are far more serious than they are today and \nprovide a burden for our children and grandchildren that in all \nprobability cannot be met.\n  The current issue of Newsweek puts this dilemma in graphic terms, \nstating:\n\n       Can the faltering Medicare system be saved? Probably not \n     this year. The reason is politics. Democrats privately admit \n     they do not want a Medicare deal because it would deprive \n     them of a powerful campaign issue. What many Democrats want \n     is a good issue, not good policy, and good policy is what is \n     needed.\n\n  Good policy will be available. The politics are reflected in the \namendment on which we will vote shortly from the Senator from Illinois \nthat simply papers over the problem itself.\n  Third, tax relief. This budget resolution, sponsored by the senior \nSenator from New Mexico, calls for real tax relief for the American \npeople to be taken out of the non-Social Security surplus over the \ncourse of the next decade. It gives that offer because it presumes the \nlogical conclusion that if we have a surplus over and above a Social \nSecurity surplus, it means that the people of the United States have \nbeen overtaxed and that that money should stay in their pockets to be \nused in the way in which they wish.\n  The President's proposal, which actually increases taxes over the \nnext decade by almost $100 billion, feels that the worst thing we can \npossibly do is allow Americans to spend more of their own money. \nAmendment after amendment, which we will be facing today and tomorrow \nand Friday, attempt not only to prevent tax relief from taking place \nthis year, but prevent tax relief from taking place for 10 years, for \n12 years and, in the case of one amendment we expect, for 75 years. The \nworst thing that could possibly happen, according to many on the other \nside, would be to provide tax relief for the American people out of a \ngenuine non-Social Security surplus.\n  How do they do that? Partly by amendments such as the Durbin \namendment, but primarily through the 70 or more new spending programs \nthat the President has included in his budget, new spending programs \nthat will spend money not only from the non-Social Security surplus but \nto the tune of more than $100 billion out of the Social Security \nsurplus itself.\n  Mr. President, that is the improper way in which to go. We should \ndeal with the Medicare crisis in a straightforward Medicare reform--a \ndifficult debate but a solution that is actually possible, as indicated \nby one of the leading Members of the Democratic Party in this body, \nSenator Breaux, in his chairmanship of that Medicare Reform \nCommission--through real Social Security reform. We must put the entire \nSocial Security surplus aside in a lockbox so that it cannot be spent \non all of the new and increased programs advocated by the President's \nbudget. As a consequence, the Abraham amendment is a vitally important \namendment and a key to the debate on this budget resolution.\n  To summarize, the budget resolution before us proposed by the Budget \nCommittee, under the leadership of my friend, the senior Senator from \nNew Mexico, the chairman, truly protects Social Security, truly \nbalances the budget of the United States, and pays down the debt, truly \nanticipates Medicare reform that is substantive and not inform only, \ntruly limits spending on other programs and truly returns the surpluses \nthat are appropriately returned to the people of the United\n\n[[Page S3191]]\n\nStates to the taxpayers who now are overtaxed in a good economy to pay \nfor them.\n  Mr. President, the Abraham amendment should be supported, the Durbin \namendment should be rejected, and we should go forth and adopt this \nbudget resolution, generally speaking, in the form in which it finds \nitself at the present time. It is only the first step. Many difficult \nsteps remain. But if we do so, if, in fact, we limit our insatiable \nappetite for spending, I believe we can promise the American people a \nstrong and growing economy for a considerable period of time in the \nfuture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have conferred with the distinguished \nSenator from New Jersey, Mr. Lautenberg, the ranking member of this \ncommittee, and we concur that I should seek unanimous consent of the \nSenate, and I so do, that the time that we use for the vote be counted \nagainst the basic budget resolution time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the occupant of the Chair for the excellent \nsuggestion, which is where I got the idea.\n  Mr. President, we had two people speak under the 22 minutes. Maybe \nthe Senator from New Jersey would like to speak or someone else.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining on \nour side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 9\\1/2\\ \nminutes, and the Senator from New Jersey has 18 minutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 144\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am going to proceed for 3 or 4 minutes on my time \nawaiting the arrival of Senators with whom Senator Lautenberg is in \ntouch.\n  First of all, everybody should know this amendment, offered by the \ndistinguished Senator from New Jersey, is not germane to the budget \nresolution. So at an appropriate time, when all the time has been \nyielded back, I will raise a point of order, at which time I assume the \nSenator from New Jersey will seek to waive that.\n  I will suggest some things now about why our budget is right and why \nthis amendment, even though it is not germane, is not the right thing \nto do. I want to start by quoting a Democratic Senator who spent a \ngreat deal of time and effort trying to reform the Medicare program. \nThe amendment of the distinguished Senator from New Jersey says, ``I \nlike the spending part of Senator Domenici's budget,'' although I am \nsure he would not like to see it in effect for awhile. He said, ``Leave \nthat alone.'' If he had not done that, we would have said you can spend \nall the surplus. Obviously, he did that.\n  Then the Senator said, ``You can't return any of this surplus tax \nmoney to the American taxpayer unless and until you have a reform for \nboth Social Security and Medicare.'' Here is what one of the Democratic \nSenators, Senator Breaux from Louisiana, said:\n\n       Medicare must not be used as a wedge issue any longer. The \n     question before this Congress is not whether to cut taxes or \n     whether to save Medicare. That is not the choice we are \n     facing. I support a tax cut [although he says targeted] and I \n     am dedicated to saving Medicare. It is not an either/or \n     proposition.\n\n  I am glad that is not the Senator from New Mexico making that \nstatement, although I could make it. There is no question in my mind \nthat is correct. As a matter of fact, it seems to this Senator that if \nall we had before us was the President's proposal on Medicare, which \ngradually, bit by bit--most of the proposals of the President's budget \nare going to be refused in the Senate. We are going to adopt the \nAbraham amendment. That says to the President: ``You were not right in \nsaying you were saving Social Security trust funds; you were saving \nonly a part of it and you were spending a part of it.'' This first vote \nis going to say you cannot spend any of it and proposes how a lockbox \nmight be structured if and when we can get the legislation up to vote \non that.\n\n  Now we are talking about Medicare and, obviously, before we are \nfinished here, no one is going to be for the President's Medicare \nproposals--or few are--because actually it does not do anything. It \npurports to do something, but it does nothing. It does not spend a \npenny on prescription drugs. As a matter of fact, it does not spend a \npenny of new money to fix Medicare at all.\n  The budget before us spends $190 billion to $200 billion more than \nthe President and fully funds Medicare. It does not cut $20 billion out \nof Medicare, which the President cut out.\n  Then it says: ``Let's get on with reform and fix it; let's stop \ntalking about things in the air; let's put it on paper and let's start \nvoting.''\n  We say there is another $100 billion left over, not from Social \nSecurity, not for returning money to the taxpayers, another 100 that we \nsay can be used, if needed, for Medicare.\n  That is going to solve Medicare well beyond the 12 years that the \ndistinguished Senator from New Jersey seeks. He seeks a 12-year \nextension of the program. That program, which is described in our \nbudget, can solve it for much longer than 12 years.\n  The problem is, we do not want to give the American taxpayers a break \nunless and until we have the reform accomplished, and we do not even \nhave a proposal from the President of the United States. It is grossly \nunfair, in my opinion.\n  Clearly, the time has come to reward the taxpayers who have been \nworking hard to keep this economy going, putting in more and more of \ntheir tax dollars. They ought to get some of it back. We ought to be \nfor keeping the economy expanding and growing, producing jobs and \nvitality.\n  If you look around the world, West Germany is in trouble, and that \nmeans most of Europe is going to be in trouble, not just Asia, and we \nare going to be the bastion of growth and prosperity. We better be \nready with some tax cuts for American business and for the American \ntaxpayer if we want another 6 or 7 years of prolonged, sustained \nrecovery. That is the kind of thing we ought to be doing, and it is \ndone by this budget, leaving the Congress to decide what kind of tax \nreductions they want in the future.\n  This budget does not prescribe that. Certain Republicans have ideas, \nand certain Democrats have ideas. This Senator, my good friend from \nLouisiana, has ideas. His would be for targeted tax cuts. I do not know \nwhat the occupant of the Chair would be for, but he would have some.\n  Only one set of ideas is going to be passed. It is going to be passed \nultimately by committees after debate and committee hearings and the \nlike. The question is not whether some of us are for an across-the-\nboard tax cut like John Kennedy was for; the question is, Are we going \nto provide anything for tax cuts? The Lautenberg amendment says no. I \nbelieve we should not adopt it, and we should get on with the budget \nformat and plan contained in the budget before us.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield 6 minutes?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. If the Senator will just give me about 2 minutes to \nrespond to Senator Domenici.\n  I just say that though the quote from Senator Breaux is that it is \nnot an either/or proposition, the fact is that the Republican \npriority--and I will do the unheard of; I will hold up my own sign--\nthat the Republican priority for the surplus has made it either/or. We \nhave tax breaks for the 10-year period, over $800 billion, $831 \nbillion, and Medicare, zero. So if we want to discuss what we are going \nto do for Medicare, I guess there is some thought that you can help it \nby giving it nothing, because that is what is planned. So if we are \ngoing to use the quote here, then I think we have to use it in the \ncontext of reality.\n  With that, since the Senator from Massachusetts had asked for the \nfloor, Mr. President, I yield--how much time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Six minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n[[Page S3192]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have listened over the course of the \npresentations earlier this morning about how the Republican budget is \ngoing to try and solve the problems in Medicare and also with regard to \nprescription drugs, and how inadequate the President's program has been \nin terms of resolving Social Security and Medicare. I am glad to hear \nthe interpretations of my good friends on the other side.\n  The fact of the matter is, the President's program, in allocating the \nresources for Social Security with 62 percent of the surplus, has been \nbasically endorsed by eight Nobel laureates in economics and over 100 \neconomic professors, along with Alan Greenspan. If you listen to our \ncolleagues out here, you would think it was a nondescript program. But \nthe fact is, it is a solid program. It is a sensible program and a \nresponsible program.\n  The chairman of the Budget Committee talks about all the money that \nis going to be there in Social Security. He talks about how they are \ngoing to add $190 billion to Medicare. They have to have it. They are \nnot adding any money. That is what the cost of the program is going to \nbe in the outer years. They do not dare cut back on that program. That \nis necessary for the very existence of the program over that period of \ntime.\n  So when they come out and say, ``We're adding all of this money and \nprotecting the Medicare program,'' that is poppycock; otherwise, they \nwould have to justify further cuts in the program. These are the best \nestimates for a continuation of the program at the present rate. That \nis all.\n  They have this wonderful other program that they talk about that is \ngoing to be available. I just refer our colleagues to the Budget \nCommittee report for the concurrent resolution on the budget, and look \non page 4, at about the middle of the page, about ``Additional On-\nBudget Surpluses.'' They talk about:\n\n       It is estimated, at this time, that nearly $133 billion in \n     on-budget surpluses could result if the resolution were . . . \n     implemented.\n\n  That has been revised to $100 billion. Now, listen--listen--to this \nfund that is going to be there. At one moment it is for prescription \ndrugs and at another moment it is for Medicare and at another moment it \nis for the transition to Medicare reform and at another moment it is \nfor national disasters. Look what they say:\n\n       These additional funds, if estimates prove accurate, would \n     further retire debt held by the public or could be made \n     available to assist funding of any transition costs to \n     implement reforms in the Medicare programs that would \n     significantly extend the solvency of that program through a \n     reserve fund mechanism adopted by the Committee. \n     Alternatively, the on-budget surplus projected by the \n     resolution could be needed for funding unexpected disasters \n     and emergencies over this period.\n\n  It does not even refer to prescription drugs. It does not even \nmention it. You talk about double counting--you can come over to page \n90, and you will see how they double count it over there. We will come \nback to that. You tie up that fund in terms of prescription drugs in \nsuch a way you will not even get an aspirin out of this particular \nproposal, Mr. President.\n\n  I just want to point out that they talk about the fund that they are \ngoing to have with the $100 billion surplus. It may be for emergencies. \nThe Budget Committee knows you average $9- or $10 billion a year in \nthat particular program. But if we look at the payout for the budget--\nand I just refer you to the budget, S. Con. Res. 20.\n  Look on page 5, look at line 18. For the year 2000, is there going to \nbe anything in there for Medicare? No. It is $6 billion in debt. How \nabout line 19, fiscal year 2001? Anything in there for Medicare \ntransition? Anything in there for prescription drugs? Anything in there \nfor emergencies? Zero. What about line 20, for the fiscal year 2002? \nZero. What about for fiscal year 2003? Zero. What about for fiscal year \n2004? There is $2,899,000,000. Isn't that something? This is their \nprogram for saving Medicare. This is their program, their own figures.\n  If I have ever heard something that makes absolutely no sense--how \ncan any member of the majority in the Budget Committee stand up on this \nfloor and say that they have anything worthwhile in here to protect \nMedicare?\n  I say to the Senator, it is $686 billion. Even if you use the whole \n$100 billion, it is $686 billion you are going to need over 15 years, \nso you do not have enough in here to even begin to save Medicare. All \nwe are trying to get is honesty in budgeting.\n  Under the Democratic program, we take all 15 percent and set it \naside. You can make these debatable points that, well, you can't really \ntransfer the funds. Of course you can't. You have to change the law to \nbe able to do it. But we understand what is being done out here, Mr. \nChairman and Senators. We understand what is being done. We are \nallocating and indicating what our priorities are. And we are going to \nsave Social Security on the one hand, and we are going to use that 15 \npercent for Medicare. And we are not going to use this $100 billion \nthat does not provide a single cent for 5 years and can be used either \nfor disasters or for any other program that has been outlined in the \nBudget Committee's report.\n  That is not saving Medicare. The amendment of the Senator from New \nJersey, Senator Lautenberg, does the job. And the amendment of Senator \nConrad does the job. We will also have an opportunity to offer \nsomething that will do it.\n  So Mr. President, I think it is worthwhile going beyond the rhetoric \nand giving our Members a chance to look through both the report and the \nlegislation to try and find out who really is interested in preserving \nMedicare. The votes that are going to be offered here later this \nafternoon, starting with Senator Lautenberg's, and Senator Conrad's, \nwill give us an opportunity to do that.\n  The principle set forth in the Lautenberg amendment goes to the heart \nof this budget debate: We should not liquidate the surplus by enacting \ntax cuts before we solve the significant financial problems facing \nSocial Security and Medicare. I wholeheartedly agree. Placing Social \nSecurity and Medicare on a firm financial footing should be our highest \nbudget priorities. The surplus gives us a unique opportunity to extend \nthe long-term solvency of those two vital programs without hurting the \nvulnerable elderly who depend upon them. We should seize that \nopportunity. Two-thirds of our senior citizens depend upon Social \nSecurity retirement benefits for more than fifty percent of their \nannual income. Without it, half of the nation's elderly would fall \nbelow the poverty line. These same retirees living on fixed incomes \nrely upon Medicare for their only access to needed health care. For all \nof them, this budget does absolutely nothing. It does not provide one \nnew dollar to support Social Security or to support Medicare. It \nsquanders the historic opportunity which the surplus has given us.\n  On the subject of Social Security, the Republican budget is an \nexercise in deception. The rhetoric surrounding its introduction \nconveys the impression that the Republicans have taken a major step \ntoward protecting Social Security. In truth, they have done nothing to \nstrengthen Social Security. Their budget would not provide even one \nadditional dollar to pay benefits to future retirees. Nor would it \nextend the life of the Trust Fund by one more day. It merely recommits \nto Social Security those dollars which already belong to the Trust Fund \nunder current law. That is all their so-called ``lockbox'' does. By \ncontrast, President Clinton's proposed budget would contribute $2.8 \ntrillion new dollars of the surplus to Social Security over the next \nfifteen years. By doing so, his budget would extend the life of the \nTrust Fund by more than a generation to beyond 2050.\n  Not only does the Republican plan fail to provide new revenue to \nextend the life of the Social Security Trust Fund, it does not even \neffectively guarantee that the existing payroll tax revenues will be \nused to pay Social Security benefits. In essence, there is a trap door \nin the Republican ``lockbox''. Their plan would allow Social Security \npayroll taxes to be used to finance unspecified ``reforms''. This opens \nthe door to risky schemes that would use the Social Security surplus to \nfinance private retirement accounts at the expense of Social Security's \nguaranteed benefits. Such a privatization plan could actually make \nSocial Security's financial picture far worse than it is today, \nnecessitating deep benefit cuts. A genuine ``lockbox'' would prevent\n\n[[Page S3193]]\n\nany such diversion of funds, but not the Republican version. A genuine \n``lockbox'' would guarantee that those dollars would be in the Trust \nFund when needed to pay benefits to future recipients. The ``lockbox'' \nin this budget does not.\n  While the Republicans claim that they too support using the surplus \nfor debt reduction, they are still unwilling to use it in a way that \nwill help save Social Security for future generations. There is a \nfundamental difference between the parties on how the savings which \nwill result from debt reduction should be used. The federal government \nwill realize enormous savings from paying down the debt. As a result, \nbillions of dollars that would have been required to pay interest on \nthe national debt will become available each year for other purposes. \nPresident Clinton believes those debt service savings should be used to \nstrengthen Social Security. So do I. But the Republicans refuse to \ncommit those dollars to Social Security. Their budget does nothing to \nincrease Social Security's ability to pay full benefits to future \ngenerations of retirees.\n\n  Currently, the federal government spends more than 11 cents of every \nbudget dollar to pay the cost of interest on the national debt. By \nusing the Social Security surplus to pay down the debt over the next \nfifteen years, we can reduce the debt service cost to just 2 cents of \nevery budget dollar by 2014; and to zero by 2018. Such prudent fiscal \nmanagement now will produce an enormous savings to the government in \nfuture years. Since it was payroll tax revenues which made the debt \nreduction possible, those savings should in turn be used to strengthen \nSocial Security when it needs additional revenue to finance the baby \nboomers' retirement after 2030. Rather than paying interest to bond-\nholding investors today, our plan would use that money to finance \nSocial Security benefits tomorrow.\n  This is analogous to the situation of a couple with young children \nand a mortgage. They know they will have a major expense fifteen years \ndown the road when their children reach college age. They use their \nextra money now to pay down their home mortgage ahead of schedule. As a \nresult, in fifteen years the mortgage will be greatly reduced or even \npaid off. Thus, the dollars that were going to pay the mortgage each \nmonth will become available to finance college for the children. In the \nsame way, the federal government is reducing its debt over the next \nfifteen years, so that it can apply the savings to Social Security when \nthe baby boomers retire.\n  That is what the President's budget proposes. It would provide an \nadditional $2.8 trillion to Social Security, most of it debt service \nsavings, between 2030 and 2055. As a result, the current level of \nSocial Security benefits would be fully financed for all future \nrecipients for more than half a century. It is an eminently reasonable \nplan. But Republican members of Congress oppose it.\n  During the budget debate, the Republicans will proclaim that this \nyear, unlike last year, Social Security tax dollars are not being used \nto pay for their tax cut. This year they are not proposing to loot \nbillions of dollars from the Social Security Trust Fund. Undeniably a \nstep in the right direction. But hardly sufficient progress. They are \nstill unwilling to use the surplus to save Social Security, still \nunwilling to use surplus dollars to extend the ability of the Social \nSecurity Trust Fund to pay full benefits to future generations.\n  Sadly, the Republican response to the financial problems facing \nMedicare is the same. The crisis facing Medicare is much more severe \nthan the financial problems facing Social Security. Medicare will \nbecome insolvent in less than a decade unless we take decisive action \nto extend it. President Clinton's budget would do that. It would devote \nfifteen percent of the surplus, nearly $700 billion, over the next \nfifteen years to financially strengthening Medicare. As a result, it \nwould have sufficient resources to fully fund current health care \nbenefits to at least 2020. This would give us the time which is \nnecessary to gradually reform the program in a way which will protect \nthe elderly beneficiaries who depend upon it. However, the \nRepublicans rejected this initiative to save Medicare. Their budget \nwill not extend the life of the Medicare Trust Fund for one day. I will \nhave a great deal more to say later in the debate about the harm that \nthis budget will do to Medicare.\n\n  The budget Republicans have brought to the floor does not provide one \nnew dollar to finance Social Security or Medicare benefits. What it \ndoes provide is nearly $800 billion new dollars for tax cuts over the \nnext decade. Tax cuts, not strengthening Social Security and Medicare, \nis their first priority. Budgets speak louder than words. The \nRepublican budget tells us much more candidly than their rhetoric where \nthe GOP's real commitment lies.\n  The Republican budget would devote $778 billion to tax cuts during \nthe next ten years--before fixing Social Security, and before funding \nMedicare for the next generation. Those who wrote this budget were not \nthinking about the two-thirds of our senior citizens who rely on Social \nSecurity retirement benefits for more than half their annual income. \nThey clearly were not thinking of the elderly who depend on Medicare \nfor their only access to health care. The pleas of the elderly have \nfallen on deaf ears.\n  When the Republicans wrote this budget, they had a very different \ngroup of people in mind. While the budget itself does not specify the \nprecise form of tax cut, the Republican leadership has already called \nfor a 10% across-the-board tax rate cut. Such a tax cut would \ndisproportionately benefit the nation's highest-income taxpayers. The \nTreasury Department's analysis of this proposal shows that the top one \npercent of earners would receive 35% of the benefits. The top twenty \npercent of earners would receive 65% of the benefits. By contrast, \napproximately 45 million Americans would get no benefit at all.\n  While an across-the-board income tax cut may sound fair at first \nhearing, it would in fact be grossly inequitable. Under the Republican \nleadership's proposal, sixty percent of American taxpayers would share \njust nine percent of the total tax savings, an average of less than \n$100 per person per year. Clearly, the Republicans are not thinking \nabout the needs of working families and their elderly parents.\n  This amendment offered by Senator Lautenberg would set us on a \ndifferent, more responsible course. It would prevent using the surplus \nto fund tax cuts until we have solved the financial problems facing \nSocial Security and Medicare. This approach would preserve the \nresources which are needed to guarantee the long-term solvency of these \ntwo historic programs without harming future beneficiaries. It is the \nright thing to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from \nMontana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to follow on the remarks of my good \nfriend from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, because I think he, with \ngreat articulation, hits the nail on the head. We are talking here not \nabout gimmicks but what is the right way, the most solid way to put a \nbudget together and to protect Social Security.\n  There is a right way; there is a wrong way. The Lautenberg amendment \nis the right way to preserve Social Security. The amendment of the \nSenator from Michigan is a good example of an idea that sounds good, \nbut is the wrong way.\n  Mandated reductions in our Nation's debt limit are irresponsible. \nThey are dangerous. They could hurt the very people that the proponents \nclaim they want to help; namely, Social Security beneficiaries.\n  As a member of the Finance Committee, I understand very clearly the \nrisks this amendment poses. Debt is incurred solely to pay expenditures \nthat Congress has already authorized. The time to limit spending is \nwhen Congress is considering the underlying bills, whether they be \nappropriations bills or tax bills, not after the bills have already \nbeen enacted into law. By the time the debt limit is reached, the \nGovernment is already obligated to make payments and must have enough \nmoney to do so.\n\n[[Page S3194]]\n\n  The debt obligations of the United States are recognized as having \nthe least credit risk of any investment in the world. That credit \nstanding is a precious asset for the American people and helps our \neconomy by reducing the costs of borrowing.\n  Remember, the last time we came face to face with a debt limit crisis \nin November 1995, Moody's credit rating service placed Treasury \nsecurities on review for possible downgrade. They did this because it \nappeared possible for the first time in our Nation's history that the \nUnited States might be forced to default on our debt obligations. From \nthe safest investment in the world, America overnight became comparable \nto that of countries which we do not hold in as high regard.\n\n  If the debt limit is reached and Congress cannot quickly obtain a \nsupermajority to increase the limit, Treasury might easily be forced to \nstop honoring any payments. The largest single recurring monthly \nexpenditure for the Treasury comes every month when Social Security \nchecks are sent out.\n  The effect of this amendment, which is being touted as helping to \npreserve Social Security for the future, could easily be to force \ncurrent beneficiaries to live without the monthly checks that so many \ndepend upon for their livelihood. Those who support this amendment--\nthat is, of the Senator from Michigan--seem to feel that we must in \neffect destroy Social Security in order to save it. Obviously, the \nmajority of Members disagree.\n  I believe we can save Social Security for the future without putting \ncurrent beneficiaries at risk of losing their monthly checks. We can do \nthis not by supporting the Abraham amendment but by sticking to the \nbudget enforcement tools that have successfully brought us this far, \nfrom a time of red ink as far as the eye could see to a day of \nprojected budget surpluses.\n  That is why I support strongly the amendment offered by Senator \nLautenberg. Simply put, we should reach agreement on a solution to the \nSocial Security problem before we begin spending money we don't yet \nhave. Until that happens, we should keep the pay-go rules and \ndiscretionary spending caps in place. This is the only way to truly \nsave Social Security first.\n  I believe if we pursue this course we can make room in the budget for \na number of critical priorities. In addition to saving Social Security, \nwe can preserve Medicare. We all know that Medicare is in dire straits, \nworse shape than Social Security, and I am astounded that the majority \nparty does not want to save Medicare, a program that is in worse shape \neven than Social Security.\n  I might also say that the balanced budget amendment which we passed a \ncouple of years ago has a disproportionately detrimental effect on \nrural hospitals and rural doctors. In my State of Montana, rural \nhospitals lost 6.5 percent in 1997 in spite of the news that hospitals \nnationwide are making big profits--a 6.5-percent loss. That was before \nthe balanced budget amendment cuts. If, as some suggest, we don't \ninfuse the Medicare trust fund with some surplus moneys, there is a \nvery real possibility that providers could suffer further cuts. If that \nhappens, small rural hospitals will not just lose money, they will \nclose.\n  For all the very real danger in the social security system, did you \nknow that if we do nothing Medicare will be insolvent in about the next \nten years? Think about that.\n  We are less than a decade away from allowing a major piece of our \nnation's security to whither on the vine.\n  Let's consider how quickly that date is coming. Only eight years ago, \nwe launched Operation Desert Storm in Iraq. Ten years ago the Berlin \nWall fell. Seems like yesterday, doesn't it?\n  And just a couple of years ago, Mr. President, Congress passed the \nBalanced Budget Act. In the BBA, we extended the life of the Medicare \nTrust Fund.\n  But we also implemented over $100 billion in cuts to health care \nproviders. I hear about those reductions from Montanans every day.\n  Montana small rural hospitals lost 6.5 percent in 1997, in spite of \nnews that hospitals nationwide were making a killing. 6.5 percent, Mr. \nPresident. And that was before the BBA cuts. If, as some have \nsuggested, we don't infuse the Medicare Trust Fund with some surplus \nmonies, there is a very real possibility that providers could suffer \nfurther cuts. If that happens small rural hospitals will not just lose \nmoney, they will close.\n  And patients--not just providers--will suffer. This Congress should \ndo the responsible thing by not balancing the budget on the backs of \nMedicare patients and providers. The Senate should dedicate 15 percent \nof the budget surplus to save Medicare.\n   Mr. President, saving Social Security and shoring up Medicare must \nbe our two top priorities.\n  I don't think that precludes us from passing targeted tax cuts, \nthough. I think we can make room for tax cuts by getting rid of \nwasteful spending wherever it occurs.\n  Let me tell you a few tax cuts I will personally work for this \nCongress:\n  We should end the marriage penalty for Montana and American families.\n  We should provide tax cuts to promote education for our children. I \nwill push this year to further expand the student loan interest \ndeduction. I'll introduce legislation to encourage greater donations of \ncomputers and technology to schools. And I'll expand the lifelong \nlearning credit so our workers can get the vital training they need to \nadapt to today's changing, global economy.\n  We should expand pension coverage particularly for our small \nbusiness. Only one in five Montanans working for small businesses have \naccess to retirement plans. I am introducing legislation to try to make \npension plans more affordable and less complicated for small businesses \nand their employees.\n  And, as part of my safety net to help farmers weather these turbulent \ntimes, I am promoting a new farm savings account.\n   Mr. President, in conclusion, I believe that the pending amendment \nis the right way to go. We must save Social Security first. We should \nnot use gimmicks like the ``lock box'' that could jeopardize our \nability to issue social security checks and hurt the very people that \nwe are trying to help.\n   Mr. President, I believe that, without such a gimmick, we can make \nroom in the budget for what should be our three biggest priorities: \nSocial Security, Medicare, and targeted tax cuts.\n  Let's seize this opportunity and do what's right for our country.\n  In summary, I am quite concerned about the priorities that are in the \nmajority budget. A budget sets a country's priorities. For me, one of \nthe main priorities should be saving Social Security, which, in effect, \nthe majority budget does not do. Certainly we should help do what we \ncan to save Medicare, to shore up Medicare, shore up the Medicare trust \nfund, which certainly the budget resolution before the Senate does not \ndo.\n  We should not use gimmicks like lockboxes, and so forth. It may sound \ngood, but they do not provide the benefits they purport to have.\n  I very much hope we adopt the amendment offered by the Senator from \nNew Jersey, the amendment that sets the priorities that this country \nreally needs and want.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 3 minutes 32 \nseconds, and the other side has 3 minutes 17 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Who wants to speak on the Democratic side?\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute 15 seconds.\n  Mr. President, I want to direct the chairman's attention to page 90 \nof the report. Here is the reserve fund for Medicare and the \nprescription drugs. I hope that anyone who believes we are really \nestablishing a reserve fund in here for prescription drugs will take a \nlittle time to read it. We don't have the time to do so right now.\n  The point I want to make is this: When my good friend from New Mexico \nis talking about the $190 billion that is going to Medicare, as I \nmentioned, that is what will be necessary to just continue the program \nwithout any kind of adjustment. Then they have this $100\n\n[[Page S3195]]\n\nbillion out there. In this report they say it can be used for \nprescription drugs, it can be used for disaster relief, it can be used \nfor anything. Any time I hear someone come over and talk about a \nparticular subject, it seems that they are using the same $100 billion \nfor that particular purpose.\n  Now back to page 90 and restrictions placed here in terms of \nprescription drugs. There is absolutely no reason to expect there will \nbe a prescription drug provision under this particular provision that \nhas been added in the budget legislation. We will have an opportunity \nlater in the afternoon to debate it, but there is nothing here to \nguarantee the availability of even one additional dollar for Medicare.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will reserve as best I can the decibel \nlevel until later in the day when I feel more like arguing with the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts, but he will hear it before we \nare finished, as I will hear his.\n  The Republican package is by far better than anything the President \nof the United States has offered to the people of this country on \nMedicare. Let me suggest that maybe before we are finished, we will put \nthe President's Medicare package before the Senate and see how many \nSenators vote for it. As a matter of fact, it doesn't pay a penny of \nprescription drugs and doesn't provide for any method or manner of \ndoing it. The 15 percent of the surplus that is put in there is clearly \nidentified as being placed in there to elongate the trust fund. But you \ncan't spend it under the President's plan. You get back IOUs, which \nmeans generations to come will have to pay whatever it is that is spent \non Medicare over the years.\n  We did better than the President in that he cut $20 billion out of \nMedicare and we did not during the next decade. When you add that \ntogether with more than $100 billion that is not allocated anywhere out \nof the surplus that can be used for Medicare reform, including \nprescription drugs, we have a very good package.\n  The only thing missing is a proposal, a reasonable proposal, by the \nPresident of the United States to put into effect the use of that money \nand the kinds of reforms that are suggested by the committee which \nworked so long and was one vote short of what they needed.\n\n  We can go on forever this year debating Medicare, but the truth of \nthe matter is, we have a solution in mind. There are others who talk \nabout the problem and indicate that it will be fixed in some miraculous \nway when they don't have a plan.\n  I yield the remaining time to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has 45 seconds.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I will speak quickly.\n  Our plan, which will be voted on, is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment \nthat we should create a Social Security lockbox. This would make sure \nthat any Social Security surplus dollars are used either to fix Social \nSecurity or pay down the national debt. People on both sides of the \naisle have been claiming that is what they wanted to do. We just heard \nthe first spokesperson in opposition to that raising issues that I \nthink are very dubious complaints.\n  If you don't want to reduce the national debt and you want to spend \nthe Social Security surplus, then vote against this amendment. However, \nI can't think of any other reason, other than that, to vote no on our \namendment. This is a sense of the Senate to set us in the direction of \nmaking sure we protect those surpluses.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from New Jersey has 1 minute 48 seconds.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I don't think I will use all that \ntime, but I will take a moment to respond in case my colleague from \nMassachusetts needs any shoring up.\n  The fact of the matter is that the reserve fund, this mythical \nreserve fund, that was going to be $132 billion has, by osmosis, shrunk \nto $101 billion and it is headed in the wrong direction.\n  If there is going to be any participation at all in establishing \nsolvency for another 12 years for Medicare, we have to make our \njudgment based on where things stand, not the kind of things that are \nsaid in honest debate.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the alternative under the Lautenberg \namendment is, we will not have the tax cuts until we have the solvency \nof Social Security and Medicare. Is that the effect of the Lautenberg \namendment?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. That is our amendment.\n  I yield back the remaining time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield back all time I might have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask for the yeas and nays on the Abraham amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent it be in order for me to make a \npoint of order against the Lautenberg amendment so we can stack that \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Res. 20 must be offered by \n12 noon on Thursday, March 25, 1999, and at 11:40 a.m. on Thursday, \nSenator Lautenberg be recognized to offer and lay aside amendments on \nbehalf of Members on his side of the aisle, and at 11:50 a.m., Senator \nDomenici be recognized to offer and lay aside amendments on behalf of \nMembers on this side of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the managers, Senator Lautenberg and \nthe chairman of the committee, Senator Domenici, for the work they are \nalready doing, for the cooperation we have been receiving from Senator \nDaschle, and the fact that we started off last night with an agreement \nthat we would have 35 hours remaining.\n  These Senators have worked through the debate this morning. We just \nhad two back-to-back votes. Getting this agreement to have the first-\ndegree amendments offered by 12 noon is also an important step in the \nright direction. I know they are going to continue to push \naggressively.\n  Let me say to Members on both sides of the aisle, I know how prolific \nwe are and how much we enjoy having amendments with our names on them. \nHowever, if we come up with 40 amendments on this side of the aisle and \n40 amendments on that side of the aisle--80 amendments on top of the \nremaining 26 or 27 hours--we are not going to be able to make it by \nFriday.\n  In view of that, I have already made arrangements for my flight to be \nSaturday, not Friday. I also want to notify Members that in order to \naccomplish this goal of finishing up by Friday, we are going to have to \ngo late--unless we can work out some other arrangement--Wednesday night \nand Thursday night, possibly Friday night. We already have presiding \nofficers signing up for hours to go all night Wednesday and Thursday \nnight. We only have a couple vacancies here. We have a 4 to 5 a.m. slot \nthat will be left for somebody to sign on to. Maybe Senator Brownback \nwill sign up for that slot. We need to fill in these time blanks for \nboth nights.\n  I know the managers are going to need help in order to get through \nthis, especially if we have to go all night. I hope we can work out a \nway to avoid that, but it is going to take the cooperation of Members \non both sides with the managers.\n  I am serious about doing this, not for punishment, but so we can do \nour work. I have Senators on both sides of the aisle coming up to me \nsaying: ``I really need to get out of here Thursday night.'' ``Can I be \ngone by 1 Friday?'' ``I must be out of here by Friday night.'' In order \nto achieve that, we have to come to additional agreements, drop some \namendments, and perhaps seriously go around the clock one night.\n  Please cooperate with the managers. You will have the chance on both \nsides to make your principal points, get votes on those amendments, and \nthen we can move on to conclusion.\n  Thank you for the cooperation we have already received.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. First, I thank the distinguished majority leader for \nhis assistance. I think that is a very good start.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that heretofore any votes that we have \nhad, that the time used up on votes count against the total time under \nthe resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I, too, extend my appreciation to the \nDemocratic leader, Senator Daschle, for the hard work he did to try to \nget people to understand that we do not want to deprive anybody at all \nof their opportunity to offer amendments, but we make the case, as we \nall heard from the majority leader, that we are prepared to stay here \nas late as necessary tonight. And Senator Domenici and I, as usual, \nhave been working cooperatively. I just wonder whether the majority \nleader asked the freshman class over there whether they would stay all \nnight. But I thank you.\n  I ask permission, if it is all right with the Senator from Missouri, \nif the Senator from Wisconsin, who has a fairly short 6-minute \npresentation to make, could be recognized at this time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. KOHL. Thank you, I say to Senator Lautenberg and Senator \nAshcroft.\n  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the budget resolution. This \nbudget is senseless, arrogant, and dishonest.\n  If this were an employee, you would fire him. If this were a house \nguest, you would boot him. But since this is a budget, our only option \nis to vote it down--and spend the few hours we have left in this debate \nhammering out a fiscal plan of which we can be proud.\n  When I call this budget senseless, I mean it literally: The budget \ndoes not make sense. The United States is experiencing the longest \npeacetime economic expansion in our history. We are projected to run \nbudget surpluses totaling almost $5 trillion over the next 15 years.\n  In goods times like these, we ought to have the confidence to be \nbold, to pay our debts from the past, to solve the problems, like \nrunaway entitlement spending, that will plague us in the future, and \nindeed, to invest wisely in a strong nation.\n  Instead, this budget makes a series of incomprehensible tradeoffs.\n  It increases funding for elementary and secondary education, while \nremoving 100,000 young students from Head Start, and eliminating child \ncare subsidies for 34,000 low-income children. If we follow this \nbudget, we will be ready to teach children who, because we have \nneglected them in their first 5 years, are not ready to learn.\n  The budget increases spending for research into new diseases, while \ncutting spending for the vaccines that protect our children from old \ndiseases.\n  The budget increases military spending beyond what the President \nwants, and cuts diplomatic spending below what the Secretary of State \nbelieves is feasible. We are sending the administration out into a \nworld of shifting borders and allegiances armed with a stick too big to \nlift and a carrot too small to see.\n  The budget fully funds the Violent Crime Trust Fund and cuts 2,700 \nFBI agents. Now how do we reduce violent crime while also reducing the \nnumber of people specifically charged with fighting it?\n  And in perhaps the cruelest mismatch of all, this budget chooses an\n\n[[Page S3197]]\n\nenormous tax cut over shoring up the Medicare Trust Fund. The budget \ntrades a long-term policy of health and security, for those who really \nneed it, for a short-term policy of giving cash to those who already \nhave it.\n  These sort of confusing tradeoffs are enough for most of us to reject \nthe budget. But these policy missteps are compounded by the fact that \nthey are continued for many years.\n  The budget includes tax cuts that grow exponentially as far as the \neye can see, and huge increases in military hardware purchases in \ncontracts stretched out almost as far. Have we not learned from the \npast? This is the same combination of defense spending and tax cuts \nthat led to the record budget deficits of the 1980s. Have we no respect \nfor the future? It is the height of arrogance for politicians today to \nlock future generations into evermore expensive contracts and \ncommitments.\n\n  And finally, the budget is dishonest. By the admission of several \ncongressional leaders, there is no way the draconian cuts in domestic \nspending envisioned by this budget will last the year.\n  What that means is, sometime in November, we will all be voting for, \nand lamenting over, a hastily thrown together omnibus appropriations \nbill that funds all the needs this budget proposes to ignore.\n  That is a sloppy way to do our business. If these domestic programs \nare priorities--and I believe they should be--then we ought to discuss \nthem now, plan for them now, budget for them now. It is dishonest to \ntrumpet this budget as responsible spending, while fully expecting to \nspend irresponsibly and freely at the end of the year.\n  This budget is not evil; it is sloppy. It reflects priorities so \nmisguided and mismatched that no one expects they will be implemented \nat the end of the day. The budget is not so much a crime as it is a \nmistake and a missed opportunity.\n  We had a chance to behave responsibly and wisely, using our current \nsurplus and strong economy to underpin a visionary plan for this \nNation's fiscal future. We could not have done something for the \nfuture, but instead we have a budget that, at best, will get some of us \nthrough tonight's 6 o'clock news sound bites. After that, it will be \nshoved aside for a last minute, unplanned and probably unwise spending \nspree.\n  So, let's not wait until tomorrow. Let's put this budget out of its \nmisery now. Let's not stumble into the new century with a senseless \nspending plan. Let's adopt a fiscal framework that makes sense for old \nand young--that will stand today and in the future.\n  I thank you, Mr. President, and yield the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 145\n\n     (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that the Federal \n Government should not directly invest the social security trust funds \n                     in private financial markets)\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Ashcroft] for himself, Mr. \n     Brownback, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, Mr. \n     Abraham, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Roth, and Mr. Warner, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 145.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT \n                   SHOULD NOT INVEST THE SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST \n                   FUNDS IN PRIVATE FINANCIAL MARKETS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the assumptions \n     underlying the functional totals in this resolution assume \n     that the Federal Government should not directly invest \n     contributions made to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors \n     Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance \n     Trust Fund established under section 201 of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401) in private financial markets.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, the amendment which I have sent to the \ndesk is a simple one. It is an amendment forbidding the Government to \ninvest Social Security trust funds in the stock market.\n  We have talked a lot about Social Security in relation to the budget \nand that it is important that we not invade the Social Security trust \nfund to undertake spending to cover deficits in other areas, and that \nis really a way to protect the trust fund. This amendment is another \nway to protect the trust fund and to protect the retirement security of \nAmericans from the risks of the stock market.\n  So this amendment expresses the sense of the Senate that the Federal \nGovernment should not invest the Social Security trust fund in the \nstock market. Having the Government invest the trust fund in the stock \nmarket is a gamble. It is a gamble Congress should be unwilling to make \non behalf of the millions who receive and depend on Social Security to \nmeet their retirement needs.\n  First, let me say that there is no more worthy Government obligation \nthan ensuring that those who paid a lifetime of Social Security taxes \nwill receive their full Social Security benefits. Social Security is \nour most important social program, and I believe it is a contract, an \nagreement between the citizens and their Government. Americans, \nincluding 1 million Missourians, depend on this commitment. And I am \ndetermined to ensure that Social Security meets that commitment.\n  The President has suggested, and for the first time in history, that \nthe Government should invest as much as $700 billion worth of Social \nSecurity surpluses in the stock market. In my view, and in the view of \nmany Missourians who depend on Social Security, this would \nunnecessarily gamble with the Social Security trust funds.\n  For more than 60 years, Social Security law has forbidden the trust \nfunds from being invested in the stock market. The pending amendment \nwill express our support for that law, making explicit what is now \nimplicit, that this kind of governmental meddling into private markets \nshould not be allowed to happen.\n  Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan says that investing \nSocial Security funds in the market is bad for Social Security and, he \nsays, bad for the economy. Now, when Alan Greenspan talks, virtually \neveryone listens. And Congress ought to listen.\n  Chairman Greenspan has said this plan ``will create a lower rate of \nreturn for Social Security recipients,'' and he ``does not believe that \nit is politically feasible to insulate such huge funds from a \ngovernmental direction.''\n  I think what he is saying is it is not time to let some bureaucrat \nplay broker-for-a-day with the Social Security trust fund. The last \nthing we need in America is the Federal Government directing the \ninvestment of Social Security trust funds based on some trendy \npolitically driven notion of which industries or which countries or \nwhich policies are in political favor at the moment.\n  Of course, Alan Greenspan is not the only Government official \nentrusted with and ensuring our economic well-being who is gravely \nconcerned or who has expressed grave concerns about this proposal. \nArthur Levitt, the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, \nthe country's top investment official, has said,\n\n       We have an obligation to think long and hard about the \n     implications of Social Security reform. Investing Social \n     Security in the stock market, by its very nature involves \n     heightened obligations, difficult questions and new \n     challenges.\n\n  Chairman Levitt is worried about the ``large-scale market effect.'' \nIn other words, what does this proposal do to the market, including \nwhether the Government would ``have an even greater incentive, if not \nthe market itself.'' We know that America has prospered because of free \nmarkets, not Government-directed markets. The prospect of the market \ntrying to control market fluctuations is disturbing.\n  In this scenario, the Government could subsidize companies that were \nlosing market value, regulate companies that pursued risky or \ninnovative strategies, and pursue policies based on which companies \nwould benefit. If the Federal Government tried to pick market winners \nand losers, all of us, companies and citizens alike, Social Security \nrecipients, and those paying the taxes would end up as losers.\n  When officials of the stature of Chairman Greenspan and Levitt, \nofficials who are responsible for the health\n\n[[Page S3198]]\n\nof the Nation's economy and of the stock market, warn us when they \nspeak, we ought to tread very carefully.\n  In addition to the concerns of the experts, I am listening to the \nconcerns of individual Missourians. I recently received a letter from \nTodd Lawrence of Greenwood, MO, who wrote,\n\n       It has been suggested that the government would invest in \n     the stock market with my Social Security money. No offense, \n     but there is not much that the government touches that works \n     well. Why would making my investment decisions for me be any \n     different. Looking at it from a business perspective, would \n     the owner of a corporation feel comfortable if the government \n     were the primary shareholder?\n\n  Todd Lawrence understands what President Clinton apparently does not. \nNo corporation would want the Government as a shareholder, and no \ninvestor would want the Government handling their investment.\n  Even if the Government were able to invest without adding new levels \nof inefficiency to the process, the Government putting Social Security \ntaxes in the stock market adds an unacceptable level of risk to \nretirement. This risk is a gamble I am unwilling to make for the one \nmillion Missourians who are the recipients of Social Security. This \namendment puts Congress on record that Government will not gamble \nSocial Security in the stock market.\n  While I understand the impulse to attempt to harness the great \npotential of the stock market, significant Government involvement in \nthe stock market could tend toward economic nationalization, excess \nGovernment involvement in private financial markets, and short-term, \npolitically motivated investment decisions that could diminish Social \nSecurity's potential rate of return.\n  It is hard to overestimate how dangerous this scheme really is. \nImagine, if you will, what would happen if the Government had $2.7 \ntrillion in the market on Black Monday, October 19, 1987, when the \nstock market lost 22 percent of its value. The trust fund's owners, \nAmerica's current and future retirees, would have lost a collective \ntotal of $633 billion that day alone. Imagine seniors who depend on \nSocial Security watching television, watching the news of the stock \nmarket collapse, wondering, even fearing, their Social Security would \nbe in danger.\n\n  While individuals properly manage their financial portfolios to \ncontrol risk, the Government has no business taking these gambles with \nthe people's money.\n  Even President Clinton has expressed skepticism with this idea. In \nAlbuquerque last year, the President said the following,\n\n       I think most people just think if there is going to be a \n     risk taken, I'd rather take it than have the government take \n     it for me.\n\n  He was right then and he is wrong now. While Americans as individuals \nshould invest as much as they can, as much as they can afford in their \nprivate equities to plan for their own retirements, the Government \nshould stay out of the stock market.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the \namendment put forward by the Senator from Missouri. I join him in this \namendment and I join him in the sentiment that he has put forward and \narticulated, I think very well, about the potential problems and \npitfalls if we go this route of the Government investing the Social \nSecurity trust fund surplus in the stock market.\n  Now, a lot of us would say if we want to have private sector \nindividuals take certain portions of their surplus and put them in \ninvestments they deem worthy and sound, that is one thing to consider; \nbut when you have the Government looking at potentially investing $2.7 \ntrillion over a period of time and directing that in the stock market, \nI think you are asking for a whole boat load of problems.\n  Having the Government invest the Social Security trust fund in the \nstock market, I believe, is dangerous because of the Government having \ncross-purposes when it frequently seeks to do various things.\n  We heard the Senator from Missouri talk about some ``for instances.'' \nIf we have a poor economy taking place and people are looking around \nsaying what can we do to stimulate the economy, what we need to do is \nput more money in the stock market to stimulate its growth and \nhopefully that will stimulate the economy. People say, ``Raid the trust \nfund and move it into the stock market.'' That may be a fine thing for \nmacroeconomics, it may not be. It could be a very poor thing for Social \nSecurity and trust funds and pension funds. We should look at these as \npeople's pension funds. That is just not a wise policy to take place.\n  We could also have all sorts of political pressures--the Senator from \nMissouri or the Senator from Kansas saying, ``Not enough of this money \nis being placed by the Government into Kansas. I think they ought to be \ninvesting more money in Kansas rather than less money,'' so I start \nlobbying, or others do, to get the Government to invest more of the \nSocial Security money, these pension funds of the American public, into \nKansas.\n\n  That may be a good and laudable purpose. From my perspective, it is a \ngreat purpose. Is that the sort of thing we ought to be doing with our \npension funds, though? Is that the sort of cross-purpose that we should \ninvite by encouraging and allowing the Federal Government to invest \nmoney in the private stock market? I think not.\n  President Clinton has suggested that the Government invest up to $700 \nbillion in surplus payroll taxes in the stock market. I applaud the \nPresident for recognizing the strength of our economy. I have to \nseriously question this proposal. The dangers of a Government-\ncontrolled economy are vast and they are far reaching. Socializing our \nfree market economy through Government-controlled investments in the \nstock market would have a chilling effect on future economic growth. \nThe markets would become more sensitive to the executive branch \ndecisions and less sensitive to market forces and factors.\n  The potential abuses are easily seen, and I have already articulated \na couple of them. Businesses that are not supportive of the \nadministration could be punished and those that are supportive would be \nrewarded. Again, a cross-purpose with people's pension money--not a \ngood idea.\n  Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan has been previously quoted as \nsaying he deems this to be a bad idea for Social Security and a bad \nidea for the economy.\n  I think his one quote bears repeating at this time because it goes to \nthe heart of the issue. Alan Greenspan said he ``does not believe that \nit is politically feasible to insulate such huge funds from a \ngovernmental direction.''\n  Now, imagine that--$700 billion multiplied over time being directed \nby Government and an administration that might be at cross purposes \nwith saying what is the best thing to do for these pension funds, or \neven if we had the best of purposes, you are going to invite \nmanipulation taking place in the market with pension funds.\n  The last thing this country needs is the Federal Government directing \nthe investment of Social Security funds based on politics. That is \nsimply what we are inviting if we seek to have the Government do this \ninvestment. This is something private individuals should do. They \nshould be allowed to do that on certain portions of it, but the \nGovernment should not.\n  Our amendment states that it is the sense of the Senate that the \nGovernment should not be allowed to invest the trust funds in the stock \nmarket. I hope all of our colleagues, seeing the dangers of this \nproposal, will vote in favor of our amendment.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I would like to speak for 6 minutes on this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 6 minutes.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise as an original cosponsor of the \nAshcroft-Brownback amendment voicing opposition to the President's plan \nof having the Federal Government invest our Social Security funds in \nthe stock market.\n\n[[Page S3199]]\n\n  We all understand and, hopefully, agree that, if left unchanged, the \nfuture of Social Security is in jeopardy, as the program will begin \nrunning deficits in 2013 when 71 million baby boomers begin collecting \nretirement benefits. We know the number of retirees will double between \n2008 and 2018, narrowing the ratio of workers to beneficiaries to less \nthan 3-to-1. I point out that in 1950 there were 16 workers for every \nsingle beneficiary. We all know that all trust funds, if they even \nexist, will be completely exhausted in 2032.\n  We have a responsibility to save this program from a fate that \neveryone agrees will happen without change. The Ashcroft-Brownback \namendment is a solid first step in assuring the American people that \nCongress is committed to fixing this problem, while preempting the \nPresident's ``Big Brother'' philosophy. I am deeply concerned by the \nmessage the President is sending to the American people. The very \nreason Social Security has a solvency problem is that it is a federally \nadministered program with IOUs that are disguised as real trust funds.\n  The President wants to right a wrong with another wrong. Not only has \nhe failed to provide Congress with actual reform legislation, the \nSocial Security Administration has neglected its responsibility to make \nlegislative recommendations to Congress as well. To think that the \nPresident now wants to embrace the benefits of private aggregate \ninvestment by playing the stock market and have Government select the \nwinners and the losers is simply bad policy.\n  Last week, I spent 13 hours in executive session in the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee marking up S. 326, the \nPatients' Bill of Rights. We debated a sizable number of amendments. \nMembers of the committee may have substantially disagreed on a majority \nof these amendments, but there was no conflict regarding individual \ncontrol and choice over one's health care. It is a fundamental premise \nthat respects each person's right to exert some control over decisions \ninvolving their own health.\n  During that debate, several of my Democratic colleagues touted \npatient control and choice. Why, then, why isn't that choice and \ncontrol being extended to Social Security? Is a person's health care \nmore sensitive or politically appealing than that person's Social \nSecurity? I have trouble separating the two. However, the President \nseems to have found a way to advocate consumer control and choice in \nhealth care while denying individuals that same right with their Social \nSecurity.\n  The lack of consistency in the President's message is disturbing. If \nthe President really believes in personal control and choice, he should \nabandon the notion of federal government investment of America's \nretirement on the stock market and support personal investment \naccounts. That's choice. That's giving Americans some say in this \ndebate. Taxpayers don't need big brother to make this decision nor do \nthey want it to. But the President's plan would authorize the federal \ngovernment to invest hard-earned payroll tax dollars on the stock \nmarket. No personal control, choice or say by the individual. The \nPresident needs to stop polling and start listening to what the \nmajority of Americans want.\n  The Ashcroft/Brownback amendment is an insurance policy for the \nAmerican people. It insures them that their Social Security will not be \ninvested and managed by the federal government--an idea that's been \ncondemned by Federal Reserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan; Comptroller \nGeneral for the General Accounting Office, David Walker; and, \nCongressional Budget Office Director Dan Crippen--all three are federal \nagency heads. Is the President listening to them?\n  How about the labor community? I received a letter signed by 10 \nprominent labor unions--including the Teamsters, United Workers of \nAmerica, United Steel Workers as well as the United Mine Workers \nindicating their opposition of ``the President's proposal to allow the \ngovernment itself to invest part of the Social Security Trust Fund \nsurpluses in corporate stocks and bonds.'' Is the President listening \nto them?\n  While serving on the Senate Labor Committee, I rarely see organized \nlabor and the business community agree. This issue, however, is one \nexception. The Alliance for Worker Retirement Security, which the \nNational Association of Manufacturers founded last year, strongly \ncriticized President Clinton's plan to have the government manage the \ninvestment of Social Security trust funds in the stock market. \nAccording to NAM, ``government ownership--in other words, control of \nprivate enterprise--is a mockery of the principles on which this \ncountry is founded.''\n  A majority of opinions agree that the President's message is flawed \nand that it constitutes bad policy. We often have trouble arriving at a \nconsensus in the Senate. But since federal agency heads, the labor \ncommunity and the business community share the same concern, this \nAdministration and the Senate have a duty to listen.\n  I strongly support the Ashcroft/Brownback amendment and I'm pleased \nto be an original cosponsor. It shows that the Senate isn't turning a \nblind eye on this important policy decision. I urge my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle to vote in favor of this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Ashcroft \namendment. This Sense of the Senate expresses the Senate's opposition \nto the Federal government directly investing the Social Security Trust \nFunds in the nation's financial markets, that is, making the Federal \ngovernment or Social Security the owner of stocks and bonds.\n  The risks of this kind of investing are well known, but bear \nrepeating. Put simply, many believe, with good reason, that there would \nbe a strong, irresistible temptation by future Administrations or \nCongresses to invest according to political considerations, rather than \nseeking the best rate of return. Let us consider just a few of these \nways. For example, some stocks might be avoided because of public \npolicy concerns. For example, last year the State of Minnesota decided \nto divest tobacco stocks from its state employee pension fund, losing \n$2 million in the process. Others might want to invest in particular \nbusinesses to create or protect jobs.\n  But even if proponents of direct Federal investing are right that \nfirewalls could be built to insulate Trust Funds investments from \npolitical considerations, such investing would almost certainly be \ncontentious. Americans are very diverse, with diverse views, and groups \nwould almost certainly organize to bring those views to bear on Trust \nFund investing. Frankly, we need to solve Social Security's future \nproblems, not add new ones.\n  Nonetheless, there is broad, bipartisan agreement that the future of \nSocial Security may be improved by reaping higher returns from \ninvestments in the nation's securities markets, in stocks and bonds. \nThe President has generally endorsed this approach, as well as many \nlawmakers, economists and other policy experts, and millions of average \nAmericans. The issue is how to conduct such investments.\n  One promising approach is personal retirement accounts. While \nproposals differ, personal retirement accounts would provide each \nworking American with an investment account he or she owns. With even \nconservative investment in stocks and bonds and the power of compound \ninterest, personal retirement accounts can provide a substantial \nretirement nest egg.\n  Indeed, I have introduced legislation, S. 263, the Personal \nRetirement Accounts Act of 1999, that would get accounts up and running \nwith a portion of the budget surplus.\n  Still others may have ideas to secure the benefits of investments for \nSocial Security. In my view, the more ideas the better regarding \ninvestment--as long as the Federal government is not the owner of \nrecord.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 147\n\n(Purpose: To use any Federal budget surplus to save Social Security and \n                            Medicare first)\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the amendment that I am offering says \nsimply, let us lock up in a safe-deposit box every penny of Social \nSecurity surplus and, in addition to that, 40 percent of the non-Social \nSecurity surplus for Medicare.\n  Mr. President, that is what this depicts: Social Security's and \nMedicare's first lockbox. Let's save the Social Security surplus over \nthe next 10 years. That is $1.8 trillion. And we save every penny of \nthe Social Security surplus each and every year.\n  In addition, we say let's also save 40 percent of the non-Social \nSecurity surplus for Medicare. These are the two top priorities of the \nAmerican people. We say let's reserve funds for both of them. Let's \nmake certain that there are sufficient resources to do the reforms that \nare necessary to strengthen and preserve both Social Security and \nMedicare.\n  As I have looked at the lockbox offered by our friends across the \naisle, it seems to me that there is a deficiency. I call this ``the \nbroken safe,'' because, while I commend our friends on the other side \nof the aisle for locking up the Social Security surplus, they forgot \nsomething. They forgot Medicare.\n  I am simply saying we ought to not only reserve the Social Security \nsurplus for Social Security, but we ought to also provide for Medicare. \nMedicare is on the brink of insolvency. In fact, it is closer to going \nunder than Social Security. So let's take the top priorities of the \nAmerican people and put them at the top of the list for the Congress as \nwell.\n  Let me make clear that under this plan we would have $1.8 trillion \nover the next 10 years for Social Security. We would have over $370 \nbillion for Medicare. But those aren't the only priorities. And we \nunderstand there would also be money left over--some $385 billion over \nthe 10 years--for top domestic priorities, including education, \ndefense, and health care and, yes, tax relief for hard-pressed American \nfamilies, but the difference is one of priorities.\n\n[[Page S3201]]\n\n  If I could go to this next chart and show the comparison, under the \nplan that we are offering we are saving Social Security and Medicare \nfirst because we think those are the priorities of the American people. \nWe save 100 percent of the Social Security surplus in every year. We \nsave 40 percent of the non-Social Security surplus for Medicare. \nOverall, we are saving 77 percent of the unified surplus in comparison \nto 62 percent in the Republican plan. That means we are paying down \nmore of the publicly held debt than the plan offered by our friends \nacross the aisle. In fact, we will pay down $300 billion more of the \npublicly held debt under the plan that I am offering in this amendment \nthan the plan of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle.\n  So, over 15 years, we reserve $700 billion for Medicare, over $370 \nbillion for 10 years, but over 15 years over $700 billion for Medicare. \nOur friends on the other side, on the other hand, have tax cuts of over \n$700 billion over that same period. But they have not one dime of the \nsurplus saved for Medicare.\n  Mr. President, we think that is a mistake.\n  If we look at the combination and compare the two plans, here is what \nwe see. The Republican plan is in blue. The plan I am offering is in \nred. In the years 2000 to 2004, the Republican plan would save $768 \nbillion. We would save $833 billion for Social Security and Medicare. \nAnd over a 10-year period, the Republican plan would save about $1.8 \ntrillion. We would save $2.155 trillion, because not only again are we \nprotecting every dollar of the Social Security surplus for Social \nSecurity, but in addition we are reserving funds out of the surplus for \nMedicare. Why? Because no part of the Federal budget is in greater \ndanger than Medicare. And, yes, we need to reform the program.\n\n  In addition to that, we need to put additional resources into \nMedicare to extend its solvency. Right now we know that Medicare is \nthreatened by the year 2008. What is going to happen? What is going to \nhappen to the millions of Americans who rely for their health care on \nthe Medicare system? Not only is it important to our grandparents, it \nis important to their children, because what happens if the health care \nof their parents are not provided for? What happens if the promise is \nnot kept? I think we all understand what happens. The responsibility \nand the debts shift, and the children will be put in an impossible \nposition as well.\n  I believe this amendment reflects the priorities of the American \npeople. The Republican plan basically says save money for Social \nSecurity. I commend them for that part of the plan. But almost all of \nthe rest of the money they say is reserved for a tax cut will go \ndisproportionately to the wealthiest among us.\n  We say those are not the priorities of the American people. Instead, \nwe ought to save every dollar of the Social Security surplus. But we \nalso ought to reserve 40 percent of the non-Social Security surplus for \nMedicare. That will still leave nearly $400 billion available for high-\npriority domestic concerns like education, defense, health care, and, \nyes, for tax relief as well.\n  That we believe reflects the priorities of the American people better \nthan those offered by the other side. They have in their plan over $800 \nbillion reserved for tax cuts. They don't have one penny reserved out \nof the surplus for Medicare--not one penny. Mr. President, we don't \nthink that is the right set of priorities.\n  I remind my colleagues of what they said last year in the Budget \nCommittee debate. This is the chairman of the Budget Committee, the \nvery able Senator Domenici. Last year he said this.\n\n       . . . Let me tell you, for every argument made around this \n     table today about saving Social Security, you can now put it \n     in the bank that the problems associated with fixing Medicare \n     are bigger than the problems fixing Social Security, bigger \n     in dollars, more difficulty in terms of the kind of reform \n     necessary, and, frankly, I am for saving Social Security. But \n     it is most interesting that there are some who want to \n     abandon Medicare . . . when it is the most precarious program \n     we have got.\n\n  Senator Domenici was right then. What a difference a year makes. I \nwish this budget reflected those priorities.\n  He went on to say:\n\n       . . . [W]e are very concerned about the long-term effect \n     our population demographics will have on Medicare, and we are \n     of the strong opinion that the second objective of this \n     budget should be to preserve Medicare.\n       . . . We think the best way to do something commensurate \n     with the depletion in the budget is to pledge any extra \n     resources we have, not generating programs, but, rather, \n     putting them in Medicare where they ought to be.\n\n  Again, the distinguished Senator from New Mexico was absolutely \nright. We ought to put additional resources that come to us to secure \nMedicare for the future as well as Social Security.\n  And Senator Gramm of Texas said just a year ago in the Budget \nCommittee, and I quote:\n\n       . . . [W]hat would we do if we had a half a trillion \n     dollars to spend? . . . The obvious answer that cries out is \n     Medicare.\n       . . . I think it is logical. People understood the \n     President on save Social Security first, and I think they \n     will understand save Medicare first.\n       . . . Medicare is in crisis. We want to save Medicare \n     first.\n\n  That is Senator Gramm of Texas, just a year ago. What has happened? \nWhy is there not a dime of the surplus reserved for Medicare in the \nplan of our Republican friends? There is not one dime locked away for \nMedicare. They will say: But we do have a surplus of $100 billion that \nwe have not spent, that is really for Medicare. But, you know what, \nthey did not do anything to protect it for Medicare, not one thing. \nNothing has been done to protect one penny of that $100 billion for \nMedicare.\n  Do you know what else, that money is also required for emergencies \nover the next 10 years. If we go back and look at the last 10 years, we \nknow that $100 billion will be spent just for emergencies because we \nare spending about $9 billion a year for emergencies. Over the next 10 \nyears, including debt service, we will use up that $100 billion of \ntheir reserve just for disasters.\n  That leads me to the conclusion that without question they have not \nlocked up one penny of surpluses for Medicare. The $100 billion that \nthey talk about has not been protected for Medicare, not a dime of it. \nAnd every penny of it will likely be used for disasters and other \nemergencies because that has been the historical record.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Even if they use the $100 billion, what part of the \nMedicare deficit would that make up?\n  It is my understanding that would not even begin to make a \ndownpayment in terms of the financial insecurity of the Medicare trust \nfund. Could the Senator address that issue? Because I agree with the \nSenator, it has been pointed out by those on the other side about how \nmuch they have done for Medicare when, as the Senator has pointed out, \nthere is not one additional cent, not one new cent. They are going to \nfund the program with $190 billion which would be expended on the \nMedicare for current services. But not one additional cent.\n  But even if they allocated the $100 billion for Medicare, given what \nthe Medicare trust fund trustees have indicated was going to be a \ndeficit of some $686 billion, how significant would that really be in \nterms of giving a guarantee to our elderly people in this country?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, unfortunately, when you pierce the veil on \nthis one, what you find is there is not anything left. There is not any \npart of that money that is protected for Medicare, not a dime. There is \n$100 billion that is not spent in their budget plan, but based on our \nhistory we know it will probably all go for disasters and emergencies. \nThere will not be any money available to strengthen Medicare. There \nwill not be any money available to extend the solvency of Medicare.\n  That is why I think this amendment is fundamentally important. \nBecause we are saying: Yes, absolutely, save every penny of the Social \nSecurity surplus for Social Security. But, of the rest of the surplus, \nthe non-Social Security surplus, we save 40 percent of it, lock it up, \nprotect it by special budget points of order so it cannot be raided, it \ncannot be looted. It is there to strengthen Medicare.\n  These are the top priorities of the American people: Medicare and \nSocial Security. We believe we ought to provide protection for both. \nThat is the essence of my amendment and I hope my colleagues will \nsupport it.\n\n[[Page S3202]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for one more question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Could I ask the Senator to open up the copy of S. Con. \nRes. 20 to page 5? As I understand it, as you go down to lines 18, 19, \n20 and 21, under the Republican budget, even for that fund that has \nbeen designated, $100 billion as I read that, there would be a deficit \nin the year 2000 of $6 billion; in fiscal year 2001 it is zero; in 2002 \nit is zero; in 2003 it is zero; and in 2004 it is only $2.8 billion.\n  So even under the proposal that our friends talk about, there will \nnot be any funds available, as I understand this, for the next 5 years. \nSo, whether you are talking about disaster relief or inadequate funding \nfor Medicare, even with the kind of restrictions that have been put on \nthis fund that might be used for prescription drugs, we are talking \nabout 5 years where there really is not anything there.\n\n  Am I correct?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator is exactly correct. He is reading the table \nexactly in the correct way. I might just say to my friend, the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, really I think our friends across the aisle have \nabout spent this $100 billion three or four times. Because, to anybody \nwho comes to them and says there are any deficiencies in their budgets, \nthey say we have $100 billion we have not spent.\n  Of course all that money, based on history, will go for emergencies \nand disasters, every penny of it. That is why they have not put one \npenny of the surplus into a Medicare lockbox, because they really want \nto spend that money two, three, or four times. They say to the Medicare \npeople who are interested in Medicare, ``We have that $100 billion. It \nwill go for Medicare.'' They say to those who are concerned about \ndisasters, ``We have funded that. We have this hundred billion we have \nnot spent. It's available for disasters and emergencies.'' They say to \nanybody else, ``Your money is in that pot of $100 billion.''\n  Surprise, surprise, there are going to be an awful lot of people \nlining up for that $100 billion who will find there is nothing there \nfor them because the money has all gone for disasters and emergencies. \nThat is really what it is reserved for. There is really not a penny of \nsurplus that is lockboxed for Medicare--not a dime.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is an attempt to protect Social \nSecurity, to protect Medicare, to allow us to get ready for the \nchallenge we face. We all understand Medicare is under enormous \npressure. Social Security is under enormous pressure. Both of them need \nto be addressed. This is our opportunity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I think Senator Judd Gregg wants to \nspeak about the amendment we set aside, and I yield him time for that \nat this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from New Mexico \nfor this excellent bill. I think he has done a superb job of putting \ntogether a budget which is responsible and appropriates for the future \nof this country.\n  As long as we are on the subject, I also wanted to comment a little \nbit about the proposal of the Senator from North Dakota, because he \nkeeps comparing some sort of lockbox concept on Medicare with the \nSocial Security lockbox which is in our budget, which is in the \nRepublican budget. You really cannot compare the two. You are comparing \napples and oranges.\n  The Social Security lockbox that the Senator from New Mexico has \ncreated, along with the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Abraham, is a real \nlockbox. It takes money which is being raised from the wage earner \ntoday under the FICA tax, the Social Security tax, and which is \ncreating a surplus in the Social Security fund, and it keeps that money \nto benefit the Social Security fund. That is a very important point, \nbecause there is no money being proposed by the other side that comes \nfrom the Medicare fund which would be locked up and protected for \nMedicare.\n  What the other side is suggesting is that the Medicare trust fund \nshould dip into the general fund, which, for Part A, is not \ntraditionally done. And then we should take money from the general fund \nand transfer it over to support the Medicare trust fund. This is a \nwhole new concept. It is an invasion of the general fund. It is a use \nof general tax revenues to support Medicare, Part A. That is the \npractical impact of the proposal of the other side.\n  If the other side really wanted to address Medicare, if it wanted to \naddress it within the context of the revenue being raised by Medicare, \nif it wanted to have people who are paying Medicare premiums covered by \nMedicare, have those premiums fully ensure them, then the other side \nwould have agreed with the Commission that was chaired by a Senator \nfrom the other side, Senator Breaux. Because that Commission put \nforward a proposal which the majority of that Commission supported, \nincluding two of the Democratic Senators, which essentially put in \nplace a structure to assure the solvency of Medicare. It was a good \nproposal. Yet when that proposal came forward, the rug was pulled out \nfrom under the chairman of that Commission, who was a Democrat, and the \nother members of that Commission, who had worked so hard to put \ntogether the proposal. A legitimate way of resolving the Medicare \nproblem was essentially walked away from by the administration and by \nthe other side of the aisle.\n\n  Now they come forward with this crocodile-tear approach relative to \nMedicare, which is exactly what it is. If they cared about Medicare, \nthey would have supported the President's Commission. They would have \nsupported the proposal from the President's Commission, and they \ndidn't. They refused to do that. They certainly wouldn't be taking \ngeneral funds to subsidize the Medicare Part A, which is what they are \nproposing under this. There is absolutely no comparison between what \nthe Senator from New Mexico has done in absolutely protecting the \nSocial Security trust fund under the lockbox, protecting FICA money to \nbe used for Social Security, as compared with what is being proposed \nhere by the Senator from North Dakota, which is to take general funds \nto support Medicare.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will please come to order.\n  Mr. GREGG. If you wanted to help Medicare, if you wanted to make it \nsolvent, you would have supported the proposals that came out of that \nCommission, the majority of that Commission.\n  There is another point to make here. That is this: You have to look \nat what was actually proposed by the President to see whether or not \nthere was a sincere effort to address this issue or whether there was a \npolitical effort to address this issue. On the issue of Social \nSecurity, the President's budget, as it was sent to us, would have \nspent $158 billion of Social Security funds for general operations of \nthe Government. It would have invaded the surplus of Social Security to \nthe extent of $158 billion. Senator Domenici and Senator Abraham's \nproposal does not allow that to happen. They say the Social Security \nsurplus shall be sacred; it shall be used for senior citizens.\n  They do not say, as the President has said and as the other side has \nsaid, if they are supporting the President's proposal, that the Social \nSecurity fund is only sacred to the extent that we want it to be \nsacred, but if we have some special program, whether it is building \nschools or spending money on defense or, I guess in the case of Al \nGore, trying to correct the traffic problems in D.C., we are going to \ninvade the Social Security fund to do that.\n  Specifically, they were going to invade the Social Security fund to \nthe extent of $158 billion.\n  So there is an issue of truth in budgeting here that has to be \naddressed. Our budget honestly saves the Social Security fund. Their \nbudget didn't save the Social Security fund at all. In fact, it invaded \nthe fund for the purposes of operating the general Government. So there \nis a lack of consistency, as there is a lack of consistency on this \nMedicare hyperbole we are hearing from the other side, which is that \nthey want to use the general fund to fund Medicare.\n  I originally rose to address, however, the amendment by Senator \nAshcroft, which I think is an extraordinarily\n\n[[Page S3203]]\n\ngood amendment. It addresses another element of the President's \nproposal on Social Security, which is that the Federal Government \nshould become the shepherd of the marketplace, that we should \nessentially have a reverse nationalization or take the Federal trust \nfunds of Social Security and nationalize the capital markets of this \ncountry by having the trustees of the Social Security trust fund invest \nin the capital markets, in the equity markets, and control those \ninvestments as a block.\n\n  This is a really terrible idea. I mean, bad ideas come through this \nplace occasionally; really, too often bad ideas come through this \nplace. But when a really bad idea comes through this place, everybody \nshould be concerned. You don't have to listen to me to see what a bad \nidea this is. All you have do is listen to Chairman Greenspan, who says \nthat this would basically pervert the marketplace, pervert the flow of \ncapital, and would inevitably lead to a diminution of our ability as a \nnation to be more competitive.\n  Or, if you want to listen to some other group that maybe is more \nliberal leaning, listen to the Democratic leadership of the UAW and the \nmajor labor unions of this country.\n  This is their statement relative to the investment of Social Security \ntrust funds surpluses:\n\n       In particular, we are deeply troubled that stock market \n     investments of the Social Security surpluses would result in \n     public tax revenues being used to finance the construction of \n     runaway steel mills in Thailand, apparel sweatshops in \n     Malaysia, auto plants in New Mexico. . ..\n\n  The list goes on and on. They oppose that investment. Why do they \noppose it? They oppose it because they do not want money of the trust \nfund being invested in stocks, which they deem to be undertaking \npolitical activity that is inappropriate. That is the whole reason not \nto do it, of course. They are making the case for why we should not \nhave public investment in the stock market by the Social Security \ntrustees.\n  The issue is this. If the Social Security trustees are going to \ninvest and they are going to invest in the equity markets, they should \ndo so in a manner which allows them to invest on the rate of return, \nnot on the basis of some political issue. But the UAW and the USWA and \nthe other labor unions are saying, no, any investment in companies that \nmight be running a steel mill in Thailand or a sweatshop in Malaysia or \nan auto plant in Mexico or an electronics plants in China, that would \nbe the wrong investment.\n  So we know exactly what is going to happen. The first time the Social \nSecurity trustees happen to invest in, let's say, a tobacco company, \nthere is going to be a bunch of folks on this floor who are going to \nsay: You cannot make that investment, Mr. Social Security trustee. You \nhave got to abandon that investment. You have to let go of that \ninvestment no matter what the rate of return is.\n  So investments aren't going to be made on the basis of what the rate \nof return is. They are not going to be made for the best interests of \nretirees. They are going to be made for the best interests of what \nhappens to be the political fad at the moment. That, of course, is why \neveryone agrees, except for the President and those who support his \nplan, that this is a really terrible idea. This is one of those really \nbad ideas that comes through here every so often and should be killed.\n  Of course, the Ashcroft amendment accomplishes that or at least makes \na statement to that effect, that we should not go forward.\n  If you don't think this is a problem, think about the size of the \namount of money that may be invested here. By the year 2035, you are \ntalking about a $2.1 trillion investment, which would be controlled by \nthe Social Security trustees; that investment being in private \nequities. This isn't the whole trust fund. This is just the percentage \nof the trust fund which would actually be invested in the private \nmarkets--$2.16 trillion. That is a huge function. Think of the impact \nthat would have on the market if suddenly the Senate said: Well, Social \nSecurity trustees, you cannot invest in autos, because we are upset \nabout the automobiles because of emissions; you cannot invest in some \nsort of food product, because we are upset that there may be a tainted \nfood; you cannot invest in some activity involving electronics, because \nmaybe there is a competition issue, such as Microsoft, you can't put \nany money in Microsoft.\n\n  What a perversion of the marketplace it would be if you had that \namount of money being invested on the basis of political events. Yet we \nknow that is what is going to happen, because we have already been told \nby the unions that they are going to make that case. If this ever \noccurs, they are going to argue that you shouldn't be able to invest \nthat way. They are going to pick different companies that shouldn't be \ninvested in.\n  As a practical matter, the opportunity for creating chaos in our \ncapital markets is huge, if we go down the President's route of \nallowing the Social Security trustees to control the investment, to \ncontrol the investment decisions as a unit, as a block. That is why \nthose of us have been supporting--and this is on both sides of the \naisle--personal accounts, which give individuals that decision, versus \nthe Social Security trustees that decision. It makes so much more \nsense.\n  Yes, we should have some sort of investment of the Social Security \ntrust funds in equities. Why? Because if you happen to be 25 years old \ntoday and you are working and you are paying FICA taxes, which happen \nto be very, very high taxes, you are never going to recover the amount \nof money you pay into the Social Security trust fund. This is \nespecially true if you are an African American. Why? Because the rate \nof return on those taxes that you are paying is extraordinarily low \nbecause, unfortunately, the benefit structure is so high and the \ngeneration that is about to retire is so large that they are going to \ntake all that money before you can get there to retire. So your rate of \nreturn represents basically a negative rate of return, if you about 20 \nto 25 years old. If you happen to be 25 to 35 years old, it is about \n1.1 percent. If you are 35 to 45 years old, it is about 2.5 percent. \nTerrible rates of return.\n  We do need to invest the Social Security trust fund in something \nother than what it is presently being invested in so that we can get a \nbetter rate of return. What is the logical place to do it? It is to put \nit in equity markets. But how you do it is the key. You cannot do it by \ngiving that control over that investment to the Social Security \ntrustees, because then you create an incentive for a perversion of the \nmarketplace by having the market adjusted by whatever happens to be the \nlocal political fad at the time. Rather, you have to give control over \nthe investment decision and ownership, most importantly over the asset, \nto the retiree, so that when you pay your taxes in FICA, you know that \nsome percentage of those taxes--you are actually going to own that \nretirement benefit. If you die before you turn 60, your estate will get \nthat benefit, and during your lifetime, you are going to be able to \nmake the decisions on how that benefit is invested so that the \ninvestments get the best return for you, not the political return for \nsome labor union or some fad of the moment.\n\n  This proposal by Senator Ashcroft is an excellent one. It is only a \nsense of the Senate, but I think it is a shot across the bow of an \nelement of the President's proposal on Social Security that needs to be \nmade, and I strongly support it. I hope it will receive strong support \nin the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to finish the unanimous consent \nrequest. I was interrupted because it had not been cleared.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the votes occur on, or in relation to, \nthe following four first-degree amendments at the conclusion, or \nyielding back, of time, and that no second-degree amendments be in \norder prior to the conclusion of the votes: Ashcroft amendment No. 145; \nConrad amendment No. 147 regarding Social Security; a Bond amendment \nregarding the President's budget; and a Kennedy amendment regarding \nMedicare.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am not sure when we will vote on that. \nI\n\n[[Page S3204]]\n\nam going to have to leave for a little while. Senator Kennedy has not \nargued and we have not responded, and I have not responded yet to \nSenator Conrad. Of course, Senator Bond wants to talk about the \nPresident's budget and let us have a vote on it.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. And the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And the distinguished Senator from New York wants to \nspeak.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I had a chance to talk about some of the matters during \nthe course of the afternoon, so I will be glad to work out a reasonable \ntime with the floor manager.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, maybe we can just start and take a \nlittle--I say to Senator Bond, how much time does the Senator think he \nneeds? I do not want to limit you.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, if I may respond, my initial presentation \nwill not be over 12 to 15 minutes, at the most. When we had debate on \nthis in the committee, a number of others wanted to join in. I do not \nknow whether there will be others who want to join either on my side or \nthe other side. But to answer the chairman's question, I personally \nneed only about 15 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Does anybody on the Democratic side have an idea of how \nlong they would want to speak?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Five minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We will get to you in a minute. We will give you time \nto speak in favor of the Conrad amendment.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Five minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. In opposition to the President's budget, does anybody \nhave any idea how much time? Fifteen minutes? A total of 30 minutes on \nthe President's budget sounds about right.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Twenty minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Kennedy wants 20 minutes. Why don't we just say \nif you take 20, we will allocate 20.\n  Mr. President, I say to Senator Conrad, is he finished? Does he want \nmore time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes, I would like more time after I hear the argument of \nthe distinguished chairman.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Moynihan wants 5 minutes on the Conrad \namendment; right?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Yes.\n  Mr. REED. Less than 10--10 will be fine, but I will try to be \nquicker.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Did the Senator say 5 is enough or 10?\n  Mr. REED. Ten.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am trying to see if we can start voting by 6:30. That \nwill help some of our Senators, and I am sure it will help Senators on \nthe other side.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Some of us need time to respond to the Conrad amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Adding up all this, it seems to me we need collectively \namong us 1 hour 45 minutes, which could put us in a position to start \nvoting at a quarter of 7. Can we set that as the time that we are going \nto start voting on these amendments in the order we have already \nagreed, and we will allocate the time as per the discussion here?\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from New Mexico yield the \nfloor?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I want to make sure we have an equivalent amount of time \non both sides. I don't know what you have taken down in terms of \nresponse on the Conrad amendment, but we want to make certain we have \nan equivalent amount of time on our side to answer.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the only thing is, the Senator has had a \nlong time to already talk, and we have not had any time to talk.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I understand. But now we are in a unanimous consent \nposture, and if we are going to do that, to get unanimous-consent we \nare going to have to have an equivalent amount of time or there will \nnot be a unanimous-consent agreement.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I cannot set the time, then. What I will ask--we all \nunderstand most of the players are here--why don't we do it this way: \nThe managers, respectively, can allocate the time, as per this \nunderstanding, to each Senator rather than entering into a consent \nagreement that binds us at this point. I think we are pretty close to \nhaving enough time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We will be ready to vote, then, at approximately 7 \no'clock.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Approximately, but I don't know that we want to set \nthat at this point. Approximately, the word should go out.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Fair enough.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nFitzgerald be added as a cosponsor to the Abraham amendment, which we \nagreed to earlier. I mistakenly did not ask for that, and I should \nhave.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will indicate that when I return I want to argue a \nfew moments with reference to the Conrad amendment, but in the \nmeantime, what I am going to do is ask Senator Gramm if he will manage \nthe bill for me. He has been here, so he can just as well accomplish \nwhat I have. That means at this point, we will recognize Senator Bond \nand set aside the previous amendments, as per the understanding we had \nheretofore.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair, and I thank my distinguished chairman.\n  Mr. CONRAD. May I intercede with a parliamentary inquiry?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. What is the pending business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Conrad amendment was debated and has been \nset aside.\n  Mr. CONRAD. How did the Conrad amendment get set aside?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It was set aside by consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Conrad amendment was set aside by \nunanimous-consent.\n  Mr. CONRAD. There was not consent on this side for setting aside the \nConrad amendment.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, as I understand the discussion that Senator \nDomenici just had, the target was to try to finish all of these \namendments at 6:30. Obviously, since we are going back and forth and \nsharing the time, the Senator, and anyone else, can debate his \namendment.\n  The objective was and the unanimous-consent request which was agreed \nto, as I understand, was that between now and 6:30, we would have these \namendments offered, but you can debate your amendment at any point and \nanyone on your side can debate it, and Senator Domenici and I will \ndebate it. We have been setting aside amendments to stack them, and \nthat, I understand from the Chair, is where we are. No one is trying to \npreclude the Senator from debating his amendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. There is apparently a misunderstanding on a UC for a \n6:30 deadline.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not an agreement.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. None exists.\n  Mr. GRAMM. That was the target that was set.\n  Mr. CONRAD. If I might just state, there was not consent granted to \ngo off the Conrad amendment, and the reason consent was not granted is \nwe have two Senators who have been here for a considerable amount of \ntime waiting to talk about the Conrad amendment. We allowed the other \nside to speak to their pending amendments. I twice gave consent for the \nother side to argue the amendment of Senator Ashcroft, and then it \nreturned to a discussion on the Conrad amendment.\n\n  I think it is only fair that those Members who are here be given a \nchance to address the Conrad amendment. They were here for that \npurpose, and then we go to the Bond amendment, which is on a different \nmatter and is a different amendment. So I ask, in fairness, that those \nSenators who are here, specifically Senator Reed of Rhode Island, and \nthe Senator from New York, be given an opportunity to discuss the \nConrad amendment which is the pending business. I did not give consent \nto going off my amendment to go to the next amendment.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we want to do everything we can to satisfy \nevery Member. No one is trying to deny the distinguished Senator the \nright to debate his amendment. But it is my\n\n[[Page S3205]]\n\nunderstanding that there was a unanimous consent request, and that it \nwas granted, so that we could set the amendment aside and offer these \nother amendments so that they would all be pending simultaneously and \nthat we would have the vote at approximately 6:45. No one agreed to the \nspecific time, but the general principle was largely agreed to.\n  On that basis, it is my understanding that Senator Bond has been \nrecognized. If that is not the case, if the Chair could give us a \nruling. We want to follow the regular order. And no one is trying to be \nunfair in any way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Conrad amendment was set aside, but a call \nfor the regular order will bring it back.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 147\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I call for the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the Conrad amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Amendment No. 147 previously proposed by the Senator from \n     North Dakota [Mr. Conrad].\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask that Senator Reed be recognized for \n10 minutes to speak on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I thank the Senator from North Dakota for yielding time to speak \nabout his amendment, the essence of which is protecting both the Social \nSecurity trust fund and also the Medicare fund.\n  One of the deficiencies in the Republican budget before us today is a \nfailure to seize a historic opportunity to strengthen the Medicare \nprogram in the United States. I argue it is not just an opportunity, \nbut it is a necessity. This is the program that benefits countless \nAmericans, it is the program that is strongly supported by all \nAmericans and it is the program that is facing serious challenges, \nserious demographic challenges, serious structural challenges.\n  One thing we can do at this moment to ensure that we have the \nopportunity to effectively address the issue of Medicare is to, in \nfact, invest dollars into the Medicare program today. But, regretfully, \nthe Republican budget proposal, rather than doing that, would reserve \nbudget surpluses for tax cuts, denying us the opportunity today to \nstrengthen the Medicare system.\n  We have come a long way since 1993 when we were looking each year at \nsoaring annual deficits in the order of $300 billion or more. Today, we \nare facing a unified surplus. With that unified surplus, we can do many \nthings. But I believe one of the principal things we must do is \nstrengthen both the Social Security system and the Medicare system. \nSenator Conrad's amendment goes a long way toward achieving that goal.\n  Because of our prudent fiscal decisions over the last 6 years, we \nhave seen a growing economy. We have seen growing prosperity. All of \nthis is contributing to a future, we anticipate, of unified budget \nsurpluses. Simply to step back now and say the work is done, now we can \nsimply initiate tax cuts, misses the point. And that point is, we have \nto protect, we have to ensure the longevity, the stability, the \npredictability of the Social Security system and the Medicare system.\n  Now, of the two, the Medicare system faces the most immediate threat. \nBy the year 2008, the trust funds are projected to become insolvent. \nThis is a situation that requires immediate action. The most prudent \nthing to do is to reserve the resources to meet this impending \nsituation of insolvency. There are, as I said before, millions of \nAmericans who depend upon it, and not just those direct beneficiaries.\n  We have come--all of us have come--to a sense of appreciation and, in \nfact, consideration that if any of our relatives, our mothers, our \nfathers, our aunts or uncles, would be sick, they would have the \nMedicare system to fall back on. That allows young families the freedom \nto know that the health care of their parents will be protected. It \ngives them the freedom to concentrate on their own needs and the needs \nof their children. So this is not just a situation with respect to \nseniors; this is a situation that affects all Americans.\n  We tried in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 to make changes to \nprolong longevity of the Medicare trust fund. Today, we are beginning \nto realize that some of these changes have created negative \nconsequences. In fact, we are looking to make some adjustments so that \nwe can guarantee quality health care for all of our seniors.\n  We have come to know that we have to make structural changes in \nMedicare, but it has to be done carefully and thoughtfully. We have \nalso come to appreciate, I hope, that we must have the resources \navailable, because the health care needs of seniors are not going to go \naway. In fairness, and in keeping faith with seniors, we have to make \nsure those resources are available.\n\n  We will have to make hard choices about the structure of the Medicare \nprogram. But these choices will be infinitely more difficult if we take \nthe path that is suggested by the budget resolution, that is, if we \ndeny additional resources to the Medicare program.\n  I argue that in order to keep the faith of our seniors and our whole \npopulation, we have to make sure that we use the projected surplus to \nstrengthen the Medicare system, and that the idea of using the surplus \nto finance tax cuts, while we face an impending crisis in Medicare, is \nthe wrong policy. We have to, as I said before, ensure that we have the \nresources to confront the situation we face. And the situation we face, \nfrankly, is one where the demands on Medicare will increase. We know \nthat. Part of it is as a result of demographics.\n  Today, 39 million Americans are beneficiaries in the Medicare \nprogram. But by the year 2032, 78 million Americans will be eligible \nfor Medicare. In terms of the sheer volume of new beneficiaries, we \nhave to start reserving sufficient funds to meet their needs now. Not \nto do that, and to dissipate those funds through tax cuts, I think, \nmight provide momentary benefits, but in the long run we will regret \nthis.\n  We have to also recognize the fact that seniors will live longer, \nprobably 6 years longer than they have in the past, so that the issues \nof health care for seniors will not get smaller in the future; they \nwill become more and more important.\n  For all of these reasons, it is important today to recognize that we \nmust maintain the strength and the resources for the Medicare program. \nThat is why the amendments we are debating today, to a degree Senator \nConrad's, in some respects Senator Kennedy's amendment, go to the \nsimple truth: We have, through very difficult decisions over the last \nseveral years, reached a situation where we have a unified budget \nsurplus. The question is whether we will take that surplus and \nstrengthen Medicare, make it available for the next generation of \nAmericans, and give us the opportunity to make structural changes, not \nout of dire necessity but because it will provide additional strength \nto the Medicare program. Or we will take these resources and dissipate \nthem through tax cuts, which will not strengthen the Medicare system. \nIn fact, when the system develops increased stresses and strains in the \nfuture, the budget resolution will leave us without the resources to \nstep into the breach and do what we must do--keep the promise to our \nseniors, keep the promise to those who have relied upon and continue to \nrely upon Medicare.\n  So I urge careful consideration of these amendments. I hope, at the \nend of the day, we will have a budget that recognizes the opportunity \nand the necessity to invest in Medicare today so that it is there \ntomorrow for all of our citizens.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, normally we would go back and forth, but \nSenator Moynihan is here and doesn't have a lengthy statement. As a \ncourtesy to him I want to allow him to speak now and then have the \nrotation come back to me.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank my good friend from Texas.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment of my friend from \nNorth Dakota, Senator Conrad. He proposes a budget point of order \nagainst the use of the Social Security surplus for new spending or tax \ncuts. He would also devote 15 percent of the unified surplus to \nMedicare.\n\n[[Page S3206]]\n\n  There is broad agreement in the Senate that the Social Security \nsurplus must be protected. Senator Conrad's approach, in my view, is \nthe right one, unlike a competing proposal under discussion. That \nproposal would create a new declining debt ceiling on debt held by the \npublic. Inadvertently, but inevitably, it would jeopardize the credit \nof the United States by hampering the ability of the Treasury to meet \nthe obligations of the Government, absent any financial crisis, but \nmerely as a mechanical result of a bill.\n  Happily, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have not \nbrought the proposal to the floor yet, but the budget resolution \nincludes ``advisory levels'' for such a new debt limit, and the \nCommittee Report states that ``it is assumed that separate and apart \nfrom the budget resolution a statute will be enacted to enforce these \nlevels.''\n  A simple explanation: We are going to buy down the debt. It is \nentirely correct that we should do so. However, anything can happen--a \ndrought to the Midwest, a correction in the markets, a rise in the \nprice of imported oil. In such an event, the revenues of the \nGovernment, although growing, will not have grown quite fast enough to \nhave the debt being retired drop to the required level. In that \ncircumstance, that perfectly prosperous economy, perfectly stable \ngovernment, could find itself in default.\n  We have shut down the U.S. Government any number of times in the \ncourse of our history. We have never defaulted on our debt. It is the \nmost secure instrument in the world. There is no reason whatever to put \nit in jeopardy at a time when we are making it even more secure by \nbringing the debt down to normal levels.\n  I hope we will not do that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the Secretary of the \nTreasury be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                       Department of the Treasury,\n\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                   March 17, 1999.\n     Hon. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Pat: Thank you for inquiring about the impact of the \n     new debt limits contained in the Social Security Surplus \n     Preservation Act. I appreciate the opportunity to respond to \n     your question. In brief, I am deeply concerned that these \n     limits could preclude the United States from meeting its \n     future financial obligations to repay maturing debt and to \n     honor payments--including benefit payments--and could also \n     run the risk of worsening a future economic downturn.\n       It has been this Administration's view that fiscal \n     restraint is best exercised through the tools of the budget \n     process. Existing enforcement tools such as the pay-go rules \n     and the discretionary spending limits in the Budget \n     Enforcement Act have been key elements in maintaining fiscal \n     discipline in the 1990's. Debt limits should not be used as \n     an additional means of imposing restraint. Debt is incurred \n     solely to pay expenditures that have previously been \n     authorized by the Congress and for the investment of the \n     Federal trust funds. By the time the debt limit is reached, \n     the Government is obligated to make payments and must have \n     enough money to do so.\n       If Treasury were prohibited from issuing any new debt to \n     honor the Government's obligations, there could be permanent \n     damage to our credit standing. The debt obligations of the \n     United States are recognized as having the least credit risk \n     of any investment in the world. That credit standing is a \n     precious asset of the American people. Even the appearance of \n     a risk that the United States of America might not meet its \n     obligations because of the absence of necessary debt \n     authority would be likely to impose significant additional \n     costs on American taxpayers. Yet, in November 1995, a debt \n     crisis was precipitated when Government borrowing reached the \n     debt limit and in January Moody's credit rating service \n     placed Treasury securities on review for possible downgrade.\n       As you know, there is currently a statutory limit on the \n     amount of money that Treasury can borrow in total from both \n     the public and from Federal trust funds. The proposed \n     ``lockbox'' provision would add a new statutory limit on debt \n     to the public.\n       The proposed new debt limit runs the risk of precipitating \n     additional debt crises in the future. Although the proposal \n     adjusts the debt ceiling for discrepancies between the actual \n     and projected Social Security surpluses, it does not make \n     similar corrections for unanticipated developments on the \n     non-Social Security side of the budget. While our \n     forecasts have been conservative, the current forecast of \n     the non-Social Security budget could prove too optimistic \n     because of changes in the economy, demographics, or \n     countless other factors. This could cause the publicly \n     held debt to exceed the new debt limit.\n       Furthermore, even if the debt limit appears sufficient \n     because it covers the annual debt level--measured from end-\n     of-year to end-of-year--it could easily be inadequate for the \n     Government to meet its obligations at a given point during \n     the year. Under normal circumstances, every business day, \n     Treasury makes payments--including Social Security payments \n     on certain days. In any given week, Treasury receives \n     revenues, makes payments, and refinances maturing debt. \n     Weekly and monthly swings in cash flow can easily exceed on-\n     hand cash balances. When this occurs, Treasury then borrows \n     from the public to meet its obligations. If the amount of \n     publicly held debt were to reach the level of the debt \n     limit--or if the debt limit were to decline to below the \n     level of publicly held debt--Treasury could be precluded from \n     borrowing additional amounts from the public. If Treasury \n     could not borrow to raise cash, it is possible that it could \n     simply have to stop honoring any payments--including Social \n     Security payments.\n       In this case, Treasury could be prohibited from issuing any \n     new debt to redeem maturing debt. Every Thursday, \n     approximately $20-23 billion of weekly Treasury bills mature \n     and, every month, an additional $60-85 billion in debt \n     matures. These securities must either be paid off in cash or \n     refinanced by issuing new debt. Treasury could be put in the \n     position of having to default for the first time on our \n     nation's history.\n       Congress could defuse the debt limit problems by \n     immediately voting to raise the debt ceiling. Under the \n     ``lockbox'' proposal, however, it would take sixty votes in \n     the Senate to do so. As past experience indicates, obtaining \n     a super-majority for this purpose is often time-consuming and \n     difficult. Moreover, this requirement would greatly enhance \n     the power of a determined minority to use the debt limit to \n     impose their views on unrelated issues.\n       Finally, the proposed debt limits could run the risk of \n     worsening an economic downturn. If the economy were to slow \n     unexpectedly, the budget balance would worsen. Absent a \n     super-majority vote to raise the debt limit, Congress would \n     need to reduce other spending or raise taxes. Either cutting \n     spending or raising taxes in a slowing economy could \n     aggravate the economic slowdown and substantially raise the \n     risk of a significant recession. And even those measures \n     would not guarantee that the debt limit would be not be \n     exceeded. A deepening recession would add further to revenue \n     losses and increases in outlays. The tax increases and \n     spending cuts could turn out to be inadequate to satisfy all \n     existing payment obligations and keep the debt under the \n     limit, worsening a crisis.\n       To summarize, these new debt limits could create \n     uncertainty about the Federal government's ability to honor \n     its further obligations and should not be used as a \n     instrument of fiscal policy. While we certainly share the \n     goal of preserving Social Security, this legislation does \n     nothing to extend the solvency of the Social Security trust \n     funds, while potentially threatening the ability to make \n     Social Security payments to millions of Americans. I will \n     recommend that the President veto the bill if it contains the \n     debt limit provisions. If you have any additional questions, \n     please do not hesitate to contract me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Robert E. Rubin.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to speak on the pending amendment by \nSenator Conrad, and then I understand the distinguished ranking member \nof the Budget Committee wants to speak on the Conrad amendment. Then we \nwill set the Conrad amendment aside, if there is no objection, and \nyield to Senator Bond, who will offer his amendment. If anyone wants to \ngive an immediate response, they can. Then we will yield to Senator \nKennedy, let him offer his amendment. At that point, Senator Domenici \nwill be back to speak on the Conrad amendment. If Senator Conrad wants \nto respond, he can. Then we are at least at that point closing in on a \nvote of all these amendments. None of this is agreed to, but follows \nthat general parameter. If no one objects to it, let me proceed.\n  Mr. BOND. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BOND. May I inquire of the Senator from Texas if there is \nimmediate response or discussion of my amendment when we get around to \nit? Would it be possible to respond at that time?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Certainly.\n  Mr. BOND. Since we seem to be wanting to keep things in the same \ncontext, it would be appreciated.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me yield to Senator Conrad and then I want to speak.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I just want to make clear that at the end of this \ndiscussion I want a chance to respond to any points that might have \nbeen raised in objection to the Conrad amendment before we go to \nanother amendment.\n  Mr. GRAMM. The only problem will be that Senator Domenici wants to \nspeak and he is not here. We are simply trying to accommodate everyone \nin terms of offering amendments and having a debate.\n\n[[Page S3207]]\n\n  In any case, there are always limits to what we can do. We will do \nthe best we can.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). There are time limits under the \nbudget rules for discussion of amendments. If an amendment is set \naside, that does not terminate the time that is still available.\n  Mr. GRAMM. How much time have we run off of the Conrad amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Conrad has 28 minutes remaining on the \namendment, and those who speak in opposition have 60 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I certainly will not take 60 minutes.\n  Mr. President, in the Budget Committee we had a series of amendments \nand they all had a common theme: Do anything with the surplus except \ngive it back to working Americans.\n  We had an amendment that said you could not give a tax cut until you \nhad fixed Social Security for 75 years--that would be the year 2074, so \nyou could not do a tax cut before the year 2074; you could not give a \ntax cut to working people until Medicare was fixed for a similar \nperiod. You could not give a tax cut until Jesus came back. You could \nnot give a tax cut until Bosnia and Serbs and Bosnia and Croats \nroutinely met, fell in love, got married and, like the lion and the \nlamb, lay down together.\n  When you listen to all this rhetoric and all these amendments, what \nthey have in common is not all the things that have to happen before a \ntax cut, but what they have in common is our Democrat colleagues do not \nwant working Americans to get any of the non-Social Security surplus \nback.\n  We find ourselves with the highest tax burden in American history. \nWhen you take Federal, State, and local taxes, 31 cents out of every \ndollar earned by every American goes to government and taxes. With the \nhistory of our country, such as at the peek of the war effort in World \nWar II in 1944 when we had the largest defense spending in American \nhistory and the highest tax burden in American history prior to today, \neven with the highest tax rate in American history, our Democrat \ncolleagues would say: ``Defer tax cuts until the year 2074, defer tax \ncuts until all the problems of the world are solved, defer tax cuts.''\n  The point is, they are not for letting working Americans keep some of \nthe money that we are now taking from them above the level needed to \npay the taxpayers' bills. Remember that every penny of the Social \nSecurity surplus by the pending budget will be set aside and locked \naway for Social Security. Now, this is the newest variant of this \n``anything but tax cuts'' amendment. This variant says, ``Don't give \nthe money to tax cuts; reduce the debt and then give an IOU to \nMedicare.''\n  I want to remind my colleagues that this doesn't provide a dime for \nMedicare.\n  Not one penny of this money can be spent under the budget. If we \nadopted this amendment, Medicare would not have one nickel that it \ndoesn't have now. It would have an IOU from the Federal Government. But \nhow would we pay the IOU? We would pay it by raising taxes, by cutting \nspending, by cutting Medicare, maybe, or by borrowing money from the \ngeneral public. But nothing we do today in giving an IOU to Medicare \nprovides any money for Medicare either today or in the future.\n  So this is not a real transfer of resources. When our dear colleague \nfrom Rhode Island on the Budget Committee says we need to give the \nresources to Medicare, no resources are given to Medicare in the budget \nof the United States. If you look at that budget, which has a $199 \nbillion increase, the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator \nfrom North Dakota doesn't change one penny of spending for Medicare \nover this period. In fact, what the Senator from North Dakota is doing \nis not changing Medicare spending, not providing any new benefit, not \npaying any old bill; he is simply giving Medicare an IOU.\n  Now, what is the net product of this IOU? That is the point I want to \nget to. The net product of this IOU is not more money for Medicare; the \nnet product of this IOU is that in the year 2009, Medicare insolvency \nwill occur unless we pass a reform bill, like the Breaux reform, which \nI strongly support and supported as a member of the bipartisan Medicare \nCommission. Unless we do something that is a real reform, in the year \n2009 we are going to have to raise payroll taxes, or raise general \ntaxes, or we are going to have to cut spending, or we are going to have \nto borrow money, whether or not we give an IOU to Medicare. Nothing in \nthe Senator's amendment changes the amount of money that is available \nin the 10-year budget for Medicare.\n  But what is changed by the amendment? Medicare is no better off, no \nworse off; it has an IOU. We already have many IOUs to Medicare because \nof our commitment to the program. It is probably the second most \npopular program in American history and one to which we are all \ncommitted. Nothing changes for Medicare. No new resources are available \nto Medicare. No hard choices are avoided in Medicare. But what is \nchanged? Well, what is changed is that this amendment will reduce the \namount of money that is available for tax cuts by $320 billion. That is \nwhat this amendment is about. The actual change in the budget as a \nresult of this amendment is to reduce the amount of money that is \navailable for tax cuts.\n  So what are we doing here? This is an amendment that has only one \nsubstantive effect; that is, it reduces our ability to eliminate the \nmarriage penalty. Americans meet and fall in love and get married, only \nto discover that they pay the Federal Government, on average, $1,400 a \nyear for the right to be married. Knowing the Presiding Officer's wife, \nI know she is worth $1,400 a year, but I believe--and so does the \nPresiding Officer--that she ought to get the $1,400, not the Federal \nGovernment. In fact, I know the wife of the distinguished Senator from \nNorth Dakota, and I know she is worth $1,400 a year, and we want her to \nhave the money. We don't understand why the Senator from North Dakota \ndoesn't think she ought to have it instead of the Government. In any \ncase, that is a matter of personal choice.\n  The point is, what we are doing here does nothing for Medicare, but \nit affects our ability to repeal the marriage penalty. There are many \npeople who believe it is not right to force farmers and ranchers to \nsell the farm and sell the ranch when papa dies. He spent his whole \nlife building up the farm or the ranch and put every penny of after-tax \nmoney he ever had into the farm or ranch. When he dies, the children \nhave to sell the farm or ranch to give the Federal Government 55 cents \nout of every dollar. We want to end that.\n  The amendment of the Senator from North Dakota doesn't help Medicare \na bit, but it takes away from our ability to exempt farms and ranches \nfrom this confiscatory death duty and exempts small businesses from \nthis confiscatory death duty. We believe we ought to have an across-\nthe-board tax cut.\n  Now, we know many of our Democrat colleagues don't believe we should \nhave an across-the-board tax cut, and they very quickly point out, \nwell, with an across-the-board tax cut, some people don't get a tax \ncut. That is true. But across-the-board tax cuts are for people who pay \ntaxes. So everybody who pays taxes would get an across-the-board tax \ncut, and people who pay a lot of taxes would get 10 percent of that \nback. People who pay a little would get 10 percent of that back, and \nthey would both be happy to have it back.\n  Now, what the Senator from North Dakota is saying is that he would \nrather not repeal the marriage penalty, or repeal or reduce the \ninheritance tax, or have a tax cut across the board, or any of the many \nother ways we could give this money back, because he would rather it \nnot go back to the taxpayers. So the net effect of this amendment is \nthat it doesn't change Medicare, doesn't change a single spending \nfigure over the 10-year budget; it gives Medicare a meaningless IOU, \nbasically. But what is changed, what is substantive, is that it lessens \nour ability to reduce the tax burden for working Americans by $320 \nbillion.\n  Let me make one final point on this. Let me give you the advantage of \ngiving some of this non-Social Security surplus back to taxpayers \nrather than having the Government keep it and ultimately spend it. We \nall remember last year when President Clinton stood at the rostrum of \nthe House and said:\n\n       Social Security first. Every penny of this surplus will go \n     to Social Security. I won't allow it to go on tax cuts, I \n     won't allow it to be spent.\n\n\n[[Page S3208]]\n\n\n  Yet, the President, as a tribute for adjourning, required that $21 \nbillion of it be spent. Every penny of it came right out of Social \nSecurity. So if we don't give this non-Social Security surplus back--or \nat least part of it--to workers, we are going to end up squandering it; \nwe are going to end up spending it.\n  Now, the advantage of giving it back is, first, it is their money to \nbegin with. This money came from the working people. The economy is \ndoing better because they are working and saving and investing more. \nWhy should they not get some of the benefit--in fact, a very small \npercentage under our budget?\n  Another thing is important. If we need the money back, we can take it \nback. But if you spend it on a bunch of new programs creating a bunch \nof new constituencies, it is gone; you will never get it back. How many \nGovernment programs have we ever eliminated in American history? \nVirtually none.\n  So I just want to urge my colleagues, when they listen to the debate \non this amendment, to remember that these amendments aren't about \ndenying a tax cut until 2074 to save Social Security, or put off a tax \ncut until Medicare's problems are forever solved, or to wait until the \nsecond coming and let Jesus worry about it, or to wait until world \npeace is enshrined. That is not what these amendments are about. These \namendments are about some of us not wanting to give people a tax cut. \nThat is what it is about.\n  So if you think that out of the massive surpluses we are projected to \nhave over the next 10 years, giving a modest tax cut to working \nAmericans in things like repealing the marriage penalty, reducing or \nrepealing the death tax, and giving a little across-the-board tax cut \nto everybody--if you think workers deserve some of the benefits of the \ngood economy and the impact it has had on taxes, rather than giving \nevery penny of it to the Government, then you want to vote no on this \namendment, and you want to vote no on a whole series of amendments, \neach of which is going to be tied to some other issue, like research to \nprevent meteorites from causing tidal waves or destroying New York \nCity--or it will go on and on and on. But the bottom line is, this is \nabout tax cuts.\n  And our colleagues are desperate. They want to spend the money. They \nwant to do everything with the money except give a little of it back. \nThat is where we have a disagreement.\n  Do not be confused. This doesn't have anything to do with Medicare. \nNothing in this amendment in any way provides another nickel to pay \nMedicare benefits. Nothing in this amendment changes the Medicare \nnumbers in this budget at all. This simply reduces debt; God's work, if \nit really happened. But what it does is give a meaningless IOU to \nMedicare. We already have written Medicare so many IOUs that we will \nnever pay back the ones we have written. If you want to, give them a \ncigar box full. And, if it makes you feel better, great. But still, it \nis a promise to pay money. It is not money.\n  So I hope our colleagues will reject this amendment and realize it is \nnot about Medicare. It is not about Social Security. It is not about \nmeteorites. It is not about the second coming. It is about taxes. Some \npeople are against them. Other people are for them.\n  That is what the vote will be about.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I will yield such time as the Senator \nfrom North Dakota needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair.\n  I have been delighted at hearing the description of my amendment by \nthe Senator from Texas. He has probably the greatest imagination in the \nChamber. Unfortunately, his imagination has been working overtime, \nbecause his description of my amendment has virtually nothing to do \nwith my amendment. The Senator from Texas suggests that my amendment is \nto prevent a tax cut. That is not the purpose of my amendment. My \namendment is very clear. My amendment provides a lockbox that reserves \nevery penny of the Social Security surplus for Social Security. It then \ngoes to the next step and reserves 40 percent of the non-Social \nSecurity surplus for Medicare because Medicare is in imminent danger.\n  I point out that the Senator from Texas knew that last year. I don't \nknow what happened in the last year that has caused him to forget it. \nBut here is what he said last year. What a difference a year makes. He \nsaid:\n\n       . . . [w]hat would we do if we had a half a trillion \n     dollars to spend?\n\n  He said then:\n\n       The obvious answer that cries out is Medicare.\n       . . . I think it is logical. People understood the \n     President on save Social Security first and I think they will \n     understand save Medicare first.\n       . . . Medicare is in crisis. We want to save Medicare \n     first.\n\n  The Senator from Texas said that last year. This year, the budget \nthat he is advocating doesn't save one penny of the surplus for \nMedicare. That is where the difference lies. He wants all of the non-\nSocial Security surplus to go for an across-the-board tax cut.\n  Where does that go? Guess where that goes. That goes to the richest \namong us. Here is what the top 1 percent gets in his proposal. They get \n$20,000 of tax cut. What happens to the bottom 60 percent? They get on \naverage $99.\n  Maybe that is why now the Senator from Texas doesn't want to lock up \nand protect one penny of surplus for Medicare, because he wants to send \nit back not to Dicky Flatts. He wants to send it back to Dicky Flatts' \nwealthy friends, 20,000 bucks apiece to them; $99 to the rest of the \npeople. The vast majority of the people, the top 1 percent, get \n$20,000. The bottom 60 percent get $99 on average.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Texas suggests there is no money \navailable for a tax cut under the Conrad amendment. That is not my \namendment.\n\n  That is a great speech. It is a great political argument. The only \nproblem with it is that it is not true. It doesn't have anything to do \nwith my amendment.\n  Let's be honest. Let's be honest. What does the Conrad amendment do \nwith the surplus over the next 10 years? Over the next 10 years the \nsurplus is $2.6 trillion. Under my amendment, the $1.8 trillion that \ncomes from Social Security would be reserved for Social Security.\n  Second, another $376 billion would be reserved to strengthen \nMedicare.\n  Interestingly enough, last year the Senator from Texas said what \nhappens if you have a windfall? The first priority ought to be \nMedicare. This year, he doesn't want to provide one thin dime out of \nthe surplus for Medicare. He wants it all to go to a tax cut, an \nacross-the-board tax cut that has this result. I don't think that is \nthe priority of the American people to give a $20,000 tax cut to folks \nwho are in the top 1 percent, people who have an average income of \n$833,000. I don't think that is a priority of the American people. Not \none dime of surplus for Medicare, but provide it all to a tax cut for \npeople who earn $833,000, give them $20,000, when Medicare is the \nprogram that is in the deepest trouble. What sense does that make? \nLet's go back to what the Conrad amendment provides, because the \nSenator from Texas talks about an amendment that is not the amendment \nthat is before the body. It doesn't prevent tax relief. It doesn't \nprevent correcting the marriage penalty. The Senator from Texas knows \nbetter.\n  The amendment that I have offered offers of the $2.6 trillion of \nsurplus over the next 10 years $1.8 trillion that comes from the Social \nSecurity surplus which goes to Social Security; $376 billion goes to \nMedicare. That leaves nearly $400 billion that is available for tax \nrelief and for domestic priorities like education and defense and \nhealth care and, yes, tax relief. In fact, you could easily accommodate \ntaking care of the marriage penalty under my amendment. You could \nprovide other forms of targeted tax relief under my amendment, because \nthose are the priorities of the American people. Save Social Security, \ndedicate every penny of the Social Security surplus for Social \nSecurity, and then 40 percent of the non-Social Security surplus for \nMedicare, because it needs money, a need that the Senator from Texas \nhimself recognized just a year ago. In addition to that, $400 billion \navailable over\n\n[[Page S3209]]\n\nthe next 10 years for high priority domestic needs like education and \ndefense, and yes, money available for tax relief as well.\n  Mr. President, that is what this amendment provides, not the \ndescription given by the Senator from Texas that bore absolutely no \nrelation to the amendment that is before us.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I know the time has moved along, so I will just take a \nmoment. If I understand the Senator's amendment effectively, what will \nbe the situation under your amendment with regard to the continued \nsolvency of the Medicare system? As I understand it, besides \nstrengthening Social Security, one of the purposes was to extend \nsolvency of the Medicare system in order to permit time to consider \nsensible reforms. Will the Senator just tell me this: Under the Conrad \namendment, what is the life expectancy of the Medicare system, and what \nwould it be without the Conrad amendment under the budget resolution \nthat is now before the Senate?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator from Massachusetts asks a good question. The \nsimple answer to the Senator is: By locking up additional funds for \nMedicare, we would be in a position at a later point, because we cannot \ndo that in the context of the budget resolution, to extend the solvency \nof the Medicare system for at least another 12 years. That is the goal \nof this effort; to first lock it up and protect it so it cannot be \ndiverted for some other purpose and then, when we get at a later point \nwhere we can make transfers which we are precluded from doing in a \nbudget resolution, to then extend the solvency of the Medicare system. \nThat is what this is all about: Protecting, strengthening Medicare, as \nwell as strengthening Social Security.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Is it the position of the Senator, when you have the \nextension of the Medicare system, that at that time there would be the \nopportunity to consider the kinds of other reforms that might continue \nthe Medicare system even beyond the 2020 period?\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is exactly correct. As the Senator may know, as a \nmember of the Finance Committee I have voted repeatedly to reform \nMedicare in order to further extend its solvency. But it is my \nconviction, and I think the failure of the Medicare Commission so \nindicates, the need is for additional resources into Medicare. We also \nneed to reform that system. But without additional resources I do not \nbelieve we will succeed in extending the solvency of the Medicare \nsystem.\n  So, there is really a two-part test here, to reform the system and to \nprovide additional resources. If we do not protect them, if we do not \nlock them up, I assure you, Senators like our colleague from Texas will \ntake the money and he will send it back to those who are earning over \n$833,000 a year. He will send them a $20,000 check and we will find our \ngrandparents and our parents, who are dependent on Medicare for their \nhealth care, are not going to have it. That is the choice before the \nbody. That is the choice before the body.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I have a final question, if I could, of the Senator. \nWould this, now, be the longest period of financial security for the \nMedicare system that we would have had since, actually, Medicare has \nbeen established? It is my understanding with the additional revenues \nwe would effectively guarantee the financial security of the Medicare \nsystem for the longest period since the Medicare system has been \nestablished.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is correct, because this would extend it at least \nanother 12 years beyond 2008 to 2020. With the new projections that are \ncoming in, I believe it will be extended even beyond that.\n  That is fundamentally the question and the choice before this body. \nWhat are we going to do with these surpluses? Our friends on the other \nside of the aisle say: Social Security and tax cuts. We are saying in \nthis amendment: Yes, Social Security, every dime of Social Security \nsurplus for Social Security. But then let's provide additional \nresources to strengthen and preserve Medicare. And then, yes, let's \nalso have funds that are available for high-priority domestic needs \nlike education and health care and, yes, defense. And also have \nresources to provide some tax relief. I put marriage penalty right at \nthe top of the list. That is provided for in this amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. May I just ask a final question of the Senator? I notice \nin the report itself, under ``Revenues'' on page 75, it states this in \nthe third paragraph:\n\n       The net tax cut in the Committee-reported resolution can \n     accommodate a substantial tax cut package (the contents of \n     which will be determined by the tax-writing committees), \n     which may include across-the-board cuts in tax rates. . . .\n\n  The sentence does continue and list others, but it lists, No. 1, \nacross-the-board tax cuts. Is that the kind of tax cut, if we were \nmoving in that direction, the Senator believes would be the fairest to \nworking families and to small farmers and the smaller business men and \nwomen of this country?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I do not think it would be the fairest. In fact, if you \nhave a 10 percent across-the-board cut, the results are what I have \nshown here. For the top 1 percent, those whose income is over $800,000 \na year, they get $20,000. The bottom 60 percent get, on average, relief \nof $99.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield to the ranking member.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We are not surprised by incomes that exceed $1 \nmillion, $5 million, $10 million--some of the top corporate executives \nin this country, some of the athletes, some of the people in \nentertainment. So if someone earned $10 million in a year and the tax \nrate was 39.6 percent for income tax, and if there was roughly a 4-\npercent decline in that, so that person then would have--if they earned \n$10 million, they would get $400,000 in tax relief? Is that the way the \ncalculation is, as you see it?\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is roughly the calculation. It is hard to see that \nas fair.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I think Michael Eisner in 1 year earned $50 million. \nHe might get a couple of million in tax relief. Is that not right?\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is correct.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Would this amendment cause us to have to wait 75 \nyears before tax cuts could be put in place?\n  Mr. CONRAD. No. Absolutely not. As I indicated, we are protecting \nSocial Security by reserving every penny of the Social Security \nsurplus. We are also reserving a substantial part of the non-Social \nSecurity surplus for Medicare. But that which remains, which is about \n$400 billion over the next 10 years, is available for high-priority \ndomestic needs including education, health care and defense, and for \ntax relief.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. So the thing that triggers this is whether or not we \nprepared Social Security and Medicare for its survival. That is the \ntriggering mechanism that enables other things to be considered--tax \ncuts, targeted tax cuts or other programs to be exercised, is that \nright?\n  Mr. CONRAD. It is all really a question of priorities. How should \nthese surpluses be used? Our view is, the priorities of the American \npeople are to safeguard Social Security, to safeguard Medicare, to \nprovide for education and defense and health care, and also tax relief. \nThe other side says there are only two priorities. They say the \npriorities with these surpluses are Social Security--and I commend them \nfor that. But then they say virtually all the rest of the money ought \nto go for tax cuts. When you look at what they are proposing, the \nSenator from Texas was very clear. He likes across-the-board. The \nchairman of the Finance Committee has indicated he likes the 10 percent \nacross-the-board.\n  That is not fair. That is not fair. It is not the priorities of the \nAmerican people. That is why this amendment is important.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, how much time do we have left on our \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 11 minutes \n20 seconds. The Senator has Texas has 45 minutes, approximately.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator from North Dakota yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Not on my time I will not yield.\n\n[[Page S3210]]\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Yield on my time. We have been very good in going back and \nforth. We have almost an hour. We have a few minutes. Would it not make \nsense to let us speak--let me say a few words, let Senator Domenici \nspeak, and then continue this, rather than shutting us out? If you want \nto do it, you obviously have the right under the rules.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. May I just ask one final question?\n  If we do not do what is included in the Conrad amendment, if we are \nlooking at the financial security of Medicare to the year 2020, is it \nthe understanding of the Senator that we would have to somehow find \n$686 billion that would either have to be a combination of tax \nincreases or benefit cuts in order to reach the $686--in order to \nensure that the Medicare trust fund would be financially sound by 2020, \nif we do not accept the Conrad amendment?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I suppose what we could do is write to these folks to \nwhom Senator Gramm is going to send the money and ask them to make \nvoluntary contributions so the Medicare system could go forward. I do \nnot think that would work very well, probably.\n  The problem, the fundamental question before us, is, How do we use \nthese surpluses? I think the priorities of the American people are very \nclear. They have told us: Social Security, Medicare, education, health \ncare, defense, and, yes, tax relief. Those are their priorities, and \nthat is what this amendment represents.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Has the Senator from North Dakota yielded the \nfloor?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to be careful in what I say. But our \ncolleague suggested that we be honest.\n  I want to be very honest. What we have before us is a totally phony \namendment. Let me go through and explain why. Let me touch a couple \npoints.\n  First of all, this save Social Security business and lock the money \naway for Social Security, that didn't come from Bill Clinton. That came \nfrom Pete Domenici. That is in the budget before us. I want to thank \nSenator Domenici for that.\n  Let me just run down the list of things here. First of all, our dear \ncolleague brought out a quote from me about using money from Medicare. \nTo paraphrase Paul Harvey, let me tell you the rest of the story.\n  Last year, our Democrat colleagues were trying to raise taxes on the \npoorest among us, on a tax where 60 percent of the tax was paid for by \nAmericans who made $25,000 a year or less. It was a cigarette tax. The \nclaim that the Government had the right to part of the money was that \npeople smoke. They get smoking-related diseases and it costs us money \nin Medicare.\n  So Senator Domenici and I said, If you are going to collect money in \ncigarette taxes and you suddenly have this giant windfall--as one of \nthe lawyers, I guess, of these people that our dear colleagues talk \nabout, these rich people, said, ``This is like winning a lottery,'' \ntalking about the millions of dollars that had gone from the \nsettlements--Senator Domenici and I said last year, Well, if you are \ngoing to tax tobacco and you are going to impose the tax on people \nmaking $25,000 a year or less that pay the bulk of tobacco taxes--they \nare concerned about poor people today, but last year they were raising \ntheir taxes--Senator Domenici and I said, Well, if you are going to do \nthat, at least spend the money on Medicare for health care.\n  Now, when it was clear they weren't going to be able to spend it on \nall their social programs, their amendment died. But that is where that \nquote came from, if we are going to be honest.\n  Let me make it clear that all this business about ``the Domenici \nbudget does not provide a penny for Medicare,'' not so. The Domenici \nbudget provides more money for Medicare than any budget ever written in \nAmerican history. It provides $199 billion of new money. It funds every \npenny for Medicare. The President proposed cutting Medicare funding by \n$20 billion over the same period. So this is not about Medicare. This \nis about tax cuts, and it is about politics.\n  Now, this ``richest among us''--I do not understand people who love \ncapitalism and hate capitalists. I do not understand people who love \ninvestment but hate the people who make investments. I don't make $1 \nmillion a year. If I were really productive, maybe I would. But let me \njust tell you the trick behind all these charts. The trick behind all \nthese charts is that tax cuts are for taxpayers. So if you don't pay \nany income taxes and we cut income taxes, you don't get a tax cut. Some \npeople say, Well, that's not fair; I don't pay income taxes, but if \nthey are going to give a tax cut, I ought to get some of the money.\n  Well, ask working people. Do they get Medicaid? No. Do they get food \nstamps? No. Do they get housing subsidies? No, because they are not \npoor. Those programs are not for working people. Tax cuts are for \nworking people. So if you don't pay any taxes, you don't get any tax \ncuts.\n  Now to this business about what if somebody makes $800,000 a year and \nthey get a $20,000 tax cut. Outrage. Well, if they get a $20,000 tax \ncut, it meant they paid $200,000 of taxes. So if I paid $20,000 of \ntaxes and I get a $2,000 tax cut, why shouldn't somebody who paid \n$200,000 get a $20,000 tax cut? Do we have to debate every issue by \ntrying to pit Americans against each other? What is wrong with people \nmaking money? What is wrong with people being rich? They didn't make \nthe money by stealing it from somebody. They made it by producing \nsomething of value and selling it. I would just like to say that we get \ntired of having the people who are making $1 million a year tell us \nabout tax cuts for rich people.\n\n  I don't get it. Senator Domenici is from an immigrant family. I told \nthe story earlier about him almost being born in a lettuce patch where \nhis mama was picking lettuce. Neither of my parents went to high \nschool. Suddenly we care about rich people and our colleagues, many of \nwhom are rich, are going to protect people against rich people.\n  Here is the point. Why not give everybody a tax cut? This bill does \nnot give an across-the-board tax cut. It just provides money for tax \ncuts. Obviously, one of the ones that will be debated, everybody will \nget a chance to give their speech about these outrageous rich people \nwho paid $1 million a year in taxes and we want $2 million. We want \nevery penny they have. We want to put them in prison. The point is, \nwith an across-the-board tax cut, you get 10 percent, whatever you pay, \nyou get 10 percent of it back.\n  If that hurts your feelings, you live in the wrong country. It \ndoesn't hurt my feelings.\n  Final points and I will get out of Senator Domenici's way. Senator \nKennedy asked, What does this do to the lifespan of Medicare? Well, let \nme tell him. Nothing is the answer, zero, zip. The lifespan of Medicare \nis supposedly to 2008, but it is only to 2008 because President Clinton \ntook part of the cost out of the trust fund and put it into general \nrevenue. So Medicare already went broke. But it is 2008 today and, if \nthis amendment were adopted, it would still be 2008, because this \namendment provides not one nickel, one penny, one million, one billion, \nnothing to Medicare. It gives Medicare a meaningless IOU, and we still \nhave to cut spending or raise taxes or borrow money in order to pay it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me correct the Senator. He didn't \neven give them an IOU. He just reduced the debt.\n  Mr. GRAMM. That is right, and claims that they get credit for it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Correct.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Well, let me say that this is a phony amendment in every \nrespect except one. It has nothing to do with Medicare. It doesn't have \nany impact on Medicare. Normally in these amendments, you have all this \nfolderol and meaningless stuff at first, but when you get to the last \npage and the last paragraph, you get to the bottom line. What this \namendment does is, it reduces the levels of funds in section 104(1) by \nwhich the Senate Committee on Finance is instructed to reduce revenues.\n  So what this amendment is about is denying people a tax cut. Our \ncolleagues are for tax cuts in general, even though both our colleagues \nvoted for the last amendment which would\n\n[[Page S3211]]\n\nhave denied any tax cut. They are for them in general. They are for \neliminating the marriage penalty in theory. They are for changing \ninheritance taxes in theory. But when it gets right down to giving \nsomebody a tax cut, they are against it.\n  Why are they against it? As long as we have been asked to be honest, \nthey are against it because they want to spend this money. They are \nagainst it because they want to spend this money on programs, just as \nthey did last year when we busted the budget by $21 billion and stole \nevery penny of it right out of the Social Security trust funds and they \nvoted for it.\n\n  So let's not be deceived. I was asked to be honest and I wasn't going \nto be, because I didn't want to be unkind. But since I have been asked \nto be honest, let me be honest. This is a phony amendment. It has \nnothing to do with Medicare and everything to do with denying tax cuts. \nOur colleagues on the left side of this Chamber want to spend this \nmoney, and we don't want them to spend it. We want people to have it \nback.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time do we have on the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 35 minutes 20 \nseconds. The Senator from North Dakota has 9 minutes 57 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me assure Senators here on the floor, I do not \nintend to use 35 minutes. I am fearful if I say anything, we will have \nto hear the same song and dance over again from the other side. We have \nheard it about 10 times today, but that is all right.\n  First of all, we all know what this is about. Last year the President \nof the United States said to the Congress, Democrat and Republican, we \nhave taken Medicare out of politics. Let us move arm in arm and let us \nfix Medicare. Everybody said great. The President was active in this \nregard, and he said, let us have this commission look at it. We have \ntaken it out of politics, because we want to fix it.\n  The truth of the matter is, the President decided to make Medicare a \npolitical issue in his budget this year. He didn't wait around for the \ncommission. He made it a political issue in his budget.\n  Those who are now arguing on the floor about the budget we produced \nin committee are continuing the political fight rather than a factual \nfight.\n  I want to say a couple of things. There is a lot to get excited about \nhere, but I promise myself I will not do that, other than I will say to \nmy good friend, you should never, never have put the Social Security \nlockbox money in the same lockbox with yours. If you would like to have \na second lockbox and call it yours, you are welcome to do it. But it is \na fraud to put it in the same lockbox with the Social Security trust \nfund. It is nothing similar to it. It has no relationship to it, and \nall it does is say, ``We're going to reduce the debt more than the \nRepublicans want to, and we're hoping that by reducing that debt, there \nwill be money available for Medicare.'' That is it plain and simple.\n  In case anybody is interested, on this chart, this red line is the \nPresident's debt reduction for which he is taking credit and have Nobel \nlaureates saying it is great. The committee bill before you is the blue \nline which reduces the debt $400 billion more than the President, \nwhich, incidentally, is more than the distinguished Senator is going to \ntake out of the tax cut to make a case--not a case for Medicare--a case \nagainst giving back to the American people any of their hard-earned \nmoney.\n  This amendment, which will fall because it is not germane, is an \nantitax amendment. Let me tell you, I am tired of Democrats getting up \nand saying, ``We don't want to vote for tax relief because Republicans \nare talking about an across-the-board tax cut.'' I am tempted to offer \nan amendment to strike the 10-percent tax cut from this tax cut and put \nin marriage penalty and any other family-related tax cuts. Take it out. \nLet's see if they are for it then.\n  What will the argument be? The argument can't be 10 percent because \nit is not even mentioned in this resolution. What they can get up and \nsay is, ``We have a better idea for tax cuts than the Republicans.'' \nAnd we say, ``Wonderful, if you do, that's fine.'' But it is not a \nwonderful idea to cut the tax cut almost in half and claim you are for \ntax cuts and you did something for Medicare when, as a matter of fact, \nall we need to do for Medicare is to get the Democrats and the \nPresident--and I will not include every Democrat because there are some \nwho already know what they want to do--but all we need to do is get \nthem to tell us what we ought to do for Medicare.\n  This idea that my friend, Senator Kennedy, got up and said, ``We are \nin the red $860 billion over,'' I don't know how many years, Mr. \nPresident, that is saying if the program stays just like it is and \nthere is no reform, that is what we would need to keep it going like it \nis.\n  Let me assure you that not even the distinguished Senator who is \nproposing this so-called Medicare amendment thinks we should leave the \nMedicare program like it is. In fact, there is a quote--we are going to \nfind it in a minute--where the distinguished Senator said Medicare does \nnot have a chance to survive unless we reform it. That is what he was \nsaying last year.\n  Reforming it means you save money by making the program more \nefficient, less apt to have fraud injected into the program and, yes, \nbeing realistic. There are those who say this commission that worked on \nthis didn't come up with a good product and they used that one idea. \nThirty years from now, the age for receiving Medicare will go up \npiecemeal, and in 30 years, it will be up 2 years. Maybe they can fix \nthat if they are serious. But, Mr. President, that reform package saved \nenough money to pay a prescription benefit. They did not need to take \naway this tax cut to do it. They had $61 billion left over from reform, \nand they said, ``Let's use it for prescription drugs.''\n\n  Any talk on the floor that the Conrad amendment is going to fix \nMedicare like it has never been fixed before is pure, absolute \ndemagoguery and speculation at the highest. Nobody has any idea what \nthat is going to do for Medicare, if it is even available for Medicare. \nIt might not even be there. It can be spent for anything else.\n  I submit, talking about what the American people want most and coming \ndown here and telling us that 20 times does not mean that that is what \nthey are getting in that amendment by my good friend, Senator Conrad, \nbecause it is not doing what he says the American people want. If you \nlook at it, it does not accomplish what he continually claims the \nAmerican people want.\n  Frankly, I believe we ought to get serious and we ought to take the \npolitics out of this, but if you do not want to, we will take this one \nas far as we can because we understand what is right, what is fair, and \nwhat is fair to future generations, not just our senior citizens.\n  From my standpoint, the truth of the matter is, this is plain and \nsimple: an effort to increase taxes that would otherwise be reduced by \n$320 billion over 10 years. What is really incredible about it is that \nit does not provide $1 for Medicare. Not one. It reduces the debt of \nthe United States temporarily until it is spent by someone with no real \nway of saying it is to go to Medicare because there is no way to do \nthat.\n  It is no lockbox; it is a wish box. In fact, you should take it out \nof my lockbox and make your own wish box out of it, and maybe mine \nshould be green and yours should be--I don't know what color--surely a \nshade of yellow, something slightly brown, something like that.\n  In any event, all this amendment purports to do is to reduce the debt \nheld by the public because the Senator could not even put it into the \nMedicare fund, as the President did, in his phony budget because if he \ndid that, he would have to raise the gross debt of the United States \nand would be vulnerable here on the floor for having done that, so it \ndoesn't even do that.\n  I understand my friend, Senator Conrad, is anxious to get up and talk \nagain. He has made so many arguments today, I don't know if he needs \nany more, but the Senate accommodates him because that is the way the \nbudget process works.\n  Let me conclude. The budget before us fully funds Medicare assuming \nno reform. Reform will save a lot of money, and there will be money \naround from these numbers in this budget\n\n[[Page S3212]]\n\nwhich is fully funded. We do not cut the $20 billion that the President \ndoes, and regardless of what they say on that side, within the 10-year \nperiod, there could be up to $100 billion. And if we get on with \nreform, that $100 billion will be available. If we wait around forever \nwith no proposal, then who knows.\n  I believe we are going to get serious. The President is going to send \nus a package. I only hope he does not send us one that is irresponsible \nbecause of this debate. I don't think he will. He understands the \nissue. We can get on to doing Medicare right, not act like this \namendment fixes it.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me just say, sometimes voices are \nraised here on the floor, mine included. But let there be no mistake, I \nhave great respect for the chairman of the Budget Committee.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And I for you.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I appreciate that, and absolute affection for the Senator \nfrom New Mexico as well. We have a disagreement. I think both of us are \nbeing honest and direct about that disagreement.\n  Let me be clear. The Senator from New Mexico says that my amendment \ndoes not fix Medicare. That is true. That is absolutely true. My \namendment does not fix Medicare; it does not solve the problem. But my \nMedicare amendment, or the part of my amendment that deals with \nMedicare, does make a difference, because it reserves funds to \nstrengthen Medicare--nearly $400 billion over the next 10 years.\n  The lockbox offered by our friends across the aisle does not provide \none penny of the surplus for Medicare. They say, in answer, ``But we \nfund Medicare.'' Yes, of course they fund Medicare. That is a budget \nrequirement. Of course they fund it. But in the surpluses that are \nprojected over the next 10 years, they are not setting aside one penny \nof that surplus to strengthen Medicare. That is a deficiency of their \nproposal.\n  Let's go back to what the Conrad amendment really does. The Conrad \namendment reserves, in a lockbox, every penny of the Social Security \nsurplus over the next 10 years for Social Security.\n  No. 2, the Conrad amendment takes $370 billion over the next 10 years \nof non-Social Security surplus and reserves that for Medicare. That is \na critical first step to solving and resolving the Medicare crisis.\n  No. 3, we still then have about $400 billion left over the next 10 \nyears to deal with high-priority domestic needs--education and health \ncare and, yes, defense and, yes, tax relief--$400 billion that is \navailable for those categories.\n  Our friends on the other side say that is not what we want to do. \nThey say, we just want the money for Social Security and tax cuts, \nnothing out of the surplus--nothing out of the surplus--for defense, \nfor education, for Medicare. Well, we do not believe those are the \npriorities of the American people. That is the difference. And that is \nwhat this amendment is about.\n  I ask my colleagues, just for a moment, to suspend partisanship on \nboth sides and really look at what this amendment says--not to the \ncharacterization of the Senator from Texas. His characterization was \nhis imagination working overtime. It is what he hoped my amendment \nsaid, not what my amendment does say. The argument that he made was an \nargument not against the amendment that is before us but an argument \nagainst an amendment that he wished I was offering.\n\n  My amendment does pay down the publicly held debt more than the \nbudget resolution--by about $300 billion. My proposal pays down \npublicly held debt more than what is being offered on the other side.\n  I think that is a good priority as well. So not only do we strengthen \nSocial Security, strengthen Medicare, or at least make it possible to \nstrengthen Medicare and also provide for high-priority domestic needs \nsuch as education, health care, defense, and tax relief, but we also \nare in a position to further pay down the public debt. Because every \neconomist who has come before us in the Budget Committee, in the \nFinance Committee, has told us that that is the highest priority of \nall--pay down this publicly held debt, to put us in a position to keep \ninterest rates down, to have a stronger economy for the future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve my time.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my time \ncome off the budget resolution itself and not off the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I want just a few minutes to respond.\n  Mr. President, I rise in strong support of Senator Conrad's lockbox \namendment, which reserves approximately 45 percent of the non-Social \nSecurity budget surplus for Medicare over the next 10 years.\n  Mr. President, we have heard a lot about the Republican lock box here \non the floor. But so far, it's been all conversation and no action and \nno amendment. Nothing was offered in Committee, except for a sense of \nthe Senate that merely endorses current law. And we don't expect to see \nanything on the floor.\n  What we have before us is a budget that spends nearly every dollar of \nthe projected $1 trillion surplus on tax cuts. And the numbers don't \nlie.\n  On page 5 of the budget resolution, the amounts of surpluses \nremaining after the Republican tax cut are as follows:\n  A $6 billion on-budget deficit in 2000;\n  A surplus of zero in 2001;\n  A surplus of zero in 2002;\n  A surplus of zero in 2003; and\n  A small $3 billion on-budget surplus in 2004.\n  Mr. President, nothing in this budget is reserved for Medicare, \nalthough the program goes bankrupt in just eight years. But Senator \nConrad's amendment would correct this obvious oversight by reserving \napproximately 45 percent of the onbudget surplus for Medicare over the \nnext 10 years.\n  This amendment is more than rhetoric, Mr. President. And it's more \nthan a press release. It's a new Senate rule that reserves $707 billion \nfor the Medicare program over the next 15 years. That's fully $707 \nbillion more than the Republican budget.\n  Over ten years, this amendment would reduce debt by over $300 billion \nmore than the Republican plan. Over the long-term, these reserves would \nbe instrumental in crafting a comprehensive Medicare reform package \nthat modernizes the program for the 21st century.\n  In the Budget Committee mark-up last year, Chairman Domenici stated \nthat ``for every dollar you divert to some other program you are \nhastening the day when Medicare falls into bankruptcy.'' Well, Mr. \nPresident, we are one year closer to bankruptcy but a giant step back \nfrom where we were last year, when this program was a priority for both \nRepublicans and Democrats.\n  Not only does our lockbox do more to protect Medicare and reduce \ndebt, it also has a stronger lock and more responsible enforcement \nprocedure for both Social Security and Medicare.\n  Mr. President, we enforce the lockbox through the tried and true \nmechanisms of the pay-go rules. If Congress attempts to spend part of \nthe Social Security surplus or Medicare reserve, the sequester rules of \nthe Balanced Budget Act would make automatic spending cuts in order to \nkeep the reserve intact.\n  But in their budget, Republicans have weakened the pay-go rule by \nallowing all funds not saved for Social Security to be used for tax \ncuts, right away, regardless of whether we ever act to reform Social \nSecurity and Medicare. Our lockbox, however, creates a powerful \nincentive for Congress to address the long-term problems of Social \nSecurity and Medicare by prohibiting surpluses outside of the lockbox \nfrom being used until we reform Social Security and Medicare.\n  To sum up, Mr. President, the Republican budget ignores Medicare, but \nthe Democratic lockbox protects both Social Security and Medicare. The \nRepublican budget reduces public debt, but our lockbox reduces it more. \nThe Republican budget does nothing to further protect Social Security, \nbut our proposal adds a new super-majority point of order to make \ncertain that Social Security surpluses remain out of\n\n[[Page S3213]]\n\nthe budget. And finally, the Republican budget puts tax breaks first \nand tax breaks only, but our lockbox puts Social Security and Medicare \nfirst.\n  Mr. President, this is an easy choice. Our proposal is better for \nSocial Security, better for Medicare, and better for debt reduction. \nAnd our proposal is a more responsible alternative to a Republican \nbudget that does absolutely nothing to protect or strengthen Medicare.\n  Mr. President, I think securing Social Security, the Social Security \ntrust fund, the Medicare trust fund, is of great help. And whether \nissuing more IOUs or not, we could put cash in there. And if we left it \nin cash, then what we would do is lose the purchasing power that is \neroded by inflation or that would fail to replenish the fund as the \nnumber of recipients grows, even though the promise is made to each \nindividual.\n  But it also does something else, I think. What it does do is it \nattempts to secure longer life for Social Security and for Medicare, to \nat least remove it from the likelihood that the appropriators one day--\nsomeday in the future, if things get tough--would be able to say, \n``Well, listen, we just can't afford to do that. We're going to \nlegislate reductions in the benefits.'' And I think it is the right way \nto go.\n  Mr. President, I must take a couple minutes because one of the things \nthat I find terribly bothersome here is the fact that we are now down \nto where we are saying, ``stole money,'' ``phony accounting,'' \n``fraud,'' and the Director of the OMB--a brilliant, educated man--was \ncalled the ``most deceptive witness to ever appear before the Finance \nCommittee'' by one of our Senators.\n  I think that that language ought to be out of order because it \naccomplishes nothing except to get everybody a red neck. That is what \nhappens. We all get excited about it because we are offended, insulted, \nby the trivial language that goes through this place when we are \ntalking about something so serious.\n  ``Taxes on poor people'' it was proposed because we were going to \nimpose a burden on the tobacco users for the amount of the health care \nsystem that they used. ``Taxes on poor people,'' the plea was. ``We've \ngot to feel sorry for those people who are going to pay more for their \ntobacco, for their cigarettes,'' even though they have consumed more of \nour health care costs in the country in lost productivity, et cetera; \nit is estimated as much as $100 billion a year. ``Poor people, they are \naddicted to tobacco; and, therefore, we ought not to ask them to pay \nmore for the programs they use.''\n\n  I agree with that of sorts, but, on the other hand, in the State of \nTexas, $15 billion was accepted by the State of Texas as a resolution, \na settlement of the case they had against the tobacco companies--$15 \nbillion. And I did not hear anybody say, ``Well, Texas ought not to \ntake that money because ultimately the consumers, the smokers, are \ngoing to pay for it.'' I did not hear anybody say that when tobacco \ncompanies raise the price of cigarettes 45 cents a pack, ``Oh, what a \npity for those poor people to have to pay it.'' Of course, it goes into \nthe profits of the tobacco companies, but I did not hear anybody \npleading the case for those poor people who are going to pay it.\n  I heard a description of capitalists who hate capitalism. Well, you \nare looking at one. You are looking at one. And there is one sitting in \nthe chair of the President, as well, a capitalist. He made his money \nthrough hard work and diligence. And I know, in my discussions with his \nwife, how she tends the business while he serves the country.\n  I came from a poor immigrant family. And I was struck by the \ncomparison between the Senator from New Mexico and myself. I was born \nat home, but it was not in rural country: it was in New Jersey. I was \nborn at home. The doctor came to visit and delivered this beautiful \npackage to my mother. That is what happened. But I did not have the \nbenefit of the hospital, and she didn't either. And maybe that is the \nresult of what we have here.\n  But the fact is, I came from immigrant parents. I came from a father \nwho worked in a silk mill. And perhaps that was the reason that this \nman, at 43 years of age, died of colon cancer. He was a weight lifter, \nhe played basketball, he wrestled, he loved the outdoors, and he ate \nhealthy foods, even in the 1930s when no one was talking about it. And \nmy father would laugh at you if you smoked, but he died very young. He \ndied young because he worked in a place that is believed was unhealthy \nto work in. There was no OSHA protection. There was nothing against \nfumes or film or dust in those mills.\n  My uncle worked in the same industry. My father was 43. My uncle died \nwhen he was in his early 50s. And my grandfather, who worked in this \nsame business, died in his early 50s. I know what it is like to have \ncome from the other side of the tracks.\n  I helped create one of the great businesses in America. And I brag \nhere for a moment. And, please, I hope everybody will forgive this \nimmodesty. We started the company without a dime, two other friends and \nI. Those two were brothers, and their father, as my father, worked in \nthe silk mill. His health, however, was better and was not harmed. None \nof us had 15 cents to call our own, and we created a business that \ntoday employs 33,000 employees, and has one of America's most \nsuccessful records for return on investment to the investors. If you \ninvested $300 in my company in 1961--we went public--it is worth almost \n$2 million today. So I am a capitalist.\n\n  I served my country 3 years in the military, and I was in Europe \nduring the war despite my youthful appearance. The fact of the matter \nis I did everything I was supposed to, and I did it the old-fashioned \nway--by working hard. It took us a long time to build that business, \nbut we did succeed.\n  I used to serve with the Hall of Famer here, Bill Bradley, a great, \ngreat Senator, a great person, who was a member of the Basketball Hall \nof Fame. New Jersey was the only State in the whole country that had \ntwo Hall of Famers. I was a member of the Hall of Fame of information \nprocessing. You should have seen the kids running after me for my \nautograph. We were the only two.\n  I got there because I helped create not just a company but an \nindustry. So I know a capitalist when I see one, and I like them \nbecause they contribute and they create jobs. As I mentioned, 33,000 \npeople work for ADP today. I don't know where they would have had jobs \nelsewhere, but they like their jobs in that company.\n  When you disparage attempts to say we have a progressive system, that \nis what has made this country great. People pay their taxes based on \ntheir ability to pay and pay the lowest tax rate on a relative basis \nthat we have seen in this country. Yes, there is more tax being paid \nbecause we have more people earning more money. It was never dreamed \nthat people would be worth $30 billion or $10 billion.\n  One of the reasons I am worried about abolishing an inheritance tax \nis a guy leaves his heirs $30 billion, and the heirs have to do nothing \nbut sit there, accumulate interest worth $1.5 billion a year, and \npretty soon they own a large part of America and you can't take it \naway.\n  When we describe people as having ulterior motives or being of lesser \ncharacter than others, I think it is the wrong way to go. I don't think \nit is a good example for people across America or children who might be \ninterested. This is an honorable body and everyone on that side of the \naisle or this side of the aisle I consider an honorable person.\n  Do we have differences? Absolutely. I think we have to tone down the \nrhetoric. I guess I have to tone down the decibels of my voice.\n  Whether or not we feel sorry for the farmer, for the rancher, who \nwhen he or she sells their property has to pay a tax, then we ought to \nfeel just as sorry for the guy who owns the hotdog stand on the \nboardwalk in Atlantic City who works and supports his family that way. \nWhat is the difference between the person who owns a retail store or \nthe person who owns a farm? There isn't any, in my view. That is my \nperspective, living in the most densely populated State in the Union.\n  I plead with my colleagues. I agree with Senator Conrad. I think we \nhave to make sure that Social Security is protected. My friends on the \nRepublican side--and we all talk about Pete Domenici, Senator Domenici, \naffectionately, as well as respectfully. The fact is we differ with \nhim, because I don't\n\n[[Page S3214]]\n\nsee one thing in this Republican budget that says we are going to put 5 \ncents in Medicare. They say nothing about it. Wishful thinking.\n  They will continue present levels of funding; OK. The fact of the \nmatter is that doesn't help protect Medicare in the years ahead.\n\n  I will yield back the floor, much to the distress of the listening \naudience.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Before I yield back any time I have on the amendment, I \nwant to say I hope I didn't say anything that prompted the Senator to \nworry about whether I was levying a personal attack on the Senator. I \ndon't believe I was. If I did, I apologize.\n  Let me ask unanimous consent--and this has been cleared with Senator \nLautenberg--that the time on all amendments from this point on be \nreduced to 1 hour equally divided and the time on second-degree \namendments be reduced to half an hour equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield to Senator Bond who has been patiently waiting \nto give us the President's budget so we can vote on it.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 151\n\n              (Purpose: To propose the President's budget)\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk, and I ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 151.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (The text \nof the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Amendments \nSubmitted.'')\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I apologize, but I want to take a break from \nthe fascinating discussions, the dissertations on autobiographical \nmaterials, and raise a new subject. I will talk about the budget. I \napologize for making this major shift in the direction of the debate, \nbut I am offering today the President's budget.\n  We offered this in the Budget Committee because a lot of people have \nbeen talking about the President's budget. Unfortunately, nobody has \noffered it here to date. I thought we ought to have an opportunity to \ndiscuss it.\n  Some of our colleagues waxed very eloquent in the Budget Committee on \nthe benefits of the President's budget. Of course, people who know \nbudgets know that they are just basically a bunch of numbers, but those \nnumbers do have consequences. When people talk about how great the \nPresident's budget is, when it comes time to vote on it, nobody seemed \nto want to do that in the Budget Committee, so I thought I would give \nall of our colleagues an opportunity to vote.\n  As I look at the President's budget plan, it reminds me of the so-\ncalled garbage boat, the garbage barge that floated in the Atlantic a \nfew years ago. Everybody kept saying how important it was to get the \ngarbage buried someplace but nobody wanted the barge to land on their \nshores. A lot of our colleagues have talked about how important and how \nwonderful the President's plan is, but no one wants to take custody of \nit, nobody wants to take responsibility for it.\n  I suggest that this substitute would be a great opportunity for \nsomebody who wants to work from the principles and the ideas of the \nPresident's plan to vote for it. Then we can move forward and work on \nit.\n  Why do our friends on the other side keep running away from the \nPresident's plan? The problem comes up when we move away from talking \nabout general principles, platforms, and commitments and start talking \nabout the details of the plan. I agree we ought to talk about \nprinciples, but principles are not enough. We have to get down to the \npoint of talking about some plans, some numbers.\n  In the Senate, we vote on a plan, not on some vague statements \nclaiming to be principles. I am from Missouri and, of course, our motto \nis ``Show Me.'' Show me how these principles translate into a budget. \nThat is what this amendment is all about. This is putting before the \nSenate the actual numbers that the President has set out to implement \nthe details of his budget plan outlined to us and to the Nation just a \nmonth and a half ago. It is a vote on the specific plan proposed by the \nPresident.\n  Now, let's take a look at what the President's plan does. This is \njust in summary, and there are a lot of things we can say about it. \nFirst and foremost, the President's plan breaks the budget discipline \nwe worked so hard to achieve, the spending caps we agreed to in the \nbalanced budget amendment that helped get control over spending and \nproduced a surplus. These caps would be shattered by the President's \nplan.\n  We would not have any surplus to be worrying about if we had not, \nunder the leadership of our distinguished chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, Senator Domenici, fought and fought and fought against plans \nthat were vetoed, against objections from the other side, against every \nmanner of obstacle, finally to get a plan in place which capped \nspending and produced a budget, where we are reducing the deficits and \nmoving toward a surplus in the future.\n  This has been stated by many observers as one of the reasons why \nthere has been some strength in the economy, because after years of \nwatching a totally undisciplined Federal spending machine raise the \ndeficit and build on the debt of this Nation, we finally are getting \nspending under control.\n  We have had good monetary policy. Our fiscal policy has been a \ndisaster. Under the leadership of Chairman Domenici, we have finally \ngotten a handle on the fiscal policy. But the President's budget plan \nproposes to spend $30 billion more than we agreed to in the balanced \nbudget amendment. He breaks the cap. This is going back to the old \nspend and spend and spend proposals that put us in the position where \nwe have run up trillions of dollars of debt on our children's and our \ngrandchildren's credit cards.\n  I think it is very important that we focus on the budget caps. The \nplan goes against the principles we supposedly agreed to around here. I \nwas very interested that, on February 28, the distinguished minority \nleader was being questioned by Cokie Roberts on the ``This Week'' \nprogram. When asked if we should keep the caps, his response was, \n``Absolutely.'' Cokie Roberts says, ``So you are against breaking the \ncaps?'' Senator Daschle says, ``Absolutely. I think we've got to live \nwithin those caps. We set them out. We all voted for them, agreed to \nthem. We knew the ramifications when we did so. We know what kind of a \nsurplus we are going to enjoy if we have them. I think we ought to \nstick with them.''\n  Well, that is a strong statement of principle in favor of the caps. I \nagree with it. But that principle is violated by the budget plan \nsubmitted by the President. That is why I think we are going to see a \nsignificant number of Members on the other side of the aisle vote \nagainst the President's plan, because the plan does not carry out the \nprinciples that he has so widely espoused and been so roundly cheered \nfor espousing.\n  Here is another principle from the President himself. This is from \nthe State of the Union Message, January 27, 1998. Within the first \nportion of the remarks, he said:\n\n       If we balance the budget for next year, it is projected we \n     will have a sizable surplus in the years immediately after. \n     What should we do with the projected surplus? I have a simple \n     four word answer: save Social Security first. Tonight, I \n     propose that we reserve 100 percent of the surplus--that is, \n     every penny of any surplus--until we have taken all the \n     measures necessary to strengthen the Social Security system \n     for the 21st century.\n\n  That was one time I was pleased to stand up and applaud the \nPresident, because I agreed with that principle. I agreed with the \nprinciple that we ought to take the money from the surplus, the \nsurpluses we are seeing now, and apply them against Social Security. \nBut what does the President's plan do? The President's plan, as \noutlined in the budget--you have heard about the devil being in the \ndetails. Man, that is an understatement when it comes to the \nPresident's budget, because it is full of devils. You can imagine what \nyou call a place that is full of devils. There is a place named for \nthat. That is what the President's budget is. The President's plan \nwould spend a whopping $158 billion of the Social Security surplus on \nthe President's big spending schemes.\n\n[[Page S3215]]\n\n  Let me show you this chart. Here is an opportunity to take a look at \nthe difference in the two plans. Here is the plan before us, Senator \nDomenici's plan, ``The Fate of the Social Security.'' It says here is \nthe surplus. Here is the President's plan. He says we can save this \nmuch, and then we want to invest some in equities. I believe Senator \nAshcroft addressed that equity question. He wants to have the Federal \nGovernment investing in the stock market and taking \ncontrol, potentially, of companies through ownership--a new form of \nnationalization, a national economic scheme that would make a central \nplanner of the Marx or Lenin era salivate with anticipation. And then \nthe President wants to spend $158 billion out of that surplus. That, \nMr. President, is not saving the Social Security surplus for Social \nSecurity.\n\n  These are some of the specifics of the plan. That is why we need an \nup-or-down vote on the President's plan, not on some vague statement by \nthe President on the principles. That is why I have offered the plan.\n  Let's talk a little bit about Medicare. We have heard that the \nPresident does wonderful things about Medicare. Well, you know, I was \nvery interested. I want to look at this because the President's plan \ncuts about $9 billion out of Medicare for the next 5 years to pay for \nnew spending programs.\n  Mr. President, in my State, if you freeze hospital payments and you \nsqueeze down on the money that the providers are getting, you are on \nthe verge of doing something disastrous. Many of the small rural \nhospitals and rural health care providers in my State are at the point \nwhere they can no longer stay in business if the reimbursements are \nratcheted down. The system has fatal flaws in it that need to be \ncorrected. Throwing money at a fatally flawed system will not save it, \nand ratcheting it down further is going to wind up having small rural \nhospitals closed, having rural hospitals no longer able to take \nMedicare patients. It is going to wind up in denying Medicare to the \npeople who most need it.\n  If we are serious about Medicare reform--and I hope we all are--we \nhad better go to work on the recommendations made by the bipartisan \nmembers of the Medicare Commission, led by our colleagues, Senators \nBreaux and Kerrey on the other side, with the active leadership of \nSenators Gramm and Frist on our side, and others, because throwing \nmoney at Medicare is not going to save a system that is fatally flawed.\n  I wish to clear away some of the chaff that has been thrown out in \ndiscussions about Medicare by citing a fellow who I believe is a rather \ncredible observer, David Broder. On March 15, he wrote an article that \nappeared in the St. Louis Post Dispatch, talking about the fury of some \nof the Finance Committee members in the Senate. He explained it. He \nsaid:\n\n       The committee had just received prepared testimony saying \n     in unusually blunt language that Clinton, far from cracking \n     the Medicare problem, may be making it worse. Dan Crippen, \n     the director of CBO, said that by transferring $350 billion \n     from the anticipated budget surpluses to the Medicare trust \n     fund, the Clinton plan would ``delay the date of \n     insolvency.''\n       But the transfer would do nothing to address the underlying \n     problem: ``Rapid growth in spending for Medicare. . .will \n     still outstrip anticipated revenues.''\n\n  Listen to what Broder said:\n\n       The prescription drug benefits Clinton touted (but left out \n     of his budget because he has no way to pay for them) ``would \n     be popular with beneficiaries,'' Crippen said, ``but the \n     additional program costs would be large.''\n\n  Broder goes on to opine:\n\n       By raising expectations, Clinton has made the Medicare \n     problem worse.\n       David M. Walker, the head of GAO, was even more biting. By \n     proposing a large-scale shift of general revenues to a \n     program now largely financed by payroll taxes, Walker said, \n     the Clinton proposal ``could serve to undermine the remaining \n     fiscal discipline associated with a self-financing trust fund \n     concept.''\n       Meantime, he said, ``it has no effect on the current and \n     projected cash-flow deficits'' in Medicare and ``would not \n     provide any new money to pay for medical services.'' The \n     Clinton program, he said, ``does not include any meaningful \n     program reform that would slow spending growth. . ..At the \n     same time, it could strengthen pressure to expand Medicare \n     benefits in a program that is fundamentally unsustainable in \n     its present form.''\n\n  There you have it. You have the President's budget plan, which is \nsmoke and mirrors as far as Medicare goes. We have had the testimony \nbefore the Budget Committee from the Director of CBO and the Director \nof the General Accounting Office. It does nothing for Medicare. It \nprovides some transfer of trust fund balances and shifts money back and \nforth with funny accounting. It gives new life to that old meaning \nthat, ``I'm from the Federal Government, trust me. I am going to \nshuffle notes around and claim that we have solved some problems.''\n\n  The Clinton plan puts more IOUs into Social Security that will \nincrease the debt held by the public. It is likely that the plan that \nhe has presented will actually increase the debt that my son and the \nchildren and grandchildren of this country will have to carry for the \nrest of their lives. By raising the debt, it does nothing to save \nSocial Security; it just increases the burden. Oh, yes. And taxes. At a \ntime when we are looking at surpluses, he increases taxes so there will \nbe more money to spend. This is a real plan. These are not principles. \nThis is what his plan does. If there are some in this body who think \nthat the President outlined the right way to go, I would say show me. \nShow me your support for it. Here is what it does. Show me if you are \nwilling to vote for it.\n  Mr. President, I don't know a lot of our colleagues who want to \nendorse a plan like that. I certainly wouldn't. But I appreciate the \nopportunity to give them the chance to speak up for the President's \nplan.\n  I thank the Chair. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Does the Senator \nintend to use the remainder of his time?\n  Mr. BOND. I would be happy to yield to any of my colleagues, or turn \nthe time over to our distinguished chairman to allocate to such \ncolleagues if they wish to speak on related areas. I would be happy to \nhave the chairman of the committee allocate the time to any of our \ncolleagues.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 14 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have 14 minutes under the agreement on first-degree \namendments. How much time would the Senator like? The Senator can have \n14 minutes. There is still time on the bill.\n  Ms. SNOWE. No. Actually less, I say to the chairman. Mr. President, I \nwant to speak on one facet of this issue, and I will speak again later. \nI thank the chairman. I appreciate his yielding me this time.\n  I had intended to address the entire issue of the budget resolution \nas a member of the Budget Committee, because I think this was an \nextraordinary process in the Budget Committee. I want to commend the \nchairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, for doing an \noutstanding job, and for his exceptional leadership in balancing the \nmany issues that came before the Budget Committee in crafting a budget \nthat strengthens and improves some areas of the budget, preserves the \nSocial Security surplus, and also addresses an issue that the debate is \nnow apparently focusing on, and that is, of course, the issue of \nMedicare.\n  The reason I decided to take to the floor at this time is because I \nthought it was important to talk about the issue of the Medicare \nprescription drug benefit in the budget resolution. First of all, I was \nsomewhat surprised to hear the tenor of the debate that has occurred on \nthe floor with respect to a particular provision--the reserve fund for \nthe Medicare prescription drug benefit program that is included in the \nbudget resolution.\n  I should point out that it was the reserve fund that will provide for \nthe assurance and the guarantee that if we get a Medicare reform \npackage, we will also be able to fund a prescription drug benefit \nprogram. Thanks to the chairman of the Budget Committee, who was \nwilling to agree to use the onbudget surpluses as a way to preserve the \nprescription drug benefit program. I had offered an amendment in the \ncommittee that provided for a reserve fund for the prescription drug \nbenefit program so that we would not have to have the 60-vote hurdle on \nthe floor of the Senate in order to provide funding for that program. \nThe very fact that we have a reserve fund in this current budget \nresolution allows for a prescription drug benefit program and\n\n[[Page S3216]]\n\ngives all the more certainty that is going to occur.\n\n  We include language that that prescription drug benefit program is \nalso contingent on a reform package that would advance the solvency of \nthe Medicare program. I think we all agree that is of necessity, given \nthe fact that the Part A program is going to go bankrupt by the year \n2008. Given the fact that we now have a reserve fund for the \nprescription drug benefit program in this budget resolution, I think it \nwill give confidence and will serve as a catalyst for reform of the \nMedicare program.\n  But what is also important here in this debate this evening--that is \nwhy I decided to take to the floor tonight at this time, I say to my \ncolleagues and to the Senator from Oregon, Senator Wyden--is to restore \nsome bipartisanship and stability to this debate on this particular \nissue. The fact is my amendment which created the reserve fund for the \nprescription drug benefit program and Medicare garnered the support of \nall of the Democrats and all of the Republicans on the committee. It \nreceived a bipartisan vote of 21 to 1 in the Budget Committee--almost \nunanimous support for this provision. It received bipartisan support \nfor this new Medicare prescription drug benefit, if legislation that \nreforms the Medicare program is reported out of the Senate Finance \nCommittee.\n  Crafting that reserve fund ensures that there will be a prescription \ndrug benefit program of some kind using the onbudget surpluses.\n  But what is important here this evening is to underscore the fact \nthat it received overwhelming bipartisan support in the committee, \nbecause we recognize that there is a glaring need for prescription drug \ncoverage in the Medicare package in the Medicare benefit program. \nSenator Wyden and I will be working with senior citizens groups and \nhealth care experts over the coming weeks to develop bipartisan \nlegislation to try to see what we can do to ensure that coverage is \nprovided. But currently it is important for Members to understand that \nthere is a reserve fund in this budget resolution for that very \npurpose.\n  I am somewhat surprised to hear the statements that have been made \nhere on the floor of the Senate suggesting that somehow there is no \ncoverage for a prescription drug program, that there is no way that \nthere is any money for Medicare or the drug benefit program when \nnothing could be further from the truth. The fact is that was one of \nthe issues in the Budget Committee that received overwhelming \nbipartisan support. That is the way we want to keep it. Senator Wyden \nand I will be working to do just that, because we know that it is \nabsolutely imperative that we provide this benefit to the senior \ncitizens of this country.\n  Medicare currently does not provide that benefit. Yet, 12 percent of \nthe elderly in this country are the ones who spend more than a third of \nall of the costs of prescription drugs in this country. So, therefore, \nwe need to provide some kind of comprehensive package and benefit \nprogram for our senior citizens on how we do that. We plan to work on \nit over the weeks and months ahead.\n\n  But I do think it is important for Members to realize that there is a \nreserve fund for this purpose in this budget. It is not IOUs, as in the \nPresident's plan, I might add. In fact, as part of my amendment, it \nprohibits the transfer of these IOUs to the Medicare trust fund as \nproposed by the President. So they can't allow a transfer. That is an \nartificial benefit to the Medicare program. It doesn't essentially do \nanything to the Medicare program. I think we all recognize that. And, \ntherefore, there is a prohibition against the transfer of IOUs to the \ntrust fund, because it is not going to do anything to enhance the \nsolvency of the Medicare trust fund. In fact, to the contrary.\n  We are going to try to do everything that we can, not only to use the \nonbudget surpluses, but any other additional funding that could be \navailable to ensure that there will be permanent funding of the \nprescription drug benefit program in the future. We think it is \nabsolutely essential. We think it is a priority. That is why it is in \nthis budget resolution. And thanks to the leadership of the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee, it happens to be there.\n  I hope Members will in no way denigrate what is in the committee \nresolution, because, if this provision wasn't in the budget resolution, \nwe would have no way of assuring that there would be funding of the \nprescription drug benefit program that we addressed in the Medicare \nreform in this session of the Congress.\n  Mr. President, I hope that we understand exactly what is in this \nbudget resolution.\n  I hope we do not make this a partisan debate. Many of us have worked \nacross the aisle to ensure that we maintain bipartisanship when it \ncomes to the reforming of the Medicare program. We hope we can preserve \nthat approach. We will continue to do everything that we can to ensure \nthat is the case. That is why I am pleased to have been able to work \nwith Senator Wyden to see how we can further develop initiatives to \nensure that prescription drug benefit program does get funded in this \nbudget and in this reform effort of the Medicare program in the future.\n  I want to make sure Members understand. If this reserve fund was not \nin the budget resolution, which was supported on a bipartisan basis, \nthere would be absolutely nothing for prescription drugs. Because the \nPresident did not provide anything for prescription drugs. There was \nnot one penny that was provided for, as far as this benefit is \nconcerned, in his budget; not even a plan. So there was no mechanism \nand this reserve fund establishes this mechanism. It was supported by \nalmost everybody on the Senate Budget Committee.\n  Now I will be pleased to yield to my colleague from Oregon, Senator \nWyden.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Maine.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I will be happy to yield to the chairman.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I know everyone is wondering when we are \ngoing to vote. I ask unanimous consent we will start rollcall votes at \n8 o'clock and we will have at that time stacked--you can write this up \nfor me in more eloquent language if it needs it--Ashcroft, Conrad, \nBond, and I assume it is Wellstone-Johnson or Johnson-Wellstone, and if \nwe have time we will call Senator Specter down before that and have \nthat one. Those will be at least the four that will be stacked and we \nwill see what happens after that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Is it the intention of the chairman that we have \nthese votes consolidated, the first one maybe the regular 15, and then \n10-minute votes after that?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think what I ought to do is let that sink in around \nhere first before we see if anyone would really complain to a shortened \ntimeframe.\n  I thank Senator Wyden for yielding to me.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield up to 10 minutes off the \nresolution to our colleague from Oregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Jersey for \ngiving me this time, and also, before he leaves, the chairman of the \nfull committee, Senator Domenici. Since I have been here, both Senator \nLautenberg and Senator Domenici have worked very closely with me on a \nspecial passion I have in terms of public service, which is health \ncare. I thank them for all their assistance.\n  Let me also say to the Senator from Maine, I am so glad she has been \nwilling to put in all this time on this issue because it seems to me, \ncolleagues, that after the Medicare Commission it is especially \nimportant that the Senate demonstrate that it is possible to take on \nthis Medicare issue in a bipartisan fashion. The reserve fund that \nSenator Snowe and I have developed, that will be perfected tomorrow, is \ngoing to allow for a significant step forward in Medicare reform. It is \nan addition to the Medicare program that is so important to the \nvulnerable elderly, but also will ensure it is responsibly financed.\n  Suffice it to say, the legislation Senator Snowe and I have pursued \nis not\n\n[[Page S3217]]\n\ngoing to be seen as perfection to partisans on either side. But I will \ntell you the seniors that we represent, and there are more than 20 \npercent of them who spend over $1,000 a year out of pocket on their \nprescription medicine, they are going to say this legislation is a \nsignificant step forward.\n  We have millions of older people in this country who are walking on \nan economic tightrope. They are balancing their food costs against \ntheir medical bills and their medical bills against their housing \nexpenses. They do not want to see the Senate spend its time bickering \nabout Medicare reform. They want to see, as Senator Snowe has just \nsaid, the Senate get serious about real reform as we have tried to do \nwith the overwhelming vote that we got in the Budget Committee on the \nquestion of prescription drugs.\n  I think it is well understood we are literally on the cusp of a \npharmaceutical revolution today. A lot of the therapies and the drugs \nand devices today constitute perhaps the very best health care \npreventive program we could have in our country, because what they do \nis prevent unnecessary hospitalizations. They keep older folks out of \nthese acute care facilities.\n  I say to the Senate today, if we can take the first step, the first \nstep in the next couple of days, with this breakthrough in Medicare in \nterms of covering pharmaceutical services, I think it will also \nconstitute a breakthrough in terms of preventive health care, because I \nbelieve a lot of these new medicines can prevent hospitalizations and \ncostly institutional care.\n  As the Senator from Maine has indicated, the heart of our bipartisan \nproposal is to stipulate that a portion of the onbudget surplus could \nbe used to meet the needs of vulnerable older people. I will also say I \nthink as the Senate Finance Committee goes forward with this issue--\nbecause, of course, it will be their job to actually craft a number of \nthe details of this legislation--it will be possible for the Senate \nFinance Committee to look at a variety of ways to fund this important \nbreakthrough in Medicare reform. But the bottom line is they will have \nsome options in looking at this issue because, as part of the budget \nprocess, we will have set out a general outline, the overall parameters \nof what really would be after the Medicare Reform Commission has \nreported--and we have seen the frustrations that surround it. We can \nthen say to the country we at least have made the beginnings of real \nMedicare reform, responsibly financed.\n\n  I will also say I think as we go forward we ought to make some tough \nchoices with respect to this drug benefit. Perhaps not all of our \ncolleagues agree, but I happen to think the Senate should not say that \nLee Iacocca ought to have access to the same kind of prescription \nbenefit as would an elderly woman, a 78-year-old who has Alzheimer's, \nan income of $13,000 a year, and a prescription drug bill out of pocket \nof $2,000. I do not think we ought to treat those two the same. But \nthat is an issue we can talk about as this legislation goes forward.\n  I indicated I would be brief. I want to wrap up by thanking our \ncolleague from Maine, Senator Snowe. She and I have been active in \nthese senior issues since our days in the House of Representatives. I \nwant to tell her I think it is especially helpful that she has been \nwilling to come forward and lead this kind of bipartisan effort after \nthe frustrations of the Medicare Commission so we can show the country \nwe are at least making a beginning.\n  I know a number of our other colleagues care greatly about this \nissue. Senator Kennedy from Massachusetts has been a leader in this \neffort to extend prescription drug coverage as well. He and I both feel \nstrongly that the key to getting started with this issue is to use a \nportion of the onbudget surplus to make sure seniors, vulnerable \nseniors, will have access to this benefit.\n  I think there is a reason that the Senate Budget Committee voted 21 \nto 1, I believe, for this benefit. We are going to refine it in the \nnext day or so, but I think we are showing the country we can expand \ncoverage for the vulnerable and do it in a responsible way. I hope our \ncolleagues will support our effort in the next day or so as we move to \na final vote on that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, may I have 2 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to congratulate our friends and \ncolleagues from Maine and from Oregon for their focus on the issue of \nprescription drugs. I look forward to the proposal that we are going to \nhave tomorrow.\n  I am looking through the reserve fund language now. There are a \nnumber of constraints on the reserve fund. For example, before that \nreserve fund can be triggered, there has to be the guarantee that there \nis going to be financial solvency for Medicare from anywhere from 9 to \n12 years, without any revenues from the President's program or other \nsources.\n  I wonder how we could possibly meet that requirement without having \ndramatic and significant cuts in the Medicare program. I welcome the \nopportunity to have a reserve fund that can really do the job on this \nissue. I welcome the chance to work with our colleagues to make sure \nthat it is done. Hopefully, we can do it in a way that is going to be \nmeaningful, because we do not want to represent that we are making \nsignificant progress in the area of expanding access to prescription \ndrugs without really doing so.\n  I know the Senators from Maine and Oregon are really interested in \nthe substance of it. I know they want to do the right thing. The \ncurrent proposal is unacceptable, but I look forward to supporting \nefforts to make sure that we get a substantial downpayment to provide \nprescription drugs in Medicare this year.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to respond to the amendment \nwhich was offered by the Senator from Missouri, who had essentially \npresented President Clinton's budget recommendations to us. I want to \nmake note of a couple of things.\n  While I support the direction of the President's budget, I am going \nto oppose this amendment, because I believe it isn't a serious attempt \nto enact the President's plan. Rather, I see it as a transparent \npolitical gimmick that has been reviewed in our committee and voted \nupon. Democrats, like Republicans, voted against the budget. That does \nnot mean we are against the general theme or the thrust of the \nPresident's budget. There are things in the budget that we want to \nexamine specifically.\n  Frankly, I think it is pretty obvious that it is designed to \ndiscredit the President's budget. It dismisses the contribution to \nMedicare that we have established in some of the amendments we tried to \noffer in the Budget Committee discussions on the budget resolution.\n  What I heard said was that if we are serious about reform, then we \nought to get on with it. The fact that we are going to increase the \nlongevity of Medicare from 2008 to 2020, a period of 12 years, is \ndismissed as casual, trite--``chaff'' was the word that was used--as \nnot being serious. On the other hand, what I heard the Senator say is \nthat he was looking at reform. He thought there was a good program that \nwas proposed there, a proposal that would take higher deductibles, \nhigher co-pays, perhaps reducing some of the hospital availability.\n  That sounded like what the Senator was proposing in terms of his view \nof what we had to do with Medicare, that his reform was designed to, \nother than adding financial stability to it, to do these other things.\n\n  Well, maybe he wants to discuss the Medicare reform this evening, \nbecause it looks like, in its present condition, some of the changes in \nthe program would be fairly painful to the Medicare beneficiaries.\n  One of the things I do not think I made clear in my remarks before, \nwhen I responded to the challenge to capitalists, one of the things \nthat causes me to want to pay my share, whatever that fair share is, to \nsupport the programs that this country offers, like health care through \nMedicare, like a chance at an education, like a chance at a job, like a \nchance to bring children up in a safe environment--that is why we have \nour police program adding 100,000 policemen to the streets of our \ncities--like adding teachers, like reducing class size, I want to live \nin that\n\n[[Page S3218]]\n\nkind of a country. I want to live in the kind of a country that says \npeople who are in the middle, people who are hard-working, people of \nmodest income, people are not looking at this society and saying: Wow, \nit is really unfair; those guys, those people at the top, get \neverything, and we are left with the dregs.\n  Not so. That is why this country, despite its growth, its absorption \nof different cultures and ethnicities, is able to get on so relatively \npeacefully. Why? It is because people believe they have a chance at \nsuccess. That is the way I want to do it. I want to make my \ncontribution. It is made by way of taxes. It is made by way of other \nthings that many of us do, whether it is philanthropic activity or \notherwise.\n  I want to do it, because I want to do it for my children. I do not \nwant them to live in a society where everybody is so angry that they \nwant to take it out on my family and other families. We have enough of \nthat violence on our streets and in our communities. I want to get rid \nof that.\n  You either pay or you hire security guards or you make sure your \nburglar alarm is on every minute of the day and night. That is the \ncondition we have arrived at.\n  I see a lessening of that. I see a lessening, very frankly, of the \nracial distrust that exists. It is not perfect by a longshot. That is \nwhat I see as America.\n  I am happy to say that if you make $800,000, you pay and you don't \nget a $20,000 rebate. I want to trust this Government that those of us \nhere have a share of running and say, OK, we will watch you; we will \nwatch the way you spend the money and so forth. But I do not see the \nkinds of result that others talk about here at times, throwing your \nmoney to the Government where they put it down the drain, where they \nsquander it on things, where they just disregard the importance of the \nresource. I don't see it.\n\n  What I see is that this is a trick tactic. This presentation of the \nPresident's budget is designed to embarrass Democrats, and the majority \nis proposing an amendment that they intend to oppose. This is an \namendment that is being offered that is going to be opposed by the \nofferer. That should make it clear enough that this is political \nhijinks and not a serious amendment.\n  We should not spend our time debating every dot and comma in the \nPresident's budget, because every one of us can find something to \ncriticize in that budget. Republicans have the luxury of not presenting \na budget that goes into the same level of detail as the President's \nbudget. Their budget, the Republican budget, is a rough outline, and \nthat is what we should be debating here--basic principles, broad \noutlines of the budget. I think it is clear that there is broad \nDemocratic support for the framework in the President's budget.\n  The President wants to reserve 77 percent of projected surpluses to \nreduce debt, save for Social Security and Medicare, and I think that is \nthe right approach for our future. But the Bond amendment is not asking \nus to support the general approach of the President's budget. It is \nasking us to support the entire budget, that presumably means that \nevery single item in that budget is satisfactory.\n  Mr. President, if I can lift it, I want you to take a look at the \nPresident's budget. This is the size of the President's budget. It has \n1,291 pages, and that is what we are being asked to approve tonight in \nthis gimmicky amendment that we are looking at.\n  I think the public sees through this. Certainly Senators see through \nit, even some of those who are on the side of the proposers. I ask if \nany Senator wants to endorse every single number in this volume. I \ndoubt it.\n  I turn to page 105 of the budget. It says that we should provide $400 \nmillion for the Dairy Recourse Loan Program. There might be some in \nhere who like that program, but I bet you that the majority are not \ngoing to like it, and I am not sure we should be endorsing that \nspecific kind of a figure here today.\n  There are literally thousands of other very specific numbers in this \nbudget, and nobody here is fully familiar with it. Nobody is going to \nagree to all of these numbers and these conclusions. But that does not \nmean we are repudiating the general theme of the President's budget, \nand no one should be confused about that.\n  I am going to ask my Democratic colleagues to join me, and all those \nwho want to make sense out of what we are doing here and want to be \nserious, to vote against this amendment because it is, again, designed, \nI think, to be hijinks, tricks, gimmicks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, does the distinguished Senator from \nOregon desire to ask the Senate something?\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I have an amendment that Senator \nSarbanes and I wish to offer. It will take but a few minutes, if we can \ndo that. I think it will be accepted by both sides.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have agreed that we are going to vote at 8 o'clock. \nWe have another amendment to take up. I hope you will not take too \nlong. Do you think you can do it in 2 minutes?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Two each?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Two each, that makes 4. Go ahead.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 152\n\n       (Purpose: To express the Sense of the Senate on providing \n     adequate foreign affairs funding.)\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk \nand ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nlaid aside. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Smith], for himself and Mr. \n     Sarbanes, proposes an amendment numbered 152.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following \n     new section and number it accordingly:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE ON PROVIDING ADEQUATE FUNDING \n                   FOR U.S. INTERNATIONAL LEADERSHIP.\n\n       (a) Fundings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) U.S. international leadership is essential to \n     maintaining security and peace for all Americans;\n       (2) such leadership depends on effective diplomacy as well \n     as a strong military;\n       (3) effective diplomacy requires adequate resources both \n     for embassy security and for international programs;\n       (4) in addition to building peace, prosperity and democracy \n     around the world, programs in the International Affairs (150) \n     account serve U.S. interests by ensuring better jobs and a \n     higher standard of living, promoting the health of our \n     citizens and preserving our natural environment, and \n     protecting the rights and safety of those who travel or do \n     business overseas;\n       (5) real spending for International Affairs has declined \n     more than 50 percent since the mid-1980s, at the same time \n     that major new challenges and opportunities have arisen from \n     the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the worldwide \n     trends toward democracy and free markets;\n       (6) current ceilings on discretionary spending will impose \n     severe additional cuts in funding for International Affairs; \n     and\n       (7) improved security for U.S. diplomatic missions and \n     personnel will place further strain on the International \n     Affairs budget absent significant additional resources.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that additional \n     budgetary resources should be identified for function 150 to \n     enable successful U.S. international leadership.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, my friend from Maryland and I \nrise today to offer a sense of the Senate out of the concern for the \n150 account out of the U.S. budget. It is an account that funds our \nefforts abroad, our foreign relations.\n  As we speak this evening, bombs are falling on Serbia. I simply note \nthat there are a lot of bombs falling in the world today. It seems like \nmore all the time. Yet, since the mid-1980s, our foreign affairs budget \nhas fallen by 50 percent.\n  I supported the President last night. It was a difficult decision. We \nare picking among bad options, but, frankly, a good option for us is to \nwage more peace, a little less war. It seems to me we ought to find a \nway to limit within the caps but recognize the value to this country of \nwaging peace through diplomacy.\n  Senator Sarbanes and I have held hearings, at the instruction of the \nchairman, on the 150 account in the last Congress and share a concern\n\n[[Page S3219]]\n\nabout the direction of the 150 account and stand together today to \noffer this and hope that the Senate can find the resources to do better \nby our efforts at waging peace.\n  I turn to my colleague from Maryland, Senator Sarbanes, and yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I thank the able Senator from Oregon for \njoining in this initiative. This is an effort to focus attention on the \nneed to provide adequate funding for International Affairs, the so-\ncalled 150 account, which is essential for maintaining our security and \nbuilding peace. U.S. international leadership requires effective \ndiplomacy, which is in many ways our first line of defense. If we do it \neffectively, we do not have to resort to using our military strength.\n  I want to make it very clear that the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee has been sensitive to this problem. We appreciate the \nconstraints within which the committee has had to work, and in the past \nthe chairman has been responsive to our concern.\n  Secretary Albright, of course, has just made some very strong \nstatements about how pressed and handicapped she feels by the funding \nlevels proposed in this budget. This amendment is an effort to show \nthat the Members of this body recognize the importance of providing the \nnecessary resources for the conduct of U.S. diplomacy, and our \nintention, as we move through this budget process, to find additional \nfunds with which to address the programs in the 150 account.\n  We have an urgent and sustained requirement to provide for upgrades \nin embassy security. We do not want to take that out of the other \ninternational programs, because that account is already at rock \nbottom--indeed, below rock bottom.\n  Mr. President, recently I received a letter from the Coalition for \nAmerican Leadership Abroad, which stated in part:\n       We are deeply concerned that over the last decade our \n     institutions, programs, and the necessary resources to \n     support diplomacy, America's front line in today's world, \n     have been seriously impacted by budget cuts. Our \n     organization, the Coalition for American Leadership Abroad \n     (COLEAD), a nonpartisan coalition of 37 non-profit foreign \n     affairs organizations, seeks to support and strengthen \n     American engagement in world affairs. We believe that we \n     should not withdraw from the world and that American \n     leadership in world affairs is not only vital for our \n     national interests and security but also to build a better \n     world community. We should not turn our backs on the 95% of \n     mankind beyond our borders.\n       U.S. funding for our diplomatic effort, in its many forms, \n     has decreased by some 50% in real terms over the past dozen \n     years. We are especially concerned about the projected \n     downward trend in the foreign affairs budget for the next \n     three years. Thus, we need to restore a rational sense of \n     balance and proportion to our funding allocations for \n     programs that preserve and protect our interests abroad. \n     Effective American diplomatic leadership cannot exist without \n     resources. We strongly believe that the time has come to \n     examine American interests and programs in order to develop a \n     broad bi-partisan consensus which would gain public and \n     leadership support. We need to develop a better and wider \n     consensus about how best to support these efforts in terms of \n     institutions and resources. Our goal should start and end \n     with a stronger America abroad, rather than a weaker nation \n     in world affairs.\n  Mr. President, hopefully, as we work through this budget process over \nthe coming weeks and months, we will be able to find a way to respond \nto the challenges that we are facing with respect to the various \nprograms and policies that are contained in the 150 account.\n  As Secretary Albright has pointed out, there is a clear and present \ndanger to American safety, prosperity, and values if we do not \nadequately address the resource question.\n  I am very hopeful that we will be able to come to grips with this in \na realistic way, and I appreciate the initiative of my distinguished \ncolleague from Oregon in this regard. This is simply a call to begin \nconfronting this problem as we move down the budget path. I am pleased \nto join in support of this amendment.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article by \nRobert Oakley be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, March 16, 1999]\n\n               Nickels and Dimes for the State Department\n\n                           (By Robert Oakley)\n\n       There is an urgent need for the president, the Office of \n     Management and Budget, the State Department and Congress to \n     increase funding for the newly reorganized foreign policy \n     establishment. This need starts with the unbudgeted security \n     improvements of some $10 billion identified by the Crowe \n     Report but does not stop there. As it is, a large part of the \n     additional--but inadequate--funding already requested for \n     security will come at the expense of substantive personnel \n     and operations, which are already hurting badly. This is \n     directly contrary on Adm. Crowe's warning that ``additional \n     funds for security must be obtained without diverting funds \n     from our major foreign affairs programs.''\n       In the immediate aftermath of the African embassy bombings, \n     the State Department consulted with OMB and agreed upon an FY \n     1999 emergency supplemental request of $1.4 billion for \n     immediate security needs in Nairobi. Dar es Salaam and \n     worldwide, including more than $250 million for additional \n     security personnel. For FY 2000, OMB has approved the request \n     of an additional one-time security increase for the State \n     Department of $3 billion, using the gimmick of an advance \n     appropriation ``borrowed'' from FY 2001-2005. This is far \n     below what Adm. Crowe recommended. Moreover, this approach is \n     almost certain to damage seriously through FY 2005 the \n     continuing substantive operations of the reorganized State \n     Department (including the U.S. Information Agency, the Arms \n     Control and Disarmament Agency and the Agency for \n     International Development), given the ceilings currently \n     stipulated by OMB and the balanced-budget act.\n       One has heard and read a great deal during the past year \n     about serious problems of readiness, morale, retention and \n     recruitment of the top-flight men and women of our armed \n     forces. Action has been taken to correct these problems. We \n     have also heard about accumulated difficulties affecting our \n     intelligence agencies. Here, again, major increases in \n     funding have been provided to assist the CIA. No such action \n     has been taken, and none appears envisaged for the foreign \n     affairs agencies, although we are in a period of relative \n     peace rather than under the threat of the Cold War. The last \n     assignment cycle of the Department of State had 3,300 vacant \n     positions but only 2,700 people to fill them.\n       There is no question that our military and intelligence \n     personnel and operations have been seriously stressed by the \n     large number of unexpected crises over the past decade \n     (Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, Kosovo, Sierra Leone, Congo, etc.), \n     yet deployments of military forces have been matched by the \n     need for additional civilian personnel in equal or greater \n     proportion. Conflict, prevention, containment and resolution \n     require civilian personnel from the State Department, USIA \n     and AID. They not only manage their own, new programs but \n     also assist the United States and other military forces and \n     international and non-governmental organizations to take the \n     comprehensive approach required for success.\n       This involves much more than important negotiations by \n     experienced diplomats such as Dick Holbrooke, Chris Hill and \n     their teams. It also means humanitarian assistance, \n     monitoring of human rights, promotion of democracy, \n     processing of refugees and controlling displaced persons \n     outside this country, and rehabilitation of economic, \n     political and security institutions.\n       Aside from the crises and conflict-related civilian \n     activities, there have also been increased requirements to \n     promote U.S. business interests in the era of globalization, \n     protect U.S. citizens, generate cooperation by other \n     governments in preventing the proliferation of weapons of \n     mass destruction and confronting narcotics, terrorism and \n     organized crime, and deal with pollution and disease before \n     they threaten the United States. Much of this is mandated by \n     Congress. All of this is important for U.S. national \n     interests.\n       Prominent senior statesmen have recently completed two \n     major studies of the State Department and the conduct of \n     foreign affairs for the Stimson Center and the Center for \n     Strategic and International Studies. They identify major \n     shortcomings and call for major improvements in our civilian \n     foreign affairs agencies. This will require substantial \n     additional funding, yet the trend has been and apparently \n     will continue to be the other way. The security problem \n     highlighted by Adm. Crowe's report, his followup letter and \n     public comments is only part of this growing problem.\n       Some say that OMB and Congress are not really interested in \n     more money for foreign affairs because the matter does not \n     have the domestic political appeal and support that our \n     military and intelligence establishments enjoy. Let us hope \n     that this is not the case. It is very doubtful that the large \n     numbers of American people who travel or have business \n     interests abroad, or who worry about the global economy and \n     the global environment, feel this way. They would understand \n     and support an increase for combined State Department \n     operations and security. The amount needed is small compared \n     with increases for the Defense Department. The State \n     Department must fight harder in requesting what it really \n     needs, and the president must reinforce the request so that \n     Congress will be able to debate and decide upon what to \n     approve.\n\n[[Page S3220]]\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment \n(Amendment # 152) being introduced today by the Senators from Oregon \n[Mr. Smith] and Maryland [Mr. Sarbanes].\n  This amendment expresses the Sense of the Senate that the resources \nidentified in the underlying budget resolution for Function 150 \n(International Affairs) be sufficient to enable successful U.S. \ninternational leadership.\n  Mr. President, this is an enormously important amendment that comes \nat a critical time. Function 150 encompasses the majority of our \ninternational programs including the operating budget of the Department \nof State. Representing barely one percent of our entire federal budget, \nour investment in Function 150 is the American investment in our \nnational security.\n  The post-Cold War era has brought with it new challenges and new \nresponsibilities for the world's only remaining superpower. Yet real \nspending for International Affairs has declined more than 50 percent \nsince the mid-1980s.\n  Mr. President, national security can not be viewed solely through a \ndefense lens, but also must comprise all the critical preventative \nmeasures offered through an active foreign affairs program. This means \ncontinuing to be active in fighting the spread of disease and drugs, \nproviding adequate nutrition for children and families, and pursuing \nU.S. goals in arms reduction. I also believe we should continue to make \nappropriate contributions to the multilateral institutions, in \nparticular the United Nations, on which the United States relies.\n  In short, Mr. President, only through committed support to both \ndiplomacy and defense can we utilize all the tools available to us to \nprotect our national security and advance our overseas interests.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. No objection.\n  Mr. President, I just say that I commend both the Senator from Oregon \nand the Senator from Maryland for offering this. I think that it is \nappropriate that we, as we assert our military might into the world \narena, try to establish the fact that we obey and want to see the rule \nof law observed, and yet we do not always pay our bills as we should. I \nthink that is kind of a contrary action to be taking. So I know the \nchairman is going to agree with me.\n  As I see members of our committee, I say to Senator Domenici, I see \npeople who are thoughtful and working hard, regardless of which side of \nthe aisle. We can get argumentative at times, but I am proud to work \nwith the members of the Budget Committee. I am particularly, obviously, \nimpressed with the work that is done by my colleagues on my side, but \nthat does not mean that I am not equally as impressed with what happens \nwith colleagues on the other side. It is just that we disagree on some \nthings.\n  So I wanted to make that statement.\n  Mr. Chairman?\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have no objection to the resolution. I hope that we \ncan find the resources that are alluded to. I do not think there should \nbe any false hope. It will be very difficult, unless they somehow or \nother decide to do something completely different from this budget. I \nregret that we had to establish priorities.\n  But I have great empathy. Since we live in this very tumultuous \nworld, we do want our foreign policy to be funded as well as possible. \nWe will work together and, hopefully, you will succeed.\n  Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 152) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we are going to go on to the next \namendment, which I understand is an amendment regarding veterans. But I \njust want to take 3 or 4 minutes and talk about the President's budget. \nI note my good friend, Senator Lautenberg, was talking about Senators \nshould not use words like ``embezzlement'' and that kind of thing to \ndescribe other people's motives. I do not think he should use the word \n``gimmick'' either. He called this proposal a gimmick. It is no gimmick \nat all.\n  In the committee, we just adopted the President's budget by a sense \nof the Senate. In this one, they actually prepared a budget that looks \nlike our kind of budget; that is, the President's budget. It took a lot \nof time. We used the Congressional Budget Office, and it is right. If \nyou want the President's budget, in a broad sense, you vote aye on the \nBond amendment.\n  Frankly, it is difficult for me to see those who have been praising \nthe President with reference to two very, very important things--Social \nSecurity and Medicare--vote against this budget, because I do believe \nthat is a recognition that on neither count does the President's budget \ndo what it says. Because I believe if it was a good Social Security \nproposal and a good Medicare proposal, those who are advocates for \nthose two programs on the other side would be voting for it even if the \nrest of it was not right up to snuff because those are the big issues.\n\n  The truth of the matter is, 100 Senators already said, in an early \nvote, on Senator Abraham's amendment--100 Senators--the President's \napproach to saving the Social Security trust fund is wrong. Now, they \nmight want to turn around and vote for the budget anyway, but they \nalready said, ``We don't want to spend $158 billion of the Social \nSecurity's money on programs.'' That was the vote.\n  Senator Bond says, ``Do you like the President's budget enough to \nvote for it?'' That is one of the things you would be voting for. I \nguarantee you, if that budget of the President's really fixed Medicare, \nthere would be no one on the other side who would be voting against \nthis, because they would be ashamed and embarrassed to find somebody to \nask them, ``How come you voted against this wonderful fix, reform, \nsaving of the Medicare system by the President?'' It is because it does \nnot do that. That is why.\n  So I do not think we need a lot of time trying to find excuses. It is \na pure, simple vote, up or down. Do you want the President's budget, \nwith all its claims for Social Security and Medicare, or do you not? I \ndo not think there would be very many Senators who say they do. And \nthat ought to take care of the issue once and for all as to this \nPresident running around saying what he does and what we don't do. Now, \nhe can talk about what we don't do, but he surely can't talk about what \nhe does. I guess he can, but he would have to acknowledge, if he wants \nto be fair, that nobody in the Senate agrees with him.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 153\n\n (Purpose: To increase funding in FY 2000 for veterans' health care by \n taking an across-the-board cut in all discretionary programs, except \n                         veterans and defense)\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I have an amendment I send to the desk \nand ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Johnson] for himself, \n     Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Reid and Mr. \n     Jeffords, proposes an amendment numbered 153.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 31 line 23 strike ``44,724,000,000''. and insert \n     ``46,724,000,000''.\n       On page 31 line 24 strike ``45,064,000,000''. and insert \n     ``47,064,000,000''.\n       On page 38 line 15 strike ``8,033,000,000''. and insert \n     ``10,033,000,000''.\n       On page 38 line 16 strike ``8,094,000,000''. and insert \n     ``10,094,000,000''.\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n       ``(A) It is the sense of the Senate that the provisions in \n     this resolution assume that if CBO determines there is an on-\n     budget surplus for FY 2000, $2 billion of that surplus will \n     be restored to the programs cut in this amendment.\n       ``(B) It is the sense of the Senate that the assumptions \n     underlying this budget resolution assume that none of these \n     offsets will come from defense of veterans, and to the extent \n     possible should come from administrative functions.''\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I ask unanimous consent that my legislative director, \nDwight Fettig, be permitted on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Minnesota,\n\n[[Page S3221]]\n\nMr. Wellstone, be added as a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. As well as the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Conrad, \nand the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kerry, and the Senator from \nNevada, Mr. Reid.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I think we can engage in this debate in a \nrelatively brief amount of time. But it is, I think, an issue that is \nfundamental. I applaud the Budget Committee chairman, Mr. Domenici, for \nworking to try to find ways to augment the veterans' health care budget \nfor the coming fiscal year.\n  The Presidential budget called for a flatline budget going on for 4 \nyears. We have had 3 years already in the flatline budget at the VA, \ndespite the fact that we have an enormous number of World War II age \nvets needing a greater amount of medical care and that we have \nincreased inflation in health care costs.\n  The independent budget, prepared by prominent veterans organizations \nin this country, has proposed conservatively that we need an additional \n$3 billion for veterans' health care in the coming year. Chairman \nDomenici has provided for a $1 billion increase. I applaud him for that \nbut recognize that still falls far short of where we need to go.\n  It is clear, from testimony that this Congress has received, that if \nwe do not make some further adjustments upward we are going to wind up \nwith a train wreck in terms of veterans' health care. We are going to \nwind up with mandatory employee furloughs, a severe curtailment of \nservices, or the elimination of programs and, inevitably, facility \nclosures around this country.\n  The amendment pending before the Senate would add the additional $2 \nbillion to provide for that $3 billion increase for fiscal year 2000. \nThe offset would come from an across-the-board reduction in the \nnondefense discretionary budget for this year.\n  Along with that goes a sense of the Senate that states:\n\n       (A) It is the sense of the Senate that the provisions in \n     this resolution assume that if CBO determines there is an on-\n     budget surplus for FY 2000, $2 billion of that surplus will \n     be restored to the programs cut in this amendment.\n       (B) It is the sense of the Senate that the assumptions \n     underlying this budget resolution assume that none of these \n     offsets will come from defense or veterans, and to the extent \n     possible should come from administrative functions.\n\n  We clearly have a crossroads we need to deal with here, Mr. \nPresident. We have to make some decisions now whether this country will \nremain committed to our veterans, remain committed to the people who \nhave given us the ability to speak here on this floor.\n  Earlier this year, we passed S. 4 having to do with retaining the \nbest, the brightest of our military personnel. It seems to me that this \nfollows on in that same general logic, recognizing that it is futile \nfor us to ask our military personnel to stay with us, to continue to \nput their lives at risk, to put up with all the hardships that they and \ntheir families suffer serving in our military, if they look around and \nfind we have reneged on our commitment to their fathers, to their \nuncles, to the generations that have gone before them.\n  If we do that, we undermine our very attempt earlier on this year to \nretain these people in our military service. At a time when we are yet \nagain undertaking a military action, in Kosovo, where the best and \nbrightest of our military personnel are, in many instances, \njeopardizing their lives once again for us, it seems to me it is not \nasking too much for our Senate to provide for a full health care \nbudget, adequate to meet the needs of our U.S. military veterans.\n\n  I hope we will be able to continue this level of funding in future \nyears. This amendment applies only to fiscal year 2000. We will have \nfurther opportunities to talk about what needs to be done next year as \nwe deal with the budget resolution again, as we deal with the \nappropriations process, as, hopefully, projected budget surpluses will \noccur and we will have those opportunities to use those kinds of \nsurpluses for offsets that will make sense.\n  However, it appears to me that the amendment, put together with the \nextraordinary assistance of the Senator from Minnesota, Mr. Wellstone, \nand his staff, as well as with the budget staff, creates an offset that \nis as painless as we can provide while, at the same time, providing for \nthis $2 billion infusion that is so badly needed, if, in fact, we are \ngoing to live up to our word to our American veterans.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and yield such time \nas he may consume to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Johnson from South \nDakota. We have been working pretty closely with the veterans community \nand, in particular, from the time they came out with their independent \nbudget. I have read that very carefully and I think this work by \nVeterans of Foreign Wars, DAV, PVA, and AmVets is a very important \ndocument. I might also add that many other organizations all around the \ncountry have added their strong support to this independent budget.\n  In addition to talking about the independent budget, let me discuss \nwhat the veterans community has said based upon their own very careful \nassessment of this. We start off with the President's flatline budget \nwhich is woefully inadequate. Let me say right away as a Democrat, I \nthink the budget is woefully inadequate, and certainly the President's \nbudget was no way to say thanks to veterans.\n  The Budget Committee has called for an increase of $1 billion, but \nthat still leaves a $2 billion shortfall. I want to also quote from a \nletter from the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs to the Senate \nBudget Committee which pointed out that the VA is facing $3 billion in \ncosts above and beyond what was proposed in the President's budget. \nThat would make it $2 billion right now given the $1 billion increase \nwe have in the budget resolution.\n  I will quote the precise figures from the Senate Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee:\n\n       * * * an additional $1.26 billion to meet unanticipated \n     spending requirements; an additional $853.1 million to \n     overcome the effects of inflation and other \n     ``uncontrollables'' in order that it may contain current \n     services; and at least $1 billion in additional funding to \n     better address the needs of aging, and increasingly female, \n     veterans population.\n\n  In other words, our own Senate Veterans' Committee, under the able \nleadership of Senator Specter and Senator Rockefeller, has basically \nechoed the same analysis of the independent budget. This is specific \nand it bears out what I have heard from veterans at rallies. The \nveterans community is very galvanized on this question. I have heard \nstories or received letters from veterans at our office--I am sure \nSenator Johnson gets the same kind of letters from the veterans \ncommunity.\n\n  The budget resolution goes a third of the way toward covering this \ncost. We need to go all the way for the veterans community. We don't \nask our troops to take a third of a hill, we don't ask them to win a \nthird of a battle, and in this particular budget we ought not to go \njust a third of the way toward providing the resources so that we can \nget good medical care to veterans in this country.\n  Both in the President's proposal and in the budget resolution that we \nhave before the Senate, the veterans are not a top priority. There is \nno doubt whatever that we should be doing much better. This amendment \nthat we introduce tonight does the job.\n  Let me put this in personal terms for a moment. I don't want to see a \ngood friend, Lyle Pearson from North Mankato--a decorated World War II \nvet, past commander of the national Disabled American Veterans--I don't \nwant to see him in a position where he doesn't receive the kind of \ndecent health care coverage that he deserves. I don't want to see an \never aging veterans population not receiving the kind of assisted care \nthey will need. Many of our veterans are elderly.\n  The question is, How will we respond to that? I don't want to see a \nthird of the homeless population continue to be veterans, many of them \nstruggling with substance abuse problems, many of them struggling with \nposttraumatic syndrome, many of them Vietnam vets. I think we can do \nbetter. I don't want\n\n[[Page S3222]]\n\nto see the kind of backlog we have right now.\n  Let me just simply talk about veterans in Bangor, ME, who were \nconcerned after a VA inspector general report noted their outpatient \nclinic had a 10-month backlog of new patients. Things were so bad last \nfall that the clinic couldn't see walk-in patients or urgent-care \npatients and there was a 4-month wait to see the clinic's part-time \npsychiatrist.\n  Veterans in Iowa are facing the possible closure of one of three \nmajor veterans hospitals because of the budget shortfalls. The Veterans \nUnder Secretary of Health, Kenneth Kizer, warned that the VA health \ncare system is in a ``precarious situation.'' Under Secretary of Health \nfor the Veterans' Administration, Ken Kizer, went on to say that the \nproposed fiscal year 2000 budget--and he was talking about the \nPresident's budget--posed very serious financial challenges and that it \nwould require a number of different things that might happen if, in \nfact, we don't provide adequate funding. Among them:\n\n       . . . mandatory employee furloughs, severe curtailment of \n     services or elimination of programs and possible unnecessary \n     facility closures.\n\n  Let me be really clear about the amendment we have introduced. The \nveterans community was asked by the Congress--they are always asked--to \ngive their positive proposal about what we need to do to have a budget \nthat will serve their needs so that we can live up to our commitment to \nveterans. We have the independent budget. It was done well. We have a \nSenate Veterans' Affairs Committee which came out with its own report \nthat said we have a $3 billion shortfall here between what the veterans \ncommunity needs by way of a real investment in health care and veteran \nservices and other services, versus the President's budget proposal. \nThe President's budget proposal was unacceptable.\n  Now the Budget Committee brings a resolution before the floor and \nadds an additional $1 billion, but we are still $2 billion short. We \nought not to go just a third of the way. We ought not to make estimates \nthat make it clear that if we are really serious about our commitment \nto veterans, we are going to make up this $3 billion debt. We ought not \nsay that and then not reflect that in our budget resolution.\n  My colleague, Senator Johnson, has done an excellent job of \nsummarizing the offset, and I do not need to repeat it. I conclude this \nway: I have never, in my 8 years in the Senate, seen the veterans \ncommunity so galvanized and so focused on any question. There is a \ntremendous amount of anger. People are smart. Four years of flatline \nbudgets have not served the veterans community well. This budget by the \nPresident and what we have in the Budget Committee resolution does not \ngo far enough. It doesn't do the job. It does not enable us to live up \nto our commitment to veterans. I feel very strongly about this.\n  This amendment we have introduced tonight provides the funding that \nwill make sure we have the health care and decent services. It lives up \nto the very words that all of us have spoken as Senators. If we are \nserious about our commitment to veterans, then we have an opportunity \nto show that commitment and to vote for this resolution that Senator \nJohnson and I and other Senators have introduced.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes today to share \nwith my colleagues my support of this amendment--offered by my friend \nfrom South Dakota, Senator Johnson--an amendment which would increase \nfunding for veterans health care services by $2 billion for Fiscal Year \n2000. I believe that this funding level is necessary for the VA to \nprovide the high quality of care it promises our nation's veterans. It \nis absolutely critical that we reverse the downward trend in VA health \ncare funding and address the abhorrent deficiencies that exist \ncurrently in our VA health care system. We, as a nation, must keep our \ncommitments to ensure that our nation's veterans receive consistent, \nhigh-quality, and reliable health care services.\n  I am convinced we cannot fulfill these commitments under the current \nlevel of funding provided both in the Administration's budget request \nand in the Chairman's mark which came out of the Budget Committee. I \nhave expressed my concern in a number of letters to the Administration, \nboth before and after their budget numbers came over to Congress--as I \nknow many of my colleagues in both the House and Senate have done--\nabout the Administration's decision to maintain a flat-lined budget for \nVA health care for the fourth consecutive year.\n  I also recently met with VA Under Secretary of Health Kenneth Kizer \nto make him aware of the severe effects that this level of funding has \nhad already in Massachusetts. I told him that many of our VA hospitals \nand clinics are under serious budget strain and cannot provide \nsufficient care to the many veterans who need--and rightly deserve--to \nreceive it. I expressed my concern that VA Hospital Directors have \ncontacted me to say that, if they have to incorporate the same cuts in \nthe coming fiscal year as they did this year, they will be forced to \nclose wards, eliminate programs, and reduce staff. In fact, this \nalready is happening.\n  In the Brockton, Massachusetts VA hospital, service providers have \nmade it clear to me and my staff that they aren't able at times to \nprovide adequate care for their patients. They are being forced to move \npsychiatric patients out into the community long before they are ready. \nThe hospitals are unable to sufficiently help homeless veterans \nstruggling with substance abuse problems. All of these troubles in \ntaking care of our veterans are the result of one problem--today there \nis not enough money to care for those veterans who so badly need our \nhelp.\n  Our Northampton VA hospital--which has a nationally renowned \nreputation for its care of combat-wounded veterans--is facing the same \nchallenges as the hospital in Brockton. They have a Post Traumatic \nStress Disorder Unit there in Northampton--the only one of its kind in \nthe entire Northeast. Veterans come hundreds of miles to find help in \neither putting their lives back together or keeping them from falling \napart. The unit is always filled to capacity and requires a full-time, \nexperienced staff that can address the needs of veterans who go there. \nBut because we aren't doing right by our veterans, that unit is in \njeopardy. Three years ago, this unit had a dedicated staff of twenty. \nToday, it has fourteen. There is only one overnight nurse to deal with \n25 combat veterans. I don't believe this Senate can say that the \nquality of care in that unit has not been diminished.\n  These examples are part of a far broader crisis in veterans health \ncare. Consider the VA nurses who haven't seen a substantial vacation \nfor as long as they can remember and haven't received pay raises in \nfive years, years when our economy has been growing in leaps and \nbounds. Put that crisis into a larger context: we have to ensure that \nadequate incentives exist for VA health care providers so that the VA \ncan recruit and retain highly skilled staff.\n  As U.S. military personnel are going over to defend U.S. national \ninterests in Kosovo, we must do all we can to let them know that their \ncountry is united behind them. We must do this for all the brave men \nand women who served and who have served our nation. Veterans are the \nbrave men and women who already have served our nation, who have been \non the front lines fighting for the freedoms Americans care about so \ndeeply. How can we ask today's soldiers to represent our values around \nthe globe if we're not willing to provide adequate health care services \nfor those who have already made the sacrifice? How can we give so \nlittle to those who have already given so much to their country?\n  These are questions that I don't believe any of us want to ask. They \nare not ones that our country should be asking--Americans everywhere \ndeserve a different and better debate than this one.\n  Mr. President, when the VA Under Secretary of Health asserts in a \nmemo that the VA's flat-lined health care budget ``poses very serious \nfinancial challenges which can only be met if decisive and timely \nactions are taken,'' I believe that there is one critical action we \nmust take. We must provide a significant increase over the \nAdministration's request for VA health care. We ought to begin \nlistening to our veterans and listening to those who care for them. We \nought to provide the level of investment the national veterans service \norganizations have endorsed in\n\n[[Page S3223]]\n\ntheir Independent Budget for FY 2000--$3 billion over the \nAdministration's request--the level of investment I believe is so badly \nneeded just to fund the programs we already have while ensuring that \nfuture programs can address the needs of an aging veterans population.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I know that each Senator has his own story \nand experience with respect to problems of veteran health care in his \nor her home State. I am just going to take a couple of minutes to \nexplain some problems that rural States have with which I am \nparticularly familiar.\n  Today I spoke to Tom Pouliot. Who is Tom? Tom is a vet from my \nhometown of Helena, MT. He is also the national commander of the \nVeterans of Foreign Wars.\n  Let me tell you a story that Tom has explained to me, which I know is \na major problem in rural States. I say ``rural.'' I mean really rural. \nI am not talking about eastern rural, although veterans in all parts of \nthe country obviously need health care, and aren't getting the health \ncare that they need. But I am talking about western rural, west of the \n100th meridian where it doesn't rain, where the distances between towns \nare vast.\n  Let me tell you a story I repeat sometimes to my colleagues.\n  When the First Lady was in Montana not too many years ago, she got \noff the plane, and says, ``This isn't rural. This is mega-rural. This \nis hyper-rural.'' I mean, for those who haven't been in the West west \nof the 100th meridian, I don't know, with all due respect, that one \ngets the sense of just how rural it is until you are there.\n  What is the problem? The problem is that tonight we can vote to \nincrease veterans' health care by an additional $2 billion. That is the \namendment offered by the Senator from South Dakota, Mr. Johnson.\n  Why do I think that is a good idea? It is a good idea because the VA \nhas had a flatline appropriations for veterans' health care for 3 \nconsecutive years. Just think of it. For 3 consecutive years, there has \nbeen no increase for veterans' health care, something that is very \nimportant and desperately in need of. I believe that a fourth year of a \nflatline health care budget would be deeply irresponsible.\n  Let me explain a couple of reasons why. Not only Tom, but I and \nothers who have visited the VA facilities in Montana, of which there \nare not many, found this problem firsthand. I asked the VA in Montana \nto visit Miles City, Billings, and Helena, so they could get a \nfirsthand look of what veterans face in getting the health care that \nthey need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All of the time of the proponent of the \namendment has expired. The Senator from New Mexico controls 5\\1/2\\ \nminutes at this point in time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 4 \nmore minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have a vote at 8 o'clock. It is ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is 5 minutes from now. I am asking for 4 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It is four votes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Just 4 minutes. That is not 8 o'clock. That is 5 minutes \nfrom now.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I haven't spoken on either amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask for 1 minute.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask that we vote at 8:01.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, in a nutshell, the problem is this: \nVeterans in Montana get appointments at Fort Harrison and other \nveterans facilities. They drive hundreds of miles for the appointments. \nThey get there, and it is canceled. They have to get in their car, or \nhave someone drive them back to their home hundreds of miles away \nagain. This is very common. Why? Because of personnel cuts. It is going \nto get worse unless we increase the veterans' health care budget.\n  Tonight I plead with my colleagues to support the Johnson amendment. \nGive our veterans a break. Men and women who have fought so hard for \nAmerica, particularly our elderly vets, who in, say, World War II, or \nin the Korean war, fought for America. Here we are increasing the \ndefense budget. We are not helping veterans' health care. That is just \nnot right.\n  All we are asking is to take a little bit of a nick out of the \ndefense budget, just a little, and increase veterans' health care just \na little.\n  As I mentioned, there has been no increase in the last 3 years. This \nbudget this year has no increase. That will be the fourth year. Let's \njust add a little bit to veterans' health care. I think it is the right \nthing to do for America's veterans.\n  I thank the Senator from New Mexico for the extra minute.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Feingold \nand Senator Robb be added as cosponsors to the Johnson amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. As Senator Wellstone expressed so eloquently, this \nadjustment would allow for the VA to keep up with medical inflation and \nfor them to retain the needed employees that they need to deliver these \nservices. It would allow for new medical initiatives the Congress had \nbeen pushing the VA to begin, including hepatitis C screenings and \nemergency care services. It would allow for addressing long-term care \ncosts, funding for homeless veterans, in compliance with any Patients' \nBill of Rights legislation this Congress enacts.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. President, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wonder if I might ask unanimous \nconsent that we set aside this amendment temporarily while an NIH \namendment is offered by Senator Specter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President. What is \nthe request? Is it that we lay aside our amendment so our colleague \ncould offer an amendment on NIH?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 157\n\n        (Purpose: To provide for funding of biomedical research)\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter], for himself, \n     Mr. Harkin, Mr. DeWine, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \n     Johnson, Ms. Mikulski, and Mr. Lautenberg, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 157.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title II, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. RESERVE FUND.\n\n       (a) In General.--In the Senate, revenue and spending \n     aggregates and allocations may be revised under section \n     302(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 for \n     legislation disallowing a Federal income tax deduction for \n     any payment to the Federal Government or any State or local \n     government in connection with any tobacco litigation or \n     settlement and to use $1,400,000,000 of the increased \n     revenues to fund biomedical research at the National \n     Institutes of Health.\n       (b) Revised Aggregates.--Upon the consideration of \n     legislation pursuant to subsection (a), the Chairman of the \n     Committee on the Budget of the Senate may file increased \n     aggregates to carry out this section. These aggregates shall \n     be considered for the purposes of the Congressional Budget \n     Act of 1974 as the aggregates contained in this resolution.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we have been accorded the opportunity to \noffer this amendment slightly out of turn, and I had already asked my \ndistinguished ranking member, Senator Harkin, to come to the floor. The \namendment is with Senator Harkin as the principal cosponsor.\n  The thrust of this amendment is to provide the financial base to \nincrease funding in the National Institutes of Health by $2 billion \nthis year. The budget resolution had increased the\n\n[[Page S3224]]\n\nbudget authority by $600 million. This amendment seeks to increase that \nbudget authority by another $1.4 billion and applies as an offset to \nthe provision to disallow tax deductions from the settlement of \ncigarettes, which would yield in excess of $1.4 billion, the amount \nwhich is covered in this amendment.\n  In November 1998, 46 States agreed to a settlement with the tobacco \nindustry requiring the tobacco companies to pay the States some $206 \nbillion over 25 years. Four other States had settled separate lawsuits \nwith the tobacco companies. The Internal Revenue Service considers \nthose settlement payments as tax deductible business expenses, and this \ndeduction effectively reduces the amount tobacco companies pay by 25 to \n30 percent. Obviously, the tobacco companies will write off these \npayments as business expenses on their Federal tax returns. The amount \nof funding for next year, the year 2000, is $1.8 billion.\n  When we look for offsets to fund matters like increased funding for \nthe National Institutes of Health, it is obviously a very difficult \nmatter with the type of budget constraints that we are under. And in \nsearching the nooks and crannies of the potential offsets, a very \ndiligent staff came up with the idea that the deductibility of these \npayments was of lesser public policy importance than to increase the \nfunding for the National Institutes of Health.\n  Now, public policy obviously depends upon someone's vantage point, \nand to have a change in law that would deny a tax deduction is not easy \nfor anyone concerned. But where you have the kinds of funds that are \ninvolved in the tobacco settlement, and where you had a much larger \nfigure being talked about for the Federal settlement, and where you \nhave all of the money going to the States, and the Federal Government \ndoesn't get any of the funds as determined by the emergency \nappropriations bill that we voted on last week on an amendment that \nSenator Harkin and I offered, I think that all factors considered, it \nis a fair and just and equitable consideration. That is especially true \nin a context where you have tobacco being the cause of so many major \nhealth ailments in the United States. So in searching for a way to find \nan offset, we have come up with the idea of disallowing this as a tax \ndeduction, which would provide the full funding in fiscal year 2000 for \nthis $1.4 billion.\n  Now, with respect to the justification for increasing NIH funding, \nMr. President, I think that is a matter which virtually speaks for \nitself. The National Institutes of Health is the crown jewel of the \nFederal Government. The advances that have been made in the National \nInstitutes of Health covering a range of ailments is just nothing short \nof marvelous.\n  It is worth just a moment to run through the list of ailments that \nNIH is studying where such magnificent progress has been made: \nAlcoholism; Alzheimer's disease; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, also \ncalled Lou Gehrig's disease; AIDS; arthritis; asthma; autism; cancers \nof so many different classifications, such as breast cancer, cervical \ncancer, prostate cancer, and other cancers; cystic fibrosis; deafness \nand communications disorders; dental diseases; diabetes; digestive \ndisease; epilepsy; heart disease; hemophilia; hepatitis; Huntington's \ndisease; kidney ailments; liver disorders; lung disease; macular \ndegeneration; osteoporosis; Parkinson's disease; schizophrenia; \nscleroderma; stroke; sudden infant death syndrome. That is not even a \ncomplete list.\n  I might comment, Mr. President, that the efforts made by various \ninterest groups, where people suffer from a variety of ailments, is \nreally overwhelming as those groups come to Washington to lobby for an \nincrease in funding for the National Institutes of Health. We had a \nresolution introduced by the distinguished Senator from Florida, \nSenator Mack, several years ago calling for the doubling of NIH over \nthe course of 5 years, and it passed 98-0.\n\n  Two years ago, when Senator Harkin and I sought to increase the \nbudget resolution by $1.1 billion, we found it was defeated by 63-37. \nLast year, when we offered an increase in the budget resolution by $2 \nbillion, it was defeated, my recollection is, by a vote of 57-41. When \nit comes to translating druthers to dollars, we have not seen the kind \nof support for NIH funding that I think is really warranted, given all \nthe facts of the case.\n  We have some 19 cosponsors on the resolution to increase funding by \nsome $2 billion. But, in the course of soliciting our colleagues for \ncosponsorship on this amendment, we found substantially less than that \nnumber stepping forward. When it comes to illness, when you have a \nloved one with Parkinson's, or a parent with Alzheimer's, or a family \nmember with cancer, or one of the ailments yourself such as heart \ndisease, no sum of money within conception is too much, and is really \nnot enough to really move to conquer that disease. At the National \nInstitutes of Health they do perform miracles.\n  In the course of last November, NIH came out with disclosures on \nresearch on stem cells, which has the potential to be a veritable \nfountain of youth. The estimate has been given on Parkinson's disease, \nto be within the range of conquering Parkinson's within 5 years, \nperhaps 10 years at the outside. As these stem cells replace other \ndisease cells in the body, the sky is the limit as to what can be \naccomplished. But all of this takes money.\n  There are still a limited number of research grants which are awarded \nby the National Institutes of Health, and an increase of $2 billion \nwill be the best spent money which the Federal Government could \nallocate.\n  We all know we have a budget in excess of $1.7 trillion, a staggering \nsum of money. And it is a question of priorities. This, I suggest, is \nat the top of the line.\n  Mr. President, if I may, I see my distinguished colleague, Senator \nHarkin, has come to the floor. But recognition is determined by the \nChair, so I simply yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We are going to vote at 8:01. Before we proceed, let me \nask unanimous consent, so everybody will know where we are going. This \nhas been cleared with the two leaders, and Senator Lautenberg \nobviously, and whoever else needs to be conferred with.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the next four votes occur in a stacked \nsequence, with 2 minutes between each vote for an explanation, 1 minute \non each side, that the other votes in the voting sequence be limited to \n10 minutes each.\n  I further ask that when the Senate resumes the concurrent resolution \nat 9 a.m. on Thursday there be 10 hours remaining for consideration.\n  However, for the information of all Senators, these votes will be the \nlast votes of the evening. But any Senator who wishes to remain, we \nplan to be here open for business all night, if it is necessary. If \nSenators want to come and offer amendments, we will be here. If they \nwill come and offer them tonight, they will be stacked for an orderly \nhour tomorrow.\n  I am hopeful that some Senators--a few--will avail themselves of that \ntime. But I am certain that it will not be 4 o'clock in the morning \nwith Senators still around offering amendments. That is why we proposed \nthe unanimous consent as we have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, if I might say to my colleague, I \nsupport the unanimous consent agreement. I want to point out to \nSenators who are interested in offering amendments that we are here as \nlong as amendments are going to be offered. If there are none offered \nat the conclusion of the votes, then we are going to be prepared to \nclose shop, as we say. As long as amendments are offered, we are here. \nIf they are not, we are closing up. But there will not be time to drag \nout tomorrow. We are willing to work all night, if necessary. But we \nare going to conclude with 10 hours tomorrow, which would then be \nroughly 35 hours' worth of time spent.\n  With that, I assume, Mr. President, that the unanimous consent \nrequest was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to ask the distinguished Senator, \nSenator Johnson--Senator Specter is on the floor--has he joined as a \ncosponsor of the amendment?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be listed \nas\n\n[[Page S3225]]\n\nan original cosponsor. We have surveyed our committee members. Senator \nThurmond, may we list you as an original cosponsor?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Yes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Senator Thurmond, and also Senator Tim Hutchinson as \ncosponsors.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think anybody who wants to join this amendment ought \nto join it. We are going to let you have a vote, but not without my \nmaking an observation about it.\n  I have been asked not to use strange words to describe amendments. So \nI will try to be very accurate.\n  This is a feel-good, do-nothing amendment, and the veterans of the \nUnited States ought not think that they are getting $2 billion. As a \nmatter of fact, there is $1.1 billion more than the President in this \nbudget. But, for some, whatever you put in--I should have put $4 \nbillion in. Then we want $7 billion.\n  The truth of the matter is, this amendment is a do-nothing, feel-good \namendment because it requires that we cut some other programs, \nfollowing the format of the budget. That would mean we would have to \ncut education, environment, NIH, international affairs, housing, WIC--\nall of which we heard complaints all day long have been cut too much \nalready. Nonetheless, this amendment chooses to cut none of them and \njust says we will find it in an allowance, which means all these \nprograms will be cut for this $2 billion.\n  I do not think that is right. But neither do I want Senators to vote \nagainst veterans. So let us all vote ``aye'' and have a great big \nhurrah about the amendment.\n  I ask for the regular order.\n\n\n                       Vote On Amendment No. 145\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.

There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndebated on the Conrad amendment.\n  The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, this amendment is very direct. It creates a lockbox \nto protect every dollar of Social Security surplus for Social Security. \nIn addition, it creates a lockbox to add 40 percent of the non-Social \nSecurity surplus for Medicare.\n  Medicare is in danger. It is on the brink of insolvency. It is time \nnot only for reform of Medicare, but to add additional resources so the \npromise of Medicare can be kept.\n  In addition, this amendment will pay down the debt by $300 billion \nmore than the budget resolution alternative. I ask my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment to create a safe lockbox, not only for Social \nSecurity but for Medicare. That leaves sufficient resources----\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, the Senate is not in order. The Senator \nshould be heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired, but because \nthe Senator from Montana is correct, the Senator may take another 3 \nseconds to finish.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleague from Montana.\n  This leaves sufficient resources for $400 billion over the next 10 \nyears for high-priority domestic issues, like education and defense, as \nwell as room for tax reduction. But, fundamentally, it puts Social \nSecurity and Medicare first.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, this amendment is an anti-tax-relief \namendment, plain and simple. Compared to the chairman's mark, which is \nbefore you, this amendment increases taxes by $320 billion over 10 \nyears.\n  As to Medicare, let us get it straight once and for all. What is \nreally incredible is that there is no lockbox for Medicare. There is a \nwish box. All we do with the money that is claimed for Medicare is \napply it against the debt so that it can be spent by anyone anytime. As \na matter of fact, if it is done to reduce the debt so as to strengthen \nthe economy, our budget does more than the President plus this \namendment by way of deficit reduction.\n  There is not one nickel in it that is spent on Medicare. It is a wish \nand a hope. We don't even know we need $320 billion over 10 years.\n  It violates the Budget Act because it is not germane to the budget, \nand the vote will be on a motion to waive, which I recommend Senators \nvote no on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of the act for the consideration of the pending amendment, and \nI ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Thank you, Madam President.\n  This amendment is an opportunity for all of our friends who think \nthat the President's budget outlines the plan which we should follow to \nexpress themselves by voting for it. The President has said we must \nsave the entire surplus to save Social Security, but the actual details \nof the plan takes $158 billion out of Social Security over the next 5 \nyears.\n  The President and the minority leader have said that we need to stay \nin the caps. This budget plan breaks the caps by $38 billion. These are \nthe actual details. These are the actual plans and the absolute numbers \nthat we think come from the President's budget.\n  For our friends who believe that the President's budget is a \npreferable means of charting our spending programs for this coming \nyear, I say vote for this.\n  I believe it does not fix Medicare. It ignores Medicare. It spends \nmoney that should be put into the retiring debt from the Social \nSecurity surplus, and I urge my colleagues to vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The Senator from New Jersey is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I think by the description the Senator \njust offered he tells you what he thinks. He is offering this amendment \nand saying vote no. What he wants the Democrats to do is to be tricked \ninto moving on this.\n  Here is one part of it--1,291 pages. If anyone wants to vote for this \nwithout inspecting it, unless all of you have reviewed it in detail and \nhave decided that whatever you are concerned about is taken care of in \nhere.\n  This is not a sincere amendment being offered. What this is, I think, \nis political chicanery. I urge my opponents to vote against it.\n  Mr. BOND. I agree.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to table the amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I respectfully disagree with the \nchairman's characterization of the amendment. This amendment tonight \nwill put the Senate on record for the first time in support of full \nfunding for veterans' health care. No budget resolution guarantees \nfunding. That is part of the appropriations process. But this amendment \nwill open the door. This amendment will open the door for consideration \non the part of the appropriators for the full funding for veterans' \nhealth care that is so badly needed.\n  I yield to the Senator from Minnesota for 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, what is meaningful about this amendment \nis it provides the necessary funding for decent health care for \nveterans. And the veterans community will hold all of us accountable. \nThis is a very meaningful vote, I say to my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who rises in opposition?\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, there is no one in opposition. So I am \ngoing to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask that Senators Specter, Jeffords, \nHutchinson, Murkowski, and myself be made original cosponsors.\n  Mr. President, while there is no assurance that veterans' health care \nis going to be increased by $2 billion, we already increased it $1.1 \nover the President's budget.

Mr. President, I wish to call to the attention of the \nSenate technical corrections to certain descriptions contained in \nSenate report 106-27, which accompanies the Concurrent Resolution on \nthe Budget for FY 2000.\n  On page 266, the description of the Conrad amendment should read:\n\n       (3) Conrad amendment to increase revenues relative to the \n     Chairman's mark by $320 billion, to require that any revenue \n     reduction be offset with spending reductions or revenue \n     increases, to create a Medicare Surplus Reserve, and to \n     create a new 60-vote point of order in the Senate against \n     legislation that would reduce that reserve.\n\n  On page 273, the description of the Lautenberg amendment should read:\n\n       (27) Lautenberg amendment to increase revenues relative to \n     the Chairman's mark by $320 billion, to require that any \n     revenue reduction be offset with spending reductions or \n     revenue increases, and to create a Medicare Surplus Reserve.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today, the Senate begins consideration of a \nbudget for the fiscal year that begins on October 1. When it passes, it \nwill be only the second budget in the last 30 years that will be \nbalanced.\n  That will be a tremendous achievement considering that it was as \nrecently as 1995 that President Clinton sent Congress a budget that \nwould have produced annual deficits in the range of $200 billion for \nthe foreseeable future. The budget recommended to us by the Budget \nCommittee will effectively balance the budget, and it will do so even \nwithout relying on the surplus from the Social Security trust fund. The \nsmall deficit that is projected now is likely to be eliminated once the \nCongressional Budget Office updates its revenue estimates this summer.\n  Mr. President, the budget we have before us will ensure that the \nSocial Security surplus is set aside so that it cannot be spent on \nother government programs--$1.8 trillion over the next 10 years. Many \nof us may have heard President Clinton promise to do the same, but when \nhe sent his budget to Capitol Hill we found that he is actually \nproposing to raid the Social Security trust fund for $158 billion over \nthe next five years alone. Moreover, we found that the President's plan \nto deposit 62 percent of the unified budget surplus into the trust fund \nwas nothing more than an accounting gimmick. According to the \nComptroller General, David Walker, ``the changes to the Social Security \nprogram [recommended by the President] will thus be more perceived than \nreal: although the Trust Funds will appear to have more resources as a \nresult of the proposal, in reality nothing about the program has \nchanged.'' In other words, the Clinton plan fails to delay the cash-\nflow problem expected in the year 2013 by a single year.\n  Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan also voiced opposition \nto the President's risky plan to invest a portion of the Social \nSecurity Trust Funds in the stock market, noting that ``even with \nHerculean efforts,'' he doubted that investment decisions could be \ninsulated from political pressures. The Clinton plan would allow \nfederal bureaucrats to play politics with people's retirement savings. \nThat is wrong.\n  By contrast, our budget will not put Social Security at risk. It will \nprotect the Social Security surpluses so that they cannot be raided for \nthe President's other spending initiatives.\n  Our budget will help preserve Medicare, as well. It will increase \nspending on the nation's health care program for seniors by an average \nof $20 billion a year for the next 10 years. That is in lieu of the $9 \nbillion reduction in Medicare spending that the President's budget \nrecommends.\n  Mr. President, we will cut the public debt in half over the next \ndecade by abiding by the spending limits Congress and the President \nagreed to two years ago. The Clinton budget, by contrast, would bust \nthe spending limits by more than $20 billion this year alone and result \nin only half as much debt reduction over the next decade.\n  Most importantly, the Senate budget proposes to return the rest of \nthe emerging surpluses to taxpayers. Congress would still have to pass \na separate bill later in the year that sets out precisely what form the \ntax relief would take, but there are many ideas. They range from a 10 \npercent across-the-board reduction in income-tax rates to more targeted \nrelief, like repeal of the marriage penalty, elimination of death \ntaxes, and reductions in capital-gains taxes. There are other ideas, \ntoo. Any of them is preferable to President Clinton's plan to raise \n$100 billion in new taxes and fees even though budget surpluses are \nmounting.\n  Although we have succeeded in balancing the unified budget, we still \nhave two very different visions of where we should be headed. The \nPresident has proposed myriad new spending programs--77 new programs in \nhis State of the Union address--paid for out of the Social Security \nsurplus, Medicare, and new taxes and fees. The Senate budget protects \nSocial Security and Medicare, and abiding by the spending limits \napproved just two years ago, we begin to pay down the debt and provide \nlong overdue tax relief to the American people.\n  I believe the Senate's approach is a better one. I hope my colleagues \nwill join me in voting aye.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me just say, according to the \nunanimous consent agreement, we are going to stay here so long as \nSenators want to offer amendments. They can either offer them and/or \npull them, set them aside, or they can offer them and debate them \ntonight. I am going to have to leave shortly, but I will have somebody \nin my stead. We were not finished with the Specter amendment. I assume \nit is the regular order. It is not?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Sure.\n  Mr. REID. In the morning--and I am confident this is appropriate, \ncleared with the manager of the bill on this side--we would like to \nline up three amendments that we will offer in order of Democrat-\nRepublican-Democrat--in the right order.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Do that tonight?\n  Mr. REID. It would be appropriate so people will be here in the \nmorning to do their work. It was suggested Senator Kennedy would offer \nthe first Democratic amendment, after that a Daschle and Dorgan, after \nthat one by John Kerry. That should get us through this side a good \npart of the morning.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We are not going to have any votes before 11. And you \nare suggesting if we are making a list in the morning, those are the \nthree that your side wants?\n  Mr. REID. First thing in the morning. Otherwise people will offer \nwhatever they want tonight.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. But we will offer in between, ours, also.\n  Mr. REID. That is right. So I am saying those would be the three \nfirst Democratic amendments in the morning.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So how would we do that? Whatever we take tonight would \nbe set aside in any event, and then we would say when they are finished \nthey would be set aside and the first three amendments to be taken up \nfor votes tomorrow would be----\n  Mr. REID. I would say to the manager of the bill, it just allows more \norder here so people know when they should come so we are not waiting \naround for people to do things.\n  So, if I could, or if you would ask that in the form of a unanimous \nconsent request, it would be appreciated.\n  We will try to have three also in the morning. We don't have any lack \nof amendments. There will be plenty. We will be glad to accommodate in \nthat regard.\n  Mr. REID. Could we do that, I say to my friend from New Mexico, a \nunanimous consent request, if that happened in the morning, Republican \nand Democrat, six amendments? Those would be the first six? I mentioned \nthe three Democrats, and you would have any that you believe are \nappropriate for Republican amendments.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let's try that.\n  When we convene in the morning----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator propounding a unanimous consent \nrequest?\n\n[[Page S3228]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am going to. Sometimes it takes a little while. I am \ngetting tired and sleepy.\n  The only amendment that could be ahead of all of this would be \nSenator Specter's amendment. And if you have not used all your time \ntonight, you will get some in the morning.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That's right.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So when that is finished, when they have completed the \npending amendment, then I ask unanimous consent that the next six \namendments be alternatively spread between Democrat and Republican and \nthat the three Democrat amendments, when they are supposedly to be \ncalled up, will be first----\n  Mr. REID. First, Senator Kennedy; second, Senators Daschle and \nDorgan; and third, Senator John Kerry.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Could you tell us what the second one is?\n  Mr. REID. One is dealing with agriculture.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. OK. Then the Republicans will appropriately assign \ntheir amendments. We will make our own arrangements on this side as to \nwhich ones go when.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, is the pending business the Specter \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CRAIG. The Senator from Iowa would debate that; is that the \nintent at this time? Would the Senator from Iowa mind if I introduced \nand laid aside an amendment at this moment? It would take me a half \nminute.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, of course.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 146\n\n       (Purpose: To modify the pay-as-you-go requirement of the \n     budget process to require that direct spending increases be \n     offset only with direct spending decreases)\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto introduce an amendment without laying the Specter amendment aside. \nThat amendment is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Craig], for himself, Mr. \n     Kerrey, Mr. Helms, and Mr. Inhofe, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 146.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the end of title II, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . REQUIREMENT TO OFFSET DIRECT SPENDING INCREASES BY \n                   DIRECT SPENDING DECREASES.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Surplus Protection Amendment''.\n       (b) In General.--In the Senate, for purposes of section 202 \n     of House Concurrent Resolution 67 (104th Congress), it shall \n     not be in order to consider any bill, joint resolution, \n     amendment, motion, or conference report that provides an \n     increase in direct spending unless the increase is offset by \n     a decrease in direct spending.\n       (c) Waiver.--This section may be waived or suspended in the \n     Senate only by the affirmative vote of three-fifths of the \n     Members, duly chosen and sworn.\n       (d) Appeals.--Appeals in the Senate from the decisions of \n     the Chair relating to any provision of this section shall be \n     limited to 1 hour, to be equally divided between, and \n     controlled by, the appellant and the manager of the \n     concurrent resolution, bill, or joint resolution, as the case \n     may be. An affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members of \n     the Senate, duly chosen and sworn, shall be required in the \n     Senate to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a \n     point of order raised under this section.\n       (e) Determination of Budget Levels.--For purposes of this \n     section, the levels of direct spending for a fiscal year \n     shall be determined on the basis of estimates made by the \n     Committee on the Budget of the Senate.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, this is a pay-go style amendment that would \nbe applied to all new mandatory spending. I would seek to debate that \nin the morning, and I ask unanimous consent that it be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Iowa for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It was cut in half by unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By a previous order, the time on the amendment \nwas reduced to an hour evenly divided, and the Senator from \nPennsylvania consumed 15 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  I am pleased to join my chairman, Senator Specter, in offering this \namendment. Two years ago, the Senate went on record, 98 to 0, \ncommitting to double the NIH budget over 5 years.\n  Last year, Senator Specter and I were able to make good on that \npledge by providing the biggest increase ever for medical research. We \nworked hard to make it happen. I thank all my Senate colleagues for \nworking with us on that historic accomplishment.\n  The omnibus appropriations bill for this year contains a $2 billion, \nor a 15-percent, increase for the National Institutes of Health. That \n15 percent puts us on track to meet our commitment to double the NIH \nbudget for 5 years, which, I repeat, was voted on here 98 to 0.\n  Unfortunately, if we pass this budget resolution as it is, we will \nfall far short of the 15-percent increase necessary to maintain that \ncommitment.\n  This budget resolution shortchanges Americans' health and \nshortchanges our efforts to control health care costs and keep Medicare \nsolvent in the long run.\n  At the same time that this budget shortchanges basic investments in \nhealth care, the budget before us increases the Pentagon budget by $18 \nbillion--$8.3 billion more than the President's request--to defend \nAmerica against some ill-defined international threat.\n  What this budget should do is spend at least $2 billion more to \ndefend us against the very real threats here at home every day --the \nthreat of cancer, the threat of Alzheimer's, the threat of diabetes, \nthe threat of osteoporosis.\n  Recently, under the leadership of Senator Specter, we had a hearing, \nand one of our witnesses was Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf. He was in town to \nurge Congress to increase its investment in medical research. He \nunderstands better than most that we cannot mount a strong defense \nwithout adequate resources. While we made some progress last year, we \nstill have a long way to go.\n  Under the budget before us, NIH will only be able to fund about one \nin four meritorious research proposals. Those are research proposals \nthat have gone through the peer review process deemed worthy of \ninvestigation. Only one in four will be funded.\n  In the next 30 years, the number of Americans over age 65 will \ndouble. Medical research is essential to help reduce the enormous \neconomic and social burdens posed by chronic diseases that impact our \nelderly from Alzheimer's and arthritis to cancer and Parkinson's and \nstroke.\n  Take Alzheimer's disease. It alone costs the Nation over $100 billion \na year. We know that simply delaying the onset by 5 years could save us \nover $50 billion a year. Delaying the onset of heart disease by 5 years \nwould save over $69 billion a year. That is why I often say to my \ncolleagues and others, if you really want to save Medicare, invest in \nmedical research. That will take care of the looming deficit in \nMedicare. We are on the verge of breakthroughs in these and other \nareas. Now is the time to boost our investment to make sure that our \nNation's top scientists can turn these opportunities into realities.\n  In addition to funding more research grants, another area that is \ncritical to making the breakthroughs we know are possible is making \nsure we have state-of-the-art laboratories and equipment. However, most \nof the research is currently being done in laboratories built in the \n1950s and 1960s.\n  According to the most recent National Science Foundation study, 47 \npercent of all biomedical research performing institutions classified \nthe amount of biological science research space as inadequate, and 51 \npercent indicated they had an inadequate amount of medical research \nspace. So the need is great.\n  Our amendment is very simple. It ensures that the budget resolution \nwill provide a $2 billion increase to the National Institutes of Health \nfor fiscal year 2000, and it is fully paid for. It is paid for by the \nvery industry that has caused most of the death and disease in this \ncountry.\n  As I said before, Mr. President, tobacco kills more Americans each \nyear than alcohol, car accidents, suicides, AIDS, homicides, illegal \ndrugs, and fires all put together.\n  Simply put, our amendment turns tobacco profits toward the cure for \nthe cancer, emphysema, and heart disease that it causes.\n  During the dealings that led to the tobacco settlements, the tobacco \nlawyers made sure that all the payments they made to the States would \nbe considered ``normal and necessary business expenses.'' But there is \nnothing ordinary about this settlement. The tobacco industry has \npeddled a product that has killed millions of Americans through their \ndeceptive advertising and sales practices. As a result of that loophole \nin the settlement, the tobacco industry can write off 35 percent of \ntheir entire settlement payment. That means American taxpayers, not big \ntobacco, will have to cough up as much as 35 percent of the cost, $2 \nbillion this year alone, and continuing the next 25 years of the \ntobacco settlement.\n  In effect, the tobacco settlement is a $70 billion tax on the \nAmerican people. What our amendment says is that basically the tobacco \ncompanies will not be able to deduct from their Federal taxes the \namount of money that they pay to the States for this settlement. The \nAmerican people have paid enough. To make them pay an additional $70 \nbillion to cover up for the tobacco companies' tax deductions for their \nsettlements is adding insult to death and injury.\n  Let me add one other thing, Mr. President. I have heard there is some \nmisinformation floating out there about our amendment. Let me be clear. \nOur amendment would have absolutely no impact on the amount of \nsettlement funds going to the States. The settlement has a clause that \nrequires a dollar-for-dollar reduction in payments to the States if \nadditional taxes are raised on tobacco and spent by the States, if the \nmoney is remitted to the States. Not one penny of the Specter amendment \nwould go to the States but would all go to the National Institutes of \nHealth. Therefore, it in no way violates that provision of the \nsettlement.\n  Mr. President, I have a letter dated today from the Congressional \nResearch\n\n[[Page S3230]]\n\nService that makes it very clear that our amendment does not violate \nthe master settlement agreement made between the States and tobacco \ncompanies. I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                               memorandum\n\n     To: Senate Committee on Appropriations, Attention: Mary \n           Dietrich.\n     From: Stephen Redhead, Specialist in Public Health, Domestic \n         Science Policy Division.\n     Subject: MSA Federal Legislation Offset.\n       Under Section X of the Master Settlement Agreement (MSA), \n     annual payments to states are subject to a federal tobacco-\n     legislation offset: If new federal legislation that requires \n     tobacco companies to make payments (``settlement payments, \n     taxes, or any other means'') to the federal government is \n     enacted on or before November 30, 2002, and some portion of \n     that money is made available to the states as (i) \n     unrestricted funds, or (ii) earmarked for health care \n     (including tobacco-related health care), those payments may \n     be offset, dollar for dollar, from the annual payments to \n     states.\n       S. Con. Res. 20 proposes federal legislation that would \n     disallow the tobacco companies' federal income tax deduction \n     for the MSA payments and use $1.4 billion of the resulting \n     revenues to fund biomedical research at the National \n     Institutes of Health (NIH). There is some concern that such \n     legislation might lead to a reduction in the MSA payments to \n     states by triggering the federal tobacco-legislation offset.\n       Although legislation disallowing a federal income tax \n     deduction for tobacco settlement payments meets the Section X \n     definition above, earmarking a portion of the funds for NIH \n     research would not appear, by itself, to satisfy the \n     criterion that money be ``made available'' to the states. NIH \n     awards grants to individual researchers and research \n     institutions under a variety of grant programs, but not to \n     states.\n       S. Con. Res. 20 might very possibly lead to a reduction in \n     state settlement payments because of the MSA's volume-of-\n     sales adjustment, which links the payments to the number of \n     packs of cigarettes sold. If the companies are disallowed the \n     federal tax deduction, then they will have to increase prices \n     to raise the necessary revenue to pay the taxes. The \n     companies have already increased prices by 75 cents a pack \n     over the past 2 years, which appears to have reduced \n     consumption. If the additional price increase further \n     depresses consumption, then under the volume-of-sales \n     adjustment the states' payments will be reduced \n     proportionately.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, let me close by saying that we went on \nrecord 98-0 to double the NIH budget over the next 5 years. Last year, \nSenator Specter and I and others were able to put that 15-percent \nincrease in there to get us on that road. This budget this year pulls \nthe rug out from under that.\n  The people of America want us to invest in medical research. They \nwant us to double the NIH budget. They believe it is important.\n  In a recent poll taken of the American people, more than 67 percent \nsupport doubling the research budget at NIH; 85 percent said it is \nimportant for us to maintain our leadership in medical research; 61 \npercent of the American people polled said they would be willing to pay \n$1 more a week in taxes to increase health research. The support is \nthere.\n  There is no reason why the tobacco companies ought to be able to \ndeduct from their Federal taxes the money that they are giving to the \nStates in that settlement. They wrote it in that agreement, but that \ndoes not bind us.\n  This amendment does not violate the agreement. What it does is it \nsaves the American taxpayers over $70 billion that they will have to \npay to save the tobacco companies their money.\n  This amendment also saves Medicare--by putting this money into \nmedical research to help solve the diseases of Alzheimer's, \nosteoporosis, arthritis, and diabetes. If you want to save Medicare, \nadopt the Specter amendment. If you want to save the taxpayers money, \nadopt the Specter amendment. If you want to save peoples' lives, adopt \nthe Specter amendment.\n  Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes 22 seconds.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to sponsor the \namendment to increase funding for health research by $2 billion. I do \nso because we must confront disease as seriously as we confront war. \nThis means we must support our brightest minds, we must have a clear \nbattle plan and we must find the resolve to win the war against \ndisease.\n  This amendment comes on the heels of several previous efforts. First, \nin 1997, the Senate adopted the Mack-Feinstein amendment 98 to 0, \nurging Congress to double the budget of the National Institutes of \nHealth over 5 years. Second, last year, Congress gave the National \nInstitutes of Health an increase of 15 percent, funding NIH at $16 \nbillion, the first step toward doubling. Third, on February 2, when we \nlearned that the President's FY 2000 budget proposed only a 2 percent \nincrease, not even enough to keep up with inflation, I wrote the \nPresident and urging instead that NIH funding be doubled by 2004.\n  It is a sad comment on our nation that the National Institutes of \nHealth in FY 1999 can only fund 31 percent of grant applications. \ngrants. The National Cancer Institute can only fund 31 percent. This is \nless than one-third of applications worthy of funding. This low funding \nrate leaves a vast wealth of knowledge unobtained, unexplored, diseases \nnot cured and not treated.\n  There are many scientifically promising areas of research to which \nthese funds could be devoted. They include gaining a clearer \nunderstanding of neural development; improving identification of \ninherited mutations which contribute to cancer risk; better \nunderstanding the interplay between genetics and environmental risk \nfactors; uncovering the causes of over 5,000 known rare diseases \naffecting over 20 million Americans.\n  In cancer, a special interest of mine, the President requests only a \n2 percent increase in FY 2000. NCI Director Dr. Richard Klausner has \nsaid that with this minimal increase, NCI would fund 10 percent fewer \ngrants, according to the February 12 Cancer Letter. The National Cancer \nAdvisory Board said this budget will ``seriously damage the National \nCancer Program.''\n  Last September, the Senate Cancer Coalition which I cochair, held a \nhearing for the Cancer March who said that cancer has reached epidemic \nproportions and if current rates continue, one quarter of our \npopulation will die from cancer. Because of the aging of the \npopulation, the incidence of cancer will reaching ``staggering \nproportions'' by 2010, with increase of 29 percent in incidence and 25 \npercent in deaths, at a cost of over $200 billion per year. They argued \nthat these compelling statistics call for raising funding for cancer \nresearch to $10 billion by 2003, a 20 percent increase each year.\n  The National Cancer Institute has identified 5 promising areas of \nresearch in its FY 2000 ``bypass budget.'' They are as follows: (1) \nCancer genetics, identify and characterize every major human gene \npredisposing to cancer. (2) Preclinical models of cancer, study genes \nand effects of alterations of them in animals ; (3) Diagnostic \ntechnologies, to improve the sensitivity of technologies to detect \nsmaller numbers of tumor cells; (4) Better understanding the unique \ncharacteristics of cells and why it turns into a cancerous cell.\n  There are still many--too many--diseases for which we have no cure. \nThis year, 1.2 million cases will be diagnosed this year and 563,100 \nAmericans will die. But we spend one-tenth of one cent of every federal \ndollar on cancer research. The mortality rates for many cancers, like \nprostate, liver, skin and kidney, continue to increase. AIDS has \nsurpassed accidents as the leading killer of young adults; it is now \nthe leading cause of death among Americans ages 25 to 44. Diabetes and \nasthma are rising. 40,000 infants die each year from devastating \ndiseases. Seven to 10 percent of children are learning disabled. Birth \ndefects affecting function occur in 7% of deliveries or 250,000 of \nbirths.\n  The baby boom generation is getting older. Over the 30 years, the \nnumber of Americans over age 65 will double. As our population ages, we \nare seeing an increase in chronic and degenerative diseases like \narthritis, cancer, osteoporosis, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. For \nexample, the 4 million people with Alzheimer's Disease today will more \nthan triple, to 14 million, by the middle of the next century--unless \nwe find a way to prevent or cure it. Health care costs will grow \nexponentially and we see that in part reflected in our budget debates \nover Medicare and Medicaid expenditures. The total annual cost of \nAlzheimer's today is $100 billion. By delaying the onset by 5 years, we \ncan save $50 billion annually.\n\n[[Page S3231]]\n\n  In January, we learned from the Institute of Medicine's study, The \nUnequal Burden of Cancer, that not all segments of our population \nbenefit fully from our advances in understanding cancer. African-\nAmerican males develop cancer 15 percent more frequently than white \nmales. Stomach and liver cancers are more prevalent among Asian \nAmericans. Cervical cancer strikes Hispanic and Vietnamese American \nwomen more than others. Many ethnic minorities experience poorer cancer \nsurvival rates than whites. American Indians have the lowest cancer \nsurvival rates of any U.S. ethnic group. This study reported that by \n2050 there will be no majority population in the U.S. And our hearings \nof the Cancer Coalition have revealed that minorities are \nunderrepresented in cancer clinical trials.\n  Discoveries from health research can reduce health care costs. Cancer \ncosts the economy $104 annually; heart disease, $128 billion; diabetes, \n$138 billion. Research can cuts costs.. A delay in the onset of stroke \ncould save $15 billion and a delay in the onset of Parkinson's disease \ncould save $3 billion annually. For every $1.00 spent on measles/mumps/\nrubella vaccine, $21.00 is saved. For the diphtheria/tetanus/pertussis \nvaccine, $29 is saved. Reducing hip fractures, the cause of one in five \nnursing home admissions can cut nursing home costs by $333 million in \none year alone. Delaying the onset of hearing impairment by 5 years in \nthe 30 percent of adults age 65 to 75 who have impairment, can save $15 \nbillion annually.\n  The United States is the world's leader in developing sophisticated \ntreatments for illnesses and diseases, in making important medical \ndiscoveries and in improving human life expectancy. Yet, we are \nspending only three cents of every health care dollar spent in this \ncountry on health research. NIH's budget is less than one percent of \nthe federal budget.\n  Funding NIH like a yoyo discourages the medical community from \npursuing research. It is like a damper on ideas, on promising lines of \nscientific pursuit, that get snuffed out while being born. The National \nAcademy of Sciences has said that we are not producing enough research \nscientists. That is in part due to the lack of assurance that health \nresearch has the priority it deserves.\n  We can do better.\n  The public is with us. A 1998 Research America poll found that most \nAmericans support doubling funding for medical research in 5 years and \nover 60 percent of people in 25 states said they are willing to \ncontribute another $1.00 per week in taxes for health research.\n  Mr. President, when President Franklin Roosevelt dedicated the new \nNational Institutes of Health research facility on October 31, 1940 in \nthe middle of World War II, he said, ``We cannot be a strong nation \nunless we are a healthy nation. And so we must recruit not only men and \nmaterials but also knowledge and science in the service of national \nstrength . . . I dedicate [this Institute] to the underlying philosophy \nof public health; to the conservation of life; to the wise use of the \nvital resources of the nation.'' That challenge is no less important \ntoday as it was in 1940.\n  I believe the public wants us to launch a war on disease and that the \npublic sees medical research as an important priority of their federal \ngovernment. I urge passage of this amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of the time for \nSenator Specter in the morning, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 159\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate on TEA-21 funding and the \n                                States)\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside and send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Collins] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 159.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE SENATE ON TEA-21 FUNDING AND THE STATES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) on May 22, 1998, the Senate overwhelmingly approved the \n     conference committee report on H.R. 2400, the Transportation \n     Equity Act for the 21st Century, in a 88-5 roll call vote;\n       (2) also on May 22, 1998, the House of Representatives \n     approved the conference committee report on this bill in a \n     297-86 recorded vote;\n       (3) on June 9, 1998, President Clinton signed this bill \n     into law, thereby making it Public Law 105-178;\n       (4) the TEA-21 legislation was a comprehensive \n     reauthorization of Federal highway and mass transit programs, \n     which authorized approximately $216,000,000,000 in Federal \n     transportation spending over the next 6 fiscal years;\n       (5) section 1105 of this legislation called for any excess \n     Federal gasoline tax revenues to be provided to the States \n     under the formulas established by the final version of TEA-\n     21; and\n       (6) the President's fiscal year 2000 budget request \n     contained a proposal to distribute approximately \n     $1,000,000,000 in excess Federal gasoline tax revenues that \n     was not consistent with the provisions of section 1105 of \n     TEA-21 and would deprive States of needed revenues.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution and any legislation \n     enacted pursuant to this resolution assume that the \n     President's fiscal year 2000 budget proposal to change the \n     manner in which any excess Federal gasoline tax revenues are \n     distributed to the States will not be implemented, but rather \n     any of these funds will be distributed to the States pursuant \n     to section 1105 of TEA-21.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to offer a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution to give the Senate the opportunity to express its clear \ncommitment to ensuring that Federal gasoline tax revenues in fiscal \nyear 2000 be distributed to the 50 States in accordance with the \nformula in the 1998 highway bill, the Transportation Equity Act for the \n21st Century--or TEA-21 bill, as it is frequently called.\n  Mr. President, let me explain the action that has prompted my \namendment and my concern. President Clinton's fiscal year 2000 budget \ncontains a proposal which essentially changes the gas tax rules in the \nmiddle of the game. The President would distribute approximately $1 \nbillion in higher-than-expected Federal gas tax revenues to a variety \nof transportation projects, rather than following the formula in the \ncurrent law. Instead of distributing these extra moneys to the States, \nas required by the 1998 highway bill, enacted only 9 months ago, the \nPresident would divert these funds to other projects.\n  To be precise, section 1105 of last year's highway bill expressly \nprovides that any additional Federal gas tax revenues above the levels \nenvisioned in the act should be distributed to 50 States under the \nhighway bill's formulas. These funds are extremely important to the \nStates. They support a variety of important transportation programs \nauthorized by the TEA-21 bill.\n  It now appears that the Federal Government will receive roughly $1.5 \nbillion in extra Federal gasoline tax revenues next year. The \nPresident, however, proposes to take $1 billion of these extra revenues \nand spend them on a variety of Federal transportation programs, \ncontravening current Federal law.\n  Mr. President, if the full $1.5 billion were allocated to the States \nunder existing law, the State of Maine would receive roughly $7 million \nin much needed additional highway funds in fiscal year 2000. Under the \nPresident's proposal, however, which diverts $1 billion of these \ngasoline tax funds, the State of Maine would receive only $3.4 million \nin extra highway funds. This is a reduction of more than 50 percent in \nthe funds that would otherwise be allocated to the State of Maine.\n  In short, if President Clinton's proposal were implemented, the State \nof Maine would lose approximately $3.6 million in critically needed \nFederal highway funds next year. The President's plan is unfair to \nMaine, it is unfair to the other States, and it should not be \nimplemented. It changes course midstream in a way that harms our \nStates' ability to meet their transportation needs. States should be \nable to rely on the Federal Government to abide by the commitment that \nit made only last May.\n  Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Budget Committee's report \naccompanying the budget resolution states as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S3232]]\n\n\n       The committee-reported resolution does not assume the \n     President's proposal to change the distribution of additional \n     Highway Trust Fund revenues under TEA-21.\n\n  My sense-of-the-Senate resolution simply clarifies this language and \nreiterates the intent behind it. That is, that we should follow the \ndictates of the 1998 highway bill and allow any and all extra Federal \ngas tax moneys to go to the States under the terms and the conditions \nof the highway law.\n  Approving the sense-of-the-Senate resolution would allow the Senate \nto clearly express its disapproval of the President's plan. We should \nnot change the rules. We should follow the allocation in the highway \nbill. We should keep the promise that we made just last May.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. I am listening to the argument the Senator has made, and I \nam curious. Is there a chart or list that would inform us how our \nStates would be doing under this different formula of which we ought to \nbe aware?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I am happy to attempt to produce that information for \nthe Senator from Connecticut.\n  It is a concern of many States that they would receive less money \nunder the President's budget than they would receive if the highway \nbill were allowed to just work under current law.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if my colleague would yield further, coming \nfrom the Northeast and New England, we have recently seen stories in \nnewspapers of gas prices going up in the peak travel season for our \nStates. I think it may be national in scope, but we feel it \nparticularly in the Northeast.\n  I commend my colleague from Maine for making this proposal. I think \nit can be a great help, particularly when we find the battle over some \nof the formulas, and where need exists. Certainly the Senator from \nMaine has a great need with a lot of roads, a lot of highways, and a \nrelatively small population.\n  It is an important amendment. I commend her for that. I might join \nher as a cosponsor in it.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I very much welcome the support of the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, it is my understanding that in terms \nof the manager, the chairman of the Budget Committee, this is \nacceptable. As far as I am concerned, it would be acceptable on our \nside. Therefore, it is fair to say we will accept it.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The question is on agreeing \nto the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 159) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the chairman and the ranking minority member of \nthe Budget Committee for their cooperation.\n  Mr. DODD. I want to take note. I think it was my persuasive arguments \nthat persuaded the ranking Democrat to support the amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 160\n\n  (Purpose: To increase the mandatory spending in the Child Care and \nDevelopment Block Grant by $7.5 billion over five years, the amendment \n   reduces the resolution's tax cut and leaves adequate room in the \nrevenue instructions for targeted tax cuts that help families with the \n costs of caring for their children, and that such relief would assist \n all working families with employment related child care expenses, as \n well as families in which one parent stays home to care for an infant)\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside, and I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, many of my colleagues may know that 9 years \nago my colleague from Utah and I offered and authored the Child Care \nand Development Block Grant Act of 1990.\n  Year after year, we have talked about this important program and \nabout what a difference we think it has made in the lives of working \nfamilies.\n  Any Member of this body who has spent time in his or her State over \nthe\n\n[[Page S3233]]\n\npast 2 months enters this debate about budget priorities knowing with \nabsolute certainty that very few issues weigh as heavily on the minds \nof parents across this country than how their children are being cared \nfor. Parents worry they can't afford to take time away from work to be \nwith their children. When they must work, they worry that the child \ncare they need will be unavailable, unaffordable, or unsafe. It is a \nconstant daily struggle for parents with young children in this \ncountry. It is a constant source of concern for parents all across the \nNation.\n  Helping these families does not require inventing a slew of new \nprograms. We already have the Child Care and Development Block grant, a \nprogram that works and that enjoys strong bipartisan support.\n  This block grant is a model of flexibility. It provides direct \nfinancial assistance to help families pay for child care. It does not \ndictate where that child care must be provided. Parents can choose a \nchild care center, they can have a home-based provider, a neighbor, a \nchurch, a relative, whatever they think is best for their child.\n  In our opinion, this is an excellent program. In fact, its only \ndownside is that the level that it is currently funded at reaches far \ntoo few families in this country. As a result of underfunding, the \nchild care block grant--now almost a decade old--can only serve 1 out \nof every 10 children. This graph highlights that: Out of every 10 \nchildren who are eligible, only 1 today can actually take advantage of \nthe child care block grant.\n  Consequently, States have had to employ various strategies to ration \nthe subsidies that these block grants provide.\n  Almost all States without exception have lowered their income-\neligibility requirements far below the federally allowed level--85 \npercent of the State's median family income, or approximately $35,000.\n  I notice the presence of our colleague from Ohio, and I know as a \nformer Governor how he wrestled with these issues. I think he knows \nvery graphically what I am about to describe for other colleagues. The \nPresiding Officer was a Governor and he can appreciate this as well.\n  Because of underfunding, over 20 states have cut off all assistance \nto families of three earning over $25,000. Fourteen States have cut \nassistance for families earning over $20,000. Seven States are even \nmore stringent: Wyoming, Alabama, Missouri, Kentucky, Iowa, South \nCarolina, and West Virginia cut off subsidies for families earning more \nthan $17,000 a year--half the income level that is allowed for under \nFederal law.\n  What is the effect of this? What happens? In some States, subsidies \nare only provided to parents on or moving off welfare. Working families \nout there living on the margin can't get any help. This is not what I \nthink any of us intended to have happen.\n  This graph shows that 52 percent of the child care needs of working \nfamilies cannot be met with current funding schemes. They are either \nlocked out by strict State income eligibility requirements, they are \nlocked out by long waiting lists, or they are locked out by subsidies \nthat are too low to pay for the child care they need.\n  Even with these strict income eligibility requirements, as I \nmentioned, many States have long waiting lists. How bad are the waiting \nlists? In California, 200,000 children are on waiting lists for child \ncare slots. In the State of Texas, it is 36,000; Massachusetts, 16,000; \nPennsylvania, almost 13,000; Alabama, 19,000; Georgia, 44,500.\n  Other States ration their limited child care dollars by paying child \ncare providers far below the market rate--again, trying hard to guard \nthese dollars carefully.\n  For example, my own State of Connecticut has been unable to raise the \npayment rates for child care providers for 7 years. Even during a \nrobust economy, we have not been able to increase the pay of child care \nproviders because of the lack of funding in the child block grant \nprogram. It isn't hard to see that paying unrealistically low rates \nmakes providers reluctant to accept subsidized children. It also isn't \nhard to see that this practice jeopardizes the ability of families who \ndo get assistance to find good quality child care.\n  When you look at the astronomical costs of child care, you can see \nhow all of these rationing practices put families in a crisis.\n  Let me draw the attention of my colleagues to this last chart here. \nThese are annual child care fees across the country for children of \nselected ages. I have picked a cross section, with some of the highest \nand some of the less costly States, to give examples. I have broken it \ndown by the cost of an infant, which is the highest child care cost, a \n3-year-old, and a 6-year-old. The highest-cost State is Massachusetts. \nIn Massachusetts, to take care of a 1-year-old child, the annual cost \nis $11,860; for a 3-year-old, it is $8,840; for a 6-year-old, it is \n$6,660. If you go down the list, I have done North Carolina, Florida, \nMinnesota, Texas, Colorado, and California.\n  Consider these numbers for a minute and recall what I showed you \nabout how States have lowered the financial eligibility criteria down \nto as low as $17,000. It means that if you live in one of the states \nwith strict income eligibility, you might earn $21,000 and not qualify \nfor the subsidy, but still be paying $8,580 for the care of an infant. \nIf you make $21,000 and have an $8,500 yearly child care bill--you are \ngetting close to paying 50 percent of your gross income to care for one \nchild.\n  If my colleagues would like, I will have this information before the \nvote tomorrow for each State to give Members some idea on what the \nwaiting lists are like, to get some sense of how important an issue \nthis is for the families living in your States.\n  Without help in paying the $4,000 to $11,000 a year that child care \ncan cost, low-income working families are forced into the untenable \nposition of placing their children in an unsafe, makeshift child care \narrangement or forgoing employment.\n  Unfortunately, what we have before us is a budget that chooses to \nignore this problem. I say, with all due respect, to those who have to \ndraft these budgets, what we have before us is a budget that disregards \nthese needs.\n  We are being asked to endorse a budget that doesn't just fail to \nprovide for an increase in child care funding but in fact would cut \ndiscretionary child care spending by $122 million in fiscal year 2000--\ncutting off assistance to some 34,000 children in the first year, and \nup to 79,000 by the fifth year of the program--in order to pay for tax \ncuts for the more affluent citizens in our society.\n  I have heard my colleagues all across this Chamber repeatedly say \nthat they only want to return the surplus to working families. That is \nhard to argue. But that is what this amendment does. Working people \nneed this.\n  This amendment provides an additional $7.5 billion over 5 years for \nthe Child Care and Development Block Grant, which goes directly to \nfamilies to help them pay for child care--by a church, by neighbors, by \nfamily members, We pay for this funding increase by reducing the \nproposed $800 billion tax cut by the same $7.5 billion over 5 years. I \ndon't think that is too big a chunk out of that for a very serious \nprogram which needs help.\n  We also make a non-binding statement that if there is a tax cut, we \nwant a tax credit for child care that helps all working families as \nwell as all parents who stay home to care for an infant.\n  That is a critically important issue if you are in the working poor \ncategory. If you are down at the $15,000 to $25,000 income level, a \nnon-refundable tax credit is not very valuable to you because you \nprobably have little or no tax bill. Without making the credit \nrefundable, you don't get much benefit.\n\n  I hope, Mr. President, that my colleagues will seriously consider \nthis amendment. Too often these amendments come up and people sort of \nblow by them, and just march in lockstep.\n  If we don't adopt this amendment, we will be very limited in the type \nof child care funding increases we can seek this year. If it is not in \nthe budget as part of a mandatory spending, I'm essentially closed out \nfor the year.\n  Others have said in the past, ``Don't make it mandatory. Take your \nbest shot in the discretionary spending and fight over appropriations \nthat.'' I have tried that over the years, I say to my colleagues. You \njust don't win. And this year will be harder than ever because, as you \nknow, we have about a 12 percent across-the-board cut in nondefense \ndiscretionary programs. For\n\n[[Page S3234]]\n\nme to get $7.5 billion over 5 years in a discretionary nondefense \nappropriations battle, is not going to happen.\n  You have to ask yourself a tough question: Regarding that $800 \nbillion tax cut, as important as it is to many of you, would you mind \nreducing it by $7.5 billion over 5 years to try to make a difference \nhere for working families who need child care?\n  You also have to ask if tax credits should go to all working families \nand stay-at-home parents. Low-income families in both these situations \nmake tough choices and they ought to have the backing of their \nrepresentatives in Congress, in my view.\n  I ask my colleagues who are here this evening, or others who may be \nwatching the debate, before the vote tomorrow, to please take a hard \nlook at this amendment and see if you can find a way to be supportive \nof it. This is the only opportunity we will have to really deal with \nthis issue, and unless it is included in this budget resolution, it is \nessentially off the table. That is it for the 106th Congress. This is \nour one opportunity to do something to help these families.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Senator Dodd and I offer this amendment \nto do more to help working families secure quality child care.\n  Child care is one of the most important challenges facing the Nation. \nThe need to improve the affordability, accessibility, and quality of \nchild care is indisputable. Every day, millions of parents go to work \nand entrust their children to the care of others. An estimated 13 \nmillion children under 6 years old are regularly in child care.\n  Every working parent wants to be sure that their children are safe \nand well cared for. Yet child care can be a staggering financial \nburden, consuming up to a quarter of the income of low-income families. \nChild care can easily cost between $4,000 and $10,000 for one child. \nBut about half of all young children live in families with incomes \nbelow $35,000. And two parents working full-time at the minimum wage \nearn only $21,400. These parents--working parents--constantly must \nchoose between paying their rent or mortgage, buying food, and being \nable to afford the quality care their children need.\n  Existing child care investments fall far short of meeting the needs \nof these parents and their children. Today, 10 million low-income \nchildren theoretically qualify for services under current Federal child \ncare programs. But because of lack of funding, only one in ten of these \nchildren actually receive it. The need is great and a ratio like that \nis unacceptable.\n  Making sure that all children receive quality care especially in the \nearly years, is one of the best possible investments in America's \nfuture. We know the enormous human potential that can be fulfilled by \nensuring that all children get adequate attention and stimulation \nduring the first three years of life. Quality child development \nincreases creativity and productivity in our workforce. There is less \nneed for remedial education and less delinquency. Safe, reliable care \noffers stable relationships and intellectually stimulating activities. \nChild care that fulfills these goals can make all the difference in \nenabling children to learn, grow, and reach their potential. If we are \nserious about putting parents to work and protecting children, we must \ninvest more in child care help for families.\n  President Clinton has put families first by giving child care the \nhigh priority it deserves. Senate Democrats have proposed an increase \nin our commitment to child care by at least $7.5 billion in mandatory \nspending over the next 5 years, almost doubling the number of children \nserved from 1 million to 2 million in 2005.\n  The benefits from investing in children are substantial and many. A \nlifetime of health costs are lower when children are supervised, \neducated about their health, and taught to develop healthy habits. \nParents' productivity improves when they know that their children are \nwell cared for. Education costs decrease when children enter school \nready to learn. By expanding child care and child development programs, \nwe invest in children, their future, and the country's future.\n  Yet this budget resolution allots no funds for increased child care \nand development programs. In fact, the Republican budget slashes funds \nfor critical programs for children. It denies 100,000 children the Head \nStart services that help them come to school ready to learn. It makes \nit impossible to reach the goal of serving a million children in Head \nStart by 2002. The message contained in the budget resolution is \nclear--children are not a priority.\n  The Nation's children and families deserve a budget that invests in \nthe right priorities--not the priorities of the right wing. This \nRepublican budget makes children a non-priority--and gives high \npriority to an $800 billion tax cut for the wealthy. Those priorities \nare wrong for children, wrong for Congress, and wrong for the Nation.\n  Now, when we have a large national surplus and a strong economy, it \nis time to invest in our most valuable resource--our children. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Are we going back and \nforth to each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no order. However, there is an \namendment pending.\n  Mr. REED. I ask unanimous consent to lay the amendment aside. My \namendment is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I think it is informal to go back and forth.\n  Mr. REED. I withdraw my unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair thanks the Senator.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 161\n\n       (Purpose: Use on-budget surplus to repay the debt instead \n     of tax cuts.)\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. Voinovich] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 161.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, we are debating a budget resolution in \nthe Senate that will provide an outline for our Nation's spending for \nthe next fiscal year. With the assurances of the Republican leadership, \nwe will be sticking to our guns on the spending caps that we agreed to \nin the 1997 balanced budget agreement. And we will lock away the Social \nSecurity trust funds in a lockbox.\n  Earlier today, the Senate reaffirmed its commitment to Social \nSecurity, voting unanimously 99 to 0 that current and future Social \nSecurity trust funds should remain only for Social Security. It was the \nright thing to do. But incredibly, President Clinton has threatened to \nveto a similar measure, the Abraham-Domenici Social Security lockbox \nbill. It is unconscionable for the President to undermine the efforts \nof Congress to save Social Security just so he can use the Social \nSecurity surplus to pay for his pet projects.\n  As cosponsor of the lockbox legislation, I believe it represents a \ngolden opportunity to show that Washington is serious about keeping its \nword to our seniors and future retirees. Since the Senate voted 99 to 0 \nthis afternoon, I expect that all of my Democratic colleagues will vote \nfor the Social Security lockbox bill when it comes to the floor and \nurge the President not to veto this legislation.\n  The Senate meanwhile will have to make some tough budget choices in \nfiscal year 2000, and we will have to do more with less. It is not \ngoing to be easy, because we have so many competing demands chasing so \nfew dollars--demands such as military pay and readiness, education, and \nperhaps Medicare. And, yes; now that the President has started to bomb \nKosovo we may need a lot more money to pay for a brand new war.\n  I would like to remind my colleagues this evening that the cost of \nthat war is coming out of the Social Security surplus. The money to pay \nfor that war is being paid for out of the Social Security surplus.\n\n[[Page S3235]]\n\n  I also recognize that we may have to deal with emergencies as they \noccur. I applaud the chairman of the Budget Committee for drafting a \nresolution that addresses those needs. Under his leadership, Senator \nDomenici has acknowledged that we must reserve $131 billion, or what I \nwould like to call a rainy day fund, that may only be used--let me \nstress--may only be used for Medicare, agriculture, Federal \nemergencies, or debt reduction.\n  While the chairman and I agree on that point, I do respectfully have \na difference of opinion on using the onbudget surplus for tax cuts.\n  The amendment that I am offering is a simple one. It takes the tax \ncuts proposed in the budget resolution and uses the money to pay down \nthe debt. Let me say again, under my amendment, we would take the $778 \nbillion in tax cuts and use the money to pay down the debt. If my \namendment is adopted and we use the onbudget surplus for debt \nreduction, then publicly held debt will drop from $3.68 trillion today \nto $960 billion by the year 2009.\n  Mr. President, we can't let this opportunity pass by, because if we \nlook at this chart, we can see how vital it is to bring down our debt. \nThis is what our debt was back in 1940. As you will notice, at the end \nof the Vietnam war, this debt skyrocketed, like Senator Glenn going up \nin the STS-95. Once we commingled the Social Security surplus with the \ngeneral funds of this country, we started to use that surplus and \nborrow money to pay for tax reductions and spending increases. We now \nhave increased that debt. When I was mayor of the city of Cleveland \nback in 1979, it was $750 billion at that time. It is $5.6 trillion \ntoday, almost a 600-percent increase in the national debt.\n  Why should we do this rather than use this money to reduce taxes?\n  First of all, if we pay down the debt, we are going to decrease our \nmassive interest payments on the national debt.\n  No. 2, we will expand the economy.\n  No. 3, we will lower interest rates for families.\n  No. 4, we are going to have less need for future tax hikes. It will \ndecrease the overall interest paid on the debt.\n  Right now, this is hard to believe, but we are spending over $600 \nmillion per day--do you hear me--per day, just to service the interest \non the national debt.\n  Let's look at what that means. Most of the American people are not \naware of what is going on here. Here are the entitlements, 54 percent; \nnet interest, look at this, 14 percent of the money going for net \ninterest; national defense, 15 percent; and nondefense discretionary, \n17 percent.\n  Look at what has happened. When Janet, my wife, and I got married \nback in 1962, we were spending 6 cents per dollar on the interest. \nToday it is 14 cents.\n  The next chart, let's look at what that interest is doing. The \ninterest on the national debt, as you can see, is a little bit below \ndefense. But look at Medicare. We are spending more money today in the \nUnited States of America on the interest on national debt than we are \non Medicare. And for education, we are spending five times more money \non interest than we are on education. And for medical research, we are \nspending 15 times more money on interest than on the National \nInstitutes of Health. That is what is going on today.\n  No. 2, it will expand the economy.\n  No. 3, it will lower the interest rate for individual families.\n  As Alan Greenspan attests, a decreasing national debt will bolster a \nstrong economy and allow individual interest rates to fall.\n  Everybody who is an expert--talk to Dan Crippen, of the Congressional \nBudget Office, or David Walker, who is the new Comptroller General at \nGAO. Ask them: If you have a surplus, what should you do with it? They \nwill come back and say, ``Reduce the national debt.''\n  These lower interest rates give middle-class Americans the ability to \npurchase homes. That is what keeps interest rates down. They are able \nto refinance mortgages and buy automobiles. The savings gives them some \nreal money to either save, invest, or put it back into the economy.\n  With the low-interest rates that we have enjoyed, over 17 million \nAmericans have refinanced their homes since 1993. Just think of the \npeople that you know who have refinanced their homes because we have \nkept interest rates down. If we pay off or reduce the national debt, \nthose rates will continue to come down. These homeowners have saved \nmillions of dollars in mortgage payments per year. In fact, one of my \nstaff members refinanced his modest duplex home in 1998. By \nrefinancing, his yearly savings will be $2,160 a year. That is more \nthan $50,000 he is going to save over the 25 years left on his \nmortgage.\n  If we could lower interest rates by 1 percentage point, an average \nfamily buying a home could save over $25,000 on a typical mortgage. Mr. \nPresident, that is a win-win for the American people. We will have less \ndebt over our heads, and Americans will have more of their own money in \ntheir pockets in order to be able to buy things that they need for \ntheir families.\n  Finally, the fourth reason is that if we reduce the national debt, it \nwill lower the amount of taxes necessary to run the Government. As the \ndebt decreases, so does the overall cost of running the Government. \nThis would allow us to maintain the current level of Government \nservices and accommodate an increase in the use of those services by \nthe baby boomers. It would also lessen the demand for future tax hikes \nthat would result in a de facto tax cut for American people. Just think \nif we could bring the amount of the net interest payments down, that \nmoney would be available for other things we need to spend money on. \nOr, in the alternative, the opportunity to reduce taxes.\n\n  From a public policy point of view, let's be serious in terms of our \ndebt. You have a 10-year projection on an $800 billion reduction in \ntaxes. We are going to have a tough time balancing the budget this \nyear. We may not have a surplus. Next year we will be lucky to have a \nsurplus. One thing we do know is if we use the money to reduce the debt \nand we do not spend it on more programs, or we do not use it to reduce \ntaxes, we will not be in the position, if the economy doesn't go the \nway we expect it to, to have to go back to the American people and say: \nFolks, we gave you a tax cut, but we are going to have to take it back \nbecause our projections were wrong. Folks, we are spending money on \nprograms, and by the way, we are going to have to cut those programs \nbecause these 10-year projections we have are not working out.\n  I want to say one thing and I think it is important. Mr. President, \n5-year projections may be reasonable; 10-year projections, if you talk \nto CBO, they would tell you they could swing $300 billion over this \nperiod of time. I think what we need to do is understand we have a \ntough budget situation that, if we lock up Social Security and do not \ntouch it as we have in the past, we are going to have a couple of tough \nyears ahead of us. Rather than projecting out 10 years and talking \nabout what we are going to be doing with the money, I think if we do \nhave that additional money, let's pay down the national debt.\n  The last thing I would like to say is this: I just had a new \ngranddaughter last week, Veronica Kay Voinovich. While I was \ncampaigning in Ohio last year I talked about my first grandchild, Mary \nFaith. Her gift, when she was born on December 26, 1996, from this \nGovernment, was a bill for $187,000, interest on a debt that was racked \nup before her life, on something that she had nothing to do with. And \nwe are asking her to pay for it. I think it is criminal. I think it is \ncriminal that we have not been willing to pay for the things that we \nwanted, that we borrowed the money, and we have had an attitude: We \nhave ours, let them worry about theirs.\n  That is not the legacy that was left to me and I do not want that \nlegacy for my granddaughters or for the other grandchildren here in the \nUnited States of America.\n  We have a wonderful opportunity. For the first time, we can see the \nlight to really do something that is responsible in dealing with this \nbudget to get ourselves back on track, so going into the next century, \nthe next 10 years are going to be good years for our country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I take time from what would normally \nbe the opposition. I want to take this\n\n[[Page S3236]]\n\nopportunity to say to the Senator from Ohio that we think that is \npretty clear thinking. Paying down the debt--he is right. I heard his \nremarks. He recounts what we have heard from the economists, Greenspan \nincluded, about the most important way to get our fiscal house in order \nand that is to pay down the debt. If we keep going like things are \nprojected, we could be through with public debt in about 15 years.\n  We would be, within 15 years, at the debt level in 1917. And no, I \ndon't remember it; I have read about it.\n  But within a couple of years thereafter we could be out of public \ndebt, which would be such a bonus for all of our succeeding \ngenerations, including our grandchildren. I congratulate the Senator. \nIs this his second grandchild? The second. One of mine, my 3-year-old \ngrandchild, was watching television tonight and he said to his mother, \n``Papa looks mad.'' And then he said, ``No, I think papa is happy.''\n  Anyway, we do it for them. I think the amendment of the Senator is a \nvery positive amendment and I hope it will get full support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the \npending amendment to consider my amendment which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 162\n\n  Mr. REED. I have an amendment at the desk and ask it be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this evening I rise to offer an amendment \nalong with Senator Sarbanes, Senator Kerry of Massachusetts, and \nSenator Murray, to restore funding for regional development programs to \nthe levels that are set forth in the President's budget. Unfortunately, \nthe budget resolution which we are considering today would reduce the \nfunding for community and regional development programs by $88.7 \nbillion over 10 years. This is compared to the President's budget \nrequest.\n  For example, in fiscal year 2000, spending for community and regional \ndevelopment programs would be reduced from $11.9 billion to $5.3 \nbillion, a cut of 55 percent. In fiscal year 2001, spending for these \nprograms would be reduced from $9.1 billion to $2.7 billion, a cut of \n70 percent.\n  Then, between the years 2002 and 2009, spending reductions each year \nare approximately 78 percent below the President's request. In effect, \nthis budget before us would eviscerate community and regional \ndevelopment programs. These programs are at the heart of our efforts to \ninvest in America, in our cities, in our rural areas, and to do so in a \nway that gives maximum flexibility to local mayors, Governors, and \ncommunity officials.\n  My amendment would increase spending for community development \nprograms by $88.7 billion over these 10 years to essentially meet the \nPresident's projections. It would be offset by reducing the amount of \ntax cuts, currently $778 billion, contained in this budget resolution. \nMy amendment not only restores funding for community and regional \ndevelopment, it will still leave approximately $700 billion for tax \ncuts.\n  I am deeply troubled by these cuts in community development programs \nbecause they will undermine the progress that our cities and rural \nareas have been making over the last several years. In fact, in many \ncities there is an urban renaissance. Where they are beginning to clean \nup blighted areas, they are beginning to attract new investment in the \ncenter cities. They are beginning to develop and sustain a mature \nculture and the arts. All of this is a result of investments through \nmany of these programs which stand to lose out tremendously in this \nproposed budget resolution.\n  One of the indications of a reviving urban area in the United States \nis the fact that crime, violent crime particularly, has fallen more \nthan 21 percent since 1993, and property crimes have dropped to the \nlowest point since 1973. I argue this is not simply the result of \nbetter police activity. This is because the cities are now able to \nreinvest and reinvigorate their communities, their neighbors. In so \ndoing, they give positive incentives and positive hope for people.\n  All this is happening. And all of this will stop happening quite \ndramatically if we make such a devastating cut in community development \nand regional development programs.\n  Let me suggest the particular programs that would be affected by \nthese massive cuts. First is the Community Development Block Grant \nProgram; then there is the section 108 program loans for cities and \ncommunities; there is the Economic Development Administration and their \ngrants to States and communities; there is FEMA disaster assistance, \nwhich is part of this program; then there is brownfield redevelopment \nprograms, which help aid the remediation of environmentally troubled \nareas so they can be redeveloped for use by cities and communities; and \nthen there is the lead hazard reduction grants, which are a critical \nproblem in\n\n[[Page S3237]]\n\nmany parts of this country, particularly urban areas; then there is the \ncommunity development financial institutions fund; the Neighborhood \nReinvestment Corporation; and the Rural Community Advancement Program. \nAll of these programs would see devastating cuts.\n  Let me for a moment talk about some of the particular programs that \nare subject to this very threatening budget resolution. First is the \nCommunity Development Block Grant Program. We are all familiar with \nthis program. It provides grants to States and to communities on a \nformula basis, the type of programmatic initiatives for new housing and \ncommunity development.\n  One of the virtues of this program, one of the reasons it is embraced \nby both sides of the aisle, conceptually, is the fact that it gives \nflexibility to the States and to the cities to decide how they want to \nuse these funds. It is not a mandate from Washington. It is not a \ncategorical program that makes them jump through all sorts of hoops. It \ngives them the flexibility to meet the demands that they deem most \ncritical.\n  These funds have been used to reconstruct and rehabilitate housing \nand provide homeownership assistance and opportunity. In fact, between \n1994 and 1996, over 640,000 housing units have been rehabilitated or \nconstructed with CDBG funds--over 640,000 housing units. These are \nhousing units typically for low-income Americans, for seniors, for \npeople with disabilities. Without this type of investment, I daresay \nthere would not be a lot of construction, particularly in some of the \nolder neighborhoods in our cities and in rural areas. With these funds, \nwe have been able to stimulate the kinds of construction and renovation \nand renewal that are so essential to the fabric of our communities.\n  These funds were also used to provide services related to the \nWelfare-to-Work Program. They are used to help assist in terms of drug \nsuppression, to aid people with drug problems; child care monies are \nused and involved here; crime prevention and education--all of these \nprograms would be subject to severe cuts.\n  They also assist tremendously community-based organizations, those \norganizations in rural areas and urban neighborhoods that are doing the \njob of trying to give people hope and opportunity and also leveraging \nprivate dollars to make sure that what we do has effect, not just here \nin Washington but on the streets of every city and every rural area of \nthis country.\n  This program has many manifestations. In my home State of Rhode \nIsland, in Bristol, they used CDBG money to fund the acquisition of \nbasic medical examination equipment, to set up a clinic and a senior \nhousing facility, providing better health care and doing it in a way \nwhich adds to the quality of life for these seniors.\n  In the State of New Mexico, they boast a new state-of-the-art \nfacility to train students for jobs in high tech. This facility was \nfunded with $600,000 in CDBG money. Again, it illustrates how flexible \nand useful these funds are, because they have been used by local \ncommunities to assist local training programs to meet local demands for \ncertain types of employees. It is a very, very valuable program.\n  In South Carolina, CDBG funds were used for 27 economic development \nprojects in rural areas, including such things as bringing water and \nsewer systems to communities that desperately needed them. Last year, \napproximately 4,000 communities throughout this country benefited from \n$4.6 billion in CDBG funding. Indeed, this funding alone leverages \nadditional private investment. In fact, it has been estimated that for \nevery $1 of CDBG money, there is $3 of private investment. As a result, \nlast year, reasonably and, I think, conservatively, we estimate that \nthe CDBG Program leveraged an additional $18.4 billion in private \nfunds.\n  It also creates jobs, because when you invest in cities, when you \ninvest in rural areas, when you do it in conjunction with other Federal \nprograms, other State programs, you can create jobs. In fact, it has \nbeen estimated that in 1996, CDBG was responsible for creating about \n133,000 jobs.\n  In view of all of this tremendous productivity, efficiency, and \neffectiveness, it seems to me remarkable and counterintuitive, indeed, \nthat we would be cutting this program by about 78 percent, effectively \nrendering it useless.\n  There is another program that should be considered, too. That is the \nsection 108 program. The section 108 program has been very critical to \nmany urban areas in this country because what it does is, it allows \ncities to leverage their annual CDBG funds to borrow additional monies \nto increase the amount of investment dollars they have on hand for \nhousing rehabilitation, for economic development, for public works \nprojects. Indeed, it allows specifically a city or a community to take \ntheir CDBG allotment and leverage that for five times more dollars \nthrough this loan program. Securing their borrowing are the annual \nproceeds of their CDBG allocation.\n\n  I raise the question: What is going to happen to these communities if \nwe slash this funding dramatically? I suggest that their financing \nsituation would be critical. They would either have to find some other \nway to secure these loans, or they would have to immediately pay off \nthese loans or they would be in default. This would be a staggering \nblow to many communities. Ultimately, what it would do, together with \nthe cuts in the overall CDBG Program, it would drive up property taxes \nin many cities and rural areas.\n  The irony here is that we are using billions of dollars to cut \nFederal taxes, with the idea of providing tax relief, which, I think, \nin a way could drive up taxes in certain communities. In fact, we all \nknow the property tax is much more regressive than income tax, than the \nFederal tax. We could have the unintended consequences, for many people \nthroughout this country, of making their tax situation worse, depriving \nthe cities of the opportunity to maintain a tax base, to stabilize it, \nand to attract new business, to attract new investment because of a \nstable tax base. This is absolutely bad policy, and it should be \nrejected.\n  Let us talk about another program that is subject to these draconian \ncuts. That is the Economic Development Administration. This agency \nprovides valuable assistance, again, to States and communities so they \ncan do projects which will accelerate their economic growth and create \nmore jobs. In my home State of Rhode Island, we work closely with the \nEDA to provide funds to help us make the final cleanup and transition \nof a former Navy base, Quonset Point, Davisville, on Narragansett Bay, \nso they can be developed for industrial expansion. Without EDA grants \nto do things like extending sewer lines, taking down an obsolete water \ntower, the State would not be in a position, as it is today, to offer \nthat property for economic development.\n  Again, this is a program which goes right to the direct needs of \ncities to create jobs and to invest in their communities and States and \nto do these types of investments. It would be reduced dramatically.\n  Brownfield redevelopment: We have brownfield redevelopment that is \nabsolutely necessary for the urban areas of this country. It is \nnecessary because we have areas that need environmental remediation, \nnot only to make them more aesthetically pleasing but also to provide \nthe opportunity for reinvestment, redevelopment for jobs; again, to \nstrengthen the urban tax base and to do so in a way that creates jobs, \nincreases the tax base, and also counteracts what is a growing problem \neverywhere, increasing urban sprawl. If we can revitalize and make \nattractive again parcels in center cities for commercial expansion, we \nwill lessen the pressure on suburban areas. This, too, can be done and \nhas to be done in conjunction with many things. One of them is the \nBrownfield Grant Program. That, too, is on the chopping block.\n  Lead hazard reduction grants: In my home State of Rhode Island, we \nhave a major hazard with lead paint and children, a major public health \nproblem, a public health problem that is one I think we are embarrassed \nto admit, but it is there. It is there particularly in older \ncommunities, not just in urban areas but older rural communities.\n  Most of the paint that was created years ago had a lead base. It was \nput up everywhere. Kids now are exposed to that paint and exposed to \nother sources of lead. It has been estimated that nearly 5 percent of \nAmerican children, age 1 to 5, approximately 1 million\n\n[[Page S3238]]\n\nchildren, suffer from lead paint poisoning. That is an outrage in this \ncountry.\n  Our programs to combat it, to reduce it, would be subject to severe \nlimitations, because HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control would not have \nthe resources--the meager resources, I might add--today that they are \nusing to try to help communities reduce the lead hazard throughout this \ncountry.\n  Now, these are just a sample of the programs that would be \neviscerated by this proposed budget resolution, that would be reduced \nover the next 10 years, dramatically, would be rendered perhaps \nineffectual and totally without purpose in many instances. That is why \nI think we have to restore these funds and do so by taking funds away \nfrom the proposed tax cuts that are embedded within this budget \nresolution.\n  There will be some procedural arguments, I am sure, raised about my \namendment, perhaps budget points of order, but really I think what we \nhave to consider here is the substance. We cannot afford to stop \ninvesting in our cities and our rural areas. This budget does precisely \nthat. It says to America's cities and America's rural areas: We are no \nlonger going to invest in you; you are on your own; good luck; but what \nwe are going to do is reduce taxes, Federal taxes.\n  I don't think we should abandon our cities and our rural areas. \nCertainly my amendment could accommodate both--a tax cut, together with \nthe continued investment in the rural areas of America and also in our \nurban centers.\n  I feel compelled to restore these cuts. I feel that the substance of \nthis amendment should triumph over procedural rules that might be \nimposed against it. As we go forward, I hope that others will feel the \nsame way, too, because, frankly, we are charting a course with this \nbudget resolution that would, I think, lead to, if not the ruin of our \ncities and rural areas, certainly it would lead to the lack of progress \nthat we have seen over the last several years.\n  I hope when this amendment is considered that it will be supported as \na way in which we can send clearly a signal to all of our cities and to \nour rural areas: We will not abandon you; we will continue to support \nyou; we will continue to share with you resources that you may use in \nyour wisdom to improve the quality of life of your cities, of your \nrural areas and, in so doing, improve the quality of life of this great \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAPO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we lay aside \nthe pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Crapo], for himself and Mr. \n     Grams, proposes an amendment numbered 163.\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. RESERVE FUND FOR INCREASED ON-BUDGET SURPLUS IN \n                   THE OUTYEARS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Any additional on-budget surplus exceeding \n     the level assumed in this resolution during the period of \n     fiscal years 2001 through 2009 as reestimated by the \n     Congressional Budget Office shall be reserved exclusively for \n     tax relief or debt reduction.\n       (b) Adjustments.--The Chairman of the Committee on the \n     Budget of the Senate may reduce the spending and revenue \n     aggregates and may revise committee allocations by taking the \n     additional amount of the on-budget surplus referred to in \n     subsection (a) for tax relief or debt reduction in the period \n     of fiscal year 2001 through 2009.\n       (c) Point of Order.--\n       (1) In general.--When the Senate is considering a bill, \n     resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report that uses \n     the additional on-budget surplus reserved in subsection (a) \n     for additional Government spending other than tax relief or \n     debt reduction, a point of order may be made by a Senator \n     against the measure, and if the Presiding Officer sustains \n     that point of order, it may not be offered as an amendment \n     from the floor.\n       (2) Supermajority.--This point of order may be waived or \n     suspended in the Senate only by an affirmative vote of three-\n     fifths of the members, duly chosen and sworn.\n       (d) Budgetary Enforcement.--Revised allocations and \n     aggregates under subsection (a) shall be considered for the \n     purposes of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 as \n     allocations and aggregates contained in this resolution.\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased tonight to join with my good friend, \nSenator Grams of Minnesota, in offering an amendment that will help \nprovide taxpayers relief from their tax obligations, as well as debt \nreduction for the American people.\n  Back when Senator Grams and I both served in the House of \nRepresentatives together and, I might add, at the same time we served \nwith you, Mr. President, in the House of Representatives, we noticed a \nvery interesting peculiarity in the budget process: When the House or \nthe Senate reduced spending or adjusted spending downward in the \nbudget, all that really happened was those particular projects or \nprograms were eliminated or reduced, but the spending never was reduced \nand the deficits that we were dealing with at that time never really \nwas reduced.\n  The deficit spending did not end. All that happened was that through \nsome very intricate budget processes, those reductions in spending got \nreallocated to other spending proposals.\n  So we came up with an idea back then called the lockbox. We passed it \nfour times in the House of Representatives as an effort to try to make \nsure that when the House or the Senate reduced spending, that reduced \nspending went to reduce the deficit and was not slid over into or moved \nover into other spending.\n  Now we have reached a point at which we have actually ended the \ndeficits that we were working on 4 or 5 years ago, and we are dealing \nwith surpluses. But the lockbox concept has gained significant support \nand is now proving to be a very valuable tool in dealing with the \nbudget in a surplus climate.\n  Today, we have already adopted a very important lockbox amendment \nrelating to Social Security. It was offered by a number of Senators. \nThe primary sponsor was Senator Abraham. That amendment provided that \nSocial Security surpluses would be locked away in a lockbox and would \nnot be allowed to be spent by Congress on other spending, in essence. \nThat was an important first step.\n  We are now debating many different aspects of a very important \nbudget. There is a debate as to what to do with the Social Security \nsurplus and, as I indicated, we made a big step today in locking up \nthat surplus so that it does not get squandered by Congress in other \nareas. That will stabilize and strengthen the Social Security trust \nfunds.\n  As you know, the debate today, tomorrow, and probably the rest of the \nweek, will show there is a debate underway on whether to reduce the \nnational debt or to engage in significant tax relief for the American \npeople or whether to allocate some of the surplus to those needed and \nimportant areas, such as our national defense or education or Medicare \nand other areas of needed concern.\n  But among that debate, Senator Grams and I believe that it is very \nimportant that we focus on what is going to happen with the surpluses \nin the future.\n  Senator Domenici has shown courage in producing a budget that is \ngoing to protect Social Security, it is going to pay down the public \ndebt, it is going to stay within the budget caps, and it is going to \nprovide an opportunity for needed critical tax relief. But on July 15, \n1999, the Congressional Budget Office is going to update its economic \nand budget forecast for the fiscal year 2000 and beyond.\n  It is our expectation that this report will forecast an onbudget \nsurplus that is even in excess of the current CBO estimates. If this is \ntrue and if that develops and we see even larger surpluses than we are \nnow expecting, and after we have now put together a budget that \nallocates it as we think proper among tax relief, debt retirement,\n\n[[Page S3239]]\n\nneeded spending on the items that I have indicated and protection of \nthe Social Security and Medicare trust funds, and if we still see a \ngrowing surplus, we believe that this unanticipated surplus should be \nset aside, should be put into another lockbox and be authorized to be \nused for only further tax relief or further debt retirement.\n  Our amendment will create a lockbox, a reserve fund in addition to \nthe non-Social Security surpluses so that we lock in the additional \nnon-Social Security surpluses, and in the outyears 2001 through 2009, \nthose additional unexpected surpluses that are non-Social Security \nsurpluses would then be made available to be taken from this lockbox \nonly for tax relief or debt retirement.\n  These excess surpluses could then benefit the American people in the \nbest way possible and would then be protected from further raiding by \nCongress for big spending. These unanticipated surpluses could not be \nused for other types of proposals, and it would guarantee the American \npeople that we would see the retirement of debt or the increase of tax \nrelief as they have been asking for. We have had some other speeches \nrecently on the floor tonight about the critical importance of \nrecognizing the national debt that has grown over the last little \nwhile.\n  The Senator from Ohio talked about his grandchildren, and all of us \nhave talked about the fact that our children and our grandchildren are \ntoday being expected to pay the debt that we have grown over the last \nfew decades. That is wrong. This bill will help assure that these \nunanticipated surpluses, if they develop, will be utilized for that \ndebt retirement.\n  What about the current quality of life? With the tax rates now the \nhighest they have been in a peacetime circumstance in America, the only \ntime tax rates have ever been higher in America is during war. We are \nnow siphoning off from the economy so much for the excessive Federal \nspending that we are jeopardizing the current quality of life of our \nchildren and our grandchildren because their families have to pay such \nheavy and excessive tax burdens.\n  It is these two key problems--the excessive taxes and the excessive \ndebt rate that we have in this country--to which we should dedicate \nthese unanticipated surpluses. Taxes are still too high and still too \ncumbersome and still impact America's working families too heavily. I \nurge all our colleagues to support this needed and valuable amendment. \nIt would utilize the critical lockbox concept to put into place one \nmore parameter on our budget negotiations this year to assure if our \neconomy does stay strong and we see those surpluses in the future we do \nnot now anticipate, that we can set them aside for retirement of our \nnational debt and reduction of the tax burden on all Americans.\n  I yield the floor at this time to my good colleague from Minnesota, \nbecause I know he is here and would like to speak further on this \nissue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise to strongly support the tax relief \nand debt reduction lockbox amendment offered by my good friend, Senator \nCrapo of Idaho. We have worked a long time together, as he mentioned, \nboth in the House and now in the Senate. We need to continue to push \nthese efforts to reduce the tax burdens on Americans.\n  This amendment would lock in any additional non-Social Security \nsurplus into the outyears for tax relief and/or for debt reduction.\n  Before I speak on this amendment, I would like to take this \nopportunity to commend Chairman Domenici for his leadership in crafting \nand delivering this well-balanced budget. I believe this budget \nblueprint is a great achievement of this Congress and it will ensure \nour continued economic growth and prosperity as we move into the next \ncentury.\n  Mr. President, protecting Social Security, reducing the national debt \nand reducing taxes are imperative for our economic security and growth. \nOur strong economy has offered us an historic opportunity to achieve \nthis three-pronged goal.\n  Chairman Domenici has ably showed us in his budget how we can provide \nmajor tax relief while still preserving Social Security and \ndramatically reducing the national debt.\n  President Clinton has proposed to spend over $158 billion of the \nSocial Security surplus in his budget over the next 5 years for \nunrelated Government programs, instead of protecting Social Security.\n  This budget includes a safe-deposit box to lock in every penny of the \n$1.8 trillion Social Security surplus earned in the next 10 years to be \nused exclusively for Social Security.\n  Stopping the Government from raiding the Social Security Trust Fund \nis an essential first step to ensure that Social Security will be there \nfor current beneficiaries, baby boomers and our children and \ngrandchildren. I am pleased that this is the No. 1 priority under this \nbudget.\n  It is also notable, Mr. President, that under this budget, the debt \nheld by the public will be reduced dramatically, much more than what \nPresident Clinton has proposed in his budget.\n  This budget also reserves nearly $800 billion of the projected non-\nSocial Security surplus--the tax overpayments of working Americans--for \ntax relief. This is the largest tax relief that has been enacted since \nthe leadership of President Ronald Reagan.\n  As one who has long championed major tax relief, I am pleased that we \nhave finally achieved some meaningful proposal in reducing our tax \nburden again.\n  Not only does this budget fund all the functions of the Government, \nbut it also significantly increases funding for our budget priorities, \nsuch as defense, for education, for Medicare, for agriculture, and \nothers.\n  In addition, Mr. President, unlike President Clinton's budget, which \nhas broken the spending caps by over $22 billion, this budget maintains \nthe fiscal discipline by retaining the spending caps.\n  There are those who claim we cannot avoid breaking the caps as we \nproceed to reconcile this budget. But I say if we do our job to oversee \nGovernment programs, we will know which areas can be streamlined and \nwhich program funding can be better shifted to new priorities. Let's \nmake sure we do our job to justify all Government funds are wisely \nspent.\n  I am particularly pleased, Mr. President, that this budget has \nincluded one of my proposals which would allow us to lock in for \nimmediate tax relief any additional on-budget surplus as re-estimated \nin July by the Congressional Budget Office of fiscal year 2000.\n  I believe this amendment offered by Senator Crapo and myself is solid \nprotection for the American taxpayers. I thank Chairman Domenici also \nfor including my proposal in his budget as well.\n  As the economy continues to be strong, we may have more revenue \nwindfalls to come in the outyears that are above and beyond what this \nbudget resolution has assumed. We also need to lock in these windfalls \nand we also need to return these tax overpayments to hard-working \nAmericans.\n  The logic for this amendment is fairly simple. Despite a shrinking \nFederal deficit and a predicted on-budget surplus, the total tax burden \non working Americans is at an all-time high. It is still imperative to \nprovide major tax relief for working Americans and address our long-\nterm fiscal imbalances.\n  We need to give back any additional on-budget surplus generated by \neconomic growth to working Americans, and we need to do it in the form \nof tax relief and debt reduction.\n  That is exactly what our amendment intends to achieve. This amendment \nwould lock in any additional non-Social Security surplus--again, not \nSocial Security surplus, but income tax surplus--that may be generated \nin the outyears which exceed the levels assumed under this budget.\n  All we are saying is, if our economic growth produces more increased \nrevenues than we expect, these revenues should be reserved and \nprotected for the taxpayers in the form of tax relief and/or debt \nreduction. It should not be there for the Government to spend it as it \npleases.\n  One question we should ask ourselves before we decide how to spend \nany non-Social Security surplus is where the budget surplus comes from. \nThe CBO has showed us precisely where we will get our revenues in the \nnext 10 years.\n  The data indicates that the greatest share of the projected budget \nsurplus comes directly from income taxes paid\n\n[[Page S3240]]\n\nby the taxpayers. Again, this is their money. There is no excuse not to \nreserve it and then return it to the people who paid it.\n  If we don't lock in this surplus to the taxpayers, we all know that \nWashington will soon spend it all, leaving nothing for tax relief or \nthe vitally important task of maintaining our long-term fiscal health.\n  Such spending will only enlarge the Government. It will only make it \neven more expensive to support in the future. And it will create an \neven higher tax burden than working Americans bear today.\n  Mr. President, I applaud the creation of the safe-deposit box for \nfuture Social Security surpluses to protect retirement security for our \nNation's retirees.\n  But I also believe we need to create a safe-deposit box of a similar \nmechanism to lock in any additional on-budget surplus for tax relief \nand/or debt reduction beyond the fiscal year 2000 re-estimate that is \nin the resolution.\n  The Congressional Budget Office reports that by 2012, we will have \neliminated all the debt held by the public and we will begin to \naccumulate assets. By 2020, the share of net assets to GDP is expected \nto reach 12 percent. This is great news.\n  However, I believe we should use some of the on-budget surplus from \nthe general fund to accelerate debt reduction. Currently we pay about \n$220 billion a year in interest. We saw from Senator Voinovich, in his \ncharts, tonight how much we are spending every year just to pay the \ninterest on the debt.\n  The sooner we eliminate the debt, the more revenue we will have in \nhand to reform Social Security, to reduce our tax burden and to finance \nour priority programs. This amendment will help us to achieve that \ngoal.\n  We have also heard some say that Americans do not want tax relief. I \nhear that often: ``Americans don't want tax relief.'' Clearly they are \ncompletely out of touch with working Americans, and this is not what I \nhear when I listen to Minnesotans when I am at home.\n  A poll conducted by Pew Research Center shows that 53 percent of the \nAmerican people say that the budget surplus should be used for a tax \ncut. Fifty-three percent want a tax cut. Only 34 percent say that it \nshould be used for additional Government programs.\n  An Associated Press poll taken by ICR is even more specific. The \nfollowing question was asked:\n\n       President Clinton and Congress have predicted big budget \n     surpluses in the next few years. Both sides want to set aside \n     more than half of the surplus to bolster Social Security, but \n     they disagree on how to spend the rest.\n\n  The question goes on:\n\n       Which one of the following uses of the remainder of the \n     surplus do you favor most: paying down the national debt, \n     cutting taxes, or spending more on government programs?\n\n  The results of that survey: 49 percent said cutting taxes, 35 percent \nsaid to pay down the debt, and only 13 percent said that they wanted to \nspend more on Government programs.\n  There was another question that was also asked. And the question was:\n\n       Some Republicans want a 10% tax cut for everyone. President \n     Clinton prefers tax credits for specific things like child \n     care or taking care of disabled parents. Which approach do \n     you like better?\n\n  And the answer: 50 percent said they want a 10-percent cut for \neveryone, 44 percent want tax credits for specific things.\n  Mr. President, Americans' message is loud and clear. They want--and \ndeserve--major tax relief.\n  Again, my biggest fear is that without the lockbox, the Government \nwill spend the entire additional on-budget surplus generated by working \nAmericans. Last year's omnibus appropriations legislation was a prime \nexample of how the Social Security surplus was spent by Congress.\n  This year's supplemental threatens to be equally abusive if we cannot \nagree on any offsets.\n  Mr. President, as I conclude tonight, we must protect the interests \nof our taxpayers. We must secure the future for our children's \nprosperity. This amendment would allow families, again, the opportunity \nto keep just a little more of their own money and to provide a good \ndownpayment on debt relief. I urge my colleagues strongly to support \nthis amendment.\n  Thank you very much. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAPO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, for decades Los Alamos, Sandia, and \nLawrence Livermore have attracted the greatest scientists in the world. \nThat has not changed with the end of the Cold War; the knowledge and \nskills in those laboratories are unequaled in the world and the envy of \nthe world--for that reason, others will always try to gain that \ninformation. The directors and scientists have, since the inceptions of \nthe laboratories, been cognizant of the fact that they are the target \nof spying.\n  As we consider how to respond to these recent allegations--and some \nsteps have been taken including: the initiation of an aggressive \ncounter-intelligence program at the laboratories that has had its \nfunding increase substantially in the last 24 months and we have halted \na declassification initiative until its implementation can be \nreviewed--we have to ensure that our actions do not undermine the \nexcellence of the laboratories.\n  Interactions with experts outside the laboratories and outside the \nUnited States are critical to the pursuit of scientific knowledge and \nunderpin the vitality of the laboratories. Cutting off those \ninteractions will cause the capabilities at the laboratories to fade \nwith time until, at some point, no one would spy on our labs there \nwouldn't be anything worthwhile in them.\n  I have been briefed by:\n  The Director of Central Intelligence;\n  The Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation;\n  Department of Energy officials, and others on the recent allegations \nof spying by the Chinese at Los Alamos National Laboratory. I will \nawait the final report of the panel of experts appointed by the \nAdministration before I assess what damage has been done by this latest \nepisode, but some facts are evident.\n  We do know, without doubt, that China's intelligence program against \nthe United States has yielded some results--they have gained access to \nclassified nuclear weapons design information. However, we do not know \nhow much information they have gained or how much that information \nbenefited their nuclear weapons program.\n  I must also say that it is unclear how China gained that information. \nThe Chinese do target our nuclear weapons laboratories, but they also \ntarget other potential sources of the same information including other \nparts of the government, its contractors, and the military branches.\n  It is also unclear how useful information China may have gained, \nabout the W-88 in particular, is to China. The W-88 is extremely \nadvanced; the product of fifty years of our best scientific and \nengineering know-how. In many ways, China's nuclear weapons program is \nnot capable of utilizing the W-88 design.\n  That is not reassuring when you look out over the coming decades, and \nin any case, knowing where our years of work led our designers will \nallow the Chinese to avoid some of the mistakes we made, but the \nChinese do not currently have warheads anything like the W-88.\n  Despite the fact that the Chinese capability today does not come \nanywhere near matching ours, the Chinese nuclear weapons program is \nthreatening. China does share its nuclear weapons technology with \nothers along with its missile technology, and it continues to develop \nmore advanced nuclear weapons designs.\n  Chinese nuclear capabilities threaten its neighbors and limit the \nopportunities to pursue broad arms control\n\n[[Page S3241]]\n\nagreements--for example, Russian negotiations on a START III treaty \nwill be strongly influenced by the growing Chinese capability on \nRussia's eastern border, and India continues to develop more advanced \nnuclear weapons partly in response to China's program.\n  I will say very little about the allegations against a specific \nscientist at Los Alamos. However, given what we know about China's \nintelligence program, it is not unreasonable to assume that scientists \nat all three weapons labs have knowingly or unknowingly been approached \nto provide classified information to China or its intermediaries. The \nlaboratories are cognizant of that threat. Frankly, I don't know if the \nsteps the laboratories, working with the Department of Energy and the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation, are taking are sufficient to prevent \nespionage at our laboratories.\n  I have met with Director Freeh I, and he assures me that the FBI is \ndoing all it can in this regard. I am certain that, no matter what \nsteps we take, the Chinese and others will continue their efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/24/senate-section/article/S3241-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, Francesco Ghebresillassie plans to retire \nafter 32 years of service to the Senate. That is quite a record, and it \ndeserves notices from those of us who depend so heavily upon--and are \nnever disappointed by--Gheib and the men and women who work with him.\n  Since 1987, he has been Manager of the Production Services Branch of \nCentral Operations under the Sergeant at Arms. In that role, he has \nsupervised all the activities of the Micrographics and Production \nServices sections. He came to that post step by step, working his way \nfrom machine operator to computer operator to shift supervisor. By \n1975, he was responsible for two work shifts and for the operations in \ntwo buildings.\n  Thereafter, as Hardware Manager, he was responsible for keeping the \nSenate current with technological changes in the computer arena, \nrefining our procedures, and working with vendors. Later on, as User \nSupport Manager and Production Services Manager, he emphasized quality \nservice to the staff who sit at the thousands of computers within our \nSenate offices. He has been responsible for interaction with them, and \nhas improved the tech support they have needed to deal with the rapid \npace of change in the cyber world. Gheib has also supervised the staff \nwho maintain our microfilm documents for posterity.\n  Needless to say, today's Senate is quite a different institution from \nthe one to which Gheib came in 1967. One of the ways it has changed for \nthe better has been the technological modernization of which Gheib has \nbeen a part. Because of his labors, and the diligence of those who have \nworked with him over the years, we have been able to better serve the \nfolks back home in ways that were not possible three decades ago.\n  As we congratulate Gheib on his retirement, I want to also \nacknowledge his wife, Theresa, who works for our colleague from \nWisconsin, Senator Kohl. We wish for them and for their daughters, Lisa \nand Ayesha, all the good things the future can bring.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/24/senate-section/article/S3241-4", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CONNIE SULLIVAN RETIRES\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, Connie Sullivan, who has served as \nReprographic Manager in the Service Department since 1989, plans to \nretire in June. This will be a significant loss for the Senate. For the \npast decade, she has been responsible for all phases of the \nReprographics Division--more recently known as Printing, Graphics, and \nDirect Mail--within the Sergeant at Arms office.\n  Connie has been with the Senate for 24 years. She came here in \nFebruary, 1975 from the House of Representatives as a Composer \nTechnician in the newly created ``Composing Room,'' which was part of \nthe Printing Section of our Department. You can imagine the \ntechnological changes Connie has seen since then, when she was asked to \nassume the duties of Composer with oversight for all the typesetting \nand layout functions of the Composing Room.\n  In the restructing of the Service Department in 1984, when the \nComposing Room became the Pre-Press Section, Connie was promoted to \nsupervisor. In a subsequent reorganization in 1986, she was again \npromoted to Operations Branch Head. That was a well-deserved \nrecognition of her long experience with the growth and integration of \nservices and, especially, the development of the Pre-Press section from \nconventional typesetting and layout to desk-top publishing and a full-\ncolor graphics operations.\n  In that regard, Connie has been one of the people who have helped the \nSenate enter fully into the information age. We are able to keep in \ncloser touch with our constituents, and they with us, and that has a \npositive impact on just about everything we do here.\n  So on behalf of the Senate, I want to thank Connie for all her years \nof service and wish her many happy years of time with her family, her \ngarden, and the enduring satisfaction of a job well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/24/senate-section/article/S3241-5", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3241-S3242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RUSSELL JACKSON RETIRES\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, there are today only four Senators who were \nhere in 1965 when Russell Jackson first came to the Senate to work as \nan elevator operator. He has observed this institution, both its \nchanges and its continuity, for a long, long time. Now, as he retires \nas Senior Manager of Central Operations, I want to thank him, on behalf \nof the entire Senate, for a lifetime of service.\n  Early on, Russell interrupted his work here for a different kind of \nservice, in the U.S. Army, but he returned to the Senate to work with \nthe Office of the Superintendent. Within that Office, he worked his way \nup the ladder by doing it all: evening shift, day shift, staff \nassistant, supervisor, office manager, and senior service officer.\n  Within the confines of the Senate family, we all know how important \nis the coordination of office moves, the\n\n[[Page S3242]]\n\nmaintenance of our furniture inventory, and all the other operations of \nthe Superintendent's Office. Russell had a hand in it all, and also \nserved as liaison between the Superintendent and our Senate offices.\n  Since 1987, Russell has been Director of the Service Department, a \ndivision that is little known to the outside world but so essential to \nall of us in the Senate. His leadership there brought technological \nchanges to meet the Senate's increasing demands for charts, graphs, \nexhibits, and the enormous amount of daily work that keeps our offices \nin contact with constituents and the media. At the same time, he \nupdated personnel practices to boost both productivity and morale, and \nto open advancement opportunities through an evaluation process and \ncross training for staff.\n  The Senate, and the constituents whom we are here to serve, owe him a \ndebt of gratitude. And I know my colleagues join me in wishing him a \nwonderful retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/24/senate-section/article/S3242-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 KOSOVO\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, at this moment, U.S. forces under NATO \ncommand are conducting air strikes against Serbia. And they have my \nfull support and endorsement as they go into battle. We all hope that \nbombing Serbia ends the cycle of violence between the Serbs and ethnic \nAlbanians in that region.\n  Yesterday, I voted against authorizing the use of force because the \nPresident refused to explain to Congress and the American people how \nhis goals would be achieved by bombing, and what our plan would be \nafter the bombing stops--if Milosevic refuses to yield. I still do not \nsee how bombing Serbia will bring about peace or end the atrocities \nbeing committed. I do not see how bombing Serbia will lead to the \nAdministration's goals of greater political autonomy to Kosovo, the \nwithdrawal of most Serbian military forces, protection of minorities, \nand a more equitable ethnic representation among local police. That \nbeing said, I fully support our troops and I'm confident they will \ncarry out their mission successfully.\n  We should all support our troops and hope that we have not started \ndown a slippery slope where the President insists that in order to \nprotect our credibility or NATO's credibility we have to send in U.S. \nground troops. The U.S. officially recognizes that Kosovo is part of \nSerbia, which along with Montenegro, forms the sovereign state of the \nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia. And Yugoslav President Slobodan \nMilosevic has made it clear that Serbia does not want foreign troops on \nits soil. President Clinton, however, is bombing Serbia in order to \nforce Serbia to agree to a peace accord which U.S. troops would be put \non the ground to enforce--as an occupation force, not a peacekeeping \nforce.\n  There is an ongoing civil war between the Serbs and the ethnic \nAlbanians and the combatants have not exhausted their will to fight. So \nwhen the President talks about sending 4,000 American military men and \nwomen to Kosovo, he is talking about making peace not keeping peace. \nThe Kosovo Liberation Army is fighting for independence; the Serbs are \nfighting for complete control by Belgrade. While the Kosovars have \naccepted the U.S.-supported plan, neither side enthusiastically \nembraces the U.S.-supported plan of limited autonomy. This is a recipe \nfor disaster.\n  The President's decision to use NATO to attack Serbia fundamentally \nchanges the nature of NATO. NATO has never attacked a country that has \nnot threatened its neighbors or a member of the alliance. I do not \nthink we should fundamentally change the nature of one of the most \nsuccessful military alliances in history without a debate.\n  Mr. President, I support our troops. And the best way that I can \nsupport them at this time is to declare that I will do everything in my \npower to make sure that U.S. troops are not put on the ground in \nKosovo.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/24/senate-section/article/S3242-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO CAPTAIN DOROTHY C. STRATTON\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President I rise today to recognize the \noutstanding accomplishments and distinguished service of Captain \nDorothy C. Stratton, U.S. Coast Guard Reserve (Ret), on this her 100th \nbirthday. She has served her country with honor as an educator, naval \nofficer and public official.\n  Born in Brookfield, Missouri, Captain Stratton earned a Bachelor of \nArts from Ottawa University in Ottawa, Kansas; a Master of Arts in \nPsychology from the University of Chicago; and a Doctorate of \nPhilosophy in Student Personnel Administration from Columbia \nUniversity. Captain Stratton joined Purdue University as the Dean of \nWomen and Associate Professor of Psychology in 1933, becoming a full \nprofessor in 1940.\n  In June, 1942, with our nation embroiled in war, Professor Stratton \nleft Purdue to join the Women Appointed Volunteer Emergency Service \n(WAVES). She was assigned as the Assistant to the Commanding Officer of \nthe U.S. Naval Training Station in Madison, Wisconsin. Due to the \nmilitary's pressing need for personnel, Congress authorized the Women's \nReserve of the U.S. Coast Guard. The Act creating the Women's Reserve \nwas signed into law by President Roosevelt on November 23, 1942, and \nwithin hours, Stratton became the first director of the new \norganization. She was the first female officer accepted for service in \nthe history of the U.S. Coast Guard. She rose from Lieutenant Commander \nto the rank of Commander on January 1, 1944 and to the rank of Captain \none month later.\n  One of Captain Stratton's first acts as Director of the U.S. Coast \nGuard Women's Reserve was to coin the famous name that would \ndistinguish them from the Navy WAVES and the Army WACS. In a memo to \nthe Commandant ADM Russell R. Waesche, Stratton explained: ``The motto \nof the Coast Guard is `Semper Paratus--Always Ready.' The initials of \nthis motto are of course, SPAR. Why not call the members of the Women's \nReserve SPARS? . . . As I understand it, a spar is often a supporting \nbeam and that is what we hope each member of the Women's Reserve will \nbe.'' Admiral Waesche agreed, and the rest, as they say, is history.\n  Captain Stratton led over 10,000 volunteers who responded to their \nnation's call for help between 1942 and 1946. She completed her service \nas Director of the SPARS in January, 1946 and was awarded the Legion of \nMerit. She then served as Director of Personnel for the International \nMonetary Fund from 1946 to 1950, and as the National Executive Director \nof the Girl Scouts of America from 1950 to 1960.\n  Mr. President, I wish to congratulate Captain Dorothy Stratton and to \nthank her for all she has done for this great country of ours. She is a \nshining example to us all, and it is truly a pleasure to wish her a \nhappy birthday today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/24/senate-section/article/S3242-3", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/24/senate-section/article/S3242-4", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3242-S3243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:00 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills and joint resolutions, in which it requests \nthe concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 4.

A bill to assist in the enhancement of the security of \nTaiwan, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations\n\n\n                    TAIWAN SECURITY ENHANCEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, today on behalf of the distinguished \nSenator from New Jersey, Mr. Torricelli, and myself, I am sending to \nthe desk a bill entitled ``The Taiwan Security Enhancement Act.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be received.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  This bill is to do the best we can to ensure that the United States \nis fulfilling its obligations to the Republic of China as specified by \nthe Taiwan Relations Act.\n  Mr. President, this has been done reasonably well for about 20 years, \nbut recent trends disclose the need for efforts by the United States to \nbe stepped up, hence the introduction of this bill by Senator \nTorricelli and\n\n[[Page S3247]]\n\nme. There will undoubtedly be further additions to the sponsorship of \nthis bill. In any case, as you know, the Pentagon, last month, \ndelivered to the Congress a report entitled ``The Security Situation in \nthe Taiwan Straits.'' Frankly, I found this report exceedingly \ndisturbing.\n  For openers, the report stated that Red China has been and will \ncontinue to deploy a large number of missiles directly across the \nstrait from Taiwan. In fact, according to media reports, China already \nhas more than 150 such missiles aimed at Taiwan and plans to increase \nthe number to 650 during the next few years.\n  Taiwan has virtually no defenses against such missiles. In 1995 and \n1996, Red China proved beyond a shadow of a doubt a willingness to use \nthese missiles, at a minimum to intimidate Taiwan.\n  I think Americans should also be concerned about Chinese missiles. In \nlate November, the Chinese People's Liberation Army conducted exercises \nconsisting of mock missile attacks on United States forces in South \nKorea and in Japan. The Pentagon report, to which I just referred, also \nmakes clear that mainland China's vast quantitative edge over Taiwan in \nnaval and air power, coupled with China's ongoing modernization drive, \nwill prove overwhelming in any sort of military confrontation. The \nPentagon report concluded that Taiwan's future success in deterring \nChinese aggression will be--and I quote from the report--``dependent on \nits continued acquisition of modern arms, technology and equipment and \nits ability to deal with a number of systemic problems'' such as \nlogistics.\n  This is precisely where the United States had better step in, Mr. \nPresident, because the United States is the only power in the world \nthat can assure that Taiwan can continue to acquire the weapons it \nneeds and deal with its systemic problems.\n  The question is, Will we do it? Communist China has coupled its \nmilitary buildup and threats against Taiwan with increased pressure on \nthe United States to limit or to cease our arms sales to Taiwan. This \nis reminiscent of 1982 when the Reagan administration yielded to \nChinese pressure and mistakenly agreed to limit and gradually reduce \nour arms sales to Taiwan in the regrettable August communique.\n  President Clinton, similarly, last summer caved in to Beijing's three \nnoes--no, no, no. Will arms sales to Taiwan be sacrificed next? I put a \nquestion mark after it because I hope the administration will recover \nfrom its lack of foresight of last summer.\n  In any event, if one listens to administration officials, who somehow \nseem incapable of commenting on arms sales to Taiwan without mentioning \nthe 1982 communique, or the administration's refusal to sell submarines \nto Taiwan on the flimsy pretext that those submarines are offensive, I \nthink one will get some idea of where the United States arms sales to \nTaiwan will be if we do not now stand steadfast.\n\n  Let me explain. Sections 3(a) and 3(b) of the Taiwan Relations Act \ncompel us, oblige us, to provide defensive arms to Taiwan based solely \nupon the judgment of the United States regarding Taiwan's needs, \nmeaning that Beijing's opinion doesn't count. Given China's threatening \nmilitary buildup, it is unlikely that Taiwan's legitimate needs are \ngoing to go down soon. Nor should U.S. arms sales go down, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Moreover, it is high time to begin a discussion of whether the United \nStates ought to be doing more in the way of exchanges in training and \nplanning with Taiwan's military. The Taiwan military has operated in \nvirtual isolation for 20 years, and this has certainly contributed to \nsome of the systemic problems alluded to in the Pentagon report, to \nwhich I referred just a moment ago.\n  Taiwan's military does not exercise with us. They do not plan with \nus. When the Red Chinese missiles were flying over Taiwan in 1996 and \nour carriers went to the strait, the Taiwan military had no direct or \nsecure way of communicating with the United States fleet, none \nwhatsoever. The question is, Do we want to be stuck in that situation \nagain? While the Secretary of Defense and other top officials can rub \nelbows in Beijing and possibly have champagne, the State Department \nprevents any other officer above the rank of colonel setting foot on \nTaiwan.\n  In addition to being outrageous, this cannot help having a corrosive \neffect on our joint ability to deter conflict in the Taiwan Strait over \ntime.\n  All of this is why I have introduced, with Senator Torricelli, the \nTaiwan Security Enhancement Act, which has three main thrusts. Let me \nbriefly identify each of them.\n  One, the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act seeks to ensure that our \nfriends in Taiwan will have the necessary equipment to maintain their \nself-defense capabilities as required by the Taiwan Relations Act. It \ndoes this by prohibiting any politically motivated reductions in arms \nsales to Taiwan pursuant to the 1982 communique and by authorizing the \nsale to Taiwan of a broad array of defense systems, including missile \ndefense systems, satellite early warning data, diesel submarines, and \nadvanced air-to-air missiles.\n  Secondly, the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act, which I have just \nintroduced, seeks to bolster the process for defense sales to Taiwan. \nThe bill does this in several ways. It requires an increase in staffing \nat the currently overworked technical section at the American Institute \nin Taiwan. It also requires the President to report to Congress \nannually on Taiwan's defense requests and to justify any rejection or \npostponement of arms sales to Taiwan.\n  These actions are not currently taken and the President and the \nCongress need to get more involved in the process, precisely as the \nTaiwan Security Enhancement Act, which I just introduced, will require.\n  Third, the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act will redress some of the \ndeficiencies in readiness resulting in part from the 20-year isolation \nof Taiwan's military. This will be achieved by supporting Taiwan's \nincreased participation at United States defense colleges, requiring \nthe enhancement of our military exchanges and joint training, and \nestablishing direct communication between our respective militaries.\n  All of this will merely implement section 2(b)(6) of what? It will \nimplement the Taiwan Relations Act, which calls for the United States--\nnot Taiwan, but the United States--to maintain a capacity to resist any \nresort to force or coercion that would jeopardize Taiwan.\n  How can we maintain that capacity over the long run if we can't even \ncommunicate with Taiwan's military--obviously, we can't--or if we do \nnot do joint planning and training with Taiwan's military?\n  I can hear it now. Some are going to say this is provocative. They \nwill claim that doing these things will upset the United States \nrelationship with China. This is true. The Red Chinese won't like this \nbill. But I think we all know, Mr. President, that many of the things \ncalled for in this legislation must be done at the earliest possible \ntime.\n  China's behavior--let me be clear--mainland China's behavior is a \nclear warning that it is time for the United States to be much more \nserious about maintaining a posture of deterrence in the western \nPacific and in protecting our loyal, long-time friends in the Republic \nof China on Taiwan.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAMM (for himself and Mrs. Hutchison):\n  S. 694. A bill to authorize the conveyance of the Naval Weapons \nIndustrial Reserve Plant No. 387, Dallas, Texas; to the Committee on \nArmed Services.\n\n\n   CONVEYANCE OF THE NAVAL WEAPONS INDUSTRIAL RESERVE PLANT NO. 387, \n                             DALLAS, TEXAS\n\n   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, along with Senator Kay Bailey \nHutchison, I am introducing legislation today which will authorize the \nSecretary of the Navy to transfer ownership of the property known as \nthe Naval Weapons Industrial Reserve Plant #387, located in Dallas, \nTexas, to the City of Dallas. This legislation allows the Navy to \ndivest itself of property no longer needed to accomplish the Navy's \nmission, while enabling the City of Dallas to maintain and develop the \nfacilities in the best interests of the citizens of the Metroplex.\n  The Navy Weapons Plant in Dallas is adjacent to Naval Air Station \nDallas, which was closed by the Base Closure and Realignment Commission \nof 1993. Years ago, the work performed at the plant directly supported \nthe Navy and its missions, but today, the Navy no\n\n[[Page S3248]]\n\nlonger needs the facility. With all of our military services struggling \nto meet today's unprecedented number of peacekeeping, humanitarian \nassistance, and sanctions enforcement operations, the Navy and the \ntaxpayer cannot afford to maintain a facility that is no longer needed. \nThe legislation I introduce today relieves the Navy of the costs of \nownership while ensuring that the citizens of North Texas are allowed \nto use the facilities for public benefit.\n  The bill will permit the City of Dallas to continue its special \nrelationship with Northrop Grumman Corporation, the current contract \ntenant. Northrop Grumman utilizes the facility primarily to manufacture \ncommercial aircraft components and systems. As one of America's premier \naerospace and defense companies, Northrop Grumman's operations in \nDallas are vital to our national economy and security, as evidenced by \ntheir annual economic impact of $840 million. Northrop Grumman's \ncurrent operations at the plant provide direct employment for 5,600 \nTexas workers, while another 16,800 indirect jobs are created in the \nmetropolitan area. This bill gives the City of Dallas the opportunity \nto assure the continuation of jobs, growth, and opportunity at the \nplant when the Navy leaves the area. This is precisely the kind of \npublic-private partnership that will be the foundation for prosperity \nin the future. I ask my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 694\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \nestablish a national cemetery for Veterans in the Atlanta, Georgia, \nmetropolitan area; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n legislation to establish a national cemetery for veterans in Atlanta, \n                                Georgia\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, today I am pleased to offer an \nimportant piece of legislation designed to address a critical need of \nGeorgia's veterans and their families.\n  One of the greatest honors our country provides for a veteran's \nservice is the opportunity to be buried in a national cemetery. It is \nlogical that a veteran's family would want to have the grave site of \ntheir loved one close by. They want to be able to place flowers or a \nfolded American flag by the headstone of their father, mother, sister \nor brother. Georgia veterans' families deserve such consideration. The \nestablishment of a new veterans national cemetery in the Atlanta \nmetropolitan area is one of my highest legislative priorities.\n  The current veterans population in Georgia is estimated to be nearly \n700,000, with over 400,000 residing in the Metro Atlanta area. One \nstate currently has two cemeteries designated specifically for \nveterans, in Marietta and Andersonville. Marietta National Cemetery has \nbeen full since 1970, and Andersonville National Historic Cemetery is \nlocated in southwest Georgia, at a considerable distance from most of \nthe states veterans population.\n  The large population of veterans' families in Metro Atlanta and North \nGeorgia is not being served, and we need to change that. Abraham \nLincoln once said: `All that a man hath will he give for his life; and \nwhile all contribute of their substance the soldier puts his life at \nstake, and often yields it up in his country's cause. The highest \nmerit, then, is due to the soldier.'\n  We owe it to our veterans to provide a national veterans cemetery \nclose to their home.\n  I have been pursuing this matter for over 20 years, since I was head \nof the Veterans' Administration, now called the Department of Veterans' \nAffairs. Nationally, there are over 300,000 vacancies in national \ncemeteries for veterans, but in Georgia, there are no such vacancies. \nThe only option these veterans have in Andersonville, a national \nhistoric cemetery which is operated by the National Parks Service, not \nthe VA, and is more than 100 miles away from the Metro Atlanta area. \nThis deeply concerns me, especially when one considers that Georgia has \nthe highest rate of growth in terms of military retirees in the Nation, \nand that the majority of these veterans reside in Metro Atlanta. We \nreally must do better for our veterans.\n  In 1979, when I was head of the VA, our studies documented that the \nAtlanta metropolitan are was the area having the largest veterans \npopulation in the country without a national cemetery. Later that same \nyear, I announced that Metro Atlanta had been chosen as the site for a \nnew VA cemetery, which was to be opened in late 1983. The Atlanta \nlocation was chosen after an exhaustive review of many\n\n[[Page S3249]]\n\nsites, including consideration of environmental, access, and land use \nfactors, and most importantly, the density of veterans population. \nUnfortunately, the Reagan Administration later withdrew approved of the \nAtlanta site. Over the years since then, Atlanta has repeatedly been \none of the top areas in the United States most in need of an additional \nnational cemetery.\n  Mr. President, the bill I am introducing today is simple. It requires \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs to establish a national cemetery in \nthe Atlanta metropolitan area. It also requires the VA to consult with \nappropriate federal, state, and local officials to determine the most \nsuitable site.\n  I believe this bill is a necessary first step toward the eventual \nestablishment of a national cemetery to meet the needs of Atlanta's \nveterans and their families. Admittedly, several factors must be \nresolved before the cemetery can be established. A site must be found \nand funding must be made available. However, we must move swiftly to \nresolve this problem so that a critical element of our commitment to \nthe Nation's veterans can be met.\n  I am hopeful that the Senate will take favorable action on my bill \nduring this Congress. I want to thank my colleague from Georgia, \nSenator Coverdell, for joining me in this important effort, and \nRepresentative Barr for sponsoring the companion bill in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 695\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ESTABLISHMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall \n     establish, in accordance with chapter 24 of title 38, United \n     States Code, a national cemetery in the Atlanta, Georgia, \n     metropolitan area to serve the needs of veterans and their \n     families.\n       (b) Consultation in Selection of Site.--Before selecting \n     the site for the national cemetery established under \n     subsection (a), the Secretary shall consult with--\n       (1) appropriate officials of the State of Georgia and local \n     officials of the Atlanta, Georgia, metropolitan area; and\n       (2) appropriate officials of the United States, including \n     the Administrator of General Services, with respect to land \n     belonging to the United States in that area that would be \n     suitable to establish the national cemetery under subsection \n     (a).\n       (c) Report.--As soon as practicable after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to Congress \n     a report on the establishment of the national cemetery under \n     subsection (a). The report shall set forth a schedule for \n     such establishment and an estimate of the costs associated \n     with such establishment.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, today I am proud to join my esteemed \ncolleague from Georgia, Senator Cleland, to introduce once again a very \nimportant piece of legislation authorizing a new National Cemetery in \nthe Atlanta, Georgia, metropolitan area. For many years Georgia has had \na pressing need for a new national cemetery for veterans. With the \nleadership of my friend from Georgia who, I might add, has been working \nto make this a reality for about twenty years, we hope to pass this \nbill this year for our nation's veterans.\n  Mr. President, Georgia has one of the fastest growing veterans \npopulations in the country. Currently, about 700,000 veterans call \nGeorgia home with well over half, about 440,000, living in the Metro-\nAtlanta region; the area where this new cemetery would be built. \nHowever, the only national cemetery in the area has been full since \n1970. Furthermore, the only other veterans cemetery in the state is \noperated by the National Parks Service, not the Department of Veterans' \nAffairs, and is in Andersonville, a town in southwest Georgia far from \nthe concentration of Georgia veterans.\n  Mr. President, I believe we clearly demonstrate the need for a new \nnational cemetery in Georgia. VA studies have concurred the need for \nthis cemetery and, in fact, Atlanta was chosen as a site for a new \ncemetery in 1983. It is now time to build this needed tribute.\n  Burial in a national cemetery is a deserving honor for our nation's \nveterans, but it is becoming increasingly difficult to bestow upon \nthem, especially in Georgia. This bipartisan legislation seeks to \nremedy this situation. Mr. President, by focusing on areas across the \ncountry with pressing needs for more burial slots, Congress can \nincrease access to the honor of burial in a national cemetery.

By passing this measure, Congress would help veterans, \nand their families, find a burial place befitting their patriotic \nservice to this great land.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE:\n  S. 696. A bill to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nto submit to Congress a plan to include as a benefit under the medicare \nprogram coverage of outpatient prescription drugs, and to provide for \nthe funding of such benefit; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n            medicare prescription drug coverage act of 1999\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Medicare \nPrescription Drug Coverage Act of 1999, a bill that calls for a full \nprescription drug benefit for all of America's senior citizens within \nthe Medicare program.\n  This bill is the Senate companion to H.R. 886, which was introduced \nby Congressman Barney Frank of Massachusetts earlier this month and \nwhich already has 22 House cosponsors.\n  One of the beauties of the Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage Act of \n1999 is its simplicity. The Act does four things. First, it directs the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to study the establishment of an \noutpatient prescription drug benefit under Medicare that provides for \nfull coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Second, the Secretary \nwill determine the sufficiency of the estate tax to fund the costs of \nthat outpatient drug benefit. Third, the Secretary must submit a report \nto Congress within six months that includes a legislative proposal to \nprovide for full coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Finally, \nthe bill transfers Federal estate tax revenues to the Medicare Hospital \nInsurance Trust Fund where those monies will be placed in a separate \nOutpatient Prescription Drug Account to pay for this coverage.\n  Mr. President, now more than ever, a Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit is needed. When Medicare was first adopted the program was \ndesigned to reflect typical private health insurance which often did \nnot include outpatient prescription drugs. Then and since, the \npharmaceutical industry has opposed a prescription drug benefit in \norder to protect its profits without regard to America's senior \ncitizens. Even today, the industry is unwilling to shed some of its \nprofits to allow all senior citizens access to needed prescription \ndrugs. But the time has come for Congress to say ``no'' to the undue \ninfluence of drug companies in Washington and ``yes'' to Medicare \nprescription drug coverage.\n  Why has the need for the Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage Act of \n1999 because so acute? The reasons are well known. First, the cost of \nprescription drugs has skyrocketed in recent years. Last year alone, \nprices increased an estimated 17%. This increase in drug costs hits \nseniors disproportionately.\n  A 1998 study by the minority staff of the House Government Reform \nCommittee found that older Americans without prescription drug \ninsurance pay on average twice as much as the discounted prices drug \ncompanies offer large scale purchasers like HMOs, pharmaceutical \nbenefit managers and government agencies. Even more astounding are \ncomparisons that show the price of some drugs are up to 15 times higher \nfor seniors. Recalcitrance on the part of the pharmaceutical industry \nand the Congress has not only forced seniors to the pay for drugs out \nof their own pockets, but the price seniors pay is a national disgrace.\n  The burden on seniors is hard for them to avoid. More than \\3/4\\ of \nAmericans aged 65 and over are taking prescription drugs. The average \nsenior citizen takes more than four prescription drugs daily and fills \nan average of 18 prescriptions a year. Older Americans take \nsignificantly more drugs on average than the under-65 population. One-\nthird of all drugs are prescribed for senior citizens even though \nseniors account for only 12% of the population.\n  Not only do older Americans spend almost three times as much of their \nincome (21%) on health care as do those under the age of 65 (8%), but \nprescription drugs are the largest single source\n\n[[Page S3250]]\n\nof out-of-pocket expenses for health services paid for by the elderly--\nmore than doctor visits or hospital admissions. The primary reason for \nthis is that Medicare does not cover outpatient prescription drugs.\n  It is totally unacceptable that 37% of seniors, nationally, have no \nprescription drug coverage and another 15-20% have totally inadequate \ncoverage. In my state of Minnesota, where Medicare HMO drug coverage \nwithout additional cost is virtually nonexistent, close to 65% of \nseniors have no outpatient drug coverage at all.\n  The result of this drug pricing inequity and excessive cost burden \nfrequently leads seniors to discontinue their medications against \nmedical advice, to lower the dose they take to make their prescriptions \nlast longer, or to take their medicines as prescribed but then skimp on \nfood and other necessities. Whichever path is taken results in a \ndecrease in health and an increased likelihood of an expensive hospital \nintervention. That is why we need the Medicare Prescription Drug \nCoverage Act of 1999. Not to provide this benefit is being penny-wise \nand pound foolish.\n  Minnesota seniors and others who live in states adjacent to Canada \nand Mexico often travel hundreds of miles and cross international \nborders to obtain drugs at prices only available in this country when \nnegotiated by volume purchasers. Mildred Miller, a 78 year old \nconstituent of mine from Minneapolis, found it necessary to travel to \nCanada and to send a friend to Mexico in order to afford the Tamoxifen \nher doctor in Minnesota had prescribed. And she is not alone.\n  For some seniors the high price of outpatient prescription drugs has \nnot yet been a burden. They are the lucky ones who are members of \nMedicare HMOs in counties where the Medicare reimbursement rate to HMOs \nhas been high enough to allow a prescription drug benefit, or are \nfortunate to be wealthy and healthy enough to be able to purchase one \nof the three Medigap policies that include a prescription drug benefit, \nor have drug coverage under health insurance benefits provided by \nformer employers.\n  But for those for whom the high price of drugs has not yet been a \nburden, the future isn't particularly bright. Medicare HMO \nreimbursement rates are being reduced and many HMOs have cut back or \ncompletely cut out their drug benefit. Medigap policies that cover \nprescription drugs are expensive, have high $250 deductibles, 50% \ncopays, and caps on benefits of $1250 or $300 per year. Health care \nbenefits offered by former employers are becoming less and less common \nand less generous.\n  The good alternatives today are out of reach of most senior citizens. \nFor example, in Minnesota, a Medicare-Choice prescription drug coverage \noption with 20% copay, no deductible, and no cap costs $130 per month. \nIt is no wonder that from Maine to Minnesota to the state of Washington \nand down to Texas, America's senior citizens are forced to leave the \ncountry so they can afford to take the medicines they need. What they \nfind are essentially the same prescription drugs at half of price. With \nthe Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage Act of 1999, they won't have to \nflee their own country.\n  What is needed is a comprehensive prescription drug benefit that \nincludes outpatient drugs--the same sort of prescription drug benefit \navailable to members of Congress--with no cap, reasonable deductibles \nand reasonable copays. That is what this legislation calls for.\n  An important aspect of the Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage Act of \n1999 is that it calls for a full prescription drug benefit--not one \ncapped at a certain limit. Medicare today doesn't limit the number of \nnecessary doctor visits or the number of needed operations--and it \nshouldn't. Prescription drugs now are as critical as those doctor \nvisits or operations and it is unconscionable for necessary drugs not \nto be covered just as fully. If we limit the maximum benefit, we \npenalize the sickest and most frail elderly who have the greatest need \nand require the greatest number of prescription medications.\n  I expect that other Medicare prescription drug bills will be offered \nin this Congress, but I fear they will not provide the full protection \nseniors really need. If you have a major life threatening illness or \nmultiple chronic diseases (something that is hard to predict before it \nhappens), your monthly drug bill will quickly exceed the oft cited \nfigure of a $1500 annual maximum. With such coverage, the sickest and \nmost needy seniors will quickly find themselves out of the benefit. As \nI travel about the state of Minnesota, I frequently hear stories of \nelderly citizens saddled with prescription drug costs in excess of $300 \nper month who are trying to make ends meet on a monthly income of \n$1,000. That is why full drug coverage is so important.\n  What is also important to know is that the cost of providing a full \nprescription drug benefit is affordable and not that much more than the \ncost of a limited benefit. In 1998, the Lewin Group estimated that a \nMedicare prescription drug benefit in 1999 with a $250 deductible, a \n20% copay and a $1500 annual cap would cost $13 billion. The same plan \nwith no annual cap, providing full protection, would cost $17 billion. \nRevenues from the estate tax, which will fund the benefit, are \nestimated to be in the $19 billion to $23 billion range. That is more \nthan enough to provide full coverage the full benefit.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me say a few words about why using the \nestate tax to pay for a Medicare prescription drug benefit makes a lot \nof sense. Many members of Congress have argued that the estate tax is \nno longer needed for general revenue. If so, there is a great deal of \nlogic in using it for a prescription drug benefit under Medicare. The \nestate tax today applies only to individual estates that are worth more \nthan $650,000 and to estates of married couples worth more than $1 \nmillion. Over the next seven years the amount exempt from the estate \ntax will rise to $1 million for individuals and $2 million for couples. \nWell over 90% of the estate tax comes from wealthy individuals who were \n65 or older at the time of their death. Most of these people were \nreceiving medical care and benefiting from Medicare coverage. Thus, \nthis bill recycles back into the Medicare program--for badly needed \nprescription drug coverage for all--money from people who benefited \nfrom their Medicare entitlement but were not in financial need of it. \nThat only makes sense. For it is more important to preserve and expand \nthe Medicare program than it is to provide tax cuts for the richest \nAmericans.\n  Mr. President, it is unconscionable that America's senior citizens \nhave such difficulty obtaining the fruits of the scientific advances \nmade by America's pharmaceutical industry. Every day we delay, millions \nof senior citizens struggle to determine how they will be able to \nafford their next prescription refill. The time to end that struggle is \nnow. That is why I am introducing the Medicare Prescription Drug \nCoverage Act of 1999 today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 696\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, last week, the Senate Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee marked up managed care reform \nlegislation. Unfortunately, this markup was characterized by the \npartisan politics that have plagued this issue for over a year now.\n  I fear that this squabbling shows no signs of letting up, and I \nexpect it to carry over onto the floor of the Senate. The result may be \nno action at all. And that, Mr. President, would be a tragedy. There \nare many individuals who need to be protected from some of the \noutrageous practices of managed care networks, and as long as we argue, \nthey are not being helped.\n  It is time to move beyond the squabbling and get something done. Do \nnot get me wrong. I strongly support and am a cosponsor of the \nPatients' Bill of Rights Act, introduced by Senator Dashcle. I have no \nintention of renouncing my support for this excellent bill. Many of its \nprovisions are based on a bill I introduced in 1997.\n  But, I do believe that we need to start reaching across the aisle to \nfind common ground in those areas where this is agreement. So, today, I \nam introducing, along with Senator Snowe, the Women's Access to Care \nAct--to guarantee that women in managed care plans can designate their \nob/gyn as their primary care physician.\n  Let me tell you, Mr. President, why this bill is so important, and I \nwill start with this basic fact: Many women consider their ob/gyn their \nprincipal doctor. According to a 1993 Gallup Poll, 72 percent of women \nhad a regular physical examination in the previous two years from an \nob/gyn. And, three-fourths of all women object to restricted access to \ntheir ob/gyn.\n  But, managed care companies are not paying attention.\n  Sometimes, a managed care company requires a woman to get a referral \nin order to see her ob/gyn. Or, a managed care plan allows a woman to \nsee an ob/gyn without a referral only under limited circumstances--such \nas for only a few visits each year or for only certain medical \nconditions. Or, a managed care network does not allow a woman's ob/gyn \nto refer her to a specialist.\n  All of these hurdles placed between a woman and her doctor mean that \na woman has to get a referral from another doctor just to see her \ndoctor, and that she must, for all practical purposes, have two \ndoctors.\n  Let me give you an example that will illustrate how absurd this is.\n  A 39-year-old woman--who considers her ob/gyn as her doctor--is in \nthe office for a routine check-up. The ob/gyn discovers a lump in the \nwoman's breast and tells her that she needs to get a mammogram. But, \nbecause the woman is under the age for automatic coverage of \nmammograms, she can only get one if her doctor says it is medically \nnecessary. But, the managed care plan does not consider the ob/gyn as \nthe woman's doctor--even though she does. So, this woman has to go find \na primary care doctor just to get that doctor to okay a mammogram. And, \nthe ob/gyn certainly cannot refer her to a specialist about the lump in \nher breast.\n\n  That, Mr. President, is silly. It makes no sense. And, it is not even \ngood health policy. According to the Commonwealth Fund, a woman whose \nob/gyn is her regular doctor is more likely to have had a complete \nphysical exam, a blood pressure reading, a cholesterol test, a clinical \nbreast exam, a mammogram, a pelvic examination, and a Pap smear.\n  In other words, a woman is more likely to receive the health care she \nneeds when she can see her ob/gyn. Why? Because many woman consider \ntheir ob/gyn their principal doctor.\n  The bill that Senator Snowe and I are introducing today recognizes \nthis fact. The Women's Access to Care Act would provide a woman in a \nmanaged care plan with three options.\n  First, she could designate an ob/gyn as her primary care physician. \nShe would have the same right of access to--and the doctor would have \nthe same right of referral as--any other primary care physician.\n  Second, she could continue the practice common today. That is, she \ncould designate a general practitioner as her primary care physician. \nBut, if she does, she must be allowed to see an ob/gyn without a \nreferral for all routine gynecological care and pregnancy related \nservices. And, the ob/gyn could refer the woman to a specialist for any \nother needed gynecological care.\n  Third, we would say that a woman could designate both an ob/gyn and a \ngeneral practitioner as her primary care provider. Sometimes a woman \nconsiders her ob/gyn as her doctor but does not want to close off \naccess to a general practitioner for other health care needs.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me briefly address what is known as \ndirect access to an ob/gyn. Allowing a woman to go directly to her ob/\ngyn without a referral would be an important step forward. But, keep in \nmind that it is not the full story. Even if the direct access were \nunlimited and unfettered, it would not allow an ob/gyn to refer a woman \nto the specialist she needs. To do that requires allowing an ob/gyn to \nbe designated as a primary care physician.\n  Mr. President, I believe the Women's Access to Care Act is a common \nsense approach that recognizes the reality of the way many women \nreceive--and want to receive--their health care. It is also an \nopportunity to break through the partisan logjam on managed care and \nenact something meaningful to help the women of America.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me and Senator Snowe in this bipartisan \neffort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 697\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to review the suitability and feasibility of \nrecovering costs of high altitude rescues at Denali National Park and \nPreserve in the state of Alaska, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\nhigh altitude rescues at denali national park and preserve in the state \n                               of alaska\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation that would require the Secretary of the Interior to report \nto Congress on the feasibility and desirability of recovering the cost \nto taxpayers of rescuing high altitude climbers on Mt. McKinley in \nDenali National Park and Preserve in the State of Alaska.\n  Mr. President, Denali National Park and Preserve attracts \napproximately 355,000 visitors per year who come to see the wildlife, \nthe grandeur of our State, and to gaze at America's highest peak. Most \nare unaware that while they are taking in the breathtaking vista that \nis Mt. McKinley, there are approximately another 1,100 persons per year \nthat are attempting to attain the 20,320 summit.\n  Climbing Mt. McKinley is certainly no easy walk in the Park. A \ntypical year sees a dozen major rescue incidents and one or two fatal \naccidents. Extreme and unpredictable weather on Mt. McKinley make high \naltitude rescues very dangerous and very expensive.\n  Over the last few years the National Park Service has actively and \nsuccessfully worked to reduce the loss of life and injury to climbers \nwho have attempted to climb this mountain. The NPS spends more than \n$750,000 per year for education; pre-positioning supplies and materials \nat various altitudes on the mountain; the positioning of a special high \naltitude helicopter in the Park; and actual rescue attempts.\n  Just last year the military and the Park Service spent four days and \n$221,818 rescuing 6 sick and injured\n\n[[Page S3253]]\n\nBritish climbers who disregarded warnings and advice from park rangers \nstationed on the mountain. This rescue included what is probably the \nworld's highest short haul helicopter rescue at 19,000 feet and \nentailed a very high level of risk for the rescue team. This is just \none example of many rescues the Park Service conducts each year on Mt. \nMcKinley.\n  Mr. President, I personally do not feel that the American taxpayer \nshould be left with the bill for rescues on this mountain. The Federal \nGovernment does not force these climbers to climb; they engage in this \nactivity voluntarily and with full knowledge of the risks. While I \nadmire the courage and tenacity of mountain climbers, I do not think it \nis fair to divert scarce park funds from services that benefit the \nmajority of park visitors for the purpose of providing extraordinarily \nexpensive services to a small number of users who put themselves in \nharm's way with their eyes wide open. Mountain climbers are a special \nbreed who are proud of their self-sufficiency and independence-- and \nrightly so. For that reason I think they should recognize the simple \nequity of paying their fair share of the public costs of their sport.\n  As a result of a recent field hearing on this issue, I found that \nwhile I have received many letters of support, there are a few stalwart \nindividuals who do not agree with my point of view and have raised some \nlegitimate questions. That is why I want the Secretary of the Interior \nto look at the feasibility and desirability of some sort of a cost \nrecovery system that puts a minimal burden on climbers, whether it be \nan insurance requirement, bonding, or any other proposal. The pros and \ncons of these cost recovery mechanisms need to be carefully explored \nbefore we act.\n  Last but not least, Mr. President, I want the Secretary to evaluate \nrequiring climbers to show proof of medical insurance so that hospitals \nin Alaska and elsewhere are not left holding the bag as they sometimes \nare under present circumstances. It is a good neighbor policy that \nshould be put into effect at the earliest opportunity.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Breaux):\n  S. 699. A bill to protect the public, especially senior citizens, \nagainst telemarketing fraud, including fraud over the Internet, and to \nauthorize an educational campaign to improve senior citizens' ability \nto protect themselves against telemarketing fraud; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n\n           THE TELEMARKETING FRAUD AND SENIORS PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, online consumer purchases are exploding, \nhaving topped more than $8 billion last year. But the goldrush in \ncyberbuying is likely to carry along with it a boom in cyberfraud. As \nwith telemarketing fraud, fraudulent schemes over the Internet are \nincreasingly aimed at seniors--some of our most vulnerable citizens. \nCongress can help head-off this cybercrime by extending our current \ntelemarketing laws to encompass fraud on the Net. That is the purpose \nof the legislation I am introducing today.\n  In response to the staggering $40 billion consumers lose in telephone \nfraud each year, Congress passed the l998 Telemarketing Fraud \nPrevention Act. I strongly supported that effort. The new law builds \nupon the four federal laws enacted since the early 1990s that deal \ndirectly with telemarketing fraud. The 1998 law stiffens penalties for \ntelemarketing fraud by toughening the sentencing guidelines--especially \nfor crimes against the elderly, requires criminal forfeiture to ensure \nthe booty of telemarketing crime is not used to commit further fraud, \nmandates victim restitution to ensure victims are the first ones \ncompensated, adds conspiracy language to the list of telemarketing \nfraud penalties so that prosecutors can find the masterminds behind the \nboiler rooms, and will help law enforcement zero in on quick-strike \nfraud operations by giving them the authority to move more quickly \nagainst suspected fraud.\n  The 1998 law is a good step forward but it's not enough to deal with \ntoday's digital economy. As more Americans--and especially seniors--go \nonline, cyberscams are proliferating. The Congressional crackdown on \ntelemarketing fraud will only encourage cyberscammers to migrate to the \nNet unless the law gets there first. That is the purpose of the \nlegislation I am pleased to introduce today with Senator Baucus.\n  The Telemarketing Fraud and Seniors Protection Act, which I \nintroduced last year as S. 2587, simply extends current law against \ntelemarketing fraud to include the same crimes committed over the \nInternet. The approach expands the existing law applicable to mail, \ntelephone, wire, and television fraud to fraud over the Internet, and \nits enforcement would follow the same division of labor there is today \nbetween the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of \nJustice. The bill would apply the same tough penalties that Congress \nenacted in l998 to cyberscams. The growth of Internet telephony makes \nit more attractive for cyberscammers to set up shop offshore, beyond \nthe reach of U.S. law. My bill would address this problem by allowing \nlaw enforcement to freeze the assets and deny entry to the United \nStates of those convicted of cyberfraud.\n  The bill takes special aim against those attempt to defraud one of \nour most vulnerable groups--our senior citizens. Seniors are the target \nfor more than 50 percent of telemarketing fraud. Although telemarketers \nconvicted of fraud face stiff penalties--a minimum of 5-10 years in \njail and restitution payments to their victims, we also need to better \neducate and inform senior citizens on how to avoid becoming victims of \ntelemarketing fraud in the first place, and how to assist law \nenforcement in catching the perpetrators.\n  The legislation would also authorize the Administration on Aging, \nthrough its network of area agencies of aging, to conduct an outreach \nprogram to senior citizens on telemarketing fraud. Seniors would be \nadvised against providing their credit card number, bank account or \nother personal information unless they had initiated the call \nunsolicited. They would also be informed of their consumer protection \nrights and any toll-free numbers and other resources to report \nsuspected illegal telemarketing.\n  Mr. President, the Federal Trade Commission is off to a good start \nagainst cyberscammers. Some of the operations the FTC has targeted are \nnot companies at all, but merely websites that promise consumers \neverything from huge new consulting contracts to the elimination of bad \ncredit reports. They may use scare tactics to frighten consumers into \nsending important personal financial information and hundreds of \ndollars for services the consumer will never see, or attempt to lure \nconsumers with the promise of helping them cash in on the Internet \nexplosion. The FTC also has a strong operation going against junk e-\nmailers. My legislation will complement and strengthen the FTC's effort \nto target telemarketing fraud over the Internet and especially when \nsuch fraud is aimed at seniors.\n  I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senator Baucus. This \nlegislation is similar to that which Rep. Weygand has introduced in the \nHouse of Representatives. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to \ncosponsor this important legislation, and ask unanimous consent that a \ncopy of the legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 699\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n        TITLE I--TELEMARKETING FRAUD AND SENIORS PROTECTION ACT\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill to amend the National Trails System Act to designate \nthe Ala Kahakai Trail as a National Historic Trail; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                ala kahakai national historic trail act\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, along with my senior colleague from Hawaii, \nSenator Dan Inouye, today I am introducing legislation to authorize \ndesignation of the Ala Kahakai (``Trail by the Sea''), on the Island of \nHawaii, as a National Historic Trail.\n  The Ala Kahakai is the modern name for an approximately 175-mile \nportion of the ancient shoreline footpath, the Ala Loa (``Long \nTrail''), that once circumscribed the island of Hawaii. The Ala Loa \nserved as the major land route connecting more than 600 communities of \nthe island kingdom of Hawaii between the 15th and 18th centuries. It is \nassociated with many prehistoric and historic housing areas, most of \nthe royal centers and temples of the island, a number of major battles, \nand the facilitation of government functions such as tax collection.\n  Of more recent significance, a key section of the trail is associated \nwith the series of events that unfolded between 1779 and 1820 that had \nlasting consequences for Hawaiian cultural evolution: Captain Cook's \nlanding and subsequent death at Kealakekua Bay in 1779; Kamehameha's \nrise to power and consolidation of the Hawaiian Islands under \nmonarchical rule; the death of Kamehameha I in 1819, followed by the \noverthrow of the ancient religious system, the kapu: and, finally, the \narrival of the first Western missionaries in 1820.\n  Interest in preserving this important Hawaiian cultural legacy has \nbeen growing since the 1970s, when the State of Hawaii began developing \nNa Ala Hele (``Trails for Walking''), a proposal for cooperative \nmanagement of the statewide trail system. I 1988, the concept evolved \ninto the Hawaii Statewide Trail and Access System, whose mission is to \ndevelop trail access while conserving Hawaii's environmental and \ncultural heritage.\n  The Na Ala Hele planning process called for the development of a \ndemonstration trail for each of Hawaii's major islands, including a 35-\nmile demonstration trail on the Big Island of Hawaii. In introduced \nlegislation (P.L. 120-361) in 1992 proposing that NPS study whether an \nexpanded, 175-mile version of the Big Island trail, the Ala Kahakai, \nshould be incorporated into the National Trails System.\n  Pursuant to P.L. 120-461, the National Park Service undertook a study \nto evaluate the desirability and feasibility of establishing the Ala \nKahakai as a national trail. In January 1998, after a long process of \nconsultation with federal, state, local authorities and other \ninterests, and after a period of public review, the study (``Ala \nKahakai National Trail Study and Final Environmental Impact \nStatement'') was completed. In August 1998, the Secretary of the \nInterior, with the concurrence of the National Park System Advisory \nBoard, endorsed the study's principle recommendation that the Ala \nKahakai be designated a National Historic Trail.\n  According to the study, the trail meets all of the three criteria for \nhistoric trail designation. To wit: it must be a trail or route \nestablished by historic use and must be historically significant as \nresult of that use; it must be of national significance with respect to \nany of several broad facets of American history, such as trade and \ncommerce, exploration, migration and settlement, or military campaigns; \nand, it must have significant potential for public recreational use or \nhistorical interest based on historic interpretation and appreciation.\n\n[[Page S3255]]\n\n  In addition, the study suggested that the trail not only qualifies \nfor designation as a National Historic Trail, but that it has the \npotential to be designated a National Scenic Trail (although to do so \nwould trivialize its historical and cultural significance) and may well \nbe eligible for the National Register of Historic Places.\n  The study presented four alternatives for the management of the Ala \nKahakai: (a) no action, (b) a national historic trail (continuous), (c) \na state historic trail, and a national historic trail (discontinuous)--\nultimately recommending alternative ``b'' as the best means to preserve \nand restore the trail and maximize public access to the entire route. \nThe preferred alternative assumes recognition of a continuous route \nthat, over time, could become continuous on the ground.\n  It is fairly clear that reestablishing the 175-mile route is \nphysically possible. Although some parts of the trail have been covered \nby lava, eroded by tides, or otherwise sustained damage from natural \nand human processes, these sections can be bridged through recreational \ntrail links. In some cases, the trail can be rebuilt using traditional \nconstruction methods.\n  About half (93 miles, or 53 percent) of the proposed trail is in \nlocal, state, or federal government ownership, and 82 miles cross \nprivate lands. Of the latter, 16 miles have been dedicated, through \nplanning requirements, as public land. Of the remaining 66 miles of \ntrail on private lands, as much as 35 miles are classified as ``ancient \ntrail'' and thus claimable as state-owned under Hawaiian law. For the \nremaining sections of trail that are not ancient trail, or for which \nthe state's claim has been forfeited in some way, landowner \nparticipation would be entirely voluntary.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, \nwhich is key to preserving and interpreting an important Hawaiian \nlegacy that is threatened by time, neglect, and modern activity. The \nAla Kahakai boasts more cultural and historical resources than any \nother trail in the National Trails System. Its designation as a \nnational historic trail would help us preserve one of the most \nimportant and evocative legacies of Hawaii's indigenous history and \nculture. I hope that Congress will act quickly on this measure, to \nensure that the trail can be developed as a resource for all Americans \nto enjoy.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. This measure is supported by State and \nlocal authorities as well as a wide spectrum of community \norganizations. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill, a \nletter of support from Hawaii Governor Ben Cayetano, as well as the \nDepartment of Interior's Record of Decision on this issue be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 700\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

AUTHORIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION.\n\n       Section 5(a) of the National Trails System Act (16 U.S.C. \n     1244(a)) is amended--\n       (1) by designating the paragraphs relating to the \n     California National Historic Trail, the Pony Express National \n     Historic Trail, and the Selma to Montgomery National Historic \n     Trail as paragraphs (18), (19), and (20), respectively; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(21) Ala kahakai national historic trail.--\n       ``(A) In general.--The Ala Kahakai National Historic Trail \n     (the Trail by the Sea), a 175 mile long trail extending from \n     Upolu Point on the north tip of Hawaii Island down the west \n     coast of the Island around Ka Lae to the east boundary of \n     Hawaii Volcanoes National Park at the ancient shoreline \n     temple known as `Wahaulu', as generally depicted on the map \n     entitled `Ala Kahakai Trail', contained in the report \n     prepared pursuant to subsection (b) entitled `Ala Kahakai \n     National Trail Study and Environmental Impact Statement', \n     dated January 1998.\n       ``(B) Map.--A map generally depicting the trail shall be on \n     file and available for public inspection in the Office of the \n     National Park Service, Department of the Interior.\n       ``(C) Administration.--The trail shall be administered by \n     the Secretary of the Interior.\n       ``(D) Land acquisition.--No land or interest in land \n     outside the exterior boundaries of any federally administered \n     area may be acquired by the United States for the trail \n     except with the consent of the owner of the land or interest \n     in land.\n       ``(E) Public participation; consultation.--The Secretary of \n     the Interior shall--\n       ``(i) encourage communities and owners of land along the \n     trail, native Hawaiians, and volunteer trail groups to \n     participate in the planning, development, and maintenance of \n     the trail; and\n       ``(ii) consult with affected Federal, State, and local \n     agencies, native Hawaiian groups, and landowners in the \n     administration of the trail.''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                           Executive Chambers,\n\n                                           Honolulu, July 1, 1998.\n     Subject: Congressional Nomination of the Ala Kahakai National \n         Historic Trail on Hawaii.\n     John J. Reynolds,\n     Regional Director, National Park Service, Pacific West \n         Region, Pacific Great Basin Support Office, San \n         Francisco, CA.\n       Dear Mr. Reynolds: This letter is in regards to the \n     potential inclusion of the historic Ala Kahakai alignment on \n     the island of Hawaii as a part of the National Trail System. \n     Senator Daniel K. Akaka and Senator Daniel K. Inouye \n     introduced federal legislation in 1992, that authorized the \n     National Park Service (NPS) to conduct a National Trail Study \n     and Environmental Impact Statement (NTS/EIS) for the United \n     States Congress, to determine if the Ala Kahakai qualified as \n     a National Historic Trail and to also determine the \n     feasibility of implementing the project.\n       During the NTS/EIS process, NPS conducted four \n     informational meetings on the island of Hawaii to solicit \n     public sentiment on the possible National Trail status and on \n     the four proposed management scenarios identified in the \n     draft NTS/EIS. The final NTS/EIS recommends inclusion of the \n     Ala Kahakai in the National Trail System, through \n     implementation of Alternative B, which establishes NPS \n     administration and oversight of the trail in coordination \n     with the state and county. The State of Hawaii concurs with \n     Alternative B, but with the following concerns: (1) \n     Congressional approval of Ala Kahakai as a National Trail, \n     without the commensurate funding, may actually contribute to \n     the decline of the associated natural and cultural resources \n     due to the probable resulting increase in public demand for \n     access to the trail and related resources, and (2) it is also \n     imperative that the concerns of native Hawaiians and adjacent \n     private landowners are addressed during development of the \n     management plan.\n       I commend the NPS in their treatment of the Ala Kahakai in \n     the NTS/EIS, and support Congressional approval of the \n     National Trail designation. The Ala Kahakai is a very \n     significant cultural and recreational resource, and a formal \n     parthership among all the participating agencies, Hawaiian \n     cultural representatives, landowners, trail user groups and \n     individuals will help to assure the sustainability of this \n     valuable historic trail.\n       With warmest personal regards,\n           Aloha,\n     Benjamin J. Cayetano.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        Final Environmental Impact Statement--Record of Decision\n\n       Summary: Pursuant to Sec. 102(2)(C) of the National \n     Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the regulations \n     promulgated by the Council on Environmental Quality (40 CFR \n     Part 1500), the Department of the Interior, National Park \n     Service has prepared this Record of Decision for the Final \n     Environmental Impact Statement for the National Trail Study \n     for Ala Kahakai. This 175-mile trail is located parallel to \n     the western and southern shoreline of the Island of Hawaii, \n     from Upolu Point on the north to the eastern boundary of \n     Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. This document is a concise \n     statement of decisions made, alternatives considered, basis \n     for the decision, and mitigating measures developed to avoid \n     or minimize environmental impacts.\n\n[[Page S3256]]\n\n       Recommendation: This National Trail Study (Study) and Final \n     Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) were prepared to \n     provide the United States Congress and the public with \n     information about the resources in the study area and how \n     they relate to criteria for the National Trails System \n     (System). The decision on whether to designate the Ala \n     Kahakai as a National Historic Trail will be made by Congress \n     after transmittal of the Study and Record of Decision (ROD) \n     by the Secretary of the Interior. The National Park Service \n     (NPS) recommends Alternative B, National Historic Trail \n     (continuous), as the environmentally preferred alternative \n     (and which is described in the FEIS for which the Notice of \n     Availability was published in the Federal Register on April \n     29, 1998). Out of four alternatives identified and analyzed, \n     the recommended alternative offers the best opportunity to \n     protect trail resources, educate the public about the history \n     and significant of the island shoreline trail, or ala loa, \n     and the Hawaiian culture, and provide high quality \n     recreation. The Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) \n     for the Study did not recommend on alternative. The DEIS was \n     issued in July 1997, and the public review period ended on \n     October 17, 1997.\n       Findings: The NPS concludes that the Ala Kahakai meets the \n     three criteria as a National Historic Trail as outlined in \n     the National Trails System Act. The NPS also concludes that \n     establishing a continuous trail is physically feasible.\n       The NPS concludes that desirability of recognizing the \n     trail rest on two key items: first; communities along the \n     way, native Hawaiians, and landowners all be involved in \n     planning and implementing the trail; and second, adequate \n     funding must be ensured at the time the trail is designated \n     to protect cultural and natural resources. If the trail is \n     designated without adequate funding at the outset, resources \n     may be more threatened by unregulated increase public use \n     then they already are.\n       The National Park System Advisory Committee agreed at their \n     November 1997 meeting that the Ala Kahakai does have National \n     Historic Significance based on the criteria developed under \n     the Historic Sites Act of 1935.\n       Recommended Alternative: Under this alternative, National \n     Historic Trail (continuous), Alternative B, the trail would \n     be recognized as a continuous route and over time would \n     become continuous on the ground. Intact segments of the \n     prehistoric and historic ala loa would be preserved and \n     protected in place. These segments would be linked with later \n     trails or reconstructed trails, as feasible, to create a \n     continuous trail. It is anticipated that, once records of \n     title are reviewed, most of the trail will be owned in fee \n     simple by the state and reserved for use of the public under \n     the Highways Act of 1892. The NPS would administer and have \n     oversight of the trail in close coordination with the state \n     and county. Nonfederally-owned portions of the trail would \n     become official components of the National Trail only through \n     agreements with landowners or land managers.\n       The NPS would prepare a management plan with the active \n     involvement of native Hawaiians, landowners, trail users, and \n     other interested groups and individuals. An advisory council \n     would be appointed by the Secretary of the Interior. The \n     National Trail would be interpreted as a portion of the \n     ancient ala loa and as a traditional cultural property of \n     continuing importance to native Hawaiians. The management \n     plan would include a uniform marker for identifying the \n     trail. State and local agencies, private landowners, local \n     groups, and individuals would manage the trail on the ground. \n     Natural, cultural, and ethnographic resources would be \n     inventoried and protected before trail segments would be \n     promoted for public use. No Federal land acquisition is \n     anticipated (it is expected that any legislation designating \n     the trail would include language prohibiting land acquisition \n     except with the consent of the owner). All current State and \n     County land use regulations would continue to apply to lands \n     adjacent to the trail.\n       Estimated federal costs for this alternative (presented in \n     the FEIS in 1997 dollars) are as follows: management plan and \n     initial brochure, $275,000; phased costs (archaeological \n     surveys and ethnography, trail identification, restoration, \n     and construction), trailhead and campsite development, \n     facility planning) $3,679,000; and annual operations cost, \n     $265,000.\n       Other Alternatives Considered: Three other alternatives \n     were considered. The No-Action Alternative, Alternative A, \n     would result in continuing the present conditions. The Ala \n     Kahakai would remain as the 35-mile state demonstration \n     trail. Piecemeal trail and resource protection would be \n     reactionary as development or other threats occur. The trail \n     would be a disconnected series of trail segments emphasizing \n     lateral shoreline access. Over time, as records of title are \n     researched for various reasons, most of the 175-mile trail \n     would be owned in fee simple by the state and reserved for \n     public use, but the ala loa and its role in the lives of \n     ancient and contemporary Hawaiians would not be consistently \n     recognized and interpreted. There would be no overall \n     administration of the trail as a unified whole as part of a \n     system of island trails.\n       The State Historic Trail Alternative, Alternative C, would \n     require state legislation to recognize the 175-mile trail as \n     a continuous portion of the ala loa. The legislation would \n     outline the requirements of a state management plan and the \n     needs for protection of resources. It is anticipated that the \n     state trails and access program, Na Ala Hele, would \n     administer the trail. To achieve the vision for the trail, \n     the state would need to appropriate funds specifically for \n     the planning, protection, development, interpretation, and \n     maintenance of the trail. Since the state is likely to own \n     most of the trail in fee simple, this alternative would \n     appear to be viable.\n       The National Historic Trail (discontinuous) Alternative, \n     Alternative D, would be similar to Alternative B, except that \n     the trail would be recognized as a continuous route, but only \n     intact prehistoric and historic sections would be protected \n     and interpreted for the public. The trail would not be \n     continous on the ground.\n       Four additional options were considered but rejected as \n     non-viable.\n       Basis for the Recommendation: In 1992, the U.S. Congress \n     enacted legislation providing for a study of the potential \n     inclusion of the Ala Kahakai into the System. National Trail \n     Studies must determine whether a trail meets eligibility \n     requirements and whether it is feasible and desirable to add \n     it to the System. The NPS found the trail meets the \n     eligibility criteria, and determined it to be feasible and \n     desirable to designate it as a unit of the System if certain \n     conditions are met.\n       In addition, National Trail Studies analyze a range of \n     conceptual alternatives for managing the trail, including a \n     no-action, a national trail, and other feasible alternatives. \n     It is NPS policy to fulfill its conservation planning-impact \n     analysis and other stewardship obligations through preparing \n     an EIS for National Trail Studies. Also as a matter of \n     policy, the NPS recommends an alternative, fully recognizing \n     that Congress is the decision-making body.\n       Each alternative in the Ala Kahakai FEIS considers natural, \n     cultural, scenic and visual, and recreational resources, and \n     the socio-economic environment. Of the four alternatives, the \n     recommended alternative offers the best opportunity to \n     protect trail resources, educate the public about the history \n     and significance of the ala loa and the Hawaiian culture, and \n     provide high quality recreation. It would treat the 175-mile \n     trail as a single system, rather than as a series of \n     unrelated segments, providing a context for protection and \n     interpretation. This approach would better protect the \n     resources than the piecemeal approach provided under \n     Alternative A, No-Action, or the segmented approach under \n     Alternative D, National Historic Trail (discontinuous). Under \n     the No-Action Alternative, trail resources could be lost to \n     continuing development and lack of public awareness of trail \n     resource values. Opportunities would be lost to interpret the \n     Ala Kahakai as part of the ala loa. Further, Alternative C, \n     State Historic Trail, may appear to be a likely management \n     scenario (since the state anticipates that it will own most \n     of the trail once land titles are investigated), but the \n     State does not appear to have the funds or enough staff to \n     plan for and manage the entire trail. The recommended \n     alternative would allow NPS administration, coordination, \n     oversight, and technical assistance to bolster state and \n     local management of the trail.\n       Measures to Minimize Harm: The FEIS addresses conceptual \n     management options for the Ala Kahakai. Supplementary \n     conservation planning and impact analysis would be necessary, \n     in conjunction with preparing a management plan; tiered \n     environmental documents for specific trail projects would be \n     prepared as they occur and as appropriate. The FEIS includes \n     practicable means at a programmatic level to avoid or \n     minimize environmental harm. For instance, it is essential \n     that no section of trail be opened for public use unless and \n     until a management plan, prepared in concert with landowners \n     and native Hawaiians along the segment, is completed and \n     maintenance and protection of cultural and natural resources \n     provided for. Cultural resources and traditional cultural \n     properties would be identified and ethnographies prepared. \n     Native Hawaiian cultural experts would advise on planning and \n     managing the trail. Native Hawaiians, landowners, communities \n     along the way, trail users, and others would be involved in \n     planning for and managing the trail. Natural resources (which \n     are often perceived as cultural resources to Native \n     Hawaiians) would be inventoried and measures taken to protect \n     archaeological sites and threatened and endangered species \n     before any portion of the trail is promoted for public use. \n     Anchialine ponds would be identified and inventoried and a \n     range of protection measures considered before encouraging \n     trail use near them. Effects of trail use on cultural and \n     natural resources would be monitored as feasible and \n     appropriate.\n       Public Review: The DEIS was developed after public scoping \n     through five public meetings, numerous agency and \n     organization meetings, distribution of meeting summaries, and \n     a newsletter series. Alternatives were developed through a \n     workshop process, and an initial opportunity for public \n     contributions was afforded through a newsletter with response \n     form. The DEIS was issued in late July 1997 and the public \n     review period ended on October 17, 1997. Also during this \n     period the NPS conducted four public meetings and received 67 \n     written comments during the 60-day public review period. The \n     FEIS (noticed in the Federal Register on April 29, 1998) \n     included responses to 39 letters from agencies, landowners, \n     organizations,\n\n[[Page S3257]]\n\n     and individuals who raised specific issues. In general, the \n     landowners who commented on the DEIS preferred the No Action \n     Alternative, and the organizations and individuals who \n     responded preferred the National Historic Trail (continuous) \n     Alternative. No significant new issues were raised which \n     would require the development of a new alternative, although \n     the FEIS clarified the impacts to land use section, the \n     intent of Alternative B, and revised the cost estimate. The \n     30-day no-action period began on April 3, 1998 and ended on \n     May 4, 1998.\n       During the no-action period, two typographic corrections \n     were noted (and are incorporated by reference):\n       1. On page 39, the abbreviation for MLCD is reversed \n     several times.\n       2. On page 49, the name ``Kekaha Kai'' is misspelled.\n       Also during this period several comments were received. \n     These communications neither surfaced new issues or concerns, \n     nor provided information to add to the FEIS. However, since \n     the FEIS provided the first public opportunity to review the \n     NPS recommendation, all comments received are summarized \n     below to ensure that Congress and interested parties are \n     fully apprised of all views. Moreover, all written \n     communications received during the entire environmental \n     compliance process are on file in the NPS's Pacific Great \n     Basin Support Office in San Francisco.\n\n\n                 comments supporting the recommendation\n\n       The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service supported the \n     recommendation and expressed interest in working with the \n     NPS, the state, and all cooperators on management strategies \n     to protect endangered plants and animals, and their habitats, \n     if the trail is designated a National Historic Trail.\n       A Hawaii County Council member supported of the \n     recommendation; his letter is attached to the Record of \n     Decision at the request of Senator Daniel Akaka.\n       E Mau Na Ala Hele, a non-profit trails support group, \n     supported the recommendation and emphasized the need for \n     local control and management.\n       Wailea Property Owners' Association generally supported the \n     recommendation, but noted concerns for litter, waste, and \n     crime, and requested that the trail be non-motorized.\n       Several individuals wrote, e-mailed, or telephoned their \n     support for the recommendation.\n\n\n                   comments supporting other options\n\n       The President of Ka Ohana O KaLae, a Puna District kinship \n     group, rejected all alternatives because the coastal area \n     ``must fall under jurisdiction of the Native Hawaiian tenant \n     living in that particular portion of ahupuaa.''\n       Waikoloa Resort supported Alternative A and indicated it \n     would not cooperate with Federal designation of the trail.\n       Kona Kohala Resort Association supported Alternative A and \n     expressed concern about increased landowner burden under the \n     recommended alternative.\n       Chalon International continued to question not including \n     the entire ``Cordy report'' in the FEIS.\n       Kamehameha Schools Bernice Pauhai Bishop Estate reiterated \n     their belief that the Ala Kahakai is a collection of \n     fragmented remnants and thus opposed designation of a \n     National Trail along the Hawaii coastline.\n       Skycliff Investment, L.L.C. questioned the listing in \n     Appendix G of 0.89 miles of the Ala Kahakai passing over \n     their property. As new owners they did not have the \n     opportunity to comment on the DEIS. They cautioned avoidance \n     of regulatory taking without compensation and asked to be \n     consulted on any developments related to the Ala Kahakai \n     Study.\n       The Hawaii Leeward Planning Conference restated concerns \n     noted in the FEIS.\n       Oceanside 1250 wrote three letters: one commented on other \n     letters included in the FEIS; the other two restated concerns \n     noted in the FEIS.\n       Conclusion: The National Trail Study, Draft and Final EIS, \n     and Record of Decision will be transmitted to Congress by the \n     Secretary of the Interior. The decision on whether to \n     designate the Ala Kahakai as a National Historic Trail will \n     be made by Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 24, 1998.\n     Superintendent,\n     Pacific Great Basin Support Office, National Park Service, \n         San Francisco, CA.\n       Dear Superintendent: Please include the enclosed remarks of \n     J.

Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: I have reviewed a copy of the above \n     referenced study and wish to submit the following brief \n     comments:\n       As a Native Hawaiian and an elected public official, I \n     encourage the Congress and National Park Service to include \n     Ala Kahakai in the National Trail System. I believe that, as \n     both a traditional cultural and public resource, this trail \n     is totally unique and of enormous significance and value. \n     Therefore, its conservation and protection are extremely \n     important, not only to present and future generations of \n     Native Hawaiians, but to the general public as well.\n       I believe that inclusion of this trail will afford greater \n     opportunities to attract the resources necessary to conserve \n     and protect it. This is especially important in light of the \n     fiscal and other constraints now being experienced in the \n     State of Hawaii.\n       I am aware that some feel inclusion may further compromise \n     this special asset, but I am confident that, as long as the \n     the trail remains a part of the public trust, and there is a \n     willingness and open mechanism to consider and implement the \n     perspectives and wishes of local residents, including Native \n     Hawaiians, the end result will be superior to leaving this \n     matter only in the hands of state and local governments.\n       Finally, I wish to commend you and all those who have \n     worked on this project. In my opinion, the work has been done \n     in a sensitive and thorough manner, and demonstrates a true \n     commitment on your part to seek and ensure that the life of \n     this land will continue to be perpetuated in that which is \n     pono.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this important \n     matter. Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can be of \n     further assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             J. Curtis Tyler, III,\n                                       Council Member, District 8.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MOYNIHAN (for himself and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 701. A bill to designate the Federal building located at 290 \nBroadway in New York, New York, as the ``Ronald H. Brown Federal \nBuilding''; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                    RONALD H. BROWN FEDERAL BUILDING\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise with my colleague Senator Schumer \nto introduce a bill to honor and remember a truly exceptional American, \nRonald H. Brown. The bill would designate the newly constructed Federal \nbuilding located at 290 Broadway in the heart of lower Manhattan as the \n``Ronald H. Brown Federal Building.''\n  It is a fitting gesture to recognize the passing of this remarkable \nAmerican, and I would ask for my colleagues' support for this \nlegislation to place one more marker in history on Ron Brown's behalf.\n  Ron Brown had a great love for enterprise and industry as reflected \nin his achievements as the first African-American to hold the office of \nU.S. Secretary of Commerce. His was also a life of outstanding \nachievement and public service: Army captain; vice president of the \nNational Urban League; partner in a prestigious law firm; chairman of \nthe Democratic National Committee; husband and father. And these are \nbut a few of the achievements that demonstrated Ron Brown's spirited \nand sweeping pursuit of life.\n  To have held any one of these posts in the government, and in the \nprivate sector, is extraordinary. To have held all of the positions he \ndid and prevail as he did, is unique. Ron Brown was tragically taken \nfrom us too soon; we are diminished by his loss. I cannot think of a \nmore fitting tribute to this uncommon man.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Ronald H. Brown Federal \nBuilding Designation Act of 1999, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 701\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF RONALD H BROWN FEDERAL BUILDING.\n\n       The Federal building located at 290 Broadway in New York, \n     New York, shall be known and designated as the ``Ronald H. \n     Brown Federal Building''.\n\n     SEC. 2 REFERENCES.\n\n       Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, \n     or other record of the United States to the building referred \n     to in section 1 shall be deemed to be a reference to the \n     ``Ronald H. Brown Federal Building''.\n\n   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am honored to join my \ncolleague, the Senior Senator from New York, Pat Moynihan, to introduce \nthis bill to honor Ronald H. Brown, a gifted and committed public \nservant. This legislation, which we offer in concert with a similar \nmeasure authored by our friend and House colleague Congressman Charles\n\n[[Page S3258]]\n\nRangel, would designate the newly constructed Federal building at 290 \nBroadway in Manhattan as the ``Ronald H. Brown Federal Building.''\n  A New Yorker raised on Lennox Avenue in Harlem, Ron Brown loved his \ncountry and ultimately gave his life in service to it. An Army captain, \nvice-president of the National Urban League, Chairman of the Democratic \nNational Committee, Ron Brown became the first African-American to \nserve as Secretary of Commerce in 1993, breathing new life and purpose \ninto that agency. President Clinton, in praising Brown's work there, \nonce told Commerce Department employees that Brown ``was one of the \nbest advisors and ablest people I ever knew.''\n  Brown's life was marked by a passion, and determination, to ensure \nthat the promise of liberty and opportunity rang true for all \nAmericans. At the Urban League and then at the DNC, he worked \nceaselessly to promote civil rights and economic development for \nminorities. Later as Secretary of Commerce, Ron Brown traversed the \nglobe in efforts to remove trade barriers and reinforce the American \nvalues of fair labor practices and human rights.\n  Less than three years ago, we lost Secretary Brown and 32 American \nbusinessmen, Commerce employees, and military personnel in a tragic \nplane crash in Croatia. Today we offer this measure as our tribute. A \nuniquely talented and beloved man, Ron Brown is sorely missed.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \n        Inouye, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Kennedy, Ms. Mikulski, and Mrs. \n        Murray):\n  S. 702. A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to \nprohibit discrimination in the payment of wages on account of sex, \nrace, or national origin, and for other purposes; to the committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                          fair pay act of 1999\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, there is perhaps no other form of \ndiscrimination that has as direct an impact on the day-to-day lives of \nworkers as wage discrimination. A recent survey of working women found \nreceiving fair pay is one of their top concerns. When women aren't paid \nwhat they're worth, we all get cheated. That's why we are introducing \nthe Fair Pay Act of 1999--to ensure equal pay for work of equal value \nfor all Americans.\n  The Equal Pay Act of 1963 prohibits sex-based discrimination in \ncompensation for doing the same job. However, this statute fails to \naddress other major parts of the pay equity problem such as job \nsegregation. Current law has not reached far enough to combat wage \ndiscrimination when employers routinely pay lower wages to jobs that \nare dominated by women. More than 30 years after the passage of the \nEqual Pay Act, women's wages still seriously lag behind their male \ncounterparts' wages. The central problem is that we continue to \nundervalue and underpay work done by women.\n  The Fair Pay Act is designed to pick up where the Equal Pay Act left \noff. The heart of the bill seeks to eliminate wage discrimination based \nupon sex, race or national origin. This important legislation would \namend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to make it illegal for \nemployers to discriminate against women and minorities by paying them \nless in jobs that are comparable in skill, effort, responsibility and \nworking conditions.\n  The Fair Pay Act would apply to each company individually and would \nprohibit companies from reducing other employees' wages to achieve pay \nequity. Seven states have passed and implemented laws to close the wage \ngap for state employees and they didn't go bankrupt doing it. Canada \nalso passed similar pay equity laws that apply to both the government \nand private sectors.\n  Wage gaps can result from differences in education, experience or \ntime in the workforce and the Fair Pay Act in no way interferes with \nthat. But just as there is a glass ceiling in the American workplace, \nthere is also a ``Glass Wall'' encountered by women who have similar \nskills and have the similar responsibilities as their male \ncounterparts, but still do not receive the same pay.\n  For example, a study of Los Angeles County employees showed social \nworkers were paid $35,000 a year while probation officers were paid \n$55,000. That's a $20,000 difference, although the jobs required \nsimilar skills, education and working conditions. This is what the Fair \nPay Act aims to fix.\n  A February 1999 report by the Institute for Women's Policy Research \nand the AFL-CIO found that families lose an average of $3,446 a year \nbecause of unequal pay in female-dominated jobs. That's $420,000 over a \nlifetime of the average woman.\n  Mr. President, persistent wage gaps for working women and people of \ncolor and the earnings inequality these gaps connote translate into \nlower pay, less family income and more poverty for working families. \nThe solution, long overdue, is fair pay for women and minority workers.\n  Please join us in support of Fair Pay Act of 1999.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na summary of the legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 702\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE AND REFERENCE.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Fair Pay \n     Act of 1999''.\n       (b) Reference.--Except as provided in section 8, whenever \n     in this Act an amendment or repeal is expressed in terms of \n     an amendment to, or repeal of, a section or other provision, \n     the reference shall be considered to be made to a section or \n     other provision of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 \n     U.S.C. 201 et seq.).\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Wage rate differentials exist between equivalent jobs \n     segregated by sex, race, and national origin in Government \n     employment and in industries engaged in commerce or in the \n     production of goods for commerce.\n       (2) The existence of such wage rate differentials--\n       (A) depresses wages and living standards for employees \n     necessary for their health and efficiency;\n       (B) prevents the maximum utilization of the available labor \n     resources;\n       (C) tends to cause labor disputes, thereby burdening, \n     affecting, and obstructing commerce;\n       (D) burdens commerce and the free flow of goods in \n     commerce; and\n       (E) constitutes an unfair method of competition.\n       (3) Discrimination in hiring and promotion has played a \n     role in maintaining a segregated work force.\n       (4) Many women and people of color work in occupations \n     dominated by individuals of their same sex, race, and \n     national origin.\n       (5)(A) A General Accounting Office analysis of wage rates \n     in the civil service of the State of Washington found that in \n     1985 of the 44 jobs studied that paid less than the average \n     of all equivalent jobs, approximately 39 percent were female-\n     dominated and approximately 16 percent were male dominated.\n       (B) A study of wage rates in Minnesota using 1990 Decennial \n     Census data found that 75 percent of the wage rate \n     differential between white and non-white workers was \n     unexplained and may be a result of discrimination.\n       (6) Section 6(d) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 \n     prohibits discrimination in compensation for ``equal work'' \n     on the basis of sex.\n       (7) Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits \n     discrimination in compensation because of race, color, \n     religion, national origin, and sex. The Supreme Court, in its \n     decision in County of Washington v. Gunther, 452 U.S. 161 \n     (1981), held that title VII's prohibition against \n     discrimination in compensation also applies to jobs that do \n     not constitute ``equal work'' as defined in section 6(d) of \n     the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Decisions of lower \n     courts, however, have demonstrated that further clarification \n     of existing legislation is necessary in order effectively to \n     carry out the intent of Congress to implement the Supreme \n     Court's holding in its Gunther decision.\n       (8) Artificial barriers to the elimination of \n     discrimination in compensation based upon sex, race, and \n     national origin continue to exist more than 3 decades after \n     the passage of section 6(d) of the Fair Labor Standards Act \n     of 1938 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Elimination of such \n     barriers would have positive effects, including--\n       (A) providing a solution to problems in the economy created \n     by discrimination through wage rate differentials;\n       (B) substantially reducing the number of working women and \n     people of color earning low wages, thereby reducing the \n     dependence on public assistance; and\n       (C) promoting stable families by enabling working family \n     members to earn a fair rate of pay.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill \nthat I am calling the ``Brady Act Amendments of 1999,'' which would \nremove ``long guns'' from the requirements of the National Instant \nCriminal Background Check System (NICS). I am pleased to be joined by \nmy distinguished colleagues, Senators Craig, Inhofe, and Helms, as \noriginal co-sponsors.\n  Mr. President, Congress has imposed many restrictions on firearms \nsales over the years, with no apparent effect on reducing crime. By \ncontrast, the most effective crime fighting initiatives have been \nundertaken at the state and local levels. Many states have dramatically \nreduced crime by increasing their incarceration rates. Local \ngovernments, such as that of Richmond, Virginia, reduced crime rates by \naggressively prosecuting cases involving possession of firearms by \nconvicted felons and drug dealers--not by imposing any new restrictions \non the purchase of firearms.\n  In fact, Mr. President, states that have fewer restrictions on the \npurchase of firearms have more favorable crime reduction trends than \nother states. Despite all of the favorable media fanfare over the Brady \nAct, states that were covered by its ``waiting period'' phase until the \nNICS went into effect late last year actually had worse crime trends \nthan other states.\n  The Federal Bureau of Investigation notes that out of the total \nnumber of homicides in a recent reporting period that were committed \nwith firearms, less than 7% were committed with rifles, and less than \n7% were committed with shotguns. Out of the total number of homicides, \nrifles and shotguns each were used in 4%, while knives, which may be \npurchased without clearance by the NICS, were used in 13% of such \ncases.\n  Mr. President, my bill would amend the Brady Act to make the NICS \napply not to firearms in general, but only to handguns.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of my bill \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 703\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Federal \nPrisoner Health Care Copayment Act, which would require federal \nprisoners to pay a nominal fee when they initiate certain visits for \nmedical attention. Fees collected from prisoners subject to an order of \nrestitution shall be paid to victims in accordance with the order. \nSeventy-five percent of all other fees would be deposited in the \nFederal Crime Victims' Fund and the remainder would go to the Federal \nBureau of Prisons (BOP) and the U.S. Marshals Service for \nadministrative expenses incurred in carrying out this Act.\n  Each time a prisoner pays to heal himself, he will be paying to heal \na victim.\n  Most working, law-abiding Americans are required to pay a copayment \nfee when they seek medical attention. It is time to impose this \nrequirement on federal prisoners.\n  The Department of Justice supports the Federal inmate user fee \nconcept, and worked with us on crafting the language contained in this \nAct.\n  To date, well over half of the states--including our home states of \nArizona and South Dakota--have implemented state-wide prisoner health \ncare copayment programs. Additionally, the following states have \nenacted this reform: Alabama, California, Colorado, Connecticut, \nDelaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, \nKentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, \nNevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, \nRhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West \nVirginia, and Wisconsin. Additional states are considering implementing \ncopayment programs.\n  Copayment programs have an outstanding record of success on the state \nlevel.\n  Tennessee, which began requiring $3 copayments in January 1996, \nreported in late 1997 that the number of infirmary visits per inmate \nhad been cut almost in half. In August 1998, prison officials in Ohio \nevaluated the nascent state copayment law, finding that the number of \nprisoners seeing a doctor has dropped 55 percent and that between March \nand August the copayment fee generated $89,500. In Arizona, there has \nbeen a reduction of about 30 percent in the number of requests for \nhealth care services.\n  Copayment programs reduce the overutilization of health care services \nwithout denying necessary care to the indigent. By discouraging the \noveruse of health care, the Prisoner Health Care Copayment Act should \n(1) help prisoners in true need of attention to receive better care, \n(2) benefit taxpayers through a reduction in the expense of operating a \nprison health care system, and (3) reduce the burden on corrections \nofficers to escort prisoners feigning illness to health care facilities \nis reduced.\n  The Act prohibits the refusal of treatment for financial reasons or \nfor appropriate preventive care.\n  Congress should follow the lead of the states and provide the federal \nBureau of Prisons with the authority to charge federal inmates a \nnominal fee for elective health care visits. The federal system is \nparticularly ripe for reform. According to the 1996 Corrections \nYearbook, the system spends more per inmate on health care than \nvirtually every state. Federal inmate health care totaled $354 million \nin fiscal year 1998, up from $138 million in fiscal year 1990. Average \ncost per inmate has increased over 36 percent during this period, from \n$2,483 to $3,363.\n\n[[Page S3261]]\n\n  Before I conclude, I would like to thank my colleague Senator Johnson \nfor his support and assistance with this legislation. Additionally, I \nappreciate the assistance of the Arizona Department of Corrections, and \nthe office staff of Sheriff Buchanan in helping me draft this reform.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with the Department of Justice, \nthe Bureau of Prisons, and colleagues on both sides of the aisle, to \nimplement a fee-for-medical-service-program--a sensible and overdue \nreform--for federal prisoners.\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join Senator \nKyl in introducing the Federal Prisoner Health Care Copayment Act. The \nKyl-Johnson bill will require federal prisoners to pay a nominal fee \nwhen they initiate certain visits for medical attention. Fees collected \nfrom prisoners will either be paid as restitution to victims or be \ndeposited into the Federal Crime Victims' Fund. My state of South \nDakota is one of 34 states that have implemented state-wide prisoner \nhealth care copayment programs. The Department of Justice supports \nextending this prisoner health care copayment program to federal \nprisoners in an attempt to reduce unnecessary medical procedures and \nensure that adequate health care services are available for prisoners \nwho need them.\n  My interest in the prisoner health care copayment issue came from \ndiscussions I had in South Dakota with a number of law enforcement \nofficials and US Marshal Lyle Swenson about the equitable treatment \nbetween pre-sentencing federal prisoners housed in county jails and the \ncounty prisoners residing in those same facilities. Currently, county \nprisoners in South Dakota are subject to state and local laws allowing \nthe collection of a health care copayment, while Marshals Service \nprisoners are not, thereby allowing federal prisoners to abuse health \ncare resources at great cost to state and local law enforcement.\n  I want to thank Senator Kyl for working with me on specific concerns \nraised by South Dakota law enforcement officials and the US Marshals \nService that I wanted addressed in the bill. I sincerely appreciate \nSenator Kyl's willingness to incorporate my language into the Federal \nPrisoner Health Care Copayment Act that allows state and local \nfacilities to collect health care copayment fees when housing pre-\nsentencing federal prisoners.\n  I also worked with Senator Kyl to include sufficient flexibility in \nthe Kyl-Johnson bill for the Bureau of Prisons and local facilities \ncontracting with the Marshals Service to maintain preventive-health \npriorities. The Kyl-Johnson bill prohibits the refusal of treatment for \nfinancial reasons or for appropriate preventive care. I am pleased this \nprovision was included to pre-empt long term, and subsequently more \ncostly, health problems among prisoners.\n  The goal of the Kyl-Johnson Federal Prisoner Health Care Copayment \nAct is not about generating revenue for the federal, state, and local \nprison systems. Instead, current prisoner health care copayment \nprograms in 34 states illustrate the success in reducing the number of \nfrivolous health visits and strain on valuable health care resources. \nThe Kyl-Johnson bill will ensure that adequate health care is available \nto those prisoners who need it, without straining the budgets of \ntaxpayers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ASHCROFT:\n  S. 705. A bill to repeal section 8003 of Public Law 105-174; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                        home page tax repeal act\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, Daniel Webster argued to the Supreme \nCourt in McCulloch v. Maryland that the power to tax involves the power \nto destroy. Chief Justice Marshall was so taken with Webster's argument \nthat he made it the central premise of his landmark opinion for the \nCourt. Fully cognizant of the potential for abuse inherent in the power \nto tax, the framers carefully circumscribed this power. The \nConstitution limits the tax power to the Congress and requires revenue \nbills to originate in the House of Representatives, the body most \nresponsive to the people. The notion that unelected bureaucrats could \nlevy taxes absent any congressional authority would have been a \ncomplete anathema to the framers. It is a long way from ``no taxation \nwithout representation'' to taxation without notice, representation or \neven participation from the Congress.\n  Unfortunately, the National Science Foundation appears to have \nforgotten that the power to tax belongs to the Congress and to Congress \nalone. Since 1992, the National Science Foundation has employed a \nprivate sector firm to registering second-level domain names, which are \nthe unique identifiers that precede ``.com'' or ``.org.'' In 1995, the \nNational Science Foundation amended its agreement with the firm to \nallow it to charge a $100 registration fee, and a $50 renewal fee. If \nthose fees had been designed simply to allow the private firm to cover \nits costs and make a modest profit they would be unproblematic. \nHowever, that is not what happened here. The National Science \nFoundation, without any congressional authority, required the private \nfirm to set aside 30 percent of the total fees collected and turn them \nover to the National Science Foundation's Intellectual Infrastructure \nFund. In short, without any congressional authorization, the National \nScience Foundation levied a substantial tax (at greater than a 42-\npercent rate) on a necessary item for doing business on the Internet.\n  Allowing this agency action to go unremedied would set a terrible \nprecedent. Why should any agency suffer through the vagaries of the \nappropriations process if it can just impose its own taxes? As long as \nthe agency has a monopoly over a necessary permit or license, it can \nset just about any tax rate it pleases. The agency could then use these \ntax revenues to fund its activities without too much concern for the \nappropriators and authorizers in Congress.\n  The potential for abuse in such unauthorized and unconstitutional \ntaxes was not lost on the Federal District Court that heard a challenge \nto the National Science Foundation's actions. The Court correctly \ndetermined that the National Science Foundation's actions amounted to \nan unconstitutional tax. Remarkably, Congress, rather than taking the \nNational Science Foundation to task for its arrogation of taxing \nauthority, actually ratified the Foundation's actions in a provision in \nlast year's supplemental appropriations bill. The message this sends to \nfederal agencies is intolerable. It creates a perverse and \nunconstitutional incentive for agencies to impose unauthorized taxes \nwith every reason to believe that a Congress that has never seen a \nrevenue source it did not like will ratify its misbehavior.\n  What is more, the National Science Foundation's actions and Congress' \nratification of those actions are inconsistent with the spirit of the \nInternet Tax Moratorium Act we passed last year. At the same time that \nwe are telling States and localities that they cannot impose \ndiscriminatory taxes on the Internet, Congress is ratifying a 42% tax \non the registration of domain names. Congress must be consistent with \nrespect to Internet taxation. We must act to repeal the ratification of \nthis unconstitutional tax. The bill I introduce today, the Home Page \nTax Repeal Act of 1999 does just that. It sends a clear message that \nCongress will not tolerate taxation of the Internet and will not allow \nfederal bureaucrats to wield the power of taxation.\n  Finally, let me be clear that my criticism of the National Science \nFoundation's actions in levying this tax should not be mistaken for \ncriticism of the policies they have pursued or of the uses to which \nthey have put the revenues. I am fully supportive of efforts to ensure \nthat we study the growth of the Internet and that the infrastructure \nsupporting the Internet keeps up with rapid growth of this incredible \nmedium. Indeed, spending for these purposes is so clearly justified \nthat I have every confidence that sufficient funds will be appropriated \nthrough the normal appropriations process. But that is the process that \nshould be followed. Allowing an agency to short-circuit that process \nand impose unconstitutional taxes--even with the best of motives--is \nsimply unacceptable. The power to tax is indeed the power to destroy. \nThe power to tax is oppressive enough in the hands of elected officials \nwho must face the voters. That same power in the hands of unelected \nbureaucrats is intolerable. On behalf of the people we represent, \nCongress should reclaim its\n\n[[Page S3262]]\n\nproper constitutional authority and reject--not ratify--this \nunconstitutional tax.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mrs. Hutchison, Mrs. Murray, Ms. \n        Mikulski, Mrs. Boxer, Ms. Collins, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Reid, \n        Mr. Biden, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Dodd, Mr. \n        Durbin, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. \n        Sarbanes):\n  S. 706.

Mr. President, in honor of Women's History Month, \ntoday I am introducing legislation to create an Advisory Committee for \nthe National Museum of Women's History. I am pleased to be joined by 17 \nof my colleagues: Senators Hutchison, Murray, Mikulski, Boxer, Collins, \nRockefeller, Reid, Biden, Akaka, Kerry (MA), Ashcroft, Dodd, Durbin, \nTorricelli, Inouye, Leiberman, and Sarbanes.\n  For far too long, women have contributed to history, but have largely \nbeen forgotten in our history books, in our monuments, and in our \nmuseums. It is long past time that the roles women have played be \nremoved from the shadows of indifference and given a place where they \ncan shine.\n  The bill we are introducing today will create a 26 member Advisory \nCommittee to look at the following three issues and report back to \nCongress concerning (1) identification of a site for the museum in the \nDistrict of Columbia; (2) development of a business plan to allow the \ncreation and maintenance of the museum to be done solely with private \ncontributions and 3) assistance with the collection and program of the \nmuseum.\n  It is important to note that this bill does not commit Congress to \nspending any money for this museum. The Committee's report will tell us \nthe feasibility of funding the museum privately. And I believe that the \nMuseum's Board has shown that they have the ability to do just that.\n  The concept for the National Museum of Women's History (NMWH) was \ncreated back in 1996. Since that time, the Board of Directors, lead by \nPresident Karen Staser, has worked tirelessly to build support and \ninterest for this project. And judging by the fact that they have \nraised more than $10.5 million for the project, lent their support to \nthe moving of the Suffragette statute from the crypt to the Rotunda, \nand raised $85,000 for that effort, I'd say they are well on their way \nto success.\n  They have also spent a lot of time answering the question ``why do we \nneed a women's museum when we have the Smithsonian.'' The first answer \nto that comes from Edith Mayo, Curator Emeritus of the Smithsonian \nNational Museum of American History, who notes that since 1963 only two \nexhibits--two--were dedicated to the role of women in history.\n  The fact is, in the story of America's success, the chapter on \nwomen's contributions has largely been left on the editing room floor. \nHere's what I mean: Many of us know that women fought and got the vote \nin 1920, with the ratification of the 19th Amendment to the \nConstitution. But how many know that Wyoming gave women the right to \nvote in 1869, 51 years earlier, and that by 1900 Utah, Colorado and \nIdaho had granted women the right to vote? Or that the suffragette \nmovement took 72 years to meet its goal? And few know that the women of \nUtah sewed dresses made from silk for the Suffragettes on their cross \ncountry tour.\n\n  History is filled with other little known but significant milestones: \nlike the first woman elected to the United States Senate was Hattie \nWyatt Caraway from Louisiana in 1932. That Margaret Chase Smith, from \nmy home state of Maine, was the first woman elected to the US Senate in \nher own right in 1948, and in 1962 became the first women to run for \nthe US Presidency in the primaries of a major political party. Or that \nthe first female cabinet member was Frances Perkins, Secretary of Labor \nfor FDR.\n  How many people know that Margaret Reha Seddon was the first US woman \nto achieve the full rank of astronaut, and flew her first space mission \naboard the Space Shuttle ``Discovery'' in 1985, twenty three years \nafter the distinguished former Senator from the State of Ohio, John \nGlenn completed his historic first flight in space?\n  And I can guarantee you more people know the last person to hit over \n.400 in baseball--Ted Williams--than can name the first woman elected \nto Congress--Jeannette Rankin of Montana, who was elected in 1916, four \nyears before ratification of the 19th Amendment gave women the right to \nvote.\n  Hardly household names. But they should be. And with a place to \nshowcase their accomplishments, perhaps one day they will take their \nrightful place beside America's greatest minds, visionary leaders, and \ngroundbreaking figures. But until then, we have a long way to go.\n  Whatever period of history you chose--women played a role. Sybil \nLudington, a 16-year-old, rode through parts of New York and \nConnecticut in April of 1777 to warn that the Redcoats were coming. \nSacajawea, the Shoshone Indian guide, helped escort Lewis and Clark on \ntheir 8000 mile expedition. Rosa Parks, Jo Ann Robinson and Myrlie \nEvers played important roles in the civil rights movement in the 50's \nand 60's. And as we move into the 21st century, the role of women--who \nnow make up 52 percent of the population--will continue to be integral \nto the future success of this country.\n  In fact the real question about the building of a women's museum is \nnot so much where it will be built--although that remains to be \nexplored. And it's not even who will pay for it--as I've said, it will \nbe done entirely with private funds. The real question when it comes to \na museum dedicated to women's history is, where will they put it all!\n  I would argue that we have a solemn responsibility to teach our \nchildren, and ourselves, about our rich past--and that includes the \nmyriad contributions of women, in all fields and every endeavor. These \nwomen can serve as role models and inspire our youth. They can teach us \nabout our past and guide us into our future. They can even prompt young \nwomen to consider a career in public service--as Senator Smith of Maine \ndid for me.\n  Instead, today in America, more young women probably know the names \nof the latest super models then the names of the female members of this \nAdministration's Cabinet. That is why we need a National Museum of \nWomen's History, that is why I am proud to sponsor this legislation, \nand that is why I hope that my colleagues will join us in supporting \nthe creation of this Advisory Committee as a first step toward writing \nthe forgotten chapters of the history of our nation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Chafee, Ms. \n        Landrieu, Mr. Levin, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. Kerrey):\n  S. 708.

I know the kinds of problems that exist at the ground level, \nand I think it's very important that we work together to address them.\n  This is especially true today, as opposed to a couple of years ago, \nbecause the child welfare agencies and the\n\n[[Page S3263]]\n\ncourts have an important new task--the implementation of the Adoption \nand Safe Families Act.\n  Almost one and a half years ago, Congress passed this historic piece \nof legislation, which was designed to encourage safe and permanent \nfamily placements for abused and neglected children--and to decrease \nthe amount of time that a child spends in the foster care system. With \nthis law, we make it clear that the health and safety of the child must \ncome first when making any decision for a child in the abuse and \nneglect system. This law shortens the time line for children in foster \ncare. Specifically, the law requires initiation of proceedings to \nterminate parental rights for any child who has been in the foster care \nsystem for 15 of the last 22 months.\n  These timelines are very important. Foster care was meant to be a \ntemporary solution--but for too many children foster care has become a \nway of life. However, the institution of these timelines has created \nadditional pressure on an already overburdened court system.\n  To give you an idea of the burden that already exists, consider this: \nWhen the Family Court was established in New York in 1962, it reviewed \n96,000 cases the first year. By 1997, the case load had increased to \n670,000 cases.\n  A September 1997 report by the Fund for Modern Courts found that \nFamily Court judges were overburdened and forced to provide, quote, \n``assembly line justice''--because they only had a few minutes to \nreview each case. The report found that in Brooklyn, cases receive an \naverage of 4 minutes before a judge on a first appearance and little \nmore than 11 minutes on subsequent appearances. The report concluded \nthat, quote: ``It is easy to understand how a tragedy can result from \ndecisions made based on so little actual time in court.'' End of quote.\n  And that's not the only problem in the system. In Cuyahoga County, \nOhio, the juvenile court identified 3,000 cases that were open, but \ninactive. In most of these cases, the child had been charged with a \nminor crime, but never had his or her case scheduled for trial. But \nmore than 100 of these cases involved children who remained in foster \ncare for months or even years, despite the fact that a judge had \nordered them to be returned home to their parents.\n  Another problem faced in Cuyahoga County, and in many other places, \nis the missing file. Until recently, the court had no central clerk's \nfile, so there was no way of tracking the location of a particular \nfile. If the file could not be found on the day of a hearing or review, \nit would result in a postponement, adding months to a child's stay in \nfoster care. It is undisputed that children need permanency as quickly \nas possible. It is simply unconscionable that children should be \ntrapped in foster care by a Dickensian nightmare of paperwork.\n  And you also have to wonder where the lawyers, case workers and \nguardians for these children were--and what they were doing as these \ncases dragged on for months or even years longer than necessary. It is \na symptom of the overburdened child welfare system and the lack of \nresources available for everyone involved --the child welfare agencies, \nthe attorneys, the guardians, the courts. It's not their fault, but \nit's not tolerable either.\n  We, collectively--as public servants, and as a society--must do \nbetter.\n  Some abuse and neglect courts have already found innovative ways to \neliminate their backlog of cases and move children toward permanency. \nOne example is in Hamilton County, Ohio, where the Juvenile Court, \nunder the leadership of Judge David Grossmann, has instituted a system \nthat successfully has reduced the amount of time a child spends in \ncare. Hamilton County added hearing officers so that more time could be \nspent on each case--leading to better quality decision making and \nreduced case loads. The court also developed a computer tracking system \nso that the judge could have essential information on each case at his \nor her fingertips, and the ``missing file'' would no longer be a bar to \npermanency.\n  The state of Connecticut has also created an innovative way of \ndealing with the backlog of cases in its child welfare system. The \nChild Protection Session is a court dedicated to settling the most \ndifficult abuse and neglect cases--contested cases of abuse and neglect \nand termination of parental rights proceedings. Connecticut has \nrecognized that these types of cases need to be handled expeditiously, \nand as a result of the special session, these cases are now being \nhandled in months, rather than years, to the benefit of all of the \nchildren involved.\n  The General Accounting Office (GAO) recently reported to Congress the \nresults of its review of juvenile and family courts performance in \nachieving permanence for children. GAO identified three elements that \nare essential to successful court reform.\n  (1) Judicial leadership and collaboration among the child welfare \nparticipants.\n  (2) Timely information regarding the court's operations and \nprocessing of cases; and\n  (3) Sufficient financial resources to initiate and sustain reform.\n  The Strengthening Abuse and Neglect Courts Act of 1999 incorporates \nall of these elements. The bill provides competitive grants to courts \nto create computerized case tracking systems and to encourage the \nreplication and implementation of successful systems in other courts. \nThe bill also provides grants to courts to reduce pending backlogs of \nabuse and neglect cases so that courts are able to comply with the time \nlines established in the Adoption and Safe Families Act.\n  The bill also includes a provision to allow judges, attorneys and \ncourt personnel to qualify for training under Title IV-E's existing \ntraining provisions. Finally, the bill includes a provision that would \nexpand the CASA program to underserved and urban areas so that more \nchildren are able to benefit from its services.\n  When Congress passed the Adoption and Safe Families Act, I said that \nthe bill is a good start, but that Congress will have to do more to \nmake sure that every child has the opportunity to live in a safe, \nstable, loving and permanent home. One of the essential ingredients in \nthis process is an efficiently operating court system. After all, \nthat's where a lot of delays occur. As well-intentioned as the strict \ntime lines of the Adoption and Safe Families Act are, mandatory filing \ndates won't be enough to promote permanency if the court docket is too \nclogged to move the cases through the system. We need to provide \nassistance to the courts so that administrative efficiency and \neffectiveness are improved and the goals of the Adoption and Safe \nFamilies Act will be more readily achieved. I encourage my colleagues \nto support this legislation and I am committed to pushing for its \ntimely consideration.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 708\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Strengthening Abuse and \n     Neglect Courts Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Under both Federal and State law, the courts play a \n     crucial and essential role in the Nation's child welfare \n     system and in ensuring safety, stability, and permanence for \n     abused and neglected children under the supervision of that \n     system.\n       (2) The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 (Public Law \n     105-89; 111 Stat. 2115) establishes explicitly for the first \n     time in Federal law that a child's health and safety must be \n     the paramount consideration when any decision is made \n     regarding a child in the Nation's child welfare system.\n       (3) The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 promotes \n     stability and permanence for abused and neglected children by \n     requiring timely decision-making in proceedings to determine \n     whether children can safely return to their families or \n     whether they should be moved into safe and stable adoptive \n     homes or other permanent family arrangements outside the \n     foster care system.\n       (4) To avoid unnecessary and lengthy stays in the foster \n     care system, the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 \n     specifically requires, among other things, that States move \n     to terminate the parental rights of the parents of those \n     children who have been in foster care for 15 of the last 22 \n     months.\n       (5) While essential to protect children and to carry out \n     the general purposes of the Adoption and Safe Families Act of \n     1997, the accelerated timelines for the termination of \n     parental rights and the other requirements imposed under that \n     Act increase the pressure on the Nation's already \n     overburdened abuse and neglect courts.\n\n[[Page S3264]]\n\n       (6) The administrative efficiency and effectiveness of the \n     Nation's abuse and neglect courts would be substantially \n     improved by the acquisition and implementation of \n     computerized case-tracking systems to identify and eliminate \n     existing backlogs, to move abuse and neglect caseloads \n     forward in a timely manner, and to move children into safe \n     and stable families. Such systems could also be used to \n     evaluate the effectiveness of such courts in meeting the \n     purposes of the amendments made by, and provisions of, the \n     Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997.\n       (7) The administrative efficiency and effectiveness of the \n     Nation's abuse and neglect courts would also be improved by \n     the identification and implementation of projects designed to \n     eliminate the backlog of abuse and neglect cases, including \n     the temporary hiring of additional judges, extension of court \n     hours, and other projects designed to reduce existing \n     caseloads.\n       (8) The administrative efficiency and effectiveness of the \n     Nation's abuse and neglect courts would be further \n     strengthened by improving the quality and availability of \n     training for judges, court personnel, agency attorneys, \n     guardians ad litem, volunteers who participate in court-\n     appointed special advocate (CASA) programs, and attorneys who \n     represent the children and the parents of children in abuse \n     and neglect proceedings.\n       (9) While recognizing that abuse and neglect courts in this \n     country are already committed to the quality administration \n     of justice, the performance of such courts would be even \n     further enhanced by the development of models and educational \n     opportunities that reinforce court projects that have already \n     been developed, including models for case-flow procedures, \n     case management, representation of children, automated \n     interagency interfaces, and ``best practices'' standards.\n       (10) Judges, magistrates, commissioners, and other judicial \n     officers play a central and vital role in ensuring that \n     proceedings in our Nation's abuse and neglect courts are run \n     efficiently and effectively. The performance of those \n     individuals in such courts can only be further enhanced by \n     training, seminars, and an ongoing opportunity to exchange \n     ideas with their peers.\n       (11) Volunteers who participate in court-appointed special \n     advocate (CASA) programs play a vital role as the eyes and \n     ears of abuse and neglect courts in proceedings conducted by, \n     or under the supervision of, such courts and also bring \n     increased public scrutiny of the abuse and neglect court \n     system. The Nation's abuse and neglect courts would benefit \n     from an expansion of this program to currently underserved \n     communities.\n       (12) Improved computerized case-tracking systems, \n     comprehensive training, and development of, and education on, \n     model abuse and neglect court systems, particularly with \n     respect to underserved areas, would significantly further the \n     purposes of the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 by \n     reducing the average length of an abused and neglected \n     child's stay in foster care, improving the quality of \n     decision-making and court services provided to children and \n     families, and increasing the number of adoptions.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I rise today to join Mr. \nDeWine in his introduction of the Strengthening Abuse and Neglect \nCourts Act. I would like to thank Mr. DeWine for his leadership on \nbehalf of vulnerable children, including our bipartisan work on this \nlegislation. Work on this legislation is based on the bipartisan work \nof the Senate coalition that supported the 1997 Adoption and Safe \nFamilies Act.\n  A unique bipartisan coalition formed in 1997 worked hard to forge \nconsensus on the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997. This law, for \nthe first time ever, establishes that a child's health and safety must \nbe paramount when any decisions are made regarding children in the \nabuse and neglect system. The law was the most sweeping and \ncomprehensive piece of child welfare legislation passed in over a \ndecade. It promotes safety, stability and permanence for all abused and \nneglected children and requires timely decision-making in all \nproceedings to determine whether children can safely return home, or \nwhether they should be moved to permanent, adoptive homes. More \nspecifically, the law requires a State to move to terminate the \nparental rights of any parent whose child has been in foster care for \n15 out of the last 22 months.\n\n[[Page S3267]]\n\n  Throughout the process of developing the Adoption Act we heard about \nthe vital role the Nation's abuse and neglect courts play in achieving \nthe goals of safety and permanence for children. We also heard that \nthese courts were seriously overburdened and challenged by insufficient \nresources. Now, nearly a year and a half after the passage of the law, \ncourts are struggling to meet the guidelines. Judges and child welfare \nprofessionals in my state of West Virginia tell me that the law is \nhelping move children through the system more quickly, that the \naccelerated timelines are, indeed, essential for the protection of \nchildren, and that the effect of this is that the courts are becoming \neven more overburdened. We are hearing this same type of feedback from \nother judges and child advocates around the country.\n  These courts--and the judges, lawyers and other court personnel--make \nsome of the most difficult and important decisions made by any members \nof the judiciary. Adjudications of abuse and neglect, terminations of \nparental rights, approval of adoptions, and life-changing \ndeterminations require the appropriate level of information, \nthoughtfulness and care. Judges throughout the country, like West \nVirginia's Chief Justice Margaret Workman, are committed to the fair \nand efficient administration of justice in these cases. In 1987, just \nover 2 million children, nationally, were reported or neglected. By \n1997, this number had swelled to well over 3 million children. During \nthis period, my own state of West Virginia experienced a 100% increase \nin child abuse cases. These staggering increases in child abuse have \nplaced an unconscionable burden on these courts.\n\n  Working within their own communities, judges, attorneys, volunteers \nfrom the Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) programs and others \nhave found creative and effective new ways to eliminate their caseload \nbacklogs and move children more efficiently and safely through the \ncourt system. In West Virginia, Judge Workman and others have developed \na comprehensive plan to increase the accountability and efficient \nadministration of abuse and neglect cases. In Cincinatti, Ohio, Judge \nGrossman's abuse and neglect courts have implemented state-of-the-art \ncomputer tracking systems which help them smooth the legal paths of \nchildren in foster care.\n  Even when courts have the dedication and initiative to implement \nthese innovative reforms, they simply cannot do it without sufficient \nresources. The purpose of the Strengthening Abuse and Neglect Courts \nAct is to help remove the burdens on an ever greater number of courts \nby increasing both their efficiency and their effectiveness. The bill \nprovides much needed resources and allows state and local communities \nthe flexibility to develop their own solutions to administrative \nproblems and caseload backlogs. In January of this year, the General \nAccounting Office released a report conducted at the request of Ways \nand Means Subcommittee on Human Resources Chairman Shaw, which \nconcluded that there are three essential ingredients for successful \ncourt reform, all of which are incorporated in this Act. There are four \nways this bill will help abuse and neglect courts better serve children \nand families.\n  The bill first provides a program of grants to states and local \ncourts for the implementation of computerized case-tracking systems, \nsimilar to the one Judge Grossman created in Ohio. Through the \nestablishment of such systems, courts are able to more easily track how \nlong a child spends in foster care and the status of their cases. When \ncourts have such ``user-friendly'' access to vital case information \nchildren truly benefit--they move more quickly through foster care and \non to adoptive homes or other permanent placements. This grant program \nwill enable state and local courts to design similar computer systems, \nto replicate models that have proven successful in other jurisdictions \nand to receive technical assistance as they implement their new \nprograms.\n  A second important provision of the bill is the grant program that \nprovides State and local courts the resources they need to eliminate \nthe backlog of abuse and neglect cases. Throughout the discussions on \nthe Adoption and Safe Families Act, we heard from dozens of judges and \nadvocates who said that far and away the biggest problem facing their \ncourts was the overwhelming backlog of these cases. Without creative \nways to eliminate these backlogs, and with the tightened timeframes we \ncreated with the new law, the judges emphasized that children's cases \nwill simply not move through the court system in a timely manner. Each \ncourt may have their own effective approach to eliminating such \nbacklogs. For some, hiring additional staff may be necessary. For \nothers, creating a ``Night Court'' or ``Saturday Court'' to hear these \ncases would work. Still others may need to restructure duties of court \npersonnel. This bill will provide grants to those court projects that \nare designed to result in the effective and rapid elimination of \ncurrent backlogs to smooth the way for more efficient courts in the \nfuture.\n\n  The Strengthening Abuse and Neglect Courts Act also recognizes that \njudges, attorneys, court personnel, law enforcement representatives, \nguardians-ad-litem and all others who participate in abuse and neglect \nproceedings can benefit from continuing education opportunities, \nimproved training and the development of models for effective practice \nin these settings. The Act, therefore, extends federal reimbursement \nfor training that is currently provided to agency caseworkers to \njudges, attorneys and key court personnel who must make decision \neffecting the lives and future of vulnerable children. In addition to \nthis basic, necessary training for court personnel, we hope it will \nalso foster between cooperation between child welfare agencies and \ncourt personnel that is imperative to make system work to ensure the \nhealth and safety of children.\n  Finally, the bill provides for an expansion of the successful CASA--\nCourt Appointed Special Advocates--volunteer program. This superb \nvolunteer program has demonstrated its ability to improve outcomes for \nabused and neglected children. CASA are volunteers specially trained to \nspeak for the best interests of children who have been abused or \nneglected. There are over 710 CASA programs nationwide, whose \nvolunteers represented nearly 200,000 children last year alone. \nRecently, the Department of Justice recognized CASA as an ``Exemplary \nProgram''. CASA has been operating in West Virginia since 1991 with \nprograms currently serving children in 13 of our counties. Of course, \nthere is more work to be done so that children in all 55 West Virginia \ncounties, and all under-served areas throughout the country can benefit \nfrom the services of these trained and dedicated volunteers. In fact, \ndespite CASA's phenomenal volunteer commitment and national praise by \ncourts, and community leaders, 70% of the children in foster care are \nstill without CASA representation. This bill will begin to address this \ngap by providing a $5 million grant to expand its programs into under-\nserved areas and to improve its ability to recruit, train and supervise \nvolunteers.\n  When we talk about how to help abused and neglected children in this \ncountry, our abuse and neglect courts are too often left out of the \ndiscussion. With the numbers of abused and neglected children rising \ndramatically--in West Virginia alone child abuse reports have doubled--\nfrom 13,000 in 1986 to over 26,000 in 1996--we need to include every \nsystem in our efforts to make a difference. The courts play a crucial \nrole and I am confident that the Strengthening Abuse and Neglect Courts \nAct will be a valuable step in making our courts stronger, more \nefficient and more able to effectively address the needs of our \nNation's most vulnerable children. I ask that my colleagues join us in \nthis important effort.\n  I ask that a fact sheet about the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n        Fact Sheet--Strengthening Abuse and Neglect Act of 1999\n\n       A bill to improve the administrative efficiency and \n     effectiveness of the Nation's abuse and neglect courts and \n     the quality and availability of training for judges, \n     attorneys, and volunteers working in such courts, and for \n     other purposes consistent with the Adoption and Safe Families \n     Act of 1997.\n\n\n          section 1, 3, & 3: title, findings, and definitions\n\n       The Strengthening Abuse and Neglect Courts Act of 1999\n\n[[Page S3268]]\n\n Section 4: grants to courts for computer automation and case tracking \n                                systems\n\n       A program to provide competitive state and local grants to \n     abuse and neglect courts to create computerized case tracking \n     systems, and to encourage the replication and implementation \n     of successful systems in other court systems.

I am pleased that this legislation is co-sponsored by the \nMinority Leader, Senator Daschle.\n  The bill authorizes up to $100 million a year in grant aid from 2000 \nthrough 2006 for any communities across the nation with populations of \nless than 10,000 which face electric rates in excess of 150 percent of \nthe national average retail price. The money can go for electricity \nsystem improvements, energy efficiency and weatherization efforts, \nwater and sanitation improvements or work to solve leaking fuel storage \ntanks.\n  The bill also amends the Rural Electrification Act to authorize Rural \nand Remote Electrification Grants of an additional $20 million a year \nto the same communities. The grants can be used to increase energy \nefficiency, lower electricity rates or provide for the modernization of \nelectric facilities.\n  The bill also establishes a new program providing rural recovery \ncommunity development block grants. This will provide for the \ndevelopment and maintenance of viable rural areas through the provision \nof affordable housing and community development assistance for rural \nareas with excessively high rates of outmigration and low per capita \nincome levels.\n  This nation has well-established programs for community development \ngrants. The majority of these programs were established to help resolve \nthe very real problems found in this Nation's urban areas. However, our \nmost rural and remote communities experience different, but equally \nreal, problems that are not addressed by existing law. Not only are \nthese communities generally ineligible for the existing programs, their \nunique challenges, while sometimes similar to those experienced by \nurban areas, require a different focus and approach.\n  The biggest single economic problem facing small communities is the \nexpense of establishing a modern infrastructure. These costs, which are \nalways substantial, are exacerbated in remote and rural areas. The \nexistence of this infrastructure, including efficient housing, \nelectricity, bulk fuel storage, waste water and water service, is a \nnecessity for the health and welfare of our children, the development \nof a prosperous economy and minimizing environmental problems.\n  There is a real cost in human misery and to the health and welfare of \neveryone, especially our children and our elderly from poor or polluted \nwater or bad housing or an inefficient power system. Hepatitis B \ninfections in rural Alaska are five times more common than in urban \nAlaska. We just have to do better if we are to bring our rural \ncommunities into the 21 Century.\n  The experience of many of Alaskans is a perfect example. Most small \ncommunities or villages in Alaska are not interconnected to an \nelectricity grid, and rely upon diesel generators for their \nelectricity. Often, the fuel can only be delivered by barge or \nairplane, and is stored in tanks. These tanks are expensive to \nmaintain, and in many cases, must be completely replaced to prevent \nleakage of fuel into the environment. While the economic and \nenvironmental savings clearly justify the construction of new \nfacilities, these communities simply don't have the ability to raise \nenough capital to make the necessary investments.\n  As a result, these communities are forced to bear an oppressive \neconomic and environmental burden that can be eased with a relatively \nsmall investment on the part of the Federal government. I can give you \nsome examples: in Manley Hot Springs, Alaska, the citizens pay almost \n70 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity. In Igiugig, Kokhanok, \nAkiachak Native Community, and Middle Kuskokwim, consumers all pay over \n50 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity. The national average is \naround 7 cents per kilowatt hour.\n  Further, in Alaska, for example, many rural villages still lack \nmodern water and sewer sanitation systems taken for granted in all \nother areas of America. According to a Federal Field Working Group, 190 \nof the state's villages have ``unsafe\" sanitation systems, 135 villages \nstill using ``honey buckets'' for waste disposal. Only 31 villages have \na fully safe, piped water system; 71 villages having only one central \nwatering source.\n  These are not only an Alaskan problem. The highest electricity rates \nin America are paid by a small community in Missouri, and communities \nin Maine, as well as islands in Rhode Island and New York will likely \nqualify for this program. Providing safe drinking water and adequate \nwaste treatment facilities is a problem for very small communities all \nacross this land.\n  What will this Act do to address these problems? First, the Act \nauthorizes $100 million per year for the years 2000-2006 for block \ngrants to communities of under 10,000 inhabitants who pay more than \n150% of the national average retail price for electricity.\n  The grants will be allocated by the Secretary of Housing and \nUrban Development among eligible communities proportionate to cost of \nelectricity in the community, as compared to the National average. The \ncommunities may use the grants only for the following eligible \nactivities:\n\n       Low-cost weatherization of homes and other buildings;\n       Construction and repair of electrical generation, \n     transmission, distribution, and related facilities;\n       Construction, remediation and repair of bulk fuel storage \n     facilities;\n       Facilities and training to reduce costs of maintaining and \n     operating electrical generation, distribution, transmission, \n     and related facilities;\n\n[[Page S3269]]\n\n       Professional management and maintenance for electrical \n     generation, distribution and transmission, and related \n     facilities;\n       Investigation of the feasibility of alternate energy \n     services;\n       Construction, operation, maintenance and repair of water \n     and waste water services;\n       Acquisition and disposition of real property for eligible \n     activities and facilities; and\n       Development of an implementation plan, including \n     administrative costs for eligible activities and facilities.\n\n  In addition this bill will amend the Rural Electrification Act of \n1936 to authorize Rural and Remote Electrification Grants for $20 \nmillion per year for years 2000-2006 for grants to qualified borrowers \nunder the Act that are in rural and remote communities who pay more \nthan 150% of the national average retail price for electricity. These \ngrants can be used to increase energy efficiency, lower electricity \nrates, or provide or modernize electric facilities.\n  This Act makes a significant step toward resolving the critical \nsocial, economic and environmental problems faced by our Nation's rural \nand remote communities. I encourage my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n  For the information of the Senate and the public, the bill can also \nbe obtained from the Internet at: http://thomas.loc.gov.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 709\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nhelp address the economic malaise that has gripped certain rural and \nremote areas of our country and the problems arising from the high cost \nof developing and maintaining infrastructure in remote communities. The \nlegislation will provide grants to rural communities suffering from \nout-migration and low per-capita income and will help ensure that \nremote communities are not unfairly penalized by the high cost of \nservices, such as water, waste water, fuel and utility services. I want \nto thank my colleague from Alaska, Senator Murkowski, for his work on \nthis legislation. His contribution in addressing these problems is most \nwelcome.\n  Rural areas of our Nation continue to experience vast fluctuations in \ntheir economic well-being due to their dependence on worldwide \nagricultural markets. The link between global economic forces and local \neconomic conditions is nowhere as pronounced as it is in rural America. \nAnd yet, rural communities are often those least capable of weathering \nthe severe periodic downturns that occur in global markets.\n  Statistics bear out these fluctuations in economic activity, but they \nfail to fully capture the human suffering that lies just beyond the \nnumbers. Economic downturns lead to the migration away from farm-\ndependent, rural communities, further stifling economic opportunities \nfor those left behind. The 1990 Census highlighted these migratory \ntrends, and I anticipate that similar trends will be captured by the \nupcoming Census, as well.\n  In short, the bandwagon of prosperity that has carried many Americans \nalong through the past decade has left many rural areas standing by the \nwayside. If this trend continues, more and more young people will be \nforced to leave the towns they grew up in for opportunities in urban \nareas. In towns like Webster, Sisseton, and White River, South Dakota, \nwe are seeing farm families broken up, populations decline, and main \nstreet businesses close their doors. While there is no doubt that \neconomic growth in our urban areas has benefited our Nation, the \ndisparity of economic development between our rural and urban areas \ncannot be ignored. If nothing is done to address the economic \nchallenges facing these areas, we will jeopardize the future of rural \nAmerica.\n  That is why Senator Murkowski and I are introducing legislation to \nprovide the Nation's rural areas with the resources necessary to make \ncritical investments in their future and, by doing so, to create \neconomic opportunities that will help them sustain a valuable and \nimportant way of life. While Federal agencies, such as the United \nStates Department of Agriculture's Office of Rural Development and the \nEconomic Development Administration, provide assistance for rural \ndevelopment purposes, there are no Federal programs that provide a \nsteady source of funding for rural areas most affected by severe out-\nmigration and low per-capita income. For these areas, the process of \neconomic development is often most arduous. The Rural and Remote \nCommunity Fairness Act of 1999 will provide the basic, long-term \nassistance necessary to aid the coordinated efforts of local community \nleaders as they begin economic recovery efforts to ensure a bright \nfuture for rural America.\n  Specifically, the Rural and Remote Community Fairness Act of 1999 \nwill provide a minimum of $200,000 per year to counties and Indian \ntribes with (1) out-migration levels of one percent or more over a \nfive-year period, (2) per-capita income levels that are below the \nnational average, and (3) borders that are not adjacent to a \nmetropolitan area. This legislation authorizes the United States \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development to set aside $50 million in \nCommunity Development Block Grant funding for this purpose. The money, \nwhich is already included in the agency's budget, will be allocated on \na formula basis to rural counties and Indian tribes suffering from out-\nmigration and low-per capita income levels.\n  County and tribal governments will be able to use this federal \nfunding to improve their industrial parks, purchase land for \ndevelopment, build affordable housing and create economic recovery \nstrategies according to their needs. All of these important steps will \nhelp rural communities address their economic problems and plan for \nlong-term growth and development.\n  In addition to addressing the problems of out-migration from low per-\ncapita income areas, this legislation also focuses on the unique \nproblems associated with those communities located in areas with high \nenergy costs. Specifically, the legislation sets aside $100,000,000 for \nweatherization efforts, the construction of cost-efficient power \nfacilities and fuel storage facilities, energy management programs, \nwater and waste water facilities, the acquisition or disposition of \nreal property for rural and remote development activities, and for the \nimplementation of a comprehensive rural and remote development plan.\n  Mr. President, the Rural and Remote Community Fairness Act of 1999 \nholds great potential for revitalizing many of\n\n[[Page S3272]]\n\nour nation's most neglected and vulnerable areas. I urge my colleagues \nto support its enactment this Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LOTT (for himself, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Breaux, Mr. \n        Hutchinson, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Craig, and Mr. Murkowski):\n  S. 710. A bill to authorize the feasibility study on the preservation \nof certain Civil War battlefields along the Vicksburg Campaign Trail; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n     vicksburg campaign trail battlefields preservation act of 1999\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr, President, on February 20, 1899, the 56th Congress took \nan important step toward preserving one of our nation's most \nsignificant historical resources when it established the Vicksburg \nNational Military Park. The campaign and siege at Vicksburg, the \n``Gibraltar of the Confederacy,'' was a pivotal moment in American \nHistory. As the gateway to the Mississippi River, the region was of \nvital strategic importance to both the South and the North. For this \nreason, the Vicksburg engagement is heralded as one of the most \nbrilliant offensive campaigns ever fought on U.S. soil.\n  Every year, the Vicksburg National Military Park plays host to over \none million visitors who are able to take advantage of this national \nhistoric treasure. Like many other National Parks, Vicksburg \ncontributes to the cultural, recreational, scenic, and economic \nvitality of the region.\n  As America celebrates the centennial anniversary of the Park's \nfounding, it is important to recognize that a number of other campaign \nrelated sites throughout Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, and \nTennessee, used by both the Union and Confederate Armies during the \n1862 to 1863 Vicksburg conflict, are in desperate need of study, \ninterpretation, management, and protection.\n  These are sites that have been listed as historically significant \nproperties on both state and national registries. Unfortunately, many \nof these same sites, buildings, fortifications, earthworks, and other \nlandmarks along the Vicksburg Campaign Trail route have been identified \nby the National Trust for Historic Preservation as being among the 11 \nmost endangered historic places in America. The Mississippi Heritage \nTrust, based in Jackson, also named the Campaign Trail as one of its \nhighest priorities and placed the Vicksburg Trail on its list of most \nthreatened historic areas in the state.\n  Mr. President, that is why I am introducing legislation today to \nauthorize the Park Service to conduct a feasibility study on the \nVicksburg Campaign Trail. A study that will identify options for \npreserving some of our nation's most important Civil War battlefields \nand sites.\n  At the outbreak of the American Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln \ngathered his ranking civil and military leaders to develop a strategy \nfor ending the war. While seated around a large table examining a map \nof the nation, Lincoln made a wide sweeping gesture with his hand, and \nthen placed his finger on the map at Vicksburg. He said, ``See what a \nlot of land these fellows hold of which Vicksburg is the key. The war \ncan never be brought to a close until that key is in our pocket.''\n  It was a crucial for the Federal government to regain control of the \nlower Mississippi River. The goal was to enable troops, supplies and \ncommerce to flow unhindered from the Northwest. Taking the Gibraltar of \nthe Confederacy would sever vital Southern supply routes, achieve a \nmajor objective of the Anaconda Plan, and effectively seal the doom of \nthe Confederate capital in Richmond.\n  Even with Major General Ulysses S. Grant leading the charge, \nVicksburg would prove a tough nut to crack. Its powerful Southern \nbatteries were trained on the river and an 8 mile-long swath of \nearthworks guarded all land based approaches. The reinforced line \nconsisted of nine major forts connected by trenches and rifle pits \nmanned by a garrison of 30,000 troops and 172 mounted guns. These \nfortifications posed the greatest challenge to Union domination of the \nMississippi River.\n  The campaign to capture Vicksburg, to ``pocket the key'' to Union \nvictory, lasted 18 months and involved more than 100,000 soldiers. It \nwas here that entire regiments of black soldiers wore the uniform of \nthe United States Army for only the second time in American history. \nThe battle of Vicksburg also involved a number of historic naval \nengagements between Union gunboats and Confederate warships.\n  After months of frustration and failure to capture the Confederate \nbastion, General Grant marched his force of over 45,000 men down the \nwest side of the Mississippi River. With the assistance of the U.S. \nfleet, Union troops crossed the river below Vicksburg and swiftly moved \ndeep into Mississippi. After five fierce battles, the state capital of \nJackson was taken. The Union Army then turned west and marched along \nthe rail line towards Vicksburg. Lt. Gen. John C. Pemberton led the \ndefense of Vicksburg and held the Rebel line for some time. Pemberton \nrefused to succumb to unconditional surrender even after 47 days of \nsiege. He finally relinquished the city on July 4, 1863 after securing \nparoles for his resistance forces.\n  Mr. President, many historians consider the battle of Vicksburg to be \nthe most decisive campaign of the Civil War. It was also the most \ncomplex combined operation ever undertaken by American armed forces \nprior to World War II. In fact, the Vicksburg Campaign is required \nstudy at the United States Military Academy, the Army War College, and \nthe Commanding General Staff College. These are the men and women who \nwill eventually lead our armed forces. Rather than just read about the \nconflict in textbooks, troops from military units throughout the \ncountry ride the battlefields to experience first hand the tactics of \nwar.\n  At a time when the movie ``Saving Private Ryan'' is recognized for \nits true-to-life depiction of the battlefield on Omaha Beach, Normandy, \nFrance, our nation must continue to reflect on the hardships suffered \nhere on our own soil. Those suffered by soldiers and civilians \nthroughout the North and South.\n  The Vicksburg campaign is truly an example of the pathos of war here \non America's shores. Brother fought against brother on opposite sides \nof the battle lines. In defense of ideals each held dear. During the \nsiege, soldiers fed off the land while the civilian population lived \nunderground to escape the constant bombardment of Union guns--enduring \nexposure, sickness, and little food. It was a military operation where \ntens of thousands of lives were lost.\n  Vicksburg is also an illustration of the healing and reunification \nthat followed Reconstruction. Union and Confederate veterans joined \nforces to establish Vicksburg National Military Park. We owe these \nformer combatants a debt of gratitude for their efforts. Not only for \ntheir distinguished bravery during the most trying of times, but also \nfor the vital legacy they left us all.\n  Now it is our solemn duty to safeguard the memory of those who fought \nso dearly during the many battles that occurred to secure Vicksburg by \nstudying the entire campaign trail. For its contribution to our \nunderstanding of the Civil War and for its continued influence on \nAmerican history. This great contest encompassed a vast geographical \nregion. Battle related sites are scattered throughout Mississippi, \nLouisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee. While some landmarks have been lost \nto age and neglect, it is not to late to protect the hundreds of \nremnants associated with the campaign that remain to tell the story.\n  Mr. President, the non-partisan measure offered today is also a key. \nThe key to protecting our national heritage. This bill will begin a \nmuch needed process to protect the integrity of the many historic \nvenues associated with the battle of Vicksburg that still exist. \nLiterally hundreds of miles of roads, fields, and bayous were covered \nby Yankee and Rebel troops during this engagement. To truly understand \nand appreciate this historic conflict, it is important to look beyond \nthe confines of the Vicksburg National Military Park as it exists \ntoday. The 106th Congress needs to build upon the legacy our \nforefathers left us by developing a comprehensive plan leading to the \neventual preservation of the many endangered sites along the four state \ncampaign trail. This Congress needs to authorize this much needed \nstudy--the second key. President Lincoln got the first key over one \nhundred years ago.\n\n[[Page S3273]]\n\n Now that 136 years have past, the current President needs the second \nkey.\n  Without Congressional action, historians, soldiers, re-enactors, and \ntourists will forever lose direct access to the many at-risk landmarks \nand battlefields along the Vicksburg campaign route that have not yet \ndisappeared. Sites, that while inexorably linked by time and honor, \nwill simply vanish into the wind without the development of coordinated \nand comprehensive preservation strategies. Sites where the true \nexperience of history will only be left to words.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join with me in support of this \nnon-partisan measure. Let us take this first and necessary step to \nprotect our national heritage for those who have gone before us and for \nthose yet to come.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 710\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to allow for the investment of joint Federal and State \nfunds from the civil settlement of damages from the Exxon Valdez oil \nspill, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n    civil settlement of damages from the ``exxon valdez'' oil spill\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we are ten years older, but are \nwe ten years wiser since the Exxon Valdez oil spill?\n  With the anniversary of the Nation's worst oil spill occurring today, \nthe question most asked by national media is how the environment and \nwildlife of Alaska has fared. In fact, just last week on a ``60 \nminutes'' story this exact question was asked. It was asked not only by \nthe network doing the story, but by the Alaskans being interviewed.\n  What's particularly frustrating is that in many cases it is still not \npossible to give informed answers.\n  In the years since 11.3 million gallons of crude oil bubbled into the \nsea, the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill (EVOS) Trustees Council has had nearly \n$800 million of the eventual $900 million that Exxon will pay at their \ndisposal to fund scientific studies. Those studies should have \ndetermined the health of marine life, wildlife and the ecosystem of \nPrince William Sound. But according to the latest summary of scientific \nstudies, while it is possible to say that some species have or are \nrecovering, it is not possible to give a full accounting.\n  According to a report from the council last month very little is \nknown about the health of cutthroat trout, Dolly Varden, rockfish or \nKittlitz's murrelets. And there is only slightly more information on \nthe health of killer whales, pigeon guillemots, cormorants, and common \nloon, harbor seals and harlequin ducks.\n  While it is heartening that the Sound appears to be recovering sooner \nthan many thought likely, and that herring and salmon stocks are \nrecovering as\n\n[[Page S3274]]\n\nare bald eagles and river otters, it is frustrating that more hard \nscientific data has not been gathered.\n  That is why, Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation, on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Stevens, that will provide for more \nscience to be done on the impacted spill area. The legislation I am \nintroducing will allow for a higher rate of interest to be earned \nthrough outside investments of the settlement funds from the Exxon \nValdez oil spill.\n  The legislation specifies that the interest on investments received \nunder this new authority must be used to support marine research and \neconomic restoration projects for the fishing industry and local \nfishermen. If the trustees choose to use this authority, an additional \n$20 million to $30 million could be generated for research and \nrestoration between now and 2001.\n  The legislation further requires the trustees to present a report to \nCongress recommending a structure the trustees believe would be most \neffective and appropriate for the administration and expenditure of \nremaining funds and interest received. This provision is also \nconsistent with comments from the public suggesting that an independent \nscience-oriented board should control the process of funding science \nprojects, rather than trustees who represent agencies that may be \nseeking project funding.\n  I, for one, believe the Council's priorities have been misplaced \nwhich has necessitated this legislation. They have been unwilling to \nadmit that science does not yet provide many mitigation answers; \ninstead, the spill trustees have decided to go on a land buying spree \nas an alternative.\n  This is a mistake, Mr. President.\n  In a State where 68 percent of all land is federally owned and where \nindividuals own less than 1 percent of all property, the trustees have \nallocated $416 million of the initial $900 million court settlement \njust for land acquisitions. They have nearly completed the purchase of \n647,000 acres in and around Prince William Sound and just recently \nvoted to set aside an additional $55 million to fund acquisitions, \nliterally, forever even though most of the land being bought was not \ndirectly affected by the spill.\n  Alaska Natives worked for decades to win the 1971 land settlement \nthat gave them control of 44 million acres of Alaska. Now, in less than \na quarter of a century, Natives have lost much of the land they had \nfought to gain--a good part of the Native lands in the region have been \nreacquired through the actions of the trustees. It is ironic, indeed, \nthat the United States purchased Alaska for $7.2 million in 1867 and \nthat 60 times more money already has been committed to buy back parts \nof it.\n  Back in 1994 when $600 million of the settlement was still \nuncommitted, I urged the trustees to commit the bulk of the settlement \nto a ``permanent fund'' that would provide a perpetual source of \nsignificant funding for research or mitigation projects. I also urged \nthe trustees to utilize the expertise of the University of Alaska in \nundertaking those studies. I warned that if too much funding was \nallocated to land acquisition, or spent on marginal science, less money \nwould be available to fund sound studies to shed light on the mysteries \naffecting commercial and sport fisheries and marine life and wildlife \nin the Sound.\n  In the intervening years we have seen General Accounting Office \naudits documenting that the trustees have pad on average 56 percent \nabove government-appraised value for the lands it has acquired. We've \nseen a situation this year where the trustees paid nearly $80 million \nfor lands on Kodiak Island, while the Department of the Interior set \nthe value of those same lands at about one-third that amount when it \ncame to funding revenue sharing payments to the Kodiak Island Borough.\n  While the trustees recently voted to place about $115 million of the \nsettlement aside to provide interest to fund future scientific studies, \nI believe the earnings from all of the roughly $170 million still owed \nby Exxon should be devoted to pay for marine research and monitoring \nincluding applied fisheries research. I believe this approach will give \nus answers, not leave us guessing, about what is happening to the Sound \nand what we can do to improve the habitat of the region. The \nlegislation we introduce today will begin to address this need.\n  Long after the Sound has healed its wounds, those lands bought by the \ntrustees will be lost forever to economic activity and to the Native \nheritage. Nowhere could this be clearer than the example of one Native \ncorporation that agreed to sell its lands with the intent to invest in \na perpetual trust to help children go to school and provide solutions \nto other problems. Instead it was pressured to make a one time payment \nto each shareholder.\n  The longest-lasting legacy of the tragedy may be that some of the \nNatives find themselves like the Biblical Esau who sold his birthright \nto Jacob for a mess of pottage and bread. When the meal was gone so was \nhis heritage. When that one-time payment has been spent, what will have \nbeen gained and what will pass on to their children?\n  Today, another tragedy is clear, we still do not have the answers to \nthe effects of the spill, even though we had the wherewithal to have \nobtained them.\n  Mr. President, immediately following the spill, I sponsored a \nprovision in the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, which was passed by \nCongress, to create Regional Citizens Advisory Councils, giving local \nresidents the authority and the resources to improve all aspects of oil \ntransport planning and cleanup. Patterned after a concept then in place \nat the Port of Sullom Voe in the North Sea's Shetland Islands, there is \nno question that the oversight and creativity that the councils \nengendered have done the most to make Alaska's oil transportation \nsystem the best in the world.\n  It is time for Congress to act again today, to ensure that we have \nthe resources to obtain the best science available in understanding \nPrince William Sound. I believe this bill will allow us to do just \nthat.\n Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I join Senator Murkowski in \nintroducing this bill to allow greater interest to be earned on funds \nfrom the civil settlement between Exxon and the State of Alaska and the \nFederal Government resulting from the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. This \nis another silver lining from the spill.\n  Under the civil settlement, Exxon has paid $900 million to the State \nof Alaska and Federal Government. The settlement established the Exxon \nValdez Oil Spill Trustee Council to administer these funds. The Trustee \nCouncil is comprised of three Federal and three State representatives.\n  While I disagree with the Council's decisions to spend much of the \nfunds to acquire land in Alaska, I was pleased by their decision on \nMarch 1, 1999 to dedicate $115 million for an endowment for marine \nresearch, monitoring, and restoration.\n  Our bill would allow the Council to invest these funds outside the \ncourt registry, where it would earn greater interest than under the \ncourt's authority. The bill is similar to the legislation we pursued \nduring the 105th Congress. We are encouraged that the Trustee Council \nhas directed its Executive Director to work with us on this measure, \nand we will keep an open mind when those discussions begin.\n  I also intend to explore whether we can merge the EVOS research \nendowment with the North Pacific Marine Research endowment I created \nlast year with funds received by the Federal Government in the case \ninvolving Dinkum Sands oil lease revenue. The EVOS funds can only be \nused in the spill area, while the Dinkum Sands funds can be used for \nresearch relating to any of the marine waters off Alaska. Merging the \ntwo would maximize research benefits for Alaska and the Nation, and \nminimize potential duplication.\n  In 1997, we established the 19-member North Pacific Research Board to \nprepare the marine research plan for the Dinkum Sands funds. In 1998, \nhowever, during the first year of funding, we simplified the approach \nso that the University of Alaska has the responsibility for preparing \nthe plan, and the plan must then be approved by the State of Alaska, \nthe Department of the Interior, and the Department of Commerce. Our \ngoal is to update the North Pacific Research Board so that the \nUniversity will have the central role, but the other entities on the \nNorth Pacific Marine Research Board will also have an advisory role in \nthe long term in setting the research priorities.\n  During our work on this, we will also see whether it is possible to \nmerge the\n\n[[Page S3275]]\n\nEVOS research endowment with the Dinkum Sands endowment. The bill that \nSenator Murkowski and I are introducing is the critical piece of the \npuzzle that will allow greater interest to be earned on the EVOS marine \nresearch endowment whether or not we are ultimately able to merge the \ntwo.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  By Mr. LOTT (for himself, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Breaux, and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 712. A bill to amend title 39, United States Code, to allow postal \npatrons to contribute to funding for highway-rail grade crossing safety \nthrough the voluntary purchase of certain specially issued United \nStates postage stamps; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                THE ``LOOK, LISTEN, AND LIVE STAMP ACT''\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today I, along with Senators Hutchison, \nBreaux, and Wyden, introduce the ``Look, Listen, and Live Stamp Act.'' \nThis bill would authorize the U.S. Postal Service to establish a \nspecial-rate postage stamp to promote highway-rail grade crossing \nsafety.\n  There are approximately 150,000 public crossings in America today, \nthe majority of which are equipped with only passive warning devices. \nIn 1998, there were 3,446 grade-crossing collisions involving motor \nvehicles resulting in 1,950 serious injuries and 422 deaths. A motorist \nis 40 times more likely to die in a crash involving a train than in a \ncollision involving another motor vehicle. Most recently, this nation \nwitnessed the horror of the Amtrak grade-crossing collision in \nBourbonnais, Illinois last week.\n  Sadly, Mr. President, grade-crossing deaths are preventable. \nUnfortunately, the cost of separating or eliminating all of these \ncrossings would run into the trillions of dollars, and even the cost of \nequipping every crossing with the most effective active warning devices \nwould run into the billions of dollars. While the railroad industry and \nFederal, state, and local governments are slowly reducing the number of \ngrade-crossings and improving others, the process will take decades to \ncomplete. Also, about half of all collisions at highway-rail grade \ncrossings occur at crossings equipped with active warning systems in \nplace: flashing lights, bells and gates.\n  To save lives now, we must intensify our efforts to educate our \ncitizens on the hazards of, and proper method for, crossing a railroad \ntrack. The ``Look, Listen, and Live Stamp Act'' would promote this \nworthy cause in two ways. First, the stamp itself, and its display in \npost offices throughout America, would serve as a reminder to all to \ntreat the crossing of a railroad track as a life or death situation. \nSecond, it would provide an additional source of revenue to the \nDepartment of Transportation to fund Operation Lifesaver programs. \nOperation Lifesaver is non-profit, nationwide public education program \ndedicated to reducing collisions, injuries, and fatalities at \nintersections where America's roadways meet railways and along railroad \nrights-of-way. ``Look, Listen, and Live'' is an Operation Lifesaver \nslogan intended to remind motor vehicle drivers how to protect their \nlives when they approach a highway-rail grade crossing.\n  Mr. President, the bill would authorize the U.S. Postal Service to \nsell the stamp at up to 25 percent more than the cost of a first-class \nstamp, with the difference going to the Department of Transportation to \nprovide additional Operation Lifesaver funding. U.S. Postal Service \ncustomers could choose to buy these special stamps, and thereby \ncontribute to this worthy cause, or continue to purchase regular first-\nclass stamps at the going rate. The choice would be theirs. Most \nimportantly, the stamp will provide a constant reminder of the need to \nexercise caution in crossing railroad tracks. Public memory of the \nBourbonnais, Illinois incident, and similar fatal collisions, will fade \nas media interest shifts to new topics. Operation Lifesaver's public \nawareness programs are an effort to change driver behavior, but \nadditional reminders, such as this stamp, are required.\n  The lives lost by a driver's careless crossing of a railroad track \nare usually those in the motor vehicle, but many times include the \npassengers and crew members of the train. Even when the train crew \nsurvives, they are haunted by the memories of helplessly watching these \nneedless deaths. This is a nationwide problem, but a March 22, 1999, \nUSA Today article detailed the dangers of this problem in my home state \nof Mississippi. I want to dedicate this bill to the families of the \nvictims of the Amtrak ``City of New Orleans'' collision in Bourbonnais \nlast week, especially to the families of the five victims from \nMississippi: June Bonnin and Jessica Tickle of Nesbit, Mississippi, \nLacey Lipscomb and Rainey Lipscomb of Lake Cormorant, Mississippi, and \nSheena Dowe of Jackson, Mississippi.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this \nbill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 712\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND SENSE OF SENATE REGARDING SEQUENTIAL \n                   BILLING POLICY FOR HOME HEALTH PAYMENTS UNDER \n                   THE MEDICARE PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) Section 4611 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 \n     included a provision that transfers financial responsibility \n     for certain home health visits under the medicare program \n     under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 \n     et seq.) from part A to part B of such program.\n       (2) The sole intent of the transfer described in paragraph \n     (1) was to extend the solvency of the Federal Hospital \n     Insurance Trust Fund under section 1817 of such Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 1395i).\n       (3) The transfer described in paragraph (1) was supposed be \n     ``seamless'' so as not to disrupt the provision of home \n     health services under the medicare program.\n       (4) The Health Care Financing Administration has imposed a \n     sequential billing policy that prohibits home health agencies \n     under the medicare program from submitting claims for \n     reimbursement for home health services provided to a \n     beneficiary unless all claims for reimbursement for home \n     health services that were previously provided to such \n     beneficiary have been completely resolved.\n       (5) The Health Care Financing Administration has also \n     expanded medical reviews of claims for reimbursement \n     submitted by home health agencies, resulting in a significant \n     slowdown nationwide in the processing of such claims.\n       (6) The sequential billing policy described in paragraph \n     (4), coupled with the slowdown in claims processing described \n     in paragraph (5), has substantially increased the cash flow \n     problems of home health agencies because payments are often \n     delayed by at least 3 months.\n       (7) The vast majority of home health agencies under the \n     medicare program are small businesses that cannot operate \n     with significant cash flow problems.\n       (8) There are many other elements under the medicare \n     program relating to home health agencies, such as the interim \n     payment system under section 1861(v)(1)(L) of such Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 1395x(v)(1)(L)), that are creating financial problems \n     for home health agencies, thereby forcing more than 2,200 \n     home health agencies nationwide to close since the date of \n     enactment of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Health Care Financing Administration should--\n       (1) evaluate and monitor the use of the sequential billing \n     policy (as described in subsection (a)(4)) in making payments \n     to home health agencies under the medicare program under \n     title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et \n     seq.);\n       (2) ensure that--\n       (A) contract fiscal intermediaries under the medicare \n     program are timely in their random medical review of claims \n     for reimbursement submitted by home health agencies; and\n       (B) such intermediaries adhere to Health Care Financing \n     Administration instructions that limit the number of claims \n     for reimbursement held for such review for any particular \n     home health agency to no more than 10 percent of the total \n     number of claims submitted by the agency; and\n       (3) ensure that such intermediaries are considering and \n     implementing constructive alternatives, such as expedited \n     reviews of claims for reimbursement, for home health agencies \n     with no history of billing problems who have cash flow \n     problems due to random medical reviews and sequential \n     billing.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  LEAHY (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 126\n\n  Mr. STEVENS (for Mr. Leahy for himself, Mr. Jeffords, and Ms. \nCollins) proposed an amendment to the bill, S. 544, supra;

FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE PROTECTION OF THE \n                   SOCIAL SECURITY SURPLUSES.\n\n       (a) The Congress finds that--\n        (1) Congress and the President should balance the budget \n     excluding the surpluses generated by the Social Security \n     trust funds;\n       (2) reducing the federal debt held by the public is a top \n     national priority, strongly supported on a bipartisan basis, \n     as evidenced by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's \n     comments that debt reduction ``is a very important element in \n     sustaining economic growth,'' as well as President Clinton's \n     comments that it ``is very, very important that we get the \n     government debt down'' when referencing his own plans to use \n     the budget surplus to reduce federal debt held by the public;\n       (3) according to the Congressional Budget Office, balancing \n     the budget excluding the surpluses generated by the Social \n     Security trust funds will reduce debt held by the public by a \n     total of $1,723,000,000,000 by the end of fiscal year 2009, \n     $417,000,000,000, or 32 per cent, more than it would be \n     reduced under the President's fiscal year 2000 budget \n     submission;\n       (4) further according to the Congressional Budget Office, \n     that the President's budget would actually spend \n     $40,000,000,000 of the Social Security surpluses in fiscal \n     year 2000 on new spending programs, and spend \n     $158,000,000,000 of the Social Security surpluses on new \n     spending programs from fiscal year 2000 through 2004; and\n       (5) Social Security surpluses should be used for Social \n     Security reform or to reduce the debt held by the public and \n     should not be used for other purposes.\n       (b) It is the sense of Congress that the functional totals \n     in this concurrent resolution on the budget assume that \n     Congress shall pass legislation which--\n       (1) Reaffirms the provisions of section 13301 of the \n     Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 that provides that \n     the receipts and disbursements of the Social Security trust \n     funds shall not be counted for the purposes of the budget \n     submitted by the President, the congressional budget, or the \n     Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, \n     and provides for a Point of Order within the Senate against \n     any concurrent resolution on the budget, an amendment \n     thereto, or a conference report thereon that violates that \n     section.\n\n[[Page S3281]]\n\n       (2) Mandates that the Social Security surpluses are used \n     only for the payment of Social Security benefits, Social \n     Security reform or to reduce the federal debt held by the \n     public, and not spent on non-Social Security programs or used \n     to offset tax cuts.\n       (3) Provides for a Senate super-majority Point of Order \n     against any bill, resolution, amendment, motion or conference \n     report that would use Social Security surpluses on anything \n     other than the payment of Social Security benefits, Social \n     Security reform or the reduction of the federal debt held by \n     the public.\n       (4) Ensures that all Social Security benefits are paid on \n     time.\n       (5) Accomodates Social Security reform legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      LAUTENBERG AMENDMENT NO. 144\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG proposed an amendment to the concurrent resolution, S. \nCon.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON PROVIDING ADEQUATE FUNDING \n                   FOR U.S. INTERNATIONAL LEADERSHIP.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) U.S. international leadership is essential to \n     maintaining security and peace for all Americans;\n       (2) such leadership depends on effective diplomacy as well \n     as a strong military;\n       (3) effective diplomacy requires adequate resources both \n     for embassy security and for international programs;\n       (4) in addition to building peace, prosperity and democracy \n     around the world, programs in the International Affairs (150) \n     account serve U.S. interests by ensuring better jobs and a \n     higher standard of living, promoting the health of our \n     citizens and preserving our natural environment, and \n     protecting the rights and safety of those who travel or do \n     business overseas;\n       (5) real spending for International Affairs has declined \n     more than 50 percent since the mid-1980s, at the same time \n     that major new challenges and opportunities have arisen from \n     the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the worldwide \n     trends toward democracy and free markets;\n       (6) current ceilings on discretionary spending will impose \n     severe additional cuts in funding for International Affairs; \n     and\n       (7) improved security for U.S. diplomatic missions and \n     personnel will place further strain on the International \n     Affairs budget absent significant additional resources.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that additional \n     budgetary resources should be identified for function 150 to \n     enable successful U.S. international leadership.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 JOHNSON (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 153\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON (for himself, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Kerry, Mr. \nReid, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Robb, Mrs. \nHutchison, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Inhofe, Ms. Collins, Mr. Hatch, Ms. \nSnowe, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Specter, Mr. Grams, Mr. Craig, Mr. Grassley, \nand Mr. Domenici) proposed an amendment to the concurrent resolution, \nS.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING INCENTIVES FOR SMALL \n                   SAVERS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) in general, the Federal budget will accumulate nearly \n     $800,000,000,000 in non-Social Security surpluses through \n     2009;\n       (2) such a level of surplus afford Congress the opportunity \n     to return a portion to the taxpayers in the form of tax \n     relief;\n       (3) the Federal tax burden is at its highest level in over \n     50 years;\n       (4) personal bankruptcy filings reached a record high in \n     1998 with $40,000,000,000 in debts discharged;\n       (5) the personal savings rate is at record lows not seen \n     since the Great Depression;\n       (6) the personal savings rate was 9 percent of income in \n     1982;\n       (7) the personal savings rate was 5.7 percent of income in \n     1992;\n       (8) the personal savings rate plummeted to 0.5 percent in \n     1998;\n       (9) the personal savings rate could plummet to as low as \n     negative 4.5 percent if current trends do not change;\n       (10) personal savings is important as a means for the \n     American people to prepare for crisis, such as a job loss, \n     health emergency, or some other personal tragedy, or to \n     prepare for retirement;\n       (11) President Clinton recently acknowledged the low rate \n     of personal savings as a concern;\n       (12) raising the starting point for the 28 percent personal \n     income tax bracket by $10,000 over 5 years would move \n     7,000,000 middle-income taxpayers into the lowest income tax \n     bracket;\n       (13) excluding the first $500 from interest and dividends \n     income, or $250 for singles, would enable 30,000,000 low- and \n     middle-income taxpayers to save tax-free and would translate \n     into approximately $1,000,000,000,000 in savings;\n       (14) exempting the first $5,000 in capital gains income \n     from capital gains taxation would mean 10,000,000 low- and \n     middle-income taxpayers would no longer pay capital gains \n     tax;\n       (15) raising the deductible limit for Individual Retirement \n     Account contributions from $2,000 to $3,000, would mean over \n     5,000,000 taxpayers will be better equipped for retirement; \n     and\n       (16) tax relief measures to encourage savings and \n     investments for low- and middle-income savers would mean tax \n     relief for nearly 112,000,000 individual taxpayers by--\n       (A) raising the starting point for the 28 percent personal \n     income tax bracket by $10,000 over 5 years;\n       (B) excluding from income the first $500 in interest and \n     dividend income ($250 for singles);\n       (C) exempting from capital gains taxation the first $5,000 \n     in capital gains taxes; and\n       (D) raising the deductible limit for Individual Retirement \n     Account contributions from $2,000 to $3,000.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this budget resolution and legislation \n     enacted pursuant to this resolution assume that--\n       (1) Congress will adopt tax relief that provides incentives \n     for savings and investment for low- and middle-income working \n     families that assist in preparing for unexpected emergencies \n     and retirement, such as--\n       (A) raising the starting point for the 28 percent personal \n     income tax bracket by $10,000 over 5 years;\n       (B) excluding from income the first $500 in interest and \n     dividend income ($250 for singles);\n       (C) exempting from capital gains taxation the first $5,000 \n     in capital gains taxes; and\n       (D) raising the deductible limit for Individual Retirement \n     Account contributions from $2,000 to $3,000; and\n       (2) tax relief as described in this subsection is fully \n     achievable within the parameters set forth under this budget \n     resolution.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 SPECTER (AND HARKIN) AMENDMENT NO. 157\n\n  Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mr. Harkin) proposed an amendment to the \nconcurrent resolution, S.Con.Res. 20, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the end of title II, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ______.

Con. Res. 20, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE MODERNIZATION AND \n                   IMPROVEMENT OF THE MEDICARE PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The health insurance coverage provided under the \n     medicare program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) is an integral part of the financial \n     security for retired and disabled individuals, as such \n     coverage protects those individuals against the financially \n     ruinous costs of a major illness.\n       (2) Expenditures under the medicare program for hospital, \n     physician, and other essential health care services that are \n     provided to nearly 39,000,000 retired and disabled \n     individuals will be $232,000,000,000 in fiscal year 2000.\n       (3) During the nearly 35 years since the medicare program \n     was established, the Nation's health care delivery and \n     financing system has undergone major transformations. \n     However, the medicare program has not kept pace with such \n     transformations.\n       (4) Former Congressional Budget Office Director Robert \n     Reischauer has described the medicare program as it exists \n     today as failing on the following 4 key dimensions (known as \n     the ``Four I's''):\n       (A) The program is inefficient.\n       (B) The program is inequitable.\n       (C) The program is inadequate.\n       (D) The program is insolvent.\n       (5) The President's budget framework does not devote 15 \n     percent of the budget surpluses to the medicare program. The \n     federal budget process does not provide a mechanism for \n     setting aside current surpluses for future obligations. As a \n     result, the notion of saving 15 percent of the surplus for \n     the medicare program cannot practically be carried out.\n       (6) The President's budget framework would transfer to the \n     Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund more than \n     $900,000,000,000 over 15 years in new IOUs that must be \n     redeemed later by raising taxes on American workers, cutting \n     benefits, or borrowing more from the public, and these new \n     IOUs would increase the gross debt of the Federal Government \n     by the amounts transferred.\n\n[[Page S3286]]\n\n       (7) The Congressional Budget Office has stated that the \n     transfers described in paragraph (6) which are strictly \n     intragovernmental, have no effect on the unified budget \n     surpluses or the on-budget surpluses and therefore have no \n     effect on the debt held by the public.\n       (8) The President's budget framework does not provide \n     access to, or financing for, prescription drugs.\n       (9) The Comptroller General of the United States has stated \n     that the President's medicare proposal does not constitute \n     reform of the program and ``is likely to create a public \n     misperception that something meaningful is being done to \n     reform the Medicare program''.\n       (10) The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 enacted changes to the \n     medicare program which strengthen and extend the solvency of \n     that program.\n       (11) The Congressional Budget Office has stated that \n     without changes made to the medicare program by the Balanced \n     Budget Act of 1997, the depletion of the Federal Hospital \n     Insurance Trust Fund would now be imminent.\n       (12) The President's budget proposes to cut medicare \n     program spending by $19,400,000,000 over 10 years, primarily \n     through reductions in payments to providers under that \n     program.\n       (13) While the recommendations by Senator John Breaux and \n     Representative William Thomas received the bipartisan support \n     of a majority of members on the National Bipartisan \n     Commission on the Future of Medicare, all of the President's \n     appointees to that commission opposed the bipartisan reform \n     plan.\n       (14) The Breaux-Thomas recommendations provide for new \n     prescription drug coverage for the neediest beneficiaries \n     within a plan that substantially improves the solvency of the \n     medicare program without transferring new IOUs to the Federal \n     Hospital Insurance Fund that must be redeemed later by \n     raising taxes, cutting benefits, or borrowing more from the \n     public.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions contained in this budget resolution \n     assume the following:\n       (1) The resolution does not adopt the President's proposals \n     to reduce medicare program spending by $19,400,000,000 over \n     10 years, nor does this resolution adopt the President's \n     proposal to spend $10,000,000,000 of medicare program funds \n     on unrelated programs.\n       (2) Congress will not transfer to the Federal Hospital \n     Insurance Trust Fund new IOUs that must be redeemed later by \n     raising taxes on American workers, cutting benefits, or \n     borrowing more from the public.\n       (3) Congress should work in a bipartisan fashion to extend \n     the solvency of the medicare program and to ensure that \n     benefits under that program will be available to \n     beneficiaries in the future.\n       (4) The American public will be well and fairly served in \n     this undertaking if the medicare program reform proposes are \n     considered within a framework that is based on the following \n     5 key principles offered in testimony to the Senate Committee \n     on Finance by the Comptroller General of the United States:\n       (A) Affordability.\n       (B) Equity.\n       (C) Adequacy.\n       (D) Feasibility.\n       (E) Public acceptance.\n       (5) The recommendations by Senator Breaux and Congressman \n     Thomas provide for new prescription drug coverage for the \n     neediest beneficiaries within a plan that substantially \n     improves the solvency of the medicare program without \n     transferring to the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund new \n     IOUs that must be redeemed later by raising taxes, cutting \n     benefits, or borrowing more from the public.\n       (6) Congress should move expeditiously to consider the \n     bipartisan recommendations of the Chairmen and the National \n     Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare.\n       (7) Congress should continue to work with the President as \n     he develops and presents his plan to fix the problems of the \n     medicare program.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  COLLINS (AND DODD) AMENDMENT NO. 159\n\n  Ms. COLLINS (for

SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING RECOVERY OF FUNDS \n                   BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN TOBACCO-RELATED \n                   LITIGATION.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Federal Tobacco Recovery and Medicare Prescription Drug \n     Benefit Resolution of 1999''.\n       (b) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The President, in his January 19, 1999 State of the \n     Union address--\n       (A) announced that the Department of Justice would develop \n     a litigation plan for the Federal Government against the \n     tobacco industry;\n       (B) indicated that any funds recovered through such \n     litigation would be used to strengthen the medicare program \n     under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 \n     et seq.); and\n       (C) urged Congress to pass legislation to include a \n     prescription drug benefit in the medicare program.\n       (2) The traditional medicare program does not include most \n     outpatient prescription drugs as part of its benefit package.\n       (3) Prescription drugs are a central element in improving \n     quality of life and in routine health maintenance.\n       (4) Prescription drugs are a key component to early health \n     care intervention strategies for the elderly.\n       (5) Eighty percent of retired individuals take at least 1 \n     prescription drug every day.\n       (6) Individuals 65 years of age or older represent 12 \n     percent of the population of the United States but consume \n     more than \\1/3\\ of all prescription drugs consumed in the \n     United States.\n       (7) Exclusive of health care-related premiums, prescription \n     drugs account for almost \\1/3\\ of the health care costs and \n     expenditures of elderly individuals.\n       (8) Approximately 10 percent of all medicare beneficiaries \n     account for nearly 50 percent of all prescription drug \n     spending by the elderly.\n       (9) Research and development on new generations of \n     pharmaceuticals represent new opportunities for healthier, \n     longer lives for our Nation's elderly.\n       (10) Prescription drugs are among the key tools in every \n     health care professional's medical arsenal to help combat and \n     prevent the onset, recurrence, or debilitating effects of \n     illness and disease.\n       (11) While Federal litigation against tobacco companies \n     will take time to develop and execute, Congress should \n     continue to work to address the immediate need among the \n     elderly for access to affordable prescription drugs.\n       (12) Treatment of tobacco-related illness is estimated to \n     cost the medicare program approximately $10,000,000,000 every \n     year.\n       (13) In 1998, 50 States reached a settlement with the \n     tobacco industry for tobacco-related illness in the amount of \n     $206,000,000,000.\n       (14) Recoveries from Federal tobacco-related litigation, if \n     successful, will likely be comparable to or exceed the dollar \n     amount recovered by the States under the 1998 settlement.\n       (15) In the event Federal tobacco-related litigation is \n     undertaken and is successful, funds recovered under such \n     litigation should first be used for the purpose of \n     strengthening the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and \n     second to finance a medicare prescription drug benefit.\n       (16) The scope of any medicare prescription drug benefit \n     should be as comprehensive as possible, with drugs used in \n     fighting tobacco-related illnesses given a first priority.\n       (17) Most Americans want the medicare program to cover the \n     costs of prescription drugs.\n       (c) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     resolution assume that funds recovered under any tobacco-\n     related litigation commenced by the Federal Government should \n     be used first for the purpose of strengthening the Federal \n     Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and second to fund a medicare \n     prescription drug benefit.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 GRAHAM (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 165\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Feingold, and Ms. Snowe) proposed an \namendment to the concurrent resolution, S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON FUNDING FOR AFTER SCHOOL \n                   EDUCATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The demand for after school education is very high. In \n     fiscal year 1998 the Department of Education's after school \n     grant program was the most competitive in the Department's \n     history. Nearly 2,000 school districts applied for over \n     $540,000,000.\n       (2) After school programs help to fight juvenile crime. Law \n     enforcement statistics show that youth who are ages 12 \n     through 17 are most at risk of committing violent acts and \n     being victims of violent acts between 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. \n     After school programs have been shown to reduce juvenile \n     crime, sometimes by up to 75 percent according to the \n     National Association of Police Athletic and Activity Leagues.\n       (3) After school programs can improve educational \n     achievement. They ensure children have safe and positive \n     learning environments in the after school hours. In the \n     Sacramento START after school program 75 percent of the \n     students showed an increase in their grades.\n       (4) After school programs have widespread support.

Mr. President, I rise today to salute our \nveterans of the First World War as the French government confers the \nLegion of Honor, its highest honor, on those living American veterans \nwho served on French soil during World War I. I salute these brave men \nand women for their courage and for their sacrifice. For the past \neighty years, they have taught several generations of Americans what it \nmeans to be a hero and what it means to be an American.\n  Our World War I veterans fought because they believed in something \nbeyond themselves, a greater good. They fought to preserve the best of \nhumanity--democracy, compassion, and liberty. Unfortunately, their \nfight exposed them to the worst of humanity, the first modern war, with \nits machine guns, its trenches, its very inhumanity.\n  ``The Great War,'' ``The War to End All Wars'' is what they called \nit. It was so terrible, so inhuman that we believed that a calamity of \nthat magnitude could never happen again. But it did. The Great War \nbecame known as World War I as a second inhuman war consumed our world.\n  Today, we owe it to those who fought in World War I, who we promised \nthat it would never happen again, that we will make sure that it \ndoesn't. These medals and this promise are for our World War I veterans \nand for everyone who fought alongside them in the trenches.\n  I offer this promise to our veterans, but I also ask for their help \nin keeping it. I ask them to teach their grandchildren and their great-\ngrandchildren about what it meant to fight for such a great and costly \ncause. Together, we can make sure that our children and our children's \nchildren never have to fight another Great War. \n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/24/senate-section/article/S3292-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S3292]]\n      RECOGNITION OF THE LIFE UNIVERSITY RUNNING EAGLE HOCKEY TEAM\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I am delighted to have this \nopportunity to congratulate the Life University Running Eagle Hockey \nteam on their remarkable season. Georgia fans all across the country \nhave had the pleasure of watching this team take its third consecutive \nAmerican Collegiate Hockey Association Division II National \nChampionship.\n  Head Coach Dan Bouchard has, in only three seasons, led the Life ice \nhockey team to one national runner-up position in the 1995-96 inaugural \nyear and two division II national titles in the two subsequent years. \nThis season brought the Running Eagles an impeccable record with 20 \nwins, 1 tie and only 5 losses. Through pool play and the championship \nround, Life had 5 wins, no losses, and averaged 6 goals a game.\n  Life University is fortunate to have an individual of the caliber of \nDan Bouchard coaching their hockey team. Not only are he and his \nassistant coaches teaching their players hockey skills, but important \nlessons for life--courage, stamina, tenacity and dedication. Although \nhe has enjoyed great success throughout his coaching career, his \nachievements go far beyond his great talent in coaching. He was a \nsecond round draft pick for the Boston Bruins in the 1970 American \nHockey League where he was the co-winner of the Happs Holmes Trophy \nwhich honors the top goalie in the AHL. Coach Bouchard moved to the \nNational Hockey League in 1972 where he gained a number of honors. In \n1976, he was chosen to play for Team Canada and in 1979 he co-founded \nthe Atlanta Sports Carnival which fund raises for leukemia research at \nEmory University. I would be hard pressed to enumerate all of his \nmagnificent life achievements and contributions to Life University, the \nMarrietta community and to all of the athletes whose lives he has \ntouched.\n  In this year's championship game the team quickly jumped ahead with a \n4-1 lead in the second period against Michigan State, thus setting the \ntone for defeat. With a final score of 6-2, they claimed their third \nnational title. The Most Valuable Player award went to the Running \nEagles' Mark Brodeur who scored 12 goals and had six assists for a \ntotal of 18 points. He led the tournament in scoring.\n  Mr. President, I ask that you and my colleagues join me in \nrecognizing and honoring the dedication and hard work of the athletes \nand coaches of the Life University Running Eagles. They have displayed \ntheir skills and dedication to excellence in hockey throughout this \nentire season and I extend my best wishes to them and congratulate the \nLife University Athletic Department on their continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/24/senate-section/article/S3292-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO MERRILL S. PARKS JR.\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity \nto recognize the life and achievements of Mr. Merrill S. Parks Jr., the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation's Special Agent in charge of \nConnecticut, who recently passed away after a brief illness at the age \nof 55.\n  Merrill Parks began his career with the FBI 29 years ago in Montana \nafter graduating from Memphis State University. He quickly moved on to \nserve in the FBI's New York division where he worked from 1971 to 1975. \nWhile there, he became a supervisory Special Agent overseeing the \ninvestigation of organized crime and white-collar crime.\n  Special Agent Parks's success as an investigator earned him a \nreputation as an expert in dealing with organized crime. By 1979, \nSpecial Agent Parks had been reassigned to the FBI headquarters in \nWashington, D.C. to manage the bureau's national program of identifying \nand infiltrating organized crime. He also initiated a long-term program \nthat dealt with combating money laundering.\n  One of Special Agent Parks most widely profiled accomplishments was \nhis leadership of what became known as the Pizza Connection case. His \nexperience and knowledge of the inner-workings of crime families led to \nthe successful prosecution of Mafia-connected drug dealers who sold \nheroin through pizza parlors and bakeries.\n  In 1986, Special Agent Parks was reassigned as an Assistant Special \nAgent in charge of Houston's FBI office. The Houston area had been \nwitnessing a growth of Mexican organized crime groups attempting to \ndistribute drugs throughout the United States, and Special Agent \nParks's expertise was enlisted to help curb their illegal activities. \nWithin the first year, under the guidance of Special Agent Parks, the \nHouston office solved 32 drug-related kidnappings.\n  The course of Merrill Parks's career eventually brought him to \nMadison, Connecticut in 1994, where he made his home with his wife, \nPatricia. In that year, he was also appointed to head the FBI's \nConnecticut office.\n  Vigorous in his determination to stop the flow of drugs and violence \nwithin our communities, Special Agent Parks faced the new task of \neliminating gangs. Sadly, Connecticut, like so many other states, has \nexperienced an emergence of gangs and gang-related crime in recent \nyears. Special Agent Parks's work in Connecticut was no less impressive \nand, as with his previous assignments, he was, once again, successful. \nIn his first year working in Connecticut, Special Agent Parks \ninfiltrated one of the state's most infamous gangs, the Latin Kings, \nand arrested numerous gang leaders.\n  Realizing that gangs were a long-term problem, he created a task \nforce that for three years continued to monitor and collect evidence on \ngang activity. Finally, in 1997, federal charges were brought against \n20 Latin King members throughout the state, and his hard work \nultimately led to the prosecution of dozens, helping to rid our streets \nof gang violence.\n  Mr. President, although Merrill Parks only lived in Connecticut for a \nshort five years, the contributions he made to the state and the \nprotection of its residents will be long remembered. I appreciated his \nwillingness to always keep me and my staff informed of recent \ndevelopments within his office and his obvious concern for making \nConnecticut a safer place to live. His stay was brief but his \naccomplishments were many and on behalf of myself, and the entire state \nof Connecticut, I would like to offer our sincere thanks for his \noutstanding efforts. Merrill Parks is survived by his wife, Patricia, a \nson, Andrew, and a daughter, Meredith. I would like to extend my \nheartfelt condolences to each of them on the passing of an outstanding \nfather, husband, and law enforcement officer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/24/senate-section/article/S3292-3", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3292-S3294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SUBMISS\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today I ask that the second \nportion of Mark A. Bradley's article on the disappearance of the U.S.S. \nScorpion be printed in the Record. The first portion of this article, \nwhich was featured in the Spring/Summer volume of the Journal of \nAmerica's Military Past, appeared in yesterday's Record. Mr. Bradley \nwas awarded the James Madison prize by the Society for History in the \nFederal Government for this article. I will ask that the third and \nfinal portion of this article be printed in tomorrow's Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n  Submiss: The Mysterious Death of the U.S.S. ``SCORPION'' (SSN 589), \n                                Part II\n\n                          (By Mark A. Bradley)\n\n       While the theory of Russian involvement is tantalizing, it \n     is highly unlikely that the Soviet Navy possessed the \n     capability in May 1968 to hunt down the Scorpion. Although \n     the Soviets were on the brink of commissioning two new \n     classes of hunter-killer and ballistic missile submarines--\n     the Victor I and the Charlie I--fully able to contend with \n     American sea power, they still relied heavily at that time on \n     their vintage diesel Whiskey class submarines to shadow and \n     challenge hostile warships. Slow and lacking advanced weapons \n     and sophisticated electronics, the outdated Whiskeys were no \n     match for the Scorpion.\n       Similarly, the Soviet's Echo II class nuclear submarine had \n     limited capabilities. Although the Echo II was armed with \n     conventional antisubmarine torpedoes, her main weapons were \n     surface-to-surface missiles. According to U.S. intelligence \n     estimates, the Echo II required over 25 minutes to surface \n     and fire, ample time for the Scorpion to parry an attack and \n     to launch one of her own. Moreover, the United States Navy \n     did not begin to decommission its Skipjack class submarines \n     until 1986. Until then, the surviving five remained in \n     firstline service, an unlikely practice for the Navy to \n     maintain if it knew or suspected that the Soviets so easily \n     had hunted down and killed the Scorpion nearly 20 years \n     before.\n\n[[Page S3293]]\n\n       After rejecting Soviet involvement, the Court similarly \n     discounted sabotage, a collision with an undersea mountain, a \n     nuclear accident, a structural failure, a fire, an irrational \n     act by a crew member, a loss of navigational control and, \n     with far less certainty, a weapons accident. Although it \n     found no direct evidence that one of the submarines's own \n     torpedoes had exploded, the Court noted that on December \n     5, 1967, the Scorpion had confronted an accidentally \n     activated Mark 37 torpedo in one of it firing tubes and \n     had sidestepped disaster by expelling it before it could \n     detonate.\n       Her standard method for deactivating a ``hot run''--the \n     Navy's term for an accidentally activated torpedo with a live \n     warhead--was to flood the tube with cold water, keeping the \n     torpedo cool, and turn the warship in a U turn more than 170 \n     degrees, activating an anti-circular homing device that shut \n     down the projectile's motor. Then her crew would drain the \n     tube, install a propeller lock and jettison it. Small and \n     battery powered, the Mark 37 was a wire-guided anti-submarine \n     torpedo that had a disturbing history of accidentally \n     activating, particularly during testing. In May 1968, the \n     Scorpion had 14 Mark 37s in an arsenal that included two Mark \n     45 ASTOR torpedoes with nuclear warheads and 7 other \n     conventional projectiles.\n       She also had a new commander. When he took over the \n     Scorpion on October 17, 1967, Francis Atwood Slattery was 36 \n     years old. From West Paris, Maine, he had graduated from \n     Annapolis in 1954 and was a member of the Naval War College's \n     class of 1967. A former executive officer on U.S.S. Nautilus, \n     ``Frank'' Slattery was among a very small cadre of \n     technically gifted offices the Navy had tapped for elite \n     nuclear submarine duty. After promotion to the rank of \n     commander on October 2, 1967, the Scorpion was his first \n     command.\n       His newness to command showed in December when navy \n     inspectors gave the Scorpion an unsatisfactory rating after \n     she failed a series of casualty drills involving her nuclear \n     torpedoes and again in January when she engaged in an \n     advanced submarine versus submarine exercise and received the \n     lowest tactical grade of all the participants. Nevertheless, \n     by the time she was deployed to the Mediterranean in \n     February, the Navy rated her fully ready and, by March, she \n     was praised by the 6th Fleet Command Staff for begin a well-\n     trained, well-run submarine. By April 1968, seven of her 12 \n     officers and 61 of her 87 enlisted men were fully qualified \n     in submarines, and the Court found no ground to blame either \n     her officers or her enlisted men for what happen on May 22.\n       As Admiral Austin closed his investigation and submitted \n     his inconclusive findings, the Mizar found the Scorpion in \n     the early morning hours of October 28, 1968, and began \n     photographing the wreckage. Once all the photographic and \n     sound recordings were collected, Admiral Austin reconvened \n     his court in early November and asked a special Technical \n     Advisory Group comprising scientists and veteran submariners \n     to pore over the newly discovered physical evidence. \n     Admiral Thomas Moorer, the Chief of Naval Operations, \n     earlier had created this group to provide technical \n     expertise to the Court.\n       Headed by Dr. John Craven, the naval scientist who in 1966 \n     led the team that retrieved a hydrogen bomb that had \n     plummeted into the Atlantic near Palomares, Spain, after two \n     U.S. Air Force planes collided, and assisted by the Naval \n     Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C., the technical \n     experts first examined the acoustical recordings and made a \n     startling discovery--the Scorpion had been heading east, \n     instead of west toward Norfolk, when the first cataclysmic \n     explosion erupted. The advisors estimated that the first \n     sound to register on SOSUS had been caused by at least 30 \n     pounds of TNT detonating 60 feet or more below the surface \n     and theorized that the Scorpion had been engaged in a hastily \n     ordered U-turn in a desperate attempt to disarm a hot run \n     torpedo that exploded and caused uncontrollable flooding. \n     According to Craven, the hot run scenario was the only one \n     that fit all the evidence.\n       In a December 16, 1984, article published in the Virginian-\n     Pilot & Ledger-Star, Craven related that the photographs \n     indicated that the Scorpion's torpedo room was still intact \n     and had not been crushed by water pressure as she spiraled \n     toward her watery grave. In that interview, Craven said he \n     believed the torpedo room did not implode, pointing out that \n     it was the first part of the Scorpion to flood after the \n     explosion and already had filled with water when the \n     submarine began to sink. Noting the absence of visible damage \n     from outside the hull, he added that a torpedo probably \n     detonated inside the compartment instead of in one of the \n     submarine's six firing tubes.\n       Craven also noted that the photographs showed that several \n     access hatches to the torpedo room were open. This meant they \n     probably were pushed out by internal pressure. The other \n     SOSUS recordings were sounds of the Scorpion's various \n     compartments collapsing and buckling as she bent like a piece \n     of taffy as she sank below her crush depth and slammed into \n     the ocean floor at a speed estimated to between 25 and 35 \n     knots per hour.\n       Although the Court discovered that Schade's May 20 \n     operational order did not specify whether the Scorpion's \n     torpedoes were to be fully armed, it seems likely that \n     Slattery would have exercised his discretion and ordered them \n     ready as she approached the Soviet ships. If so, this would \n     have been the first time in over a year that the Scorpion had \n     engaged in an operation which required her tactical torpedoes \n     to be fully loaded. She would have done so with a new torpedo \n     gang and weapons officer. All her torpedo men had been \n     replaced since her last operation, and her weapons officer \n     had been relieved during her Mediterranean deployment.\n       The Court speculated that the Scorpion probably had begun \n     disarming her torpedoes by the time she broadcast her final \n     message on the evening of May 21 because of the Navy's strict \n     policy forbidding submarines from entering Norfolk with fully \n     armed warheads. If so, the investigators theorized that \n     something as simple as a short in a piece of testing \n     equipment accidentally could have activated one of the Mark \n     37's batteries and triggered a hot run. Left with only \n     seconds to react, Slattery would have ordered the Scorpion \n     into the abrupt U-turn she was making when the torpedo \n     exploded and filled her with rushing sea water.\n       Almost immediately, the Navy's Bureau of Weapons challenged \n     the hot run theory and commissioned its own study to \n     undermine it. The Bureau's position was supported by Admiral \n     P. Ephriam Holmes, the commander of the Navy's Atlantic \n     Fleet, and Vice Admiral Schade. Both pointed out that there \n     was no visible torpedo damage to the Scorpion's hull in any \n     of the thousands of photographs taken by the Mizar and \n     Trieste II, that her weapons room showed no signs of a \n     cataclysmic explosion that would have followed as the \n     warship's torpedoes erupted in a massive chain reaction, and \n     that her torpedo firing doors were tightly shuttered. \n     Moreover, former crew members were unable to identify any \n     objects in her debris field that came from her torpedo room.\n       Admiral Schade, a veteran World War II submariner and \n     holder of both the Navy Cross and the Silver Star, told the \n     Court that he believed the Scorpion simply was lost after she \n     flooded and sank below her designed operating capacity. \n     Although unsure of how the flooding started, Schade \n     speculated that it happened while the submarine was at 60 \n     feet or at periscope depth and that she already was full of \n     water by the time she began to sink. In a letter to Admiral \n     Austin, he wrote that he believed that the most likely cause \n     of the disaster was an accident involving the submarine's \n     trash disposal unit.\n       Located in the Scorpion's galley, her trash disposal \n     consisted of an inner door separated from highly pressurized \n     sea water by a basketball-sized valve connected to a 10\\1/2\\-\n     inch tunnel. Although the inner door was supposed to be \n     mechanically prevented from opening while trash was being \n     flushed, and the crew was trained to use a bleed valve to \n     make sure no pressurized sea water was outside before \n     ejecting waste, a broken system or valve coupled with human \n     error could have unleashed a fatal chain of events as a \n     torrent of high-pressure sea water roared through the \n     submarine. Pouring through the Scorpion's galley and swamping \n     her operations center, the rushing cascade would have \n     overwhelmed her pumps, washed over and shorted out her \n     electric control panels, flooded over her huge battery \n     several decks below and exploded into a deadly mist of \n     fiery hydrogen and poisonous chlorine gas. With her crew \n     dead or unconscious and water pressure squeezing her as \n     she plunged deeper and deeper, the Scorpion would have \n     imploded as she rocketed nearly two miles to the ocean's \n     floor.\n       Vice Admiral Robert Fountain (Ret), the former executive \n     officer on the Scorpion from 1965 until 1967, supports this \n     theory. In a recent interview, Fountain explained that the \n     Scorpion normally came up to periscope depth to expel her \n     trash and that she especially would have needed to do so \n     after completing an underwater intelligence operation. He \n     also pointed out that the submarine had experienced flooding \n     because of her trash disposal unit before. Some of the \n     photographs taken by the Mizar and Trieste II appear to back \n     Fountain's claim. These show that all the submarine's \n     identifiable debris is from her operations center where her \n     galley was located, and that a large section of her hull is \n     missing where her huge 69-ton battery was stored.\n       The Austin Court considered this theory and determined it \n     was possible but ``not probable'' without further comment. \n     Moreover, the several witnesses testified that they believed \n     the warship's safety systems would have deployed to save her \n     if she was flooding that close to the surface. This \n     assessment might have been right if the Scorpion's safety \n     systems were fully working and certified, but they were \n     neither.\n       The Scorpion's safety systems were a direct product of the \n     worst submarine disaster in American history--the loss of \n     U.S.S. Thresher and her entire crew of 112 sailors and 17 \n     civilians on April 10, 1963. It is impossible to overestimate \n     what the Thresher's loss meant to the Navy. A public \n     relations nightmare during the very dangerous middle years of \n     the cold War, the Thresher's abrupt demise during test dives \n     220 miles off Cape Cod shattered the myth of the service's \n     technological invincibility--much like the Challenger's \n     explosion did to NASA's some 23 years later--and caused acute \n     embarrassment and unwelcome political oversight. Not only did \n     it deprive the Navy of its most advanced submarine, but the \n     disaster also spawned a round of congressional hearings and \n     newspaper editorials questioning the design, testing and \n     safety of the service's underwater nuclear fleet.\n       To combat these criticisms and regain its prestige, the \n     Navy instituted its Submarine\n\n[[Page S3294]]\n\n     Safety Program (SUBSAFE). First initiated in May 1963 and \n     formalized that December, SUBSAFE was designed to ensure the \n     Thresher was not repeated. After months of exhaustive \n     hearings, which produced 12 volumes and 1,718 pages of \n     evidence, the service's experts traced the Thresher's sinking \n     to a series of failed silver-braze joints and pipes that \n     set into motion a deadly chain of catastrophic events that \n     ended with the warship's main systems flooded and her \n     ballast system unable to muster enough air to send her to \n     the surface. The investigators concluded that once the \n     submarine dove to her test depth of 1,300 feet, water \n     pressure ruptured her pipes and created a two inch leak. \n     This sent an unstoppable stream of icy water over her \n     control panels that her crew was unable to stop because \n     they could not reach her centralized shutoff valves in \n     time. It stopped her reactor and sent her backwards and \n     downwards as she lost all power. Unable to blow enough air \n     into her ballast tanks through her narrow pipes--moisture \n     in her pipes had frozen, blocking her air vents--the \n     Thresher imploded as she fell over 8,000 feet to the \n     bottom.\n       In the wake of this, the Navy's Bureau of Ships and the \n     Ship Systems Command placed depth restrictions on all the \n     service's post-World War II submarines--the Scorpion was \n     limited to a depth of 500 feet instead of her standard \n     operating depth of 700 feet--and ordered their inspectors and \n     workmen to begin the time-consuming and expensive task of \n     examining and replacing faulty sea water hydraulic piping \n     systems and rewelding possible faulty joints in over 80 \n     submarines. They also ordered the improvement of flood \n     control systems by increasing ballast tank blow rates and the \n     installation of decentralized sea water shutoff valves.\n       By the time SUBSAFE was instituted, the Scorpion was in \n     dry-dock at the Charleston Naval Shipyard for her first and \n     last full overhaul. Arriving on June 10, 1963, and remaining \n     until April 28, 1964, she had nearly completed her repairs by \n     the time the yard's command received orders to implement the \n     new safety requirements. Although workmen inspected the \n     Scorpion's hull and replaced many of her welds, they were not \n     authorized to install emergency sea water shut-off valves. \n     Moreover, the Naval Sea Systems Command deemed the interim \n     emergency blow system the yard constructed unsuitable for \n     service and ordered it disconnected. The Navy decided to \n     defer installing these two systems until early 1967, the date \n     of the Scorpion's next scheduled overhaul.\n       By then, the Navy had spent over $500 million on SUBSAFE \n     and estimated that it needed at least another $200 million \n     more to certify all its submarines. In addition, severe \n     outside pressures were forcing the Navy to rethink how best \n     to allocate its already stretched resources. Faced with \n     fighting an increasingly protracted war in Vietnam while \n     meeting the unchanging demands of maintaining America's \n     global security obligations at a time when the \n     Soviets decided to expand and transform their navy into a \n     full-blown blue water fleet, the service's high command \n     began to grope for new ways to meet its backbreaking \n     obligations.\n       Confronted now with the urgent need to launch more warships \n     and to keep the ones it already had at sea, the Navy decided \n     to delay installing full SUBSAFE systems in many of its older \n     submarines. What prompted this shift started with a series of \n     confidential memoranda and messages drafted in 1966 as the \n     Navy sought ways to reduce the time its submarines spent in \n     dry dock meeting SUBSAFE's requirements. A Naval Sea Systems \n     Command study of that era revealed not only the rising costs \n     of this program but that approximately 40 percent of the \n     average submarine's time was spent undergoing reconditioning \n     instead of serving at sea.\n       The Navy's leadership was clearly worried by the political \n     fallout these statistics would generate. On March 24, 1966, \n     the Commander of Submarine Squadron 6--the Scorpion's unit--\n     drafted a memorandum to Admiral Schade, Commander Submarine \n     Force, Atlantic Fleet that candidly admitted that ``the \n     inordinate amount of time currently involved in routine \n     overhauls of nuclear submarines is a recognized source of \n     major concern to the Navy as a whole and the submarine force \n     in particular and stands as a source of acute political \n     embarrassment.'' The memorandum blamed the Navy's Bureau of \n     Ships and the managers of the service's shipyards for these \n     problems and complained about the shortage of skilled workers \n     needed to complete the overhauls, their poor planning in \n     ordering critical materials on time, and the overall \n     magnitude of what SUBSAFE required. It also warned that the \n     Scorpion's next scheduled reconditioning in November 1966 \n     ``will establish a new record for in overhaul \n     duration.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/24/senate-section/article/S3294-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3294-S3295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SMALL FARM RIDER AMENDMENT\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly about an \namendment regarding OSHA inspections of small farms, which I was \nprepared to offer to S. 544, the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations \nbill. To expedite the consideration of this emergency legislation, I \nwithdrew my amendment, but I want my colleagues to know that I will \ncontinue to press this issue.\n  As other Senators may know, the Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration, by statute, can enforce health and safety rules and \ninvestigate accidents on farms or businesses of any size.\n  However, a rider prohibiting OSHA from expending funds to carry out \nits statutory duty with respect to small farms has been attached to \nDepartment of Labor appropriations bills for the past several years. \nSmall farms are those that employ ten or fewer workers and do not \nmaintain a camp for temporary employees.\n  I want to emphasize that this prohibition extends even to the \ninvestigation of fatal, work-related accidents. I am not speaking of \nmalicious acts leading to deaths on the job--law enforcement \nauthorities are capable of addressing those circumstances. I am \nspeaking of deaths caused by preventable health and safety hazards--\nhazards that no agency other than OSHA has the capacity to address.\n  Since the death of a sixteen-year-old Rhode Islander in an accident \non a small farm in 1997, I have worked to address this issue.\n  Mr. President, it is heartbreaking for a parent to send a child off \nto a summer job only to see him die in an accident, and it is \ninfuriating for these parents to wonder whether other youngsters now \nworking on that job are safe.\n  I am sensitive to the concerns that some Senators will have about \nprotecting the interests of family farms. That is why I have attempted \nto only moderately amend the current rider. Indeed, my amendment only \nallows OSHA access to small farms if there is a death, and only for \ninvestigation, not punitive action.\n  I have advanced this proposal in the hope of disseminating \ninformation about the causes of fatalities in order to prevent repeat \ntragedies and to bring a sense of closure to families who lose a loved \none.\n  When I raised this issue during the markup of the Safety Advancement \nfor Employees (SAFE) Act in the Labor and Human Resources Committee \nduring the last Congress, several of my colleagues expressed a \nwillingness to work with me on this issue. Regrettably, there is little \nthe authorizing committee can do, because the problem stems from an \nappropriations rider, and an appropriations bill is where a correction \nshould be made.\n  Mr. President, agriculture is one of the most hazardous industries in \nthe United States today. We should take at least this minimal step to \nensure the safety of agricultural employees.\n  Last Fall, the National Research Council (NRC), an arm of the \nNational Academy of Sciences (NAS), issued a report entitled Protecting \nYouth at Work. Among its recommendations was the following related to \nsmall farm safety:\n\n       To ensure the equal protection of children and adolescents \n     from health and safety hazards in agriculture, Congress \n     should undertake an examination of the effects and \n     feasibility of extending all relevant Occupational Safety and \n     Health Administration regulations to agricultural workers, \n     including subjecting small farms to the same level of OSHA \n     enforcement as that applied to other small businesses.\n\n  Mr. President, it is the opinion of the NAS panel that small farms \nshould be subject to the same level of enforcement as all other small \nbusinesses. In comparison to this recommendation, my proposed amendment \nis moderate, because, again, my amendment only allows an OSHA \ninspection on a small farm following a fatal accident. The inspection \ncould not result in fines or any other OSHA enforcement.\n  During consideration of the SAFE Act in the 105th Congress, the Labor \nCommittee voted for a provision requiring an NAS peer review of all new \nOSHA standards. Today, we have a report from the NAS making \nrecommendations on OSHA enforcement on small farms. I hope that \ncolleagues will keep that in mind and that they will remember that my \namendment is not as extensive as the NAS recommendation.\n  Mr. President, some have criticized my amendment as unfair to small \nfarm owners. I am mystified by their argument. The only small farms to \nbe impacted would be those where an employee dies in a work related \naccident. Then, the only imposition the business would face would be an \ninvestigation: no fines, no enforcement, and no regulation. If \ninformation could be disseminated to prevent just one of the 500 deaths \nthat occur annually in the agriculture industry, I believe this minor\n\n[[Page S3295]]\n\ninconvenience would be worth it. I know my constituents who lost their \nson feel that way, and I would venture to guess that many other \nfamilies would feel that way too.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Specter, Chairman of the \nSenate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, \nand Education, for his good faith efforts to address this issue. His \ncommitment to continue working with me was a major reason for my \ndecision not to proceed my amendment on the Supplemental Appropriations \nbill. I look forward to working with the Senator from Pennsylvania and \nother concerned Senators in the months ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/24/senate-section/article/S3295-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n HONOR VICTIMS OF SCHOOL VIOLENCE BY ENACTING THE SAFE SCHOOL SECURITY \n                                  ACT\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to state that today \nmarks the first anniversary since the tragic school shooting in \nJonesboro, Arkansas. We all remember hearing about the gun shots fired \nby two young boys hiding in the woods--shots that led to the tragic \ndeath of four of their classmates and a Jonesboro teacher. March 24th \nwill forever be ingrained in our memories as the day our children's \nsafety at school was threatened in a way we could hardly imagine.\n  One of the bills I introduced recently was aimed at keeping our kids \nin school. But solving the truancy problem is only one of the issues we \nmust work together to tackle. Not only do we need to keep our kids in \nschool, we need to keep our kids in school safe! The Safe School \nSecurity Act I introduced last week is intended to do just that.\n  Children should not have to fear for their safety while attending our \npublic schools. At a time when violent crime in the nation is \ndecreasing, ten percent of our public schools reported at least one \nserious violent crime during the 1996-97 school year. Because of this \nlevel of violence, 29 percent of elementary, 34 percent of junior high \nand 20 percent of high school students fear that they will be a victim \nof crime while at school. The school yard fist fight is no longer a \nchild's worst fear: 71 percent of children ages 7 to 10 say they worry \nabout being shot or stabbed. In fact, 13.2% of high school seniors \nreported being threatened by a weapon between 1995 and 1996. We all \nknow that a violent environment is not a good learning environment.\n  Educators and law enforcement know that technology is the key to \npreventing and reducing crime in our schools. Most of us understand the \nimportance of protecting our assets, yet we have neglected to protect \nour biggest investment of all: our school children. The Safe School \nSecurity Act would establish the School Security Technology Center at \nSandia National Laboratory and provide grant money for local school \ndistricts to access the technology developed and tested by the lab. \nBecause Sandia is one of our nation's premier labs when it comes to \nproviding physical security for our nation's most important assets, it \nis fitting that Sandia would be chosen to provide security to our \nschool districts throughout our nation.\n  Increased school security not only reduces violent crime, it reduces \ntruancy and property crime. The latest technology was recently tested \nin a pilot project involving Sandia Labs and Belen High School in \nBelen, New Mexico and the results were astounding. After two years, \nBelen High School experienced a 75 percent reduction in school \nviolence, a 30 percent reduction in truancy, an 80 percent reduction in \nvehicle break-ins and a 75 percent reduction in vandalism. More \nimportant, Belen realized a 100% reduction in the presence of \nunauthorized people on the school grounds. Also, Belen saw insurance \nclaims due to theft or vandalism at the high school drop from $50,000 \nto $5,000 after the pilot project went into effect. Clearly, the cost \nof making our schools safer and more secure is a good investment for \nour nation.\n  The School Security Technology Center will partner with the Law \nEnforcement and Corrections Technology Center in Georgia to facilitate \nthe transfer of available security technology to schools that could \nbenefit the most from such technology. The School Security Technology \nCenter will also provide security assessments for schools so they do \nnot spend limited school resources on security tools that do not work. \nThis bill will authorize $10,000,000 for schools to access the \ntechnical assistance from Sandia and to purchase security tools that \nfit their needs.\n  This one year anniversary of the horrible tragedy in Jonesboro should \nmake it clear to everyone that it is time to focus on making our kids \nfeel safe in school and ultimately putting kids first.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/24/senate-section/article/S3295-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3295-S3296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATOR EDWARD M. KENNEDY'S REMARKS AT THE AMERICAN IRELAND FUND \n                             NATIONAL GALA\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, last week, on the eve of Saint \nPatrick's Day, the American Ireland Fund recognized Senator Kennedy for \nhis life-long commitment to the Irish people and to peace in Northern \nIreland. Senator Hatch and myself had the honor of introducing Senator \nKennedy that night. Today, I rise to recognize Senator Kennedy for his \nwork on behalf of peace and justice here in the United States and \naround the world, particularly in Ireland.\n  Before Ireland was in fashion, Senator Kennedy was its loyal friend. \nThroughout the adult lives of most of the members of this body, Senator \nKennedy, his sister United States Ambassador to Ireland Jean Kennedy \nSmith, and members of their family have worked tirelessly, day in and \nday out, to better the lot of the least fortunate of their fellow men \nand women. Senator Kennedy's efforts regularly reach across the borders \nof nation, race and religion.\n  It was only natural, then, that the conflict and injustice in \nNorthern Ireland would make a claim on Senator Kennedy's conscience. \nHis unceasing interest in achieving peace in Northern Ireland was, and \nis, the one constant over the many ups and downs on the still bumpy \nroad to resolving that conflict. He labors both as a distinguished \nrepresentative of the United States, and as a loyal son of Ireland.\n  Reflecting on the way Senator Kennedy has led so many of his \ncolleagues down the tortured path that must inevitably lead to peace, I \nam reminded of the figure of the great Irish poet, William Butler \nYeats, standing amidst the portraits of his contemporaries in the \nDublin municipal gallery of art, and urging history to judge him not on \nthis or that isolated deed but to:\n\n     Think where man's glory most begins and ends;\n     And say my glory was I had such friends.\n  Mr. President, I, and many others, are most grateful to be able to \ncall Senator Kennedy both a colleague and a friend.\n  In recognition of the honor he received last week from the American \nIreland Fund, Mr. President, I ask that the remarks he gave that \nevening be printed in the Record.\n  The remarks follow:\n       Thank you, Chris Dodd and Orrin Hatch, for those kind \n     words. Bertie Ahern, Kingsley Aikens, Loretta Brennan \n     Glucksman, Father Gerry Creedon, friends, family--and fellow \n     immigrants!\n       I just wish my parents could have been here. Mother would \n     have loved everything you said--and Dad wouldn't have \n     believed a word of it!\n       There's an old Irish saying that half the lies your \n     opponents tell about you are not true.\n       But when your friends tell lies like that--it's beautiful.\n       It is an especially great honor to accept this award in the \n     presence of so many of those who were essential to the \n     success of the Good Friday Agreement.\n       The shamrock has three leaves, and I'm convinced that the \n     peace agreement would never have been possible without the \n     strong support at all the critical moments of the three \n     greatest friends of Ireland in America--President Bill \n     Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, and our truly indispensable \n     peacemaker, Senator George Mitchell.\n       I welcome Bertie Ahern back to Washington. He deserves \n     great credit for his own leadership during the peace \n     negotiations and in the succeeding months.\n       I also pay tribute to the leaders of the Northern Ireland \n     political parties who are here--John Hume and Seamus Mallon, \n     Gerry Adams, David Trimble, Lord Alderdice, and Monica \n     McWilliams. And I especially congratulate John Hume and David \n     Trimble for the well-deserved Nobel Peace Prize.\n       I also welcome Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Mo \n     Mowlam. And I salute Prime Minister Tony Blair, and many \n     other Irish and British officials for their courage and \n     determination not only in reaching the peace agreement, but \n     in moving it forward, inch by inch, day by day.\n\n[[Page S3296]]\n\n       I'm reminded of the lines of Robert Frost that President \n     Kennedy loved, ``I have promises to keep, and miles to go \n     before I sleep.''\n       I am very grateful for this honor and my heart is very full \n     this evening. In truth, I owe a great deal to two others in \n     our family--my sister Jean, the Ambassador who won the hearts \n     of the Irish people all over again for our family. She made \n     her own indispensable contributions to the peace process, and \n     I know how much she looks forward to working with all of you \n     on the Irish Festival she's planning at the Kennedy Center a \n     year from now.\n       And, of course, my brother Jack. In fact, it's because of \n     President Kennedy that all of us are here this evening. \n     During his visit to Ireland in 1963, he joined with President \n     de Valera in creating the American Irish Foundation, to \n     encourage closer ties between Irish Americans and Ireland.\n       A quarter century later, the merger with Tony O'Reilly and \n     Dan Rooney's Ireland Fund created the world's largest private \n     organization supporting constructive change in all of \n     Ireland, North and South. So I say to all of you, well done--\n     Erin Go Bragh!\n       Jack would have enjoyed this evening. He was always ready \n     to share his love of Ireland and all things Irish, especially \n     with those, like so many of us, who have the map of Ireland \n     on our faces. And he would have admired your skill in turning \n     our ties of heritage and history into practical avenues of \n     peace and prosperity for both our peoples.\n       The bonds between America and Ireland have flourished from \n     the beginning. There might never have been a United States of \n     America without the timely support from Ireland two centuries \n     ago. As President Kennedy told the Doil on his visit to \n     Ireland in 1963, Irish volunteers played so dominant a role \n     in our Revolutionary Army that Lord Mountjoy lamented in the \n     British Parliament, ``We have lost America through the \n     Irish.''\n       It is often forgotten that more than half of the 44 million \n     Americans of Irish descent are Protestant. The impact on \n     America of Scotch-Irish settlers from what is today Northern \n     Ireland was profound. They made and continue to make immense \n     contributions to our country. Andrew Jackson was of Ulster \n     Presbyterian stock, and proud of it. Eleven other Presidents \n     of the United States were of Scotch-Irish heritage, including \n     President Clinton.\n       Now, in our own day and generation, by facilitating the \n     peace process, Irish Americans have a priceless opportunity \n     to give something back to Ireland in return for all that \n     Ireland has given us.\n       To the Unionists in Northern Ireland, we say that we are \n     your brothers and sisters, not your enemies. The vast \n     majority of Irish Catholics in America bear you no ill-will. \n     Our hope is that as your ancestors did for America, you will \n     help to lead the way to peace for Northern Ireland.\n       Many able leaders in the past devised what they thought \n     were lasting solutions for Ireland. We know the high price \n     that Ireland--and Britain, too--have paid because of those \n     failed solutions and the endless seeds of repression, famine, \n     partition and violence they sowed.\n       It is the clear lesson of that tragic history that no \n     settlement will last unless it is based on equality and \n     mutual respect. These are the twin pillars of peace. The \n     Nationalist community will never accept a role of \n     subservience to Unionism. And the Unionist community will \n     never accept a role of subservience to Nationalism.\n       We know how far we have already come towards these goals \n     because of the Good Friday Agreement. People on both sides in \n     Northern Ireland understand that progress best of all, \n     because they see the true meaning of peace in their lives and \n     their communities. The ascent to a peaceful future is nearly \n     won, and they know how much is at risk. They are determined \n     not to slide backward into the violent past--and they reject \n     political leadership that would take them back.\n       We talk of a thirty-year conflict. But its roots go back \n     not 30 years, but 300 years, not one generation but 10 \n     generations, before the Mayflower landed at Plymouth Rock.\n       The Good Friday Agreement is the best new beginning of all \n     those 300 years, and the people of Ireland and Northern \n     Ireland know it. It was endorsed by decisive votes in both \n     parts of Ireland as a clear mandate to their leaders, and \n     history will not deal kindly with any leader who fails this \n     test, or any others who return to the bomb and the bullet.\n       The task now facing the Irish and British Governments and \n     political leaders in Northern Ireland is to build greater \n     momentum for full implementation of the Agreement. Clearly, \n     there has been welcome recent progress. Last month, the \n     Northern Ireland Assembly approved the designation of the \n     Northern Ireland Departments and the group of cross-border \n     bodies. Last week, Britain and Ireland signed historic \n     treaties for closer ties.\n       Further progress in these areas is dependent on full \n     implementation of all aspects of the agreement. We commend \n     the work of General de Chastelain's independent commission on \n     decommissioning, and we look forward to the important \n     meetings taking place this week in Washington and in the \n     weeks ahead.\n       Inevitably, there will be new difficulties beyond this \n     current one. But implementation of the Agreement offers the \n     best way forward and the best yardstick to judge the policies \n     and actions of all involved. The goal of peace is best served \n     by prompt action on the Agreement. Those who take risks for \n     peace can be assured of timely support by President Clinton, \n     Congress, and the American people.\n       Not all the guns have remained silent. The carnage \n     inflicted on the town and people of Omagh last August was a \n     grim reminder that, in spite of all that has been achieved, \n     there are still some who subscribe to violence. As recently \n     as yesterday, the cowardly murder of Rosemary Nelson reminds \n     us anew of the urgency of our task. The horror of these \n     atrocities unites all the people of Ireland and Great \n     Britain, and friends of Ireland everywhere, in a \n     determination that such tactics of terrorism will never again \n     be tolerated or condoned\n       Sectarian attacks, punishment beatings, and other acts of \n     violence must also stop. They serve only to inflame division, \n     recrimination and pressures to respond in kind. Resort to \n     violence is unacceptable. It is time to say enough is enough \n     is enough is enough. It is time to replace hate with hope.\n       We see the signs of progress in many ways. There is growing \n     confidence that a new police organization will soon be born \n     in Northern Ireland, capable of attracting and deserving the \n     support of all parts of the community. The Patten Commission \n     has a mandate to produce these new arrangements for fair law \n     enforcement, accountable to and fully representative of the \n     society. Its report is due this summer. So progress on this \n     critical issue is being made.\n       Prisoners have been released. The British have reduced \n     their troop levels to the lowest point in twenty years. \n     Surely, only those for whom too long a sacrifice has made a \n     stone of the heart can fail to see that the future lies with \n     peace.\n       We are heartened by the establishment of the Human Rights \n     Commissions and we look forward to close cross-border co-\n     operation on these vital issues. We also count on early \n     progress on the review of the criminal laws, and the \n     dismantling of emergency legislation.\n       As preparations for the 1999 marching season begin, the \n     situation at Drumcree remains disturbing. We call on all \n     involved to respect and uphold the decisions of the Parades \n     Commission, and to recognize that progress can only be made \n     on the basis of negotiation and agreement.\n       The Ireland of our dreams is no longer a poor country. The \n     dark side of emigration from Ireland now belongs to history. \n     There is still poverty in Ireland, as there is in America. \n     But we are witnessing one of the great miracles of economics, \n     as the romantic Ireland of the past transforms itself into \n     the high-tech Ireland of the future. Yeats would have \n     appreciated it. In Easter 1916, a terrible beauty was born. \n     At Easter 1999, an entrepreneurial beauty is being born \n     before our very eyes.\n       But the modern transformation of Ireland also means that we \n     can no longer rely on the naturally renewing ties between \n     Ireland and America created by successive waves of \n     immigrants. We must work together all the harder, therefore, \n     on both sides of the Atlantic to keep our ties strong and \n     vital. The growth of student educational exchanges between \n     our youth can have a primary role --through college Junior \n     Years Abroad, in summer schools, in the Mitchell and \n     Fulbright Scholarships, and in the expansion of Irish Studies \n     in American universities and American Studies in Ireland.\n       Important though economic performance is, the challenges of \n     the twenty-first century will come increasingly in the realm \n     of the mind, the spirit, and the imagination, where Ireland's \n     strengths are especially great. In an increasingly global \n     world, the contributions of peoples and nations will be \n     measured by how well they enrich our common humanity. Ireland \n     has enormous potential to be one of the brightest stars in \n     this new worldwide firmament, and this challenge is an area \n     in which the American Ireland Fund is playing a vigorous and \n     impressive role.\n       Starting before World War II, it was the custom of Eamon de \n     Valera to speak to his Irish kinfolk in other lands, \n     especially in the United States, and to tell them year by \n     year on St. Patrick's Day of the progress being made to build \n     the Ireland of our dreams--an Ireland, he said, that ``is \n     destined to play, by its example and its inspiration, a great \n     part as a nation among the nations.'' His dream has long been \n     our dream too, and how beautiful it is to see it coming true, \n     as we dedicate ourselves anew to one of the truly great \n     friendships in human history, the friendship of America and \n     all of Ireland.\n       In closing, let me say a final word to our friends from \n     Northern Ireland who are here. It is natural that we focus on \n     the problems of the moment. But we do not overlook all that \n     is good about your land--the ability of the people, their \n     remarkable work ethic, their culture, and the vast potential \n     of both communities that will be unleashed by a peaceful \n     future.\n       We know the achievements of your leadership, which have \n     brought you to this threshold of that future. President \n     Kennedy would call you profiles in courage twice over--for \n     your political courage in facing this extraordinary \n     challenge, and for your very real personal courage in facing \n     physical danger every day.\n       You've been asked to do a great deal already, and you've \n     done it well. Now, you're asked to do even more, because we \n     know you will not fail. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they \n     shall be called the children of God. Thank you very \n     much.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/24/senate-section/article/S3297-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S3297]]\n                        ANTI-SEMITISM IN RUSSIA\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM.

In order to maintain this commitment, the Russian Duma must \ncensure those in its ranks failing to comply with the recognized OSCE \nresolution.\n  In the U.S., Congress has joined international organizations and the \nworld community in denouncing the anti-Semitic statements. House \nConcurrent Resolution 37 asserts that Congress: condemns the \nstatements; commends President Boris Yeltsin and other members of the \nRussian Duma for rebuking the anti-Semitic statements; and reiterates \nour firm belief that such discrimination is counter-productive to \nefforts toward true peace and justice. Furthermore, in dialogue with \nRussian leaders the U.S. has the opportunity to combat this hate-filled \nrhetroic. I believe it is of the utmost priority that the anti-Semitic \nstatements be given proper attention in discussions with Russian \nleaders.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in not only supported House \nConcurrent Resolution 37, but also in signing onto the letter to Vice-\nPresident Al Gore raising the issue of anti-Semitism with Prime \nMinister Primakove.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/24/senate-section/article/S3297-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         50TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY OF BARBARA AND HAROLD HARRIS\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE.

Throughout this \ndistinguished career, Barbara has benefited from the dedication, \nstrength, and devotion of her beloved husband Harold.\n  I ask my fellow colleagues to please join me in congratulating \nBarbara and Harold on this most auspicious occasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/24/senate-section/article/S3297-3", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNITION OF THE OREGON PARTNERSHIP\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today in \nrecognition of an extraordinary group of people in my state who are \nworking each day to protect our children and teenagers from the dangers \nof alcohol and drug abuse.\n  The Oregon Partnership, led by Executive Director, Judy Cushing, is \nthe only nonprofit statewide network of drug prevention services \navailable to every community--rural and urban--throughout Oregon.\n  While we may talk about the importance of drug abuse prevention \nprograms on the floor of the Senate, the staff at the Oregon \nPartnership are turning words into action with very limited federal \nresources. Their accomplishments and allegiance to the thousands whom \nthey serve, deserves respect and additional federal support.\n  Formed in 1993, the Partnership is governed by a volunteer, 12-member \nBoard of Directors and has a statewide volunteer base of 500 educators, \nparents, youth, health professionals, business and faith leaders. \nTogether, they share a common goal--to help the young people of Oregon \nhelp themselves and their peers--to lead productive and drug-free \nlives.\n  Through these combined efforts, this group of dedicated volunteers is \ntruly a partnership. With 73 coalitions that reach across the state of \nOregon, the Partnership empowers communities at a grassroots level \nthrough a strong support network of resources including media relations \nassistance, event planning and training that targets the local needs of \neach community. In addition, the Partnership's resource center provides \ncommunities and families with materials that provide answers to \nquestions about alcohol, tobacco and other drugs. The Partnership also \nmaintains a website that provides details about other available \nresources, materials and programs.\n  Recognizing that information is only effective when it is available, \nthe Oregon Partnership houses the only statewide 24-hour helpline with \nperson-to-person contact every day. The HelpLine/YouthLine currently \nresponds to 2,000 calls per month from substance abusers, family \nmembers and friends who are searching for referral assistance and \ninformation about treatment programs and services within their local \narea.\n  What is truly exemplary about the Oregon Partnership, is that it \nprovides these services through its network of volunteers. More than \nfifty professionally trained volunteers provide confidential \ncounseling, information and local treatment referral for chemical \ndependence and other addictions. Sixty percent of the volunteers are \ncollege and graduate students pursuing counseling careers.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the Oregon Partnership is an example of \nwhat Congress intended for the use of federal drug prevention dollars. \nUnlike any other program in our state, the Oregon Partnership is the \nresource that serves as the link that keeps the chain from prevention \nprograms to treatment strong. The Oregon Partnership is our first line \nof defense and the kind voice at the end of the phone that says, ``Yes, \nwe can help.''\n  For these reasons and many more, I would like to take this \nopportunity to formally thank the directors, members and volunteers of \nthe Oregon Partnership for their dedication and gracious, generous \nservice to the people of Oregon as they work to eliminate drug abuse \nthroughout our state: Judy Cushing, Joyce Adams-Malin, Lloyd Duncan, \nJennifer Fogelman, Jill Showalter, Kaleen Deatherage, Penny Labberton, \nElizabeth Buskirk, Mary Ellen Apostol, Michelle Kromm, Ericka Ziettlow, \nJennie Donnelly, Karla Bateman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/24/senate-section/article/S3297-4", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3297-S3298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   DEMINING IN NICARAGUA AND HONDURAS\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last night, the Senate passed the \nSupplemental Appropriations bill, which, among other things, contains \nfunding for hurricane relief for Central America. I am very pleased \nthat the Supplemental also specifies that up to $2,000,000 should be \nmade available for humanitarian demining activities in Nicaragua and \nHonduras. Hurricane Mitch has greatly exacerbated the problem of anti-\npersonnel landmines in both countries. An estimated 100,000 mines were \nplaced in the Nicaraguan-Honduran border area in the 1980's by \nSandanista and Contra soldiers. Demining activities to date have been \ndiligent, but painstakingly slow, as over 70,000 mines continue to \nthreaten the population.\n  While the problem has certainly been very serious, at least the areas \nwhich contained these mines in both countries were reasonably well \nknown. Until Hurricane Mitch, that is. Mudslides and the tremendous \nvolume of water that accompanied the hurricane have carried mines into \nareas not previously contaminated. Two Nicaraguan civilians were killed \nlast fall by a mine in an area never thought to hold them previously. A \nU.S. Army study confirmed the new threat in many areas of Nicaragua.\n  Imagine, Mr. President, the impact on reconstruction efforts in these \ndevastated countries if an American or other foreign national working \nto rebuild the infrastructure should be injured or killed by a mine.\n  Other Senators may be surprised to hear that one of the most \neffective ways to demine these areas is the use of man-dog teams. The \nexplosive material in mines emit a gas, which dogs can be trained to \ndetect. Once a mine is detected, the dog is trained to immediately stop \nand sit, and conventional\n\n[[Page S3298]]\n\ndemining can begin. Conventional demining amounts to metal detection, a \npainstakingly slow process which may detect thousands of discarded \nmetal items for every mine found. Most surface area scanned for mines \nnever had any to begin with. But the fear of mines keeps native \npopulations from utilizing the land. Dogs can radically speed the \nprocess, and focus the efforts of human deminers into areas which \nactually contain mines.\n  The Marshall Legacy Institute, responding to a request from the \nInterAmerican Defense Board, has proposed putting additional man-dog \nteams into Central America to speed the reconstruction process. The \nproposal has the support of the Humane Society, and I hope the \nAdministration will give serious consideration to supporting this \nproposal with these supplemental funds.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/24/senate-section/article/S3298-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO A UTAH NATIVE\n\nMr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to note a significant event in \nthe life of a native son of Utah and for those of us here in \nWashington. After working for over thirty years in government and \nprivate service, Anthony T. Cluff is leaving the leadership role he has \nheld at one of the preeminent trade groups in Washington, The Bankers \nRoundtable.\n  Few individuals have contributed so much to this city.\n  Tony worked as an economist at the Treasury Department and later with \nthe American Bankers Association and the Securities Industry \nAssociation. Then he spent 8 years on Capitol Hill as a member of the \nSenate Banking Committee staff and served several years as Minority \nStaff Director under Senator John Tower of Texas. He also served as a \nstaff member to my father here in the Senate.\n  For nearly two decades he has steered the association that represents \nthe nation's leading banks--The Bankers Roundtable and its predecessor, \nthe Association of Reserve City Bankers. During his tenure, he has \nelevated the prominence of the group, enhanced its message and provided \nhis members with important professional guidance. Under his leadership, \nthe Roundtable expanded its range of activities and took leadership \nroles in interstate banking legislation, payments system regulation, \nenvironmental liability reforms and addressing the challenges of new \ntechnology for the banking industry. Most of all, Tony imparted to the \nassociation and its staff his values of hard work, doing what is right \nand speaking the truth; these values are reflected in the approaches \nthat the association takes in working with government.\n  Tony Cluff was born in Logan, Utah, and has maintained his ties to \nUtah despite spending most of his time in Washington. For though he has \nmany responsibilities here, many of his family and friends remain in \nUtah and the West.\n  With long service to his country and to the industry he has \nrepresented, Tony is leaving The Bankers Roundtable to pursue other \ninterests that will afford him more time to write, to be with his \nchildren and grandchildren and to enjoy life a bit more. He leaves his \nwork ``on top,'' with an unblemished record and with the knowledge that \nthere are many in this city and throughout the country indebted to him.\n  I want to wish Tony and his family the very best and express my \nthanks for all that he has done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/24/senate-section/article/S3298-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           KOSOVO RESOLUTION\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, on Tuesday morning, the President \nmade it clear that efforts to achieve a negotiated political solution \nto the Kosovo crisis had failed and that military action in the form of \nNATO conducted air strikes employing US military equipment and \npersonnel was imminent. Although I am very disappointed that the \nPresident did not include congressional leaders much earlier in this \nimportant debate, the fact remains that the President has begun the \nprocess, under his authority as Commander-in-Chief, which will lead to \nair strikes and will put the men and women of our armed forces in \nharm's way. My vote supporting S. Con. Res. 21 was, therefore cast, for \nthe express purpose of conveying support for our troops who, at this \nmoment, are ready to risk their lives on this very dangerous mission. \nMy vote should not be interpreted as an endorsement of or authorization \nfor any escalation to more extensive involvement, such as the \nintroduction of ground troops in this conflict. Indeed, before any such \nescalation of our military commitment in this crisis is contemplated, I \nbelieve the President should give Congress a more significant role in \nthe debate than we have thus far and address many critical questions \nregarding US military involvement. Specifically, the President must \nclearly explain what US national security interests are at stake, the \nmission objectives of our military action, the cost and duration of the \ndeployment, and overall exit strategy. Failure to consult with Congress \non these important issues in a timely fashion would significantly \naffect the extent of my support for any subsequent, broader US \ninvolvement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/24/senate-section/article/S3298-3", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3298-S3299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SEVERE DROP IN PORK PRICES\n\n Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask that two letters be printed \nin the Record. Senator Bond and I worked on an amendment to the \nsupplemental appropriations bill that would help the plight of the hog \nfarmers in the state of Missouri and across the nation.\n  The Missouri Farm Bureau, the Missouri Pork Producers, the American \nFarm Bureau, and National Pork Producers Council requested our \nassistance, and we have responded by working with the Appropriations \nCommittee to get an amendment included in the supplemental \nappropriations bill that makes $250 million available for farmers \nstruggling to survive the severe drop in pork prices. Under the \namendment, the U.S. Department of Agriculture would be provided with \n$150 million new funds and would be given the authority to use another \n$100 million, that the USDA already has, to help hog farmers.\n  It is the understanding of those of us that have offered this \namendment today that the majority of the funds available to the \nSecretary of Agriculture will be used on behalf of our nation's pork \nfarmers. Last year, all of the major commodity groups received disaster \nassistance, but the hog farmers received nothing.\n  The letters from the Missouri Farm Bureau, the American Farm Bureau, \nand the National Pork Producers Council define further the farmers' \ninterest in our amendment.\n  The letters follow:\n\n\n                              Missouri Farm Bureau Federation,\n\n                               Jefferson City, MO, March 18, 1999.\n     Hon. John Ashcroft,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Christopher Bond,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Ashcroft and Bond: On behalf of Missouri Farm \n     Bureau, the state's largest general farm organization, I am \n     writing to express our strong support of your efforts to make \n     additional funding available to the U.S. Department of \n     Agriculture for economic disaster payments to pork producers. \n     We believe that waiving the existing cap on USDA Section 32 \n     funds and appropriating an additional $150 million to Section \n     32 will pave the way for the Secretary of Agriculture to \n     provide much-needed relief to pork producers.\n       According to the University of Missouri, cash receipts for \n     the U.S. pork industry are expected to average less than $9 \n     billion in 1998, a reduction of over $4 billion from the 1997 \n     level of $13.2 billion. Although hog prices have recovered \n     from the historic lows experienced over the October 1998-\n     January 1999 period, they remain far below the average cost \n     of production. Economists have now estimated the market \n     failed to reflect normal supply and demand conditions last \n     Fall when hog prices plummeted to 8 cents per pound. Studies \n     indicate that under normal supply and demand conditions \n     prices would have fallen to between $25.87 a hundredweight \n     and $29.41 a hundredweight.\n       Funds that will be available for direct payments under \n     Section 32 will not compensate pork producers for all the \n     staggering losses experienced in recent months.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 774, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 774) to amend the Small Business Act to change \n     the conditions of participation and provide an authorization \n     of appropriations for the women's business center program.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There being no objection, the Senate proceeded \nto consider the bill.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr President, today we in the United States Senate have an \nopportunity to take an important step in strengthening the Women's \nBusiness Center Program at the Small Business Administration. The \n``Women's Business Center Amendment Act of 1999'' authorizes SBA to \nmake grants totaling up to $11 million annually to Women's Business \nCenters throughout the United States.\n  During the past decade, the number of women-owned small businesses \nhas exploded. Women-owned small businesses are the fastest growing \nsegment of our nation's business community. Years ago, there was an \nadvertising campaign slogan proclaiming that women ``had come a long \nway.'' I find that slogan very applicable to the plateau now reached by \nwomen entrepreneurs. During this time, women business owners have \nestablished themselves as a key component of our small business \ncommunity, which has been the engine driving our economy during the \n1990's.\n  The research foundation arm of the National Association of Women \nBusiness Owners (NAWBO) has conducted studies which show that women no \nlonger are having more trouble than men obtaining bank loans. However, \nobtaining a loan does not guarantee a business' success. In fact, many \nsmall businesses that start out well capitalized end up failing. \nSuccess of a small business is usually dependent on the owner's \nmanagement capabilities. Women's Business Centers offer help to women \nentrepreneurs who are looking to start a business or who already have a \nbusiness by providing them with business and education training, \nincluding marketing, finance, and management assistance.\n  For the past three years, I have worked with Senator Domenici Senator \nKerry, and members of the Committee on Small Business first to save and \nlater to expand the Women's Business Center Program. In 1996, when the \nAdministration sought to zero-out the budget for the program, I helped \nlead the effort to earmark funds for the program within the SBA FY 1997 \nbudget. Senator Domenici, Senator Kerry and I sponsored the ``Women's \nBusiness Centers Act of 1997,'' which expanded the program from $4 \nmillion to $8 million per year. This bill was incorporated into the \n``Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997'' (Public Law 105-135).\n  Last year, I sponsored the ``Year 2000 Readiness and Small Business \nPrograms Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998,'' which included an \nincrease from $8 million to $12 million and made other reforms in the \nWomen's Business Center Program. This bill passed the Senate \nunanimously; unfortunately, the House of Representatives was not able \nto act on the bill before Congress adjourned. In light of the pressing \ndemand to expand the authorization for the Women's Business Center \nProgram, I applaud the Chairman of the House Committee on Small \nBusiness, Jim Talent, and the Committee's ranking Democrat, Nydia \nVelazquez, for their efforts to push through House-passage of the bill \nso quickly this year.\n  The ``Women's Business Center Amendments Act of 1999'' brings us a \ngiant step closer to achieving our goal of having at least one Women's \nBusiness Center up and running in each of the 50 states. Under this \nbill, SBA will be able to continue to fund the existing 35 eligible \nCenters and provide seed funding to new eligible applicant Centers in \nstates not yet served by the program.\n  The bill authorizes $11 million for Fiscal Year 2000 for the Women's \nBusiness Center Program; however, the Administration has requested $9 \nmillion. This summer I intend to work closely with Senator Kerry on \nlegislation to allow Women's Business Centers that have completed their \ninitial three or five year Women's Business Center grants with SBA to \napply for another five year grant to allow them to be able to continue \nto provide the high level of service they are currently delivering to \nwomen small business owners. Our initiative may require an increase in \nSBA's budget for the Women's Business Center Program for FY 2000, and I \nintend to study very closely the financial needs of the program. As a \nmember of the Appropriations Committee, I will urge my colleagues to \nsupport an increase in the FY 2000 budget for the program, if \nnecessary, that will allow it to expand and meet the needs of the \ngrowing number of women-owned small businesses. I strongly believe we \nmust pursue this course even if that means pushing for an increase \nabove the amount requested in the President's budget request.\n  Mr. President, it is critical that the Senate vote to approve the \n``women's Business Center Act of 1999,'' so that the Federal government \ncan continue to help make small business ownership a reality for women \nentrepreneurs. I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on H.R. 774, the \nWomen's Business Center Amendments Act of 1999. This bill will make \nsmall but important changes to the Women's Business Center program. \nFirst, similar to the bill that Senator Cleland and I introduced last \nCongress, it will raise the authorization for the centers from $8 \nmillion to $11 million. Secondly, the bill changes the matching \nrequirements for centers; instead of raising two non-Federal dollars \nfor every Federal dollar in the third, fourth and fifth years, centers \nwill only be required to raise one non-Federal dollar for every one \nFederal dollar. I\n\n[[Page S3300]]\n\nsupport this bill, thought I would prefer that the authorization and \nfunding were increased to $12 million to make it consistent with the \nlegislation our Committee passed last year. This program has been very \nsuccessful in helping women start and grow businesses and it deserves \ngenerous funding.\n  Women-owned businesses are increasing in number, range, diversity and \nearning power. They constitute more than one-third of the 20 million \nsmall businesses in the United States, and account for some $3 trillion \nin annual revenues to the economy. Addressing the special needs of \nwomen-owned businesses serves not only entrepreneurs, but also the \neconomic strength of this nation as a whole.\n  This bill further ensures that new and potential women business \nowners, who otherwise might be excluded from the economic mainstream of \nsociety, are afforded every opportunity to succeed through the Small \nBusiness Administration's Women's Business Centers program.\n  Centers are faced with the challenging task of teaching business \nbasics and providing practical support and realistic encouragement. \nMassachusetts has an excellent example of a Women's Business Center--\nthe Center for Women & Enterprise (CWE) in Boston. Andrea Silbert is a \ntireless executive director who effectively raises money, forges \npartnerships and designs thorough training and mentoring programs to \nhelp women entrepreneurs. When CWE trains an entrepreneur, she leans \nhow to approach a lender for a loan, learns how to manage her business, \nand gains an understanding of the hows and whys of marketing. \nNationwide, women should have access to this type of quality, \ncomprehensive training.\n  It is clear that the centers are having a positive social and \neconomic impact on the lives of many women and the communities which \nthey serve. New clients continue to be racially and ethnically diverse: \nSome 40 percent are members of minority groups. About half are married, \nand half are single, widowed, divorced, or separated.\n  While this bill addresses some important issues, I am concerned about \nthe unresolved problem of sustainability. How can established, \neffective centers that are at the end of the five-year Federal funding \ncycle continue to provide the same quality of services without the \nFederal contribution? It's their bread and butter, and it's \nindispensable leverage that helps centers raise the obligatory matching \nfunding.\n  Agnes Noonan, executive director of the Women's Economic Self-\nSufficiency Team (WESST corp.) in New Mexico recently reinforced this \npoint when she testified before the Senate Committee on Small Business. \nWith an 89 percent growth in the number of women-owned businesses over \nthe last decade and a 161 percent increase in revenues, it is sound \neconomic policy for the Federal government to support programs which \nfacilitate the training and development of women business owners. It \nfollows that we would be wise to safeguard the investment that has been \nmade to date in the infrastructure of women's business centers around \nthe country.\n  I believe we should find a fair way to let these centers recompete \nfor the base funding. And we should do it this calendar year, before \nit's too late and the centers have lost their Federal funding and are \nout of business. I will be introducing a bill to allow Women's Business \nCenters to recompete for Federal funding in mid-April, when we return \nfrom the Easter recess. I hope that my colleagues with strong Women's \nBusiness Centers in their states will join me in sponsoring \nrecompetition legislation.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their continuing efforts to \nexpand policies that allow women entrepreneurs to grow and thrive.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read a \nthird time, and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed at the \nappropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING RECOVERY OF FUNDS \n                   BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN TOBACCO-RELATED \n                   LITIGATION.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Federal Tobacco Recovery and Medicare Prescription Drug \n     Benefit Resolution of 1999''.\n       (b) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The President, in his January 19, 1999 State of the \n     Union address--\n       (A) announced that the Department of Justice would develop \n     a litigation plan for the Federal Government against the \n     tobacco industry;\n       (B) indicated that any funds recovered through such \n     litigation would be used to strengthen the medicare program \n     under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 \n     et seq.); and\n       (C) urged Congress to pass legislation to include a \n     prescription drug benefit in the medicare program.\n       (2) The traditional medicare program does not include most \n     outpatient prescription drugs as part of its benefit package.\n       (3) Prescription drugs are a central element in improving \n     quality of life and in routine health maintenance.\n       (4) Prescription drugs are a key component to early health \n     care intervention strategies for the elderly.\n       (5) Eighty percent of retired individuals take at least 1 \n     prescription drug every day.\n       (6) Individuals 65 years of age or older represent 12 \n     percent of the population of the United States but consume \n     more than \\1/3\\ of all prescription drugs consumed in the \n     United States.\n       (7) Exclusive of health care-related premiums, prescription \n     drugs account for almost \\1/3\\ of the health care costs and \n     expenditures of elderly individuals.\n       (8) Approximately 10 percent of all medicare beneficiaries \n     account for nearly 50 percent of all prescription drug \n     spending by the elderly.\n       (9) Research and development on new generations of \n     pharmaceuticals represent new opportunities for healthier, \n     longer lives for our Nation's elderly.\n       (10) Prescription drugs are among the key tools in every \n     health care professional's medical arsenal to help combat and \n     prevent the onset, recurrence, or debilitating effects of \n     illness and disease.\n       (11) While Federal litigation against tobacco companies \n     will take time to develop and execute, Congress should \n     continue to work to address the immediate need among the \n     elderly for access to affordable prescription drugs.\n       (12) Treatment of tobacco-related illness is estimated to \n     cost the medicare program approximately $10,000,000,000 every \n     year.\n       (13) In 1998, 50 States reached a settlement with the \n     tobacco industry for tobacco-related illness in the amount of \n     $206,000,000,000.\n       (14) Recoveries from Federal tobacco-related litigation, if \n     successful, will likely be comparable to or exceed the dollar \n     amount recovered by the States under the 1998 settlement.\n       (15) In the event Federal tobacco-related litigation is \n     undertaken and is successful, funds recovered under such \n     litigation should first be used for the purpose of \n     strengthening the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and \n     second to finance a medicare prescription drug benefit.\n       (16) The scope of any medicare prescription drug benefit \n     should be as comprehensive as\n\n[[Page S3302]]\n\n     possible, with drugs used in fighting tobacco-related \n     illnesses given a first priority.\n       (17) Most Americans want the medicare program to cover the \n     costs of prescription drugs.\n       (c) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     resolution assume that funds recovered under any tobacco-\n     related litigation commenced by the Federal Government should \n     be used first for the purpose of strengthening the Federal \n     Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and second to fund a medicare \n     prescription drug benefit.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this resolution--``The Federal Tobacco \nRecovery and Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Resolution of 1999''--\nurges the Administration to set aside funds from any Federal tobacco-\nrelated litigation for the primary purpose of strengthening the \nsolvency of the Medicare Trust Fund and second to help pay for a \nMedicare prescription drug benefit.\n  In the President's January 19, 1999 State of the Union Address he \nannounced that the Justice Department was preparing a litigation plan \nto take tobacco companies to court and that the funds recovered from \nsuch an effort would be used to strengthen the Medicare program.\n  The details of the Justice Department's litigation plan are still not \nknown at this time. However, the United States Senate should be on \nrecord as to how any funds recovered should be spent.\n  It is my belief that our first priority must be to shore up the \nMedicare Trust Fund which, by the most recent estimates of the \nCongressional Budget Office, shows the program going into insolvency in \n2010.\n  The second use of these funds should then go to help defray the costs \nof a Medicare prescription drug benefit.\n  While this resolution states clearly as to how these funds ought to \nbe spent, a few things must be made clear:\n  1. This resolution must not impede our efforts to address the \nimmediate need among seniors for access to affordable prescription \ndrugs. We must do something now and must not use this resolution as an \nexcuse not to act now.\n  2. The funding mechanism for this benefit is not a tax, is not a \npayroll increase, is not a premium increase and does not tap into the \n``surplus''.\n  Some of you might ask the question, ``Why should we look to the \ntobacco industry to fund a Medicare prescription drug benefit?''\n  The answer to this question is clear. Tobacco companies produce a \nproduct that is responsible for millions of deaths and billions of \ndollars worth of tobacco-related illness in this country. Taxpayers \nshould not be forced to pay for what the tobacco industry is primarily \nresponsible for.\n  Medicare alone is estimated to incur more than $10 billion in \nexpenses for the treatment of tobacco-related illness every year. This \nfigure reflects what Medicare covers. What this figure does not reflect \nis the amount of money paid out of the pockets of beneficiaries for all \nthe outpatient prescription drugs needed for the treatment of tobacco-\nrelated illness that Medicare does not cover. The types of drugs I am \nreferring to include:\n  Zyban--The only prescription drug available to assist smokers in \nquitting. This would be a key element in a smoking cessation and \nbroader prevention strategy.\n  Bronchodilators--used in the treatment of emphysema.\n  Nitroglycerin--used in the treatment of angina pectoris (reduction in \nblood flow to the heart).\n  Cholestyramine and Colestipol--used in the treatment of high \ncholesterol.\n  Calcium Channel Blockers/Diuretics/Beta Blockers/Vasodilators--used \nin the treatment of high blood pressure.\n  The use of tobacco products and the cost of treatment is draining the \nMedicare program. But it is costing Medicare beneficiaries their lives.\n  According to the American Cancer Society, individuals who smoke have \ndouble the heart attack risk of non-smokers. Cigarette smoking is the \nbiggest risk factor for sudden cardiac death. And smokers who have a \nheart attack are more likely to die and die suddenly (within an hour) \nthan are non-smokers.\n  These are real costs that real people face every day.\n  Combine these sobering facts with the overwhelming desire among \nnearly all our colleagues, the Nation's leading policy experts, and \nmost importantly, beneficiaries of the program, that prescription drugs \nmust be included in any reform of the Medicare program. The need for \nprescription drugs is undeniable. Just listen to some of the facts:\n  80 percent of retired persons take a prescription drug every day.\n  Annual drug expenditures for the average Medicare beneficiary are \napproximately $600.\n  While individuals 65 or older represent 12 percent of the U.S. \npopulation, they consume more than one-third of all prescription drugs.\n  Excluding the cost of premiums, drugs account for almost one-third of \nthe elderly's health costs and expenditures.\n  Approximately 10 percent of Medicare beneficiaries account for nearly \nhalf of all drug spending among the elderly.\n  By 2007, the Health Care Financing Administration projects that drug \ncosts will make up over 8 percent of total health care spending (in \n1996 this figure was 6 percent).\n  Combine this need with the fact that in a recent study published in \nthe journal Health Affairs, approximately one third of all Medicare \nbeneficiaries have no prescription drug coverage at all.\n  And the two-thirds of Medicare beneficiaries that reportedly do have \ncoverage (through supplemental programs such as Medigap or employee-\nbased retirement health plans) have coverage that is not uniform, often \nlimited, and frequently very expensive.\n  A recent study conducted by the League of Women Voters and the Kaiser \nFamily Foundation, in which over 6,500 of current and future Medicare \nbeneficiaries were interviewed on their views of reforming the Medicare \nprogram, found that after fraud, waste, and abuse, the number one \nconcern for beneficiaries is access to affordable prescription drugs.\n  Advances in biotechnology and genetic engineering have brought about \na true revolution in the care and treatment of patients. What once \nseemed science fiction in 1965 is today's scientific reality.\n  In today's, and tomorrow's, health care system, prescription drugs \nare an integral part of every health care professional's medical \narsenal.\n  But these advances in technology have come at a price. A price that, \nfor many seniors, is not affordable. Or even worse, forces them to make \ndecisions nobody should face.\n  Decisions about purchasing drugs or paying the rent. Or skipping \ndoses of a prescription or reducing the dosage to make it last longer--\ndecisions that can often have serious health consequences.\n  What good are the best drugs in the world if nobody can afford them \nor they bankrupt people trying to do the right thing?\n  This is where this resolution makes a difference. This resolution \nsays that we ought to find a way to pay for prescription drugs. To pay \nfor them in a manner that is fiscally responsible.\n  As I noted earlier, this resolution does not guarantee a Medicare \nprescription drug benefit since it is contingent upon a successful \nlitigation effort by the Justice Department.\n  And, the size and scope of a benefit funded by such a recovery would \nbe dependent on the size of the recovery.\n  To give my colleagues a sense of the potential size of a successful \nlitigation effort, and using the recent State tobacco settlement as a \nbenchmark, we could expect a Federal lawsuit that could match or exceed \nthe $206 billion settlement of the States.\n  So this is no small undertaking and has the potential to have far \nreaching, positive consequences for the Medicare program.\n  This resolution would also prioritize the types of prescription drugs \nthat ought to be funded. First priority would go to funding drugs used \nin the treatment of tobacco-related illness. If additional funds are \navailable, the range of drugs could then be expanded.\n  I want to re-iterate that this resolution should not be used to take \nthis distinguished body off the hook for addressing the immediate need \namong seniors for affordable prescription drugs.\n  We must continue to work to find a way to handle this problem now. \nOur resolution, if adopted, would provide momentum for this effort and \nfor the Justice Department's litigation efforts.\n  Finally, this resolution has the support of the nation's largest \nsenior\n\n[[Page S3303]]\n\nmembership organization, the American Association of Retired Persons.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.\n  Mr. President, last week, we had very heated debate on the question \nof whether the Federal Government should designate a portion of the \ntobacco settlements received by the 50 individual States and require \nthem to use those designated funds for certain specific purposes. By \nmore than a 2-to-1 margin, the Senate rejected that proposal.\n  There were a number of reasons why the Senate rejected that proposal. \nI think they were strong and compelling reasons. They included the fact \nthat the States had initiated these litigations against the tobacco \nindustry without the assistance of the Federal Government, that the \nStates were acting responsibly in utilizing the tobacco funds; and I \nbelieve a persuasive reason was the fact that the Federal Government \nannounced its intention to initiate its own litigation against the \ntobacco industry for its loss of revenue through programs such as \nMedicare to tobacco-related diseases.\n  This amendment builds upon that debate of last week. It builds, also, \nupon a statement that was made by the President in his January 19 State \nof the Union Address in which the President stated that the Justice \nDepartment was preparing a litigation plan to take tobacco companies to \ncourt, and that the funds recovered from that effort would be used to \nstrengthen the Medicare program. The details of the Justice Department \nlitigation plan are still unknown at this time. However, I think it is \nappropriate that the Senate should be on record as to how these funds, \nwhen recovered, should be utilized.\n  It is my belief that the first priority must be to strengthen the \nMedicare system, and that the most appropriate method of achieving that \nobjective is to provide that the first call of any recovery from a \nFederal tobacco litigation would be to replace those funds in the \nMedicare trust fund that have been excessively expended in order to \ntreat tobacco-related afflictions.\n  Second is that those funds should be used to commence a Medicare \nprescription drug benefit. Why is it appropriate that the second call \nfor these funds should be to fund a prescription medication benefit? \nThese reasons include that a substantial amount of the expenditures for \ntobacco-related diseases end up having a pharmacological cost, and some \nof the most used and most expensive medications are those which are \nrelated to the treatment through prescription medication of tobacco-\nrelated diseases. Zyban, for instance, is the only prescription drug \navailable to assist smokers in quitting their addiction. Other drugs \nthat relate to bronchitis, used for treatment in emphysema, \nnitroglycerin, and used for treatment of angina pectoris, a disease \nfrequently associated with tobacco use, are examples of the types of \nprescription medications that are utilized in large part because of a \ntobacco affliction. The use of tobacco products is costing Medicare by \ndraining its resources. But it is costing the Medicare beneficiaries \npotentially their lives.\n  According to the American Cancer Society, individuals who smoke have \ndouble the heart attack risk of nonsmokers. Therefore, they are more \nlikely to require the medication associated with heart disease. \nCigarette smoking is the biggest risk factor for sudden cardiac death. \nSmokers who had a heart attack are more likely to die, and die \nsuddenly, than nonsmokers. These are real costs, these are real people \nwhose lives are at stake.\n  Mr. President, just listen to some of the facts in terms of the use \nby our Medicare beneficiary population of prescription medication--\nmedication which today is not covered by the Medicare program. Eighty \npercent of retired persons take at least one prescribed drug every day.\n\n  Annual drug expenditures for the average Medicare beneficiary is \n$600. While individuals 65 or older represent only 12 percent of the \nUnited States population, they consume more than one-third of all \nprescription drugs. Excluding the cost of premiums, drugs account for \nalmost one-third of the elderly's health costs and expenditures. \nApproximately 10 percent of Medicare beneficiary accounts for nearly \nhalf of all drug spending among the elderly.\n  By the year 2007, the Health Care Finance Administration projects \nthat drug costs will make up over eight percent of total health care \nspending. This compares to 6 percent as recently as 1996.\n  Mr. President, these are all reasons why it is appropriate that as \nthe Federal Government commences its litigation to recover the cost \nthat the Federal Government has expended through programs such as \nMedicare, that the first use of these funds should be to strengthen \nMedicare, and the second use should be to commence the funding of a \nprescription drug benefit.\n  This proposal is receiving the strong support of groups which \nrepresent the interests of older Americans. The AARP has officially \nendorsed the concept of utilizing recoveries from the to be litigation \nby the Federal Government for purposes of strengthening Medicare and \nthen providing for a prescription drug benefit.\n  The American Association of Retired Persons is a strong voice in \nsupport of this proposal.\n  Mr. President, I urge that my colleagues give their support in \nadopting this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask uanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \nletter from the American Association of Retired Persons.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                         AARP,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 24, 1999.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: Thank you for the opportunity to \n     review the ``Affordable Prescription Drugs for Seniors \n     Resolution'' that you plan to offer during the Senate's \n     debate of the FY 2000 Budget Resolution. I want to commend \n     you for your leadership in calling the Congress's attention \n     to the issue of the high cost of prescription drugs and the \n     difficulties older Americans have because out-patient \n     prescription drugs are not included in Medicare's benefit \n     package.\n       Since Medicare was created over 30 years ago, prescription \n     drugs have become more and more central to the delivery of \n     high quality health care. As a result most health insurance \n     plans for workers cover prescription drugs. Medicare, \n     however, does not. A huge challenge before us is to find an \n     affordable way to provide prescription drug coverage to \n     Medicare beneficiaries in whatever health care plan they \n     choose.\n       Your resolution presents a way to help finance a \n     prescription drug benefit through earmarking a portion of \n     funds recovered from any tobacco-related federal litigation. \n     AARP views this idea as a constructive effort to address a \n     very serious problem for millions of Medicare beneficiaries. \n     For years, the Medicare program has borne the cost of caring \n     for people with tobacco-related illnesses. It, therefore, \n     seems fair and reasonable that this health insurance program \n     get a share of funds recovered from a Justice Department \n     lawsuit to fund a needed benefit. However, as you point out, \n     your proposal is contingent upon successful federal \n     litigation.\n       Providing Medicare beneficiaries with a prescription drug \n     benefit is an important issue for AARP and we are pleased \n     that your resolution begins to address this. We look forward \n     to working with you and other Members of Congress on a \n     bipartisan basis to investigate approaches for providing a \n     Medicare prescription drug benefits and to address the high \n     cost of prescription drugs. Please feel free to contact me or \n     have your staff contact Tricia Smith or Mila Becker of our \n     Federal Affairs Health Team at (202) 434-3770.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Horace B. Deets,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 165\n\n       (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that the \n     Congress and the President should offset inappropriate \n     emergency funding from fiscal year 1999 in fiscal year 1999.)\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk, which is \ncosponsored by Senators Snowe and Feingold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CRAPO). The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida (Mr. Graham), for himself, and Mr. \n     Feingold, and Ms. Snowe, proposes an amendment numbered 165.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE SENATE ON OFFSETTING INAPPROPRIATE \n                   EMERGENCY SPENDING.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the levels in this \n     resolution assume that--\n\n[[Page S3304]]\n\n       (1) some emergency expenditures made at the end of the \n     105th Congress for fiscal year 1999 were inappropriately \n     deemed as emergencies; and\n       (2) Congress and the President should identify these \n     inappropriate expenditures and fully pay for these \n     expenditures during the fiscal year in which they will be \n     incurred.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, we learned last year that five years of \nfiscal austerity and economic growth had transformed a $290 billion \ndeficit into the first budget surplus in more than a generation.\n  I am dedicated to strengthening the nation's long-term economic \nprospects through prudent fiscal policy.\n  This discipline helped to create favorable economic, fiscal, \ndemographic and political conditions to address the long-term Social \nSecurity and Medicare deficits that will accompany the aging of our \nnation's population.\n  These deficits threaten to undo the hard work and fiscal discipline \nof recent years as well as undermine our potential for future economic \ngrowth.\n  But that success did not give the Congress license to return to the \nfree-spending ways of the past--especially since 100 percent of the \nsurplus was the result of surpluses in the Social Security Trust Fund.\n  We owe it to our children and grandchildren to save this money until \nSocial Security's long-term solvency is assured.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, the last legislative action of the last \nCongress made a mockery of our promises to be fiscally disciplined.\n  In the waning hours of last fall's budget negotiations, we passed a \n$532 billion Omnibus Appropriations Bill.\n  Included in that was $21.4 billion in so-called ``emergency'' \nspending.\n  Since that $21.4 billion could be approved without offsets, that \nfunding came right out of the surplus--reducing it from $80 billion to \n$59 billion.\n  That action would have been more palatable had all of the supposedly \n``emergency'' funds been allocated for true emergencies.\n  But while some of the $21.4 billion was used to fund what had \ntraditionally been accepted as emergencies--necessary expenditures for \nsudden, urgent or unforeseen temporary needs--much of it was not.\n  For example, the Y2K computer problem received $3.35 billion.\n  And $100 million went to a new visitors center at the Capitol.\n  These projects might be worthy. They might be mandatory.\n  But to label them ``emergency'' threatens to undermine efforts to \nsafeguard the surplus of Social Security.\n  Even worse, this budgetary slight of hand was also used to increase \nfunding for projects that had been funded in the regular appropriations \nprocess.\n  For example, after previously allocating $270.5 billion for defense, \nCongress provided an additional $8.3 billion in ``emergency'' defense \nspending in the Omnibus Appropriations Bill.\n  And that's not all.\n  Because these pseudo-emergency spending provisions were included in \nan Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report, they could not be removed \nwithout sending the entire funding package down to defeat.\n  Members of both Houses were left with an unpalatable choice: shut \ndown the government, or steal from our children's and grandchildren's \nSocial Security surplus.\n  Mr. President, that's not a choice. It's a national disgrace.\n  It is vital that we institute an emergency spending process that \nresponds quickly to true emergencies without opening the door to \nmisuse.\n  We must establish procedural safeguards to deter future Congresses \nfrom misusing the emergency spending process.\n  We should not attach any emergency spending to non-emergency \nlegislation or designate emergency spending measures that do not meet \nthe definition of an emergency.\n  Mr. President, in February I was pleased to join Senator Olympia \nSnowe of Maine in introducing legislation that will protect our newly \nwon budget surplus from false, emergency budgetary alarms.\n  We proposed three reforms.\n  First, to create a point of order, similar to the Byrd Rule, that \nprevents non-emergency items from being included in emergency spending.\n  This will enable members to challenge the validity of any individual \nitem that is designated an emergency without defeating the entire \nemergency spending bill.\n  Second, to require a 60-vote super-majority in the Senate for passage \nof any bill that contains emergency spending, whether it is designated \nan ``emergency'' spending bill or not.\n  This will encourage Congress to either pay for supplemental \nappropriations or make sure they represent a true emergency.\n  And third, to make all proposed emergency spending subject to a 60-\nvote point of order in the Senate.\n  This rule will help to prevent non-emergency items from ever being \nincluded in emergency legislation.\n  But even if passed, our legislation will not be the total cure for \nCongress' budding addiction to emergency spending.\n  In the short term, it is vital that we immediately replenish the \nsurplus with the funds that were ``borrowed'' last fall.\n  On the day after passage of the Omnibus Appropriations Act--October \n21, 1998--I wrote the President and asked that the federal government \ncommit itself to restoring funding the the non-traditional \n``emergency'' items during this fiscal year.\n  I did not receive a response.\n  So in January, I again wrote to the President and made the same \nrequest for a commitment to fiscal discipline.\n  Once again, I have not received a response.\n  And on January 18, 1999, Roll Call published an opinion piece of mine \nin which I asked the President to address this subject in his State of \nthe Union address.\n  He did not.\n  Fortunately, the United States Constitution says that the Congress \nneed not wait for the President.\n  We can--and must--take the steps necessary to restore the budget \nsurplus to its previous levels.\n  And we must do that now, before the urge to spend the surplus becomes \na full-fledged addiction.\n  To that end, tonight I am introducing a Sense of the Senate \nResolution that starts the process of rectifying last fall's budgetary \nprocess.\n  Its message is simple: Congress and the President should restore \nthose funds that were inappropriately deemed as emergencies and taken \nfrom the budget surplus.\n  Mr. President, as we debate the first post-deficit Budget Resolution \nin more than a quarter-century, it is vital that the American people \nknow that we will maintain the fiscal discipline that has helped to \nproduce our favorable economic climate.\n  Fiscal responsibility means taking responsibility for our mistakes--\nand ensuring that we do not misuse our emergency spending powers.\n  The next Congress that leaves the door wide open to raids on the \nsurplus will be the one that passes on more debt--and a less secure \nSocial Security system--to our children and grandchildren.\n  Mr. President, we have heard much today--and I particularly commend \nyou and Senator Grams of Minnesota for the amendment that you just \noffered--on the subject of locking up the non-Social Security surplus \nin excess of that which is currently anticipated. We have considered \nseveral proposals throughout the day today. I anticipate other \nproposals of a similar nature will be considered tomorrow. I believe \nthere is a strong resolve among the Members of the Senate to protect \nboth the Social Security surplus and the non-Social Security surplus \nand to use it for appropriate purposes.\n  I might say personally that I believe the first use of the money \nshould be to reduce the enormous national debt that we have accumulated \nover the last 30 years, and I will advocate that be the priority \npurpose. Unless we first direct our attention to protecting the surplus \nitself, there won't be anything left, no matter how tightly it is \ncontained in a lockbox to be used for any of these desirable ends. So \nour first goal must be to focus on how can we protect the surplus \nitself, and then see that the surplus is used for appropriate purposes.\n  Recently, Senator Olympia Snowe and myself introduced legislation \nwhich was intended to close one of the loopholes which you, Mr. \nPresident, have just alluded to. That was a major source of leakage of \nthe surplus as recently as October of last year. That\n\n[[Page S3305]]\n\nwas the inappropriate use of the so-called ``emergency appropriations \naccount.'' Certainly there are emergencies. We have a policy that where \nthere are emergencies defined as being ``unexpected events,'' \nparticularly of a scale that is beyond the capacity of a local \ncommunity to appropriately respond without Federal assistance, that for \nthose true emergencies we do not require that there be an offset in \nspending, or a tax increase to pay for them. The problem is that last \nOctober an appropriate public policy for true emergencies was stretched \nout of recognition by having many other items which had never in the \npast been thought of as emergencies included in that emergency account, \nand suddenly over $21 billion was expended. It was expended in a way, \nMr. President, because it was included in a conference committee report \nthat was not subject to amendment that was no way to excise, to apply a \nscalpel to cut out those inappropriate items.\n  The amendment that we are offering in the form of a sense of a Senate \nwould commit this Senate to first analyst those items in that $21 \nbillion emergency expenditure that is outside the traditional \ndefinition of an emergency, and we would commit ourselves in this \nfiscal year and in the next two fiscal years when expenditures of those \nfunds are provided for pursuant to our action in October to find \noffsets. That is, we would not continue to treat them as emergencies. \nJust because we made a serious error last fall, we are not committed to \ncontinuing to repeat that error this year, next year, and two years \nfrom now.\n  Let me just illustrate with this graph why I think focusing on \nprotecting the surplus is so critical.\n  In 1998, we had a total Social Security surplus of the $99 billion. \nThe first thing that came off the top of that $99 billion was that we \nhad a $27 billion deficit in the non-Social Security account. The first \nuse of the Social Security surplus in 1998 was to pay the deficit, and \nthe rest of the budget. Then in addition to that, in 1998, we \ndesignated $3 billion as emergency outlays, which meant that we didn't \nhave to either find new taxes to pay for them, or cut spending \nsomeplace else to replace these emergency expenditures. They came out \nof the surplus. What started out as a $99 billion surplus ended up as a \n$69 billion surplus. So effectively, $30 billion that should have gone \nto protect the Social Security fund was drained away to pay for deficit \nelsewhere in the Federal Government, and for emergency accounts.\n\n  In 1999, we start with a Social Security surplus of $127 billion. \nAgain, the first call on that was to pay the deficit in the rest of the \nFederal Government, which, fortunately, has significantly shrunk from \n$27 billion year before to $3 billion in the year 1999. But what \nballooned was the emergency account. This is where that October raid on \nthe surplus showed up in our 1999 account with a $13 billion hit \nagainst the Social Security surplus.\n  Last year we lost $16 billion that should have gone to protect the \nsolvency of the Social Security fund and was used to fund other Federal \ndeficits, emergencies, a significant proportion of which were \nemergencies in name only.\n  We have already started to ``cook the cake'' for the year 2000 where \nwe are projecting a non-Social Security deficit of $5 billion.\n  I was pleased with some of the remarks that our Presiding Officer \nmade earlier this evening in which he indicated that maybe when the \nnext estimate of our national fiscal position based on the strength of \nthe economy is made we will in fact not face this $5 billion deficit in \nfiscal year 2000. I hope his prophesy comes to be.\n  But we also have already added $5 billion by the emergency, so-called \nemergency, expenditures of October of 1998, to the year 2000 fiscal \nyear. So, with a $138 billion Social Security surplus, we are going to \nbe reducing it by $10 billion to pay off deficits elsewhere and these \nemergency accounts.\n  So the amendment we are offering states that we commit ourselves that \nwe will first closely scrutinize those items which were listed as an \nemergency in October of 1998, and for those that do not meet the test \nof being a true emergency, that we will commit ourselves to find \nappropriate offsets to pay for those emergencies and not use them as a \nfurther raid against the Social Security system and against the surplus \nwhich is to provide for its solvency.\n  Mr. President, I anticipate that not only on this legislation but on \nother legislation which will be presented by the budget and the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, we will be considering some fundamental \nchanges in the way in which we deal with emergency appropriations so we \nwill not ever repeat the larceny against the Social Security trust fund \nand against the surpluses which support it that occurred late at night \nin October of 1998.\n  I urge my colleagues to take the first step towards overcoming the \nindignity that we committed to the Social Security system last October \nby committing ourselves to restore to the Social Security surplus those \nexpenditures which were inappropriately listed as emergencies.\n  I urge the adoption of this amendment when it comes before the Senate \ntomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                    Amendments. Nos. 166 Through 175\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I send the following amendments to the \ndesk. I ask that they all be considered as offered and laid aside and \nthat related statements be printed in the Record at the appropriate \nplace.\n  The amendments are as follows: One from Senator Lautenberg, one from \nSenator Schumer, two from Senator Feinstein, one from Senator Harry \nReid of Nevada, two from Senator Murray, one from Senator Hollings, and \ntwo from Senator Boxer.\n  I ask, as I earlier said, they be considered as offered and laid \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator's request for \nconsideration of the amendments which were just read is agreed to. The \namendments will then be laid aside.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 166\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate on saving Social Security \n  and Medicare, reducing the public debt, and targeting tax relief to \n                    middle-income working families.)\n\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON SAVING SOCIAL SECURITY AND \n                   MEDICARE, REDUCING THE PUBLIC DEBT, AND \n                   TARGETING TAX RELIEF TO MIDDLE-INCOME WORKING \n                   FAMILIES.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the provisions of this \n     resolution assume that--\n       (1) Congress should adopt a budget that--\n       (A) reserves the entire off-budget surplus for Social \n     Security each year; and\n       (B) over 15 years, like the President's budget, reserves--\n       (i) 77 percent, or $3,600,000,000 of the total surplus for \n     Social Security and Medicare;\n       (ii) 23 percent, or $1,000,000,000 of the surplus for--\n\n       (I) investments in key domestic priorities such as \n     education, the environment, and law enforcement;\n       (II) investments in military readiness; and\n       (III) pro-savings tax cuts for working families;\n\n       (2) any tax cuts or spending increases should not be \n     enacted before the solvency of Social Security is assured and \n     Medicare solvency is extended twelve years;\n       (3) the 77 percent or $3,600,0000,000 of the total surplus \n     for Social Security and Medicare should be used to reduce the \n     publicly held debt; and\n       (4) any tax cuts should be targeted to provide tax relief \n     to middle-income working families and should not provide \n     disproportionate tax relief to people with the highest \n     incomes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, earlier we considered an amendment \nthat asked the Senate to endorse every line in the President's budget.\n  This amendment asks the Senate to endorse only the general principles \nof that budget and its proposals for using projected budget surpluses.\n  The President's budget calls for no net increase in spending and no \nnet tax cut until we have acted to reform Social Security. It is vital \nthat we make Social Security our top priority so that the program will \nstill be strong when our children and grandchildren are ready to \nretire.\n  The amendment I have now proposed would address what many describe as \nthe President's other budget, his framework for using projected budget \nsurpluses once we have taken care of Social Security.\n  This amendment lays out the President's overall principles, which are \ndesigned to prepare our Nation for the next century.\n  The amendment says that Congress should reserve the entire off-budget \nsurplus for Social Security and, over 15\n\n[[Page S3306]]\n\nyears, allocate: 77 percent or $3.6 trillion of the total surplus for \nSocial Security and Medicare; and 23 percent of the surplus, or $1 \ntrillion, for investments in key domestic priorities, such as \neducation, the environment, and law enforcement; investments in \nmilitary readiness, and pro-savings tax cuts for working families.\n  The amendment also says that tax cuts or spending increases should \nnot be enacted before the solvency of Social Security is assured and \nMedicare solvency is extended 12 years.\n  In addition, the amendment states that the 77 percent or $3.6 \ntrillion of the total surplus for Social Security and Medicare should \nbe used to reduce publicly held debt. That would provide great \ndividends for our economy. Reducing the future debt burden and future \ninterest costs would essentially provide a tax cut for our children.\n  And, finally, the amendment says that any tax cuts should be targeted \nto provide tax relief to middle-income working families and should not \nprovide disproportionate tax relief to people with the highest incomes.\n  Mr. President, this framework emphasizes saving for the future. It's \nfiscally responsible. It would help protect Social Security and \nMedicare. And it calls for tax relief and investments where they are \nmost needed.\n  The amendment does not endorse every dot and comma of the President's \nbudget. But it would endorse the overall priorities of that proposal.\n  I hope my colleagues will support it.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 167\n\n   (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate tha the COPS Program \n                        should be reauthorized)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON REAUTHORIZING THE COPS \n                   PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) as of December 1998, the Community Oriented Policing \n     Services (COPS) Program had awarded grants for the hiring or \n     redeployment to the nation's streets of more than 92,000 \n     police officers and sheriff's deputies;\n       (2) according to the United States Bureau of Justice \n     Statistics, the Nation's violent crime rate declined almost 7 \n     percent during 1997 and has fallen more than 21 percent since \n     1993; and\n       (3) enhanced community policing has significantly \n     contributed to this decline in the violent crime rate.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that the Community \n     Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Program should be \n     reauthorized in order to provide continued Federal funding \n     for the hiring, deployment, and retention of community law \n     enforcement officers.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 168\n\n     (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding school \n    construction grants, and reducing school sizes and class sizes)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING SOCIAL SECURITY \n                   NOTCH BABIES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the Social Security Amendments of 1977 (Public Law 95-\n     216) substantially altered the way social security benefits \n     are computed;\n       (2) those amendments resulted in disparate benefits \n     depending upon the year in which a worker becomes eligible \n     for benefits; and\n       (3) those individuals born between the years 1917 and 1926, \n     and who are commonly referred to as ``notch babies'' receive \n     benefits that are lower than those retirees who were born \n     before or after those years.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution and legislation enacted \n     pursuant to this resolution assume that the Congress should \n     allow workers who attain age 65 after 1981 and before 1992 to \n     choose either lump sum payments over 4 years totaling $5,000 \n     or an improved benefit computation formula under a new 10-\n     year rule governing the transition to the changes in benefit \n     computation rules enacted in the Social Security Amendments \n     of 1977.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Social Security notch causes 11 million \nAmericans born between the years 1917-1926 to receive less in Social \nSecurity benefits than Americans born outside the notch years.\n  The notch inequity is a direct result of changes made by Congress in \n1977 to the Social Security benefits formula.\n  It is important that we restore the confidence of the notch victims \nand show them that we in Congress will accept responsibility for any \nerror that was made.\n  While we must save Social Security for the future, we have an \nobligation to those who receive less than individuals who were \nfortunate enough to have been born just days before or after the notch \nperiod.\n  Many notch babies, through no fault of their own, receive more than \n$200 less per month than their neighbors.\n  It is time for us to right this wrong. I recently introduced \nlegislation--the Notch Fairness Act of 1999--that proposes using any \nprojected budget surplus to pay a lump sum benefit to notch babies.\n  While we have a surplus, let's fix the notch problem once and for all \nand restore the confidence of the millions of notch babies across this \nland.\n  Government has an obligation to be fair. I don't think we have been \nin the case of the notch babies.\n  Please join my efforts to correct the inequity created by the Social \nSecurity notch.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 171\n\n  (Purpose: To ensure that the President's after school initiative if \n                   fully funded for fiscal year 2000)\n\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON FUNDING FOR AFTER SCHOOL \n                   EDUCATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The demand for after school education is very high. In \n     fiscal year 1998 the Department of Education's after school \n     grant program was the most competitive in the Department's \n     history. Nearly 2,000 school districts applied for over \n     $540,000,000.\n       (2) After school programs help to fight juvenile crime. Law \n     enforcement statistics show that youth who are ages 12 \n     through 17 are most at risk of committing violent acts and \n     being victims of violent acts between 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. \n     After school programs have been shown to reduce juvenile \n     crime, sometimes by up to 75 percent according to the \n     National Association of Police Athletic and Activity Leagues.\n       (3) After school programs can improve educational \n     achievement. They ensure children have safe and positive \n     learning environments in the after school hours. In the \n     Sacramento START after school program 75 percent of the \n     students showed an increase in their grades.\n       (4) After school programs have widespread support.
