Mr. President, today the Senate will immediately proceed to \na period of morning business until 10 a.m. I see Senator Grams is here \nfor some remarks after my opening statement.\n  Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights Plus, and a number of amendments will be \noffered, I am sure, throughout the day. Debate will resume on the \npending Dodd amendment regarding coverage of clinical trials.\n  As we go forward today, I remind Senators that we will continue to \nhave what I am sure everybody will agree has been a good debate. I \nassume there will be several amendments offered today, and so there \nwill be votes, I hope, even this morning or early afternoon and then \nthroughout the rest of the afternoon. By previous consent, the Senate \nwill complete action, I remind Senators, on the pending bill during \ntomorrow's session of the Senate. We may go into the evening, but it \nwill be a normal evening. We have tried to make sure we had full time \nallocated for this debate and amendments. We agreed in the beginning \nthat we would at least have normal days or more.\n  Actually, so far, on Monday we spent 6 hours 17 minutes on this bill. \nThe average Mondays are 4 hours 46 minutes. On Tuesday we spent 7 hours \n5 minutes. The average Tuesdays are 7 hours and 30 minutes. The average \nWednesdays are usually around 9 hours 39 minutes. So we are going to \nstay right on track. I encourage my colleagues to make their best case, \noffer their amendments, make their speeches, but at the end of this \nweek I hope we will come to a conclusion that will produce a bill which \nwill address the important areas of patients' rights, consumer rights, \nprotections they need, the right to access of documents, the rights \nthat they should have to care, including emergency instances, but there \nhas to be a prudent standard; there has to be some common sense applied \nto all of this.\n  I would also say at this point how proud I have been of the only \ndoctor we have in the Senate. I think we are really blessed and \nprivileged to have Dr. Bill Frist here. Not only is he an outstanding \nhuman being but, unlike a lot of us, he knows what he is talking about. \nHaving been a highly acclaimed heart surgeon, having a family that has \nbeen involved in hospital care, he has an extent of knowledge when it \ncomes to clinical tests or how patients are treated, what procedures \nare necessary, most of us just do not have. So it has been a real \npleasure to watch him at work over the past few days.\n  The Senate may consider any available appropriations bills when we \ncomplete the Patients' Bill of Rights. I remind Senators we are \nscheduled to have a vote on the Abraham-Domenici Social Security \nlockbox on Friday. There have been indications that the President \nsupports a lockbox concept. I asked him in our meeting on Monday: Mr. \nPresident, what is your plan? Do you support the House version, which \nis a real lockbox? The Senate version is really tight because it bases \nthe lockbox on the declining debt that would result from locking the \nSocial Security funds up and not allowing them to be spent for anything \nbut Social Security. Or the House version, which is a more procedural \neffort to keep these funds from being spent, requiring a supermajority \nvote, for instance, in the Senate of 60 votes in order to spend that \nmoney for anything but Social Security, which I think it should not be. \nOr is there some compromise version?\n\n  Senator Daschle and I have communicated on that a couple times over \nthe past 2 days. We hope that maybe we can come to some agreement and \nget this Social Security lockbox done, set those moneys aside so that \nwe can move on and deal with other issues such as Medicare reform and \nreturning\n\n[[Page S8424]]\n\nsome of the tax overpayment to working American families.\n  So after the Patients' Bill of Rights, we do have the vote scheduled \non Friday on the lockbox for Social Security, and then we are looking \nat other appropriations bills that we could go to Friday or early next \nweek or the intelligence authorization bill. We will confer with \nleadership on both sides before that announcement is made.\n  With that, I thank my colleagues, and I yield the floor so that \nSenator Grams can make his statement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/14/senate-section/article/S8424-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk a little bit about the \nhealth care bill we are debating in this Chamber.\n  Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have day after day \nasserted that their Patients' Bill of Rights legislation is better than \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights Plus legislation, of which I am a proud \ncosponsor.\n  If we are to believe that raising the cost of every insured \nindividual's premiums by 6.1 percent and increasing the number of \nuninsured by roughly 1.8 million people is what is good for America, \nthen, yes, this could be called a better bill. I, however, don't think \nthose statistics suggest it's a better bill. Most Americans who know \nthat this legislation increases costs and increases the number of \nuninsured do not think it is a better bill at all.\n  I firmly believe that the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus, S. 300, is a \nmuch more productive solution to problems facing Americans in the \nhealth care market today.\n  Mr. President, eight to ten percent of Minnesotans are uninsured \ntoday. Now, we in Minnesota enjoy a lower uninsured rate than the \nnational average and we have historically had one of the lowest \nuninsured populations in the country.\n  However, if S. 6 is adopted into law, I could expect to see about \n36,000 more Minnesotans become uninsured. Nationally, about 15 percent \nof our population today is without insurance. They may be uninsured for \na number of reasons, but I bet the biggest obstacle for most people is \naccess, and access is determined by costs. They simply cannot afford \nthe costs of insurance.\n  These uninsured Americans would be left even further behind if we \nadopt the Kennedy-Daschle health care bill. Our colleagues make no \neffort whatsoever to address the problems of the uninsured. I do not \nthink this is good policy, I do not think it is good for the Nation, \nand it certainly is not good for those already uninsured or those who \nwill be forced to drop health care insurance because of increased \ncosts.\n  Thankfully, we have an alternative, and it is called the Health Care \nAccess and Equity Act of 1999, or S. 1274. I was pleased to introduce \nthis legislation along with my colleagues Chairman Roth and also \nSenator Abraham of Michigan. When we introduced this bill on June 24, \nwe did so with the support of 15 of our colleagues.\n  The Health Care Access and Equity Act does several things to increase \naccess to health insurance, but one of the most important components is \nthe full deductibility of health insurance costs for those without \naccess to health insurance coverage through their employer. The Health \nCare Access and Equity Act of 1999 presents us with the opportunity to \ncreate the most comprehensive tax deductible coverage system in our \nNation's history. It achieves this by eliminating one of the most \ndiscriminatory portions of the Tax Code: the disparate treatment \nbetween an employer purchasing a health plan as opposed to an \nindividual purchasing health insurance on their own.\n  When employers purchase a health care plan for their employees, he or \nshe can fully deduct the cost of providing that insurance, effectively \nlowering the actual cost of providing that coverage. However, when an \nemployee purchases an individual policy on their own, they must do so \nwith after-tax dollars and cannot fully deduct the cost of that plan. \nThey do not have the ability or the advantage offered to employers to \nreduce the actual costs of their policy by deducting the premiums from \ntheir taxes every year. Therefore, health insurance is too costly and, \nfor many, they usually wind up without health coverage. The Health Care \nAccess and Equity Act will end this discrimination within the Tax Code \nand make health care available for many more Americans.\n  Let's make the same tax incentives for purchasing health insurance \nnow available to employers apply to everybody. Let's level the playing \nfield, and we will have taken the next logical step in the evolution of \nour health care system.\n  I believe Congress should be doing what it can to lower the cost of \nhealth insurance, making it more affordable--not by proposing \nlegislation that will raise the costs and will make health insurance \nmore and more difficult to afford.\n  I have a chart with me that shows the impact my legislation would \nhave for my constituents. As you can see, it would reduce health \ninsurance costs by anywhere from $796 to $1,384 for a family of four \nliving in Mankato, MN, and also $887 to about $1,542 for a family of \nfour living in St. Paul, or the Twin Cities. This is because they could \ndeduct their premiums on their taxes, and this is what they would save \noff their tax bills which they could use then to pay for health \ninsurance policies, thus making health care more affordable.\n\n  These are very significant costs which could make health insurance \ncoverage available for many more people in my State, as well as across \nthe country, who are currently in the individual health insurance \nmarket, and that is more than my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle can say about their bill.\n  It seems most proposals before the Senate are just out there forcing \nsome Federal definition of quality health plans onto the consumers and \nthen sticks them with the bill, the increased cost for those mandates. \nIt is not good policy, it does nothing for those who are uninsured, and \nit will not help those who will be forced to drop their health \ninsurance because they can no longer afford the increase in those \nhealth care premiums.\n  Even without the increased costs associated with the so-called \nPatients' Bill of Rights legislation, employers are already \nanticipating premium increases of between 7 to 10 percent over and \nabove the costs that would be forced to go up under the plan by Senator \nKennedy. Add on to that the costs of the Patients' Bill of Rights and \nyou get higher numbers across the board, you get higher premiums, \nhigher uninsured and higher frustration because any raise in pay that a \nmiddle-class worker might expect will now go toward even higher health \ncare premium costs.\n  It is estimated that benefit mandates comprise over 20 percent of the \nprice of health plan premiums already in the\n\n[[Page S8425]]\n\nState of Minnesota, and if you add on top of that the 5- to 6-percent \ntax on health plans and we are getting close to one-third of that \npremium being attributed to taxes or mandates.\n  You might say: Employers can cover the premium increases. Some may, \nbut some may not. Regardless, the money employers use to cover higher \nhealth insurance premiums could be used to increase the employee's \nsalary. By increasing the employers' costs, Congress will force \nemployees to forego a pay increase. My colleagues across the aisle may \nbelieve this is a good direction for the country to go in, but I do \nnot, and I know that most Minnesotans do not agree.\n  If all this were not bad enough, 57 percent of small businesses say \nthey will stop providing health insurance for their employees if they \nare exposed to the Kennedy-Daschle bill's liability provisions. This is \nnot just a threat. Most small businesses are not able to absorb higher \noperating expenses without cutting back or eliminating some costs, and \nthat could mean as well some jobs that would be lost.\n  Let's talk about the liability issue a little bit.\n  Under Senator Kennedy's legislation, employees will be able to sue \ntheir employers for something the employer is not obligated to provide. \nThat sounds a little strange to me, so I have to say it again. People \nwill be able to sue their employer if they are unhappy with something \ntheir employer is not in any way obligated to provide.\n  Proponents of increasing costs through liability will say: We have \ncarved out employers from the liability provisions so only insurers, \nHMOs, and third-party plan administrators would be liable. This may be \ntrue in theory, but what they will not tell you is that there is \nalready no way to separate the two under recent guidance from the \nDepartment of Labor. The guidance clarifies that employers have a \nfiduciary obligation to monitor plan quality. This responsibility \nrenders so-called carve-outs ineffective because there is no way \nemployers can completely absolve themselves of benefit decisions under \ntheir health plan which is required under the Democrats' illusionary \ncarve-outs.\n\n  As I have mentioned before, the Kennedy-Daschle approach will \nincrease costs, and even if employers could meet the guidelines for \nthat liability exemption, the costs are still passed on to the \nemployers and, of course, those costs are then passed on to their \nemployees. Essentially, the Kennedy-Daschle liability provision does \nnot guarantee quality health care. What it does guarantee is increased \nhealth premium costs for every American.\n  What fork in the road is this country taking when a notion such as \nthis is given any serious discussion? Isn't it apparent to supporters \nof the Kennedy bill that if companies are exposed to this type of \nliability they would just drop insurance coverage for their employees?\n  I have never believed we need more litigation in this country, and \nthis is certainly not an exception. We all want patients to have \nprotection as much as anyone else. Yet how do we ensure patients are \nreceiving the health care they need in a timely fashion?\n  I believe a strong, independent, quick, and easily accessible appeals \nprocess for those who have been denied health care services they and \ntheir physicians believe is necessary is what is needed and appropriate \nmeans to resolve coverage disputes. Again, as an original cosponsor of \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights Plus legislation, I support an idea for \nthis strong, independent, external appeals process to ensure people \nreceive the health care they need and to make sure they get it when \nthey need it.\n  Perhaps the best part of the appeals process is the fact that the \nexternal appeal is binding on the health plan but not binding on the \nperson who is appealing. What does that exactly mean?\n  It means if you were denied care you and your physician believe is \nnecessary, go through the appeals process and the appeals board agrees \nwith you, the health plan then is legally bound to pay for that care. \nHowever, if you are unsatisfied with the outcome of the appeals \nprocess, you can then sue the health plan under current law, which \nallows the collection of attorney's fees, the cost benefit, court \ncosts, injunctive relief, and other equitable relief.\n  No one can sue their way to good health, but we can give them the \ntools they need to get the care they need when they need it, and the \nPatients' Bill of Rights Plus gives consumers those tools.\n  The Kennedy-Daschle bill also includes a provision which, on the \nsurface, also sounds very reasonable. It allows physicians and patients \nto determine what is medically necessary. Who could be against that? \nBut what they do not tell you is creating such a standard could, under \nsome circumstances, work against the patient's best interest. I will \ngive an example of how this could happen.\n  Under Senator Kennedy's bill, health plans would be required to cover \nthe costs of whatever setting or duration of care a physician decides \nis ``medically necessary.'' The bill goes on to define medical \nnecessity as whatever is consistent with generally accepted principles \nof professional medical practice.\n\n  This effectively prohibits health plans from intervening in \nsituations when it is clearly in the patient's best interest. For \ninstance, the Centers for Disease Control figures indicate that \napproximately 349,000 unnecessary caesarean sections were performed in \n1991. While decisions regarding these individual procedures were based \non generally accepted principles, a large number of women were \nneedlessly subjected to major surgery and risk of infection.\n  Another shortcoming of the generally accepted principles of medical \npractice is the variance in treatments from region to region. Let's \ntake a look at what the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care 1998 says about \ntreatments for breast cancer;\n\n       Once diagnosed, surgery is universally recommended for the \n     treatment of breast cancer. There are two principle surgical \n     approaches: breast sparing surgery (lumpectomy, which is \n     followed by radiation therapy) and mastectomy (complete \n     removal of the breast). Randomized clinical trials have shown \n     that these two approaches have nearly identical rates of \n     cancer cure. . . . Despite scientific evidence that the \n     survival rate is the same for breast sparing surgery and for \n     mastectomy, and in spite of wide consensus that patient \n     preferences should determine which treatment is chosen, the \n     wide variations in surgical rates suggest that physician, \n     rather than patient, preferences are the deciding factor on \n     most cases.\n\n  That's what the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care 1998 has to say about \nthe choice between lumpectomies and mastectomies. Let me tell you about \na related incident which actually happened in my state of Minnesota.\n  Several years ago, one of the major health plans in Minnesota \nreceived a telephone call from a Minnesota physician seeking \nauthorization to perform an outpatient mastectomy on a woman suffering \nfrom breast cancer. This physician wanted to admit a woman to a same-\nday surgical center, remove her breast and then send her home later \nthat day.\n  The health plan's medical director had never heard of an outpatient \nmastectomy being done before. In answer to questioning by the health \nplan, the physician admitted he had done the procedure only one time \nbefore. When asked why he wanted to do this procedure on an outpatient \nbasis, he told the plan it was at the request of the patient. The \nplan's representative told the physician to wait and make no plans to \ndo the procedure outpatient.\n  The health plan then went to the patient and asked why she would want \nto procedure done as an outpatient. She told the plan's representative \nthat the physician told her the plan was ordering him to do the \nprocedure on an outpatient basis. ``You know how insurance companies \nare,'' she said he told her.\n  When the plan told her they hadn't ordered the physician to do the \nprocedure outpatient, she began to cry. She did not want the procedure \ndone outpatient.\n  The health plan called the physician back and told him that due to \nthe lack of medical necessity, they were denying his request for \nauthorization to do the mastectomy on an outpatient basis. The patient \nhad the mastectomy as an inpatient, and because of complications, she \nended up staying in the hospital for several days.\n  Mr. President, this women was a single-mother of three who would have \nbeen totally incapable of caring for herself, much less her three \nchildren, if the physician had done the procedure outpatient as he \noriginally requested.\n  This example demonstrates how health plans can and do contribute to\n\n[[Page S8426]]\n\nquality in our health care system. Are there problems in some areas? \nHave mistakes been made? Yes. But, let's think about the consequences \nof what we do here today. Will the Kennedy bill really make health care \nbetter? More quality oriented? I don't think it will.\n  New breakthroughs in pharmaceuticals and medical devices are unveiled \nalmost daily. Many of these breakthroughs come from Minnesota companies \nand research facilities. These breakthroughs represent opportunities \nfor individuals to live longer, healthier, more productive lives. I \nbelieve it would be difficult for physicians, or anyone, to be able to \nkeep up with all the latest technology and treatments by themselves. \nYet, that's what we're forcing them to do if the medical necessity \nprovision included in the Kennedy bill passes as written. Further, if \nplans are required to pay for whatever procedure, treatment, drug or \ndevice providers offer, we could be putting patient's health, and \nperhaps their lives, at stake.\n  To show the inconsistency of President Clinton and Senator Kennedy \ndisplay by insisting the medical necessity provision be part of the \nPatients' Bill of Rights, they directly contradict a report issued in \nFebruary by the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health \nand Human Services. The report found that the majority of all Medicare \nfee-for-service fraud cases is a lack of medical necessity. You may \nrecall Secretary Shalala holding a press conference in response to this \nreport calling on America's seniors to be more vigilant when receiving \nhealth care services to assure that fraud is not being committed.\n  If the administration is urging consumers and health plans to take \naction in order to reduce fraud in the Medicare program, why is it \nproposing to bar health plans from using the very same tools to prevent \nfraud in their programs?\n  While I'm thinking about Medicare and the Patients' Bill of Rights, \nit was President Clinton who insisted, under the threat of a veto, a \nprovision be included in the Balanced Budget Act which denies seniors \none of the most basic patient's rights--the ability to use their own \nmoney to pay for the health care services they believe are necessary. \nOur Democratic colleagues agreed with the President and have stalled \nreconsideration of this egregious violation of a basic right. I am \nhopeful we can get to that patient's right later this year.\n  The problems our health care system faces are not just the result of \nmanaged care. If it were, Minnesota, where 90 percent of health care \nconsumers are in managed care organizations, would not have the longest \nlife expectancy in the United States. The Twin Cities of Minneapolis \nand St. Paul would not have the lowest health care costs of the top 20 \nmetropolitan areas in the United States, and we wouldn't have an \nuninsured rate half the national average. Minnesota has found a way to \nlive and thrive with managed care. It's not without problem, but for \nthe vast majority of Minnesotans, it works well. With all due respect \nto my colleague from Massachusetts, Minnesotans don't want his \ndefinition of a quality health plan and we don't want him to tell us \nwhat protections we need or don't need.\n  During my first term in Congress, President Clinton introduced the \nHealth Security Act, which is now commonly referred to as ``Clinton \nCare.'' I was opposed to the President's legislation because it was \nnothing short of a government take-over of the best health care system \nin the world. I remain opposed to this type of legislation because it \nis too prescriptive, too centralized and limits health care choices.\n  Over the past two years, we've seen bill after bill introduced which \npropose, in the name of quality health care, to allow federal \nbureaucrats, Congress and lawyers to practice medicine without a \nlicense. Benefit mandates are thrown around Congress as if there were \nno consequences. I've heard it referred to as legislating by body part.\n  We are told by those on the other side of the aisle, ``we need to \nhave benefit mandates so Americans can receive quality health care,'' \nand ``let's preempt the states because they don't know what they're \ndoing.'' I disagree, and the very individuals who regulate HMOs and \nevery other type of health plan for the respective states--the \ninsurance commissioners--also strongly disagree. In fact, State \ninsurance commissioners have already spoken to Congress on this issue. \nThe National Association of Insurance Commissioners wrote this to \nChairman Jeffords in March of this year.\n\n       It is our belief that states should and will continue the \n     efforts to develop creative, flexible, market-sensitive \n     protections for health consumers in fully insured plans, and \n     Congress should focus attention on those consumers who have \n     no protections in self-funded ERISA plans.\n\n  The letter goes on to explain very precisely their view of pending \nlegislation:\n\n       The states have already adopted statutory and regulatory \n     protections for consumers in fully insured plans and have \n     tailored these protections to fit the needs of their states' \n     consumers and health care marketplaces. In addition, many \n     states are supplementing their existing protections during \n     the current legislative session based upon particular \n     circumstances within their own states. We do not want states \n     to be preempted by Congressional or administrative actions.\n\n  There has been a lot of smoke blown around here about how many \nhealth-based organizations have endorsed this bill or that bill, but \nwhen it comes to regulating health insurance policies, I believe we \nneed to put more stock in the option of those who are currently \nresponsible for regulating health insurance--our state insurance \ncommissioners. They know best what the people in their states need--\nthey know best how to achieve their goals, and Congress should know \nbetter than to question their ability or willingness to meet those \nchallenges.\n  As we get deeper and deeper into the details of the Kennedy-Daschle \nbill, I am reminded of something Minority Leader Daschle said in the \nopening hours of this debate. He claimed that the reason insurance \ncompanies call them HMOs ``is that H-M-O stands for their patient \nphilosophy: Having Minimal Options.'' Mr. President, I suggest that it \nis the Kennedy-Daschle bill that would take away options and our \ncolleagues should be willing to admit it.\n  We have seen our colleagues' true motives when they backed President \nClinton's Health Security Act, when they backed President Clinton \ntaking away a senior's right to use their own earnings to pay for \nmedical services without the government and now we see it with the \nKennedy-Daschle Patients' Bill of Rights. Consumer's options are \nbecoming minimal and we have government to thank for that.\n  To suggest that our bill--the only one expanding options for the \nAmerican people by eliminating restrictions on medical savings \naccounts, allowing the self-employed to fully deduct the cost of \npurchasing health insurance, and permitting the carryover of unused \nfunds in flexible spending accounts--limits Americans choices, ignores \nthe contents of our bill and ignores the reality of the Kennedy-Daschle \nbill.\n  Another issue I would like to talk about is something I have taken \ngreat interest in over the past three years--emergency medical \nservices. This is perhaps one area in our debate which Republicans and \nDemocrats have agreed is important enough to ensure access for \nAmericans in need of immediate care. Every proposal in Congress \ncontains some form of the prudent layperson standard for emergency \nservices. That is with good reason.\n  The Federal Government has some precedence in dealing with access to \nemergency care through a law enacted in the 1980s called EMTALA, or The \nEmergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act. This act requires \nhospitals to treat everyone and anyone who enters their emergency \ndepartment regardless of ability to pay as a precondition to \nparticipation in the Medicare program.\n  All the proposals before Congress with the prudent layperson standard \ninclude some reference to EMTALA. Where I have concern is the lack of \nany mention of ambulance services in any Patients' Bill of Rights \nlegislation. While there has been some mention of ambulance services \nbeing included as part of the ancillary services clause under EMTALA, \nthis simply will not work.\n  I will remind my colleagues that EMTALA only affects what happens \nonce an individual arrives at a hospital's emergency room door. It \ncovers none of the pre-hospital care people receive from courageous EMS \npersonnel\n\n[[Page S8427]]\n\nall over the Nation whose sole function is to get the sickest among us \nto the emergency room quickly, efficiently and safely so emergency \nphysicians can tend to our condition.\n  Contrary to what most people think, EMS personnel do not make \ndiagnoses. They do not make decisions about whether a patient should or \nshould not be transported to an emergency room based on their medical \ncondition. Ambulance personnel respond to calls initiated in any number \nof ways, arrive at the location, assess the patient's condition, \nstabilize them and ready them for transportation to a facility with the \npersonnel trained to make a diagnosis.\n  The reason I wanted to bring this to everyone's attention is because \nI believe many of us have not taken the time to fully understand the \nfunction ambulance services performs in the health care delivery \nsystem. We cannot afford to continue ignoring the important role EMS \nplays in health care.\n  For the past 3 years, I have introduced legislation which would \naddress some of the problems ambulance services faces every day. My \nmost recent iteration is S. 911, the Emergency Medical Services \nEfficiency Act. I invite any and all of my colleagues to join me as a \ncosponsor of this important legislation. I am hopeful we can include \nseveral of its provisions in the Patients' Bill of Rights legislation \nbefore us today.\n  For every 1 percent increase in premiums, there are an additional two \nto four thousand uninsured in Minnesota. Whether it's a family of four \nin Ada, Minnesota or a single mother of two in Zumbrota, I don't want \nto be responsible for any Minnesotan losing their health insurance \ncoverage. I believe if I were to vote for the Kennedy-Daschle bill, I \nwould be doing just that--ensuring that 36,000 Minnesotans will be \nforced to drop their coverage because they can no longer afford it.\n  That is something I, along with 97 of my colleagues in the Senate, \nvoted not to do in a sense-of-the-Senate resolution last year. I urge \nmy colleagues to honor the promise they made in that vote and defeat \nthe government-centered, one-size-fits-all vision of health care \nillustrated by the Kennedy-Daschle Patients' Bill of Rights. Patients \nwill get a bill all right--one taken out of their paychecks every \nmonth.\n  I urge my colleagues to say yes to creating choices, yes to \nprotecting consumers who aren't currently protected, yes to being \nmindful of costs, and yes to increasing the number of insured--they can \ndo all that with one vote for the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/14/senate-section/article/S8427-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8427-S8428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I will discuss several issues that are \ncentral to the debate we are having on managed care in the Patients' \nBill of Rights.\n  First, I was very disappointed that the Senate rejected Senator \nKennedy's amendment which would have extended the protections of the \nPatients' Bill of Rights to all privately insured Americans. Those in \nfavor of much more limited coverage, very much restricted coverage, \nargue that the cost in the Democratic alternative would cause many \nAmericans to lose their health insurance through increased premiums. \nThey argue, as we have heard time and time again, that premiums would \nrise and that employers would drop coverage.\n  When you actually talk to many employers, particularly those in small \nbusinesses who are represented by the American Small Business Alliance, \nfor example, they tell quite a different story. They talk about a \nsituation in which they have already seen premiums rise, but they get \nvery little for what they pay for.\n  For example, Mr. Brian McCarthy, President of McCarthy Flowers and \nCabs, from Scranton, PA, had this to say. His words:\n\n       Workers who spend time out sick or are consumed in battles \n     with their health plan wreak havoc on the bottom line. That \n     lost productivity costs my business a lot more than the \n     modest premium increases that may result from this \n     legislation.\n\n  He went on to add:\n\n       The Patients' Bill of Rights is about giving people the \n     care they need and deserve, and it clearly gives small \n     businesses a better deal for their health care dollar.\n\n  That is not the voice of a Senator, but of a small businessperson who \nhas seen the effects of managed care on his own bottom line.\n  Another small business owner, Mr. Tom Reed, who owns Lake Motors in \nEagle Lake, TX, said:\n\n       My premiums go up now and I get nothing, or sometimes even \n     less coverage. The Patients' Bill of Rights at least will \n     give me something tangible, bringing me better value for the \n     health care money I spend.\n\n  Those are the words of businesspeople who are struggling with the \nissues. They are in favor of this legislation because they want to get \nwhat they have been paying a lot for, and that is quality health care. \nThey will only get that with the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  There have been studies that have supported these anecdotal comments. \nThe Kaiser-Harvard Program on Health Policy surveyed small business \nexecutives from the small business sector, and they found that 88 \npercent support independent appeals such as those that are in the \nDemocratic alternative; 75 percent support the right to see a \nspecialist without prior approval; 61 percent favor giving people the \nright to sue their health plan; and fewer than 1 percent suggested that \nthey might drop coverage if rates increased.\n  These are small business executives. This is compelling and \npersuasive evidence that, in order to be responsive to the needs of \nsmall businesses throughout the country, it is imperative that we pass \nthe Democratic alternative.\n  There is another aspect of this legislation which deserves \ndiscussion, and that is the fact that health care plans, HMOs, are \nimmune from liability because of what is apparently a loophole in the \nERISA law.\n  A physician can be sued for malpractice, a physician can be sued for \nmaking misjudgments, but an insurance company, often working through \nnonphysicians, administrators, and reviewers, are immune from such \nsuits.\n  This aspect of accountability is critical to making sure that we have \nrights that are enforceable and that actually produce tangible results \nthroughout the country.\n\n  In another survey, the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 73 percent \nof those surveyed believe that patients should be able to hold their \nmanaged care plans accountable through the courts.\n  This is not to suggest that anyone is encouraging a mass exodus to \nthe courthouse. In fact, there is quite a bit of experience that \nsuggests this probably will not happen.\n  In Texas, in May of 1997, bipartisan legislation was passed making it \nthe first State where managed care organizations can be sued for \nmedical malpractice. Like the Democratic plan, the Texas liability law \nis closely tied to tough, independent external review processes. In \nfact, you cannot take advantage of the right to sue until you have been \nthrough this independent review process.\n  Despite all the warnings about a flurry of lawsuits--the same thing \nwe are hearing today--this has not been the experience in Texas. \nNeither has the State experienced increased premiums. What has happened \nis that both sides now are claiming success. HMOs are saying: Look, \nthis is working. And consumers are saying: This is helping us out. In \nfact, according to Texas State Senator David Sibley----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Mr. REED. I ask unanimous consent for an additional minute\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Chair.\n  According to one of the sponsors, Texas State Senator David Sibley, \nwho is Republican, in his words, stated:\n\n       [T]he Texas experience has been very positive. . . . Both \n     sides are claiming victory: the HMOs are saying ``see how \n     well it works; people aren't filing many reviews.'' The \n     consumer groups are saying that HMOs are being more \n     responsive and are looking more carefully at the needs of \n     patients before they deny claims.\n\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REED. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator aware that George W. Bush, Governor of the \nState\n\n[[Page S8428]]\n\nof Texas, vetoed the initial HMO bill in the State of Texas?\n  Mr. REED. I was not aware of that. But I think experience is showing \nthat it would have been an error because the law is working very well. \nWe have a rare historic opportunity to do something to help the \nAmerican people. It has been done already by the great State of Texas \nin many respects, but we can do much more, and we shall do much better. \nI would like to see the same type of protections that are available to \nthe good people of Texas afforded to everyone in this great country.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWisconsin, Mr. Feingold, is recognized to speak up to 10 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/14/senate-section/article/S8428-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8428-S8429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE IMPORTANCE OF PATIENT PROTECTIONS\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \nimportance of passing a meaningful Patients' Bill of Rights package \nthat will ensure that managed care companies cannot put their cost-\ncontrol measures ahead of the well-being of their patients. This \nlegislation is absolutely vital to protecting the quality of health \ncare for all Americans.\n  Many of my colleagues have spoken on various aspects of this issue \nover the past few weeks. But I would like to bring my colleagues' \nstatements ``home'' by speaking a bit about what we mean when we talk \nabout ``Protecting Patients' Rights.'' We are talking about the grim \nreality that the American health care system is no longer controlled by \nthose who best understand how to treat patients--our physicians.\n  Instead, managed care companies, primarily HMOs but also other health \ninsurance providers, have become so involved in the business of health \ncare that they control nearly every aspect of health care including \nwhere the health care is provided, and by whom. Of greatest concerns to \nme the most is that these managed care organizations can decide whether \nthat health care can be provided at all--they make the key medical \ndecisions. In other words,, regardless of whether that care is \ndetermined to be medically necessary by the physician who is treating \nyou, managed care administrators can override your doctor's medical \ndecisions and refuse to cover the care that you need.\n  How does this happen? Well, managed care companies control costs by \nlimiting supply--screening which health care providers its enrollees \nare permitted to see, requiring patients to go through insurance \ncompany gatekeepers prior to seeing a specialist, tracking physician \npractice patterns to ensure that doctors are complying with HMOs' cost-\ncontrol efforts. Some HMOs go so far as to impose a gag-rule on \ndoctors, prohibiting physicians in their system from discussing \ntreatment options that the HMO administrators deem too expensive.\n  Managed care companies control how--or even whether--we receive \nhealth care. Their control over what goes on in the examination room \ncan be matched only by their significant political clout in Washington, \nwhich they've gained in part through generous political donations. Mr. \nPresident, during earlier remarks I gave on the Patients' Bill of \nRights, I talked about the power special interests wield in the health \ncare debate, but I want to remind my colleagues and the public of those \nremarks, because I think it's vital that we keep the power of these \nwealthy interests in mind throughout this discussion.\n  During the last election cycle, managed care companies and their \naffiliated groups spent more than $3.4 million on soft money \ncontributions, PAC, and individual contributions--roughly double what \nthey spent during the last mid-term elections.\n  Managed care giant United HealthCare Corporation gave $305,000 in \nsoft money to the parties, and $65,500 in PAC money to candidates;\n\n  Blue Cross/Blue Shield's national association gave more than $200,000 \nin soft money and nearly $350,000 in PAC money;\n  And the managed care industry's chief lobby, the American Association \nof Health Plans, has given nearly $60,000 in soft money in the last two \nyears.\n  Mr. President, these numbers are just the tip of the iceberg, but I \nmention them today to present a clearer picture of the power the \nmanaged care industry wields in Washington as we debate managed care \nreform. As we talk here on the floor about why Americans have such an \nimportant stake in this body passing the Patients' Bill of Rights, we \nshould also be aware of what a huge stake the industry has in stopping \nthis legislation, and how they have used the campaign finance system to \nprotect their interests.\n  Regardless of how you feel about any particular Patients' Bill of \nRights proposal, I think any reasonable person would agree that an \narrangement where someone has financial incentives to deny health care \nto my family and me--that the very existence of such incentives has to \nraise flags. As a parent, and as a consumer, I want to be sure that \nmanaged care cost-control systems don't compromise the quality of \nhealth care for my family and me.\n  So I want to make it clear that the central goal of protecting \npatients' rights is to ensure that medical necessity is what drives our \nhealth care. That's what we're talking about. We need to be sure that \nthe people making health care decisions are licensed health care \nprofessionals, not administrative personnel whose primary mission is to \nprotect their bottom line. I do not think that is an outrageous, pie-\nin-the-sky goal. I think it's a common sense expectation when I buy \nhealth insurance for my family, and I don't think any of my colleagues \nwould demand any less from their own health insurance.\n  During the year or so since Senators Daschle and Kennedy first \nintroduced the Patients' Bill of Rights, I have had the opportunity to \nvisit every county in my state to speak with my constituents and to \nfind out what issues they care about. I can tell you that health care--\nthe quality of health care, the availability of health care--is \nconsistently one of the top issues that my constituents raise with me. \nIn general, the quality of health care in Wisconsin is quite good. \nWisconsin was one of the first states to regulate HMOs as insurance \nproviders, and the state has developed a set of basic, common sense \npatient protections--many of which are included in S. 6, the Democratic \nPatients' Bill of Rights.\n  Mr. President, I would like to share a story that was told to me by a \npediatrician who practices in Madison, Wisconsin. This pediatrician \ntold me about a newborn infant she saw who looked fine upon first \nexamination, but on the second day, the pediatrician detected a heart \nmurmur. Knowing that this newborn urgently needed to see a specialist, \nthe pediatrician immediately called for a referral to a pediatric \ncardiologist, which in this particular HMO requires first going through \nan adult cardiologist for the referral to a pediatric specialist. By \nsheer luck, a pediatric cardiologist happened to be in the hospital on \na separate matter and was able to examine the baby.\n\n  The pediatric cardiologist ordered an echocardiogram and diagnosed \ncoarctation, a tightening or narrowing of the aorta that is specific to \nnewborns. That pediatric cardiologist happened to be in the right place \nat the right time--but under usual circumstances, time would have been \nlost while a referral was sought from an adult cardiologist. As a \nresult, that baby immediately began receiving medication--\nprostaglandin--intravenously until she could be transported to \nChildren's Hospital in Milwaukee to receive emergency heart surgery. \nThe baby survived and is doing well.\n  When I heard this story, apart from relief that the baby survived, my \nfirst question was, ``What would have happened if you and the baby's \nparents had to go through the normal processes of the HMO's rules?'' \nThe pediatrician told me that that process, even if expedited, would \nhave taken at least 24 hours, which didn't sound very long until the \npediatrician informed me that the untreated coarctation would have \nresulted in the baby's death within a few hours.\n  I am greatly relieved and happy that this particular baby was cared \nfor and survived. But what I find frightening, though, is that this \nbaby survived almost as a fluke, in spite of the system. The Patients' \nBill of Rights includes a guarantee of access to pediatric specialists. \nFortunately for the family of\n\n[[Page S8429]]\n\nthe baby with the heart murmur, many pieces fell into place to save the \nbaby, including a dedicated and vigilant pediatrician willing to be an \nadvocate for her patient and a pediatric specialist in the right place \nat the right time. This situation didn't turn into a horror story. But \nwe simply cannot let these sorts of happy endings happen only by \nchance. We must enact meaningful patient protections, such as \nguaranteed access to pediatric specialists as contained in the \nDemocratic Patients' Bill of Rights but lacking in the Republican bill, \nto ensure that people get the care that they need.\n  The patient protections we are talking about ought to be part of the \ndeal when you enroll in health insurance. These are pretty basic \nconcerns, Mr. President, concerns that I think may get obscured \nsometimes when we get into jargon like ``prudent layperson,'' ``point \nof service,'' and so on. So when we speak about protecting patients' \nrights, I want to be clear that we are talking about how to make sure \nthat corporate cost-control concerns don't result in people being \ndenied the care that they need.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/14/senate-section/article/S8429-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senate will now resume consideration of S. \n1344, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1344) to amend the Public Health Service Act, \n     the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, and the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to protect consumers in managed \n     care plans and other health coverage.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Daschle amendment No. 1232, in the nature of a substitute.\n       Dodd amendment No. 1239 (to amendment No. 1232), to provide \n     coverage for individuals participating in approved clinical \n     trials and for approved drugs and medical devices.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time on the pending amendment?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from California 7 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair, and I thank the Democratic whip for \nyielding me this time.\n  Mr. President, I rise in favor of the Dodd amendment, which deals \nwith access to clinical trials and access to prescription drugs. I \nthink this is a very important amendment, and I am very proud to speak \nin favor of it.\n  Yesterday, as I left the floor of the Senate, I realized what the \nscore was for the people: Zero. In very close votes in each case, this \nRepublican majority voted, with rare exception, for the HMOs and \nagainst the patients of this country. It is stunning to me to see that, \na most amazing thing.\n  As I discussed some of what happened yesterday with my Democratic \nfriends, who happened to be women, we were all stunned at the vote \nagainst a very straightforward amendment by Senator Robb which \nbasically said, after a mastectomy, a doctor should determine the \nlength of stay. It is stunning to me that that couldn't pass the \nSenate. The hold and the grip of the HMOs is extraordinary.\n  There is a cartoon in today's Washington Post that I find very \ninteresting. It pictures huge campaign contributions. The Senator from \nWisconsin talks about that all the time. I am not surprised people are \ncynical. All I hope is that they wake up and listen to this debate. \nThis amendment on clinical trials is one they ought to listen to.\n  What is a clinical trial? A clinical trial occurs when there is a \npromising new therapy for a condition, a disease for which traditional \ntherapies are not working for everyone. So what happens is people will \nenroll in these clinical trials; usually, they are pretty desperate at \nthat point because their disease is not responding well to the \ntraditional therapies. They want to get into this trial, and they want \nto see if they have a chance at surviving. The good news about this for \nsociety is not only will this individual have a chance of surviving, \nbut we learn about the therapy, and, of course, it is the way we have \nseen therapies move into the mainstream of treatment.\n  Well, what is happening now with the HMOs--because they are so \ninterested in their profits and paying their CEOs $30 million, in one \ncase, and $50 million a year in another case--is they are cutting back \non costs. So where they used to pay the costs associated with a \nclinical trial, not for the experimental therapy itself, because that \nis paid by the company that invented it, but by the associated costs, \nif there are reactions to the therapy, et cetera, they are cutting back \non this treatment. So by their refusal to pay for the patient cost, \nmany research institutions--particularly cancer centers--are cutting \nback on the clinical trials because there is a lack of payment by the \nHMOs, and we are running into a real serious problem.\n  When you continually put profit before patient care, when you \ncontinually put dollar signs ahead of vital signs, what happens is we \nare losing the opportunity to test these promising treatments for \ncancer, for Alzheimer's, for Parkinson's, for diabetes, for AIDS--you \nname the disease. By the way, if you ask the average American what they \nfear most, they will tell you it is illness; it is cancer; it is heart \ndisease; it is stroke; it is the loss of a loved one.\n  So what we have is a situation where HMOs are refusing to pay the \npatient costs in clinical trials, and clinical trials are being cut \nback at the very time when we are making tremendous strides in learning \nmore about therapies. This is a sad day.\n  So what we do in this amendment is essentially say let's go back to \nthe way it always was, where the HMOs pay for the costs associated with \nthese clinical trials for their patients. If we don't pass this \namendment and this trend continues, we will reverse the trend of \nfinding better cures for disease.\n  The other thing this amendment does, which is really important, is it \ndeals with access to prescription drugs. Nearly all the HMOs have \ndeveloped what is called a formulary, which is a limited list of \nprescription drugs for which the HMO will pay. They do this to receive \ndiscounts from drug companies and to limit the number of medications \nfor which they pay. This is a cost-saving measure. I don't have a \nproblem with this--except when the formulary drug isn't right for the \npatient, except when a doctor says the drug his patient needs is not in \nthe formulary. What this amendment says is that the HMO must pay for \nthe drug that a doctor determines his patient needs, even if it isn't \nin the list that the HMO provided.\n  It also says in this amendment that HMOs cannot classify a drug that \nis approved by the FDA as experimental, which is one of the ways they \nget around having to pay for a drug. They say to a patient: Well, I \nknow your doctor wants you to use this drug, but it is experimental.\n  Well, if a drug is approved by the FDA, the Food and Drug \nAdministration, then it is clear that the drug has been approved and \nought to be available.\n  So this is a very important measure. This will ensure we keep making \nprogress on clinical trials. This will ensure people get access to the \nneeded drugs. I hope we will stand up, not as we did yesterday, because \nthis Senate sat down for the people and stood up for the big money \ninterests in this society, the HMOs and their bottom line. Let's stand \nup for the people and let's support this Dodd amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, very quickly, let me state where we are, \nand then I will yield to the Senator from Florida.\n  We are presently considering an underlying amendment on clinical \ntrials which was put forth by Senator Dodd. It is an issue we have \ndiscussed a great deal in committee. It deserves discussion and it \ndeserves a great deal of debate because it is important. As one who has \nbeen a principal investigator in clinical trials and has been involved \nin clinical investigations and trials for pharmaceutical agents and the \napplication of medical devices, such as cardiac valves and stints, all \nof which I am familiar, it allows me to say it is critically important \nwe debate and address\n\n[[Page S8430]]\n\nthis issue, that we make sure we do move forward in a direction to \ncapture and support the great benefits which are available in clinical \ntrials.\n  A clinical trial is fairly straightforward in patient care. It is to \nfigure out whether or not something works or whether it is harmful or \nnot harmful. It is necessary to use and investigate patient populations \nwhere one group of the population receives it and one group does not \nreceive it, to see what the adverse effects are, what works and what \ndoes not work. It is the accepted way of making and capturing the great \nadvances which we all know are both being realized, but even more \nexciting--whether it is in the field of cancer or heart disease or bone \ndisease or stroke--is that we are going to make our great \nbreakthroughs.\n  In the underlying bill we are considering, we have a study by the \nInstitute of Medicine to look at the factors which might hinder patient \nparticipation in those trials and also to figure out what the cost of \nthese trials are, because you have one population that is not getting \neither a specific device or pharmaceutical agent and one population \nthat does. But to compare these two populations, you need to do more \ntesting, more examinations. If you have side effects or an adverse \nreaction from a medication, maybe you have to have a longer \nhospitalization or new treatments.\n  Well, the challenge we have as a nation is to figure out what that \nadditional cost is. There have been only three good studies completed \nto date to determine the difference between those incremental costs to \ncarry out that investigation. What we are considering is a new mandate \nand whether or not that new mandate should be placed on the HMOs' \nbacks, or the private sector's back, in order to make the great \nadvances in which we all want to participate. If we open that door--and \nI think we can go further than what is in the underlying bill--we have \nto be very careful not to impose a huge, very expensive mandate on our \nprivate health insurance system--something we haven't been able to do \nin Medicare, the public system. We have struggled with it, and we \nhaven't been able to figure it out with the public dollars. So before \nwe put in a huge mandate, we have to be careful not to dump on the \nprivate sector something we haven't been able to do in the public \nsector. That is the essence of the bill we will be passing over the \nnext 48 hours.\n  I think we can make great strides. Probably the first thing to do is \nto look at the clinical trials. In this body, no Member has spent as \nmuch--or more--time looking at this issue of clinical trials than the \nSenator from Florida.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MACK. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank Senator Frist for \nyielding me time. I also appreciate greatly the comments made with \nrespect to the clinical trials. Again, I look forward to continuing to \nwork with him in the future on this issue.\n  Mr. President, I want to respond to one provision of the amendment \noffered last night by my friend from Connecticut, Senator Dodd. This \nprovision goes to a concern that has been raised by patients throughout \nour country--the issue of health coverage for patients who are \nparticipating in clinical trials.\n  As Members of the United States Senate, we must seek legislative \nsolutions to a wide array of public policy issues. These issues include \nhealth policy, as we are doing today. They include tax policy, economic \npolicy, foreign policy, and education policy. The list is quite \nexpansive. Frequently, we find ourselves divided on issues of the day.\n  However, I can think of no issue which better unites Republicans and \nDemocrats, conservatives and liberals, as the issue of biomedical \nresearch.\n  In addition to Senator Dodd, we are fortunate to have many, many \nleaders in the Senate on this important issue. Senator Specter and \nSenator Harkin are leading the historic bipartisan effort to double \nfunding for the National Institutes of Health. Senator Jeffords, \nSenator First, Senator Kennedy, and Senator Mikulski have worked hard \nin their committee to authorize and oversee the activities of the HIH. \nAny many more of my colleagues have each contributed in their own way \nto help make funding for HIH the national priority it is today. As I \nsaid, few issues unite the Senate like medical research.\n  One of the highlights during my 17 years as a Member of the Senate \nand House of Representatives has been to meet the scientists who are \nrevolutionizing the way man fights disease, and to improve our quality \nof life. It doesn't matter if they are a young bench scientist or a \nNobel Laureate, their mission remains the same--to find ways to detect \nand treat diseases. Today, there is a level of commitment and \nenthusiasm to this monumental endeavor that I've never seen before. \nToday, researchers dare to use the word, ``cure.'' That wasn't the case \nvery long ago.\n  As we work to make sure that scientists have the necessary resources \nto continue their remarkable progress, we must also address the \nethical, legal and social implications of biomedical research. Science \nis moving faster than public policy can keep pace. It's as though \nscience is on the Concorde, and Congress stalled at Kitty Hawk trying \nto get off the ground.\n  There are very difficult, complex scientific issues which require \nCongressional action, but these issues also require thoughtful and \ncareful deliberation. For example, Congress has been working for many \nyears to ensure that health plans do not discriminate against people \nbecause of their genetic information. As a cancer survivor, I know how \nimportant it is to have confidence in knowing that a genetic test will \nbe used for information, not discrimination. I've been part of a \nbipartisan effort to resolve this issue, starting with legislation \nintroduced by our former colleague, Senator Mark Hatfield.\n  Genetic nondiscrimination is a very complex issue with wide-ranging \nramifications. There have been many questions to answer. Congress has \nstruggled with how best to define medical and scientific terms. We have \nexamined the impact of our actions on the cost and availability of \nhealth insurance. Frequently, we have determined that much more \ninformation was needed before deciding the best approach.\n  We have addressed the issue of genetic nondiscrimination with \nthoughtful deliberation, and I believe the Congress must take the same \nthoughtful, deliberative approach when it comes to coverage of clinical \ntrials.\n  There are many questions to be answered. What are the cost \nimplications? How will this new benefit impact the availability of \nhealth insurance? What impact will coverage of clinical trials have on \nhealth insurance premiums? How will it impact small business owners, \nwho are struggling to provide health insurance for their employees? \nWhat is the best approach to defining medical and scientific terms, \nsuch as ``routine patient costs''?--becasue that definition will \ndetermine what the underlying costs of this effort will be.\n  These are very important questions, involving very complex issues, \nwith very significant implications.\n  Mr. President, I support comprehensive coverage of clinical trials. \nBut, as this time, we need more information before we go that far.\n  Later today, or tomorrow, I will be introducing an amendment, along \nwith Senator Frist, Senator Jeffords, Senator Collins, and others, \nwhich will help provide patients, scientists, lawmakers, employers, \nhealth plans and others with answers to the many questions associated \nwith health insurance coverage for clinical trials. I will outline our \napproach at that time.\n  Mr. President, medical research is a bipartisan issue. We all agree \nthat the basic scientific research funded by the National Institutes of \nHealth must be translated into new forms of treatment through well-\ndesigned clinical trials. Earlier this year, Senator Rockfeller and I \nintroduced legislation to provide Medicare coverage for cancer clinical \ntrials. I am pleased to say that a bipartisan group of 36 Senators have \ncosponsored this bill. Senator Snowe and others have introduced \nlegislation to provide coverage through private health plans. We may \napproach the issue in different ways, but we all agree that the Senate \nmust address the issue of clinical trial coverage, and we must do so \nnow.\n\n[[Page S8431]]\n\n  Mr. President, I look forward to discussing my amendment later in the \ndebate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield 20 minutes to the Senator from \nIdaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me, first, thank one of the true \nleaders in the Senate on the issue of health care for yielding me time, \nand to say how much I have appreciated his work in the last month and \nin the last few days during this critical debate on the Patients' Bill \nof Rights.\n  I am pleased the Senate is, once again, debating the issue of health \ncare reform. I am pleased because here we have an opportunity, I think, \nto reclaim for the American people their right to control their health \ncare. I am excited we have this opportunity to talk about medical \nsavings accounts, restoring patients rights, and making health care \ninsurance affordable--or at least this should be the essence of the \ndebate.\n  I must tell you that I am disappointed to see only one side is \ninterested in truly talking about patients' rights instead of more \nregulation, more government, and, somehow, more control. While \nRepublicans are talking about giving all Americans access to health \ncare insurance and letting them control their medical health care, our \nDemocrat friends are talking about driving up costs, canceling health \ncare coverage for millions of Americans, and putting American health \ncare under the control of more Federal Government.\n  I am aware my friend, the Senator from Connecticut, has an amendment \non the floor. I will speak to that amendment in just a few moments. But \nI think it is important to set that amendment in the context of the \ndebate on the bill yesterday, today, and the balance of the week.\n  First, I want to look at what it is our Democrat friends on the floor \nof the Senate are asking us to swallow. I believe this will help us \nbetter understand the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator \nfrom Connecticut.\n  We have heard a lot of talk about the cost of the Kennedy bill--some \nof it on this floor. Yesterday we even saw our colleagues parade out \nthe President of the United States to downplay the cost of the Kennedy \nbill. Our Democrat colleagues have a mantra when it comes to the cost \nof the bill. Over and over again, they say, well, it is less than a Big \nMac; it is less than $2 a month.\n  Let me look at this chart for a moment, and maybe you will join with \nme in it. It is ``less than a Big Mac.'' That is what Senator Kennedy \nsaid. They even say the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says \nthis bill will cost less than a Big Mac.\n  If you look at the Congressional Budget Office report--and I \nrecommend you read it in its entirety--you will see it says nothing \nabout a Big Mac. But this is what it does say: According to the \nCongressional Budget Office, the Kennedy bill will increase premiums an \naverage of 6.1 percent over and above the normal inflationary costs of \nhealth care.\n  For instance, let's read from the CBO report because an awful lot of \nmy colleagues on the other side of the aisle seem to be confused about \nwhat the Congressional Budget Office has said about this bill.\n  I am quoting the CBO report:\n\n       Most of the provisions would reach their full effect within \n     the first 3 years of its enactment. The CBO estimates the \n     premiums for an employer-sponsored health plan would rise by \n     an average of 6.1 percent in the absence of any compensating \n     changes on the part of the employer.\n\n  What are the ``compensating changes''? There is a clear history in \nhealth care that, as costs go up, people either leave or are dropped \nfrom the system.\n  The CBO says of the Kennedy bill on compensating changes:\n\n       Employers could respond to premium increases in a variety \n     of ways to reduce their impact. They could drop health care \n     insurance entirely.\n\n  Yes, that is an option. CBO says it is.\n  ``Reduce the generosity of the benefit package.''\n  That is quite typically what happens. They keep narrowing the scope \nof the coverage.\n  ``Increase cost sharing by beneficiaries.''\n  We know what that means--the consumer pays more of the bill.\n  Or ``increase the employee's share of the premium.''\n  If my colleagues on the other side of the aisle think the CBO had a \nnice thing to say about their bill, I suggest they read the entire \nreport. ``They could drop health insurance entirely'' is a quote. This \nis perhaps the most frightening part of the Kennedy bill to any \nAmerican family. So many families across America are struggling to get \nby--we know that--even in prosperous times. There is a very large chunk \nof America that does not share totally in that prosperity. They depend \non their health insurance to protect them when things go wrong.\n  Yet every Democrat Member of this Chamber has thrown their support \nbehind a bill that would take protection away from an estimated 1.9 \nmillion Americans. That is one estimate. Here is another estimate \ncommissioned by our friends at the AFL-CIO. They indicate that the \nKennedy bill could cancel health care coverage for approximately 1.8 \nmillion Americans.\n  I suggest a new slogan for my colleagues when they talk about the \nbill. I am talking now about ``golden arches.'' Over 1.8 million \nAmericans are uninsured by the Kennedy bill. That is a Big Mac attack \ndirectly at the American consumer and directly at the American family.\n  A few weeks ago when I made the same comment on the floor of the \nSenate, my colleague from North Dakota--who happens to be on the floor \nnow, Senator Dorgan--made a very remarkable statement. I don't think I \nhave heard it yet in the debate. My friend said the Kennedy bill might \nactually increase coverage because it would make health care so \nattractive that people who are now uninsured would sign up to get its \ncoverage. I say this is a remarkable statement for a very obvious \nreason. First, my friend seems to think we in the Senate can repeal the \nlaw of supply and demand. Raise the price, and more people are going to \ncome and get it? I doubt it. History shows quite the opposite.\n  So instead of demand decreasing as price goes up, consumers will buy \nmore of the product because it is more pricey and, yes, it does have \nmore benefits or possibly more? I don't think so.\n  Divide the dollars each family spends. They have to put food on the \ntable; they have to take the risk when it comes to health insurance.\n  While 14 percent of the public want Congress to reform medical care \nor to reform managed care, a whopping 82 percent of America wants \nCongress to make health care more affordable. That is what we ought to \nbe about: Extending coverage, protecting the patient, and while doing \nit, certainly not raising costs but hopefully making it more \naffordable.\n\n  That hardly fits my friend's description of a ``public clamor'' for a \nmore expensive health insurance program.\n  Finally, if my colleagues know so much about health care insurance \nand how attractive they can make it to the consumers, I suggest they \nresign from the Senate and go run a health care insurance company \nbecause obviously they know a new formula and they could make a \nkilling.\n  Enough about Big Mac attacks. That is what the Kennedy bill ought to \nbe called--a Big Mac attack. We have seen the number of uninsured \nAmericans rise from 32 million to 43 million in just 10 years. Since \n1995, the uninsured in my home State of Idaho has risen from 15 to 18 \npercent of the population. That is higher than the national average. \nEvery year we add 1 million Americans to the ranks of the uninsured. \nThe Kennedy bill would speed up that process instead of slow it down. \nWhat the Senate ought to be about right now and what our Government \nought to be about is trying to slow it down and make it more \naffordable.\n  My colleague from Connecticut has offered an amendment that he says \nwill improve access to cancer treatment. Before we vote on this \namendment, I will discuss the impact of the Kennedy bill and what it \nwould do in the context of this amendment in our fight against cancer.\n  We have heard from my colleague from Florida who, thank goodness, \nsurvived cancer. Most Members have not\n\n[[Page S8432]]\n\nhad to go through that trauma. What he said was critically important. \nThe 1.9 million Americans who would lose their health care coverage \nunder the Kennedy bill represent more than 1 out of every 100 Americans \nwith private coverage. Private health care insurance in this country \npays for millions of Americans to undergo cancer screening meant to \ncatch the deadly illness quickly, when it can be treated and defeated.\n  The Centers for Disease Control say every year private health \ninsurance pays for 33 million American women to undergo exams meant to \ndetect breast cancer. The Kennedy bill would cancel coverage for, it is \nnow estimated, 189,000 such breast exams every year. I don't really \nbelieve that is what they intend, but that is the unintended \nconsequence of this kind of legislation. Mr. President, 189,000 women \ncould go without breast exams if the Kennedy bill became law.\n  The Centers for Disease Control say each year private health \ninsurance pays for 9 million American women to have a mammogram. The \nKennedy bill would cancel coverage for 53,000 of those mammograms on an \nannual basis. Run the statistics, run the percentages, run the figures. \nIf you are going to take 1.8 or 1.9 million Americans out from under \ncoverage, statistically I am accurate.\n  Yesterday my colleague from California, Senator Boxer, said, \n``Republicans are turning their backs on America's women.'' She was on \nthe floor just a few moments ago repeating that. I want to know how \nSenator Boxer and all sponsors of the Kennedy bill reconcile their \ncommitment to women and women's health with the fact that they are \nsupporting a bill that could cause thousands of malignant lumps to go \nundiagnosed every year.\n  The Centers for Disease Control says each year private health \ninsurance pays for 41 million women to have pelvic exams and 24 million \nPap smears. These tests are meant to detect ovarian, uterine, and \ncervical cancers. Yet the Kennedy bill would cancel coverage for \n238,000 pelvic exams and 135,000 Pap smears. That is every year, \naccording to the statistics, according to CBO, and according to the \nexamination and study by the AFL-CIO.\n  I want to hear the Kennedy bill supporters begin to reconcile these \nnumbers, if their mantra is to fight cancer. We are talking about \naccess to the system. We want people to have these tests. We want them \nprotected. Yet if you shoot the cost up, people will take the risk. \nThere are only so many fungible dollars in every citizen's life. They \nhave to make real choices. My friends, that is the marketplace. I am \nafraid that is the unintended consequence of the Kennedy bill.\n  It does not harm just women. The Kennedy bill could and would \ncancel--if you run the statistics, there it is again--23,000 prostate \nexams every year.\n  As a final example, the Kennedy bill could cancel coverage for \n439,000 skin cancer exams every year. I say this is a final example \nbecause the list is not exhaustive. It would be impossible to track all \nthe ways the Kennedy bill threatens the health of 1.9 million Americans \nwho it would leave without protection from the life-threatening \ndiseases they will face.\n\n  When my Republican colleagues raised the cost issue yesterday, I \nbelieve my colleague from Massachusetts called it a red herring. If \nthis passes, I wonder what he will say to the women and the men who \nwill lose their fight against cancer because they did not get the early \ndetection. Because they did not have the money, they did not have the \ncoverage to walk through the door and get the exam.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will not yield.\n  I find it astounding that this is what my colleagues have contributed \nto the debate on patients' rights. How can a patient have a right if a \npatient cannot have access? Every study shows a 6.1-percent increase in \npremiums above inflation will drive 1.9 million Americans out of health \ncare.\n  My Republican colleagues and I support a different approach, a \nsubstantially different approach. We have a bill that puts patients in \ncontrol of their own health care and that makes health care simply more \naffordable. Our bill achieves it by giving all Americans access to \nmedical savings accounts, along with all of the other kinds of health \ncare insurances that are now available.\n  Since we introduced the limited MSA, or the Medical Savings Pilot \nProgram, something really very wonderful in health care has happened. I \nknow the other side does not want to recognize it. I am so frustrated, \ntrying to understand why they would ignore that the General Accounting \nOffice estimates that 37 percent of medical savings account buyers \npreviously had no coverage whatsoever, and 82 percent of the American \npublic rate the high cost of medical health care coverage their chief \nconcern. Medical savings accounts meet that concern. Our bill has that \nin it. That is not driving people out of the system. That is reaching \nout, bringing people into the system, into the system for their Pap \nsmears, into the system for their pelvic exams, into the system for \nearly detection of cancer. There is the difference, driving people out \nor encouraging people to come in, making health care more affordable.\n  A medical savings account gives you 100-percent coverage, 100 percent \nof doctors to choose from. My Democratic colleagues have gone to great \nlengths to say our bill does not generate direct access to specialists; \nthat our bill does not generate direct access to OB/GYNs; that we do \nnot guarantee access to pediatricians; that we do not let patients \nchoose their doctors; that we do not ensure that medical decisions will \nbe made by a patient and that patient's doctor. They could not be more \nwrong.\n  If you own a medical savings account and you own insurance, you \nchoose your own doctor, always. If you feel you need a specialist, then \nyou go to the specialist. If you need direct access to an OB/GYN, you \nhave it. If you need direct access to a pediatrician, nobody is sitting \nthere as the gatekeeper they like to talk about; you are the person in \npower. You have the direct access.\n  Once again, for mandatory referral, you are in control of your \ndestiny and the destiny that comes in cooperation with your primary \ncare physician. That is what we are talking about, about personalizing \nhealth care and taking the Federal Government out of it. That is why \nRepublicans have always supported MSAs. We are not saying everybody \nought to have them. We are simply saying open up the option. Make it \navailable as a matter of choice so you can choose between what you can \nafford and what has now become even more affordable. So we are not \nthrusting the Federal bureaucracy on the system and shoving up the cost \nby every legitimate estimator's estimation. We are, in fact, \npotentially driving those costs down.\n\n  A program that decreases the number of uninsured and gives patients \ndirect access to their doctors is what this Senate ought to be about. \nIf my Democrat colleagues truly want Americans to have affordable \nmedical care that patients control, they should be clamoring for a \nmedical savings account.\n  How can my colleagues stand up for a patient's right to greater \naccess to cancer treatment when they are supporting a bill that leaves \nmillions without health care coverage? I quoted the statistics, and \nthey are very easy to extrapolate out of those figures. We are talking \nabout hundreds of thousands fewer exams for potential cancer under what \nis now being proposed.\n  The answer is they really have not thought their bill through. They \ndo not think the marketplace works, that somehow you can reform it and \nchange it and control it by simply enacting a Federal regulation. Will \ncosts not go up? We know they will go up. We know every time we have \ntampered with health care for the better benefit or for the less, we \nhave had the direct impact on the marketplace that has driven health \ncare costs up. Every time it is driven up, it is driven beyond the \npoint of access by some Americans.\n  Why would they do this? I am not sure why they do this. I guess I \ncould quote President Clinton at the defeat of health care last time, \nwhen he said:\n\n       Now what I tried before won't work, maybe we can do it \n     another way. That's what we've tried to do, a step at a time, \n     until eventually we finish this.\n\n  I think that is the essence of what the Kennedy bill does, one step \nat a time, toward a greater sense of Federal control driving the cost \nup so the American consumer says, OK, give me\n\n[[Page S8433]]\n\nFederal health care; I can't afford it any other way.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, pursuant to the agreement with the Senator \nfrom Tennessee, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Illinois; \nfollowing that, 3 minutes to the Senator from West Virginia; then 3 \nminutes to the distinguished Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, yesterday was a banner day on the floor of \nthe Senate for the insurance industry. Three different amendments were \nconsidered, amendments which the insurance industry of America opposed. \nThe first of those amendments said a woman could keep her OB/GYN as her \nprimary physician no matter what the HMO said. The Republican majority \nand the insurance industry defeated that.\n  The second said you should have access to the emergency room closest \nto your home when you have a family emergency. That amendment was \ndefeated by the insurance industry and the Republican majority.\n  The third amendment said if you have a dispute with your insurance \ncompany about coverage, we are truly going to have an independent panel \ndecide who is right and who is wrong. That amendment was defeated by \nthe insurance industry and the Republican majority.\n  They may be dancing in the board rooms and the canyons of K Street, \nbut I can tell you the people of America understand this debate, and \nthey know they lost on the floor of the Senate yesterday.\n  We are now debating an issue of equal importance. If you have a \nhealth insurance plan and your doctor says: You have a serious \ncondition; we need to try a new drug; it has been approved by the FDA; \nit may work and it may not; in that situation many health insurance \ncompanies say: No, we will not pay for it because it is \n``experimental.''\n  Have you walked into a convenience store in your hometown and seen \nthose little canisters on the counter asking you to leave 50 cents or a \ndollar to help that local family pay for a medical bill they cannot \nafford? Many of these same people are paying for drugs, reimbursement \nfor which was turned down by health insurance companies because the \ntreatment was experimental. People literally on the brink of life or \ndeath, following doctors' orders, using FDA-approved drugs, have been \nturned down by these insurance companies.\n  Senator Dodd offers an amendment to protect our rights to use these \ndrugs as doctors call for them to save our lives. The Republican \nmajority and the insurance industry oppose it. We will face another \nvote today and another question as to whether American families will \nwin or lose.\n  Last Sunday in Chicago, I met this little fellow in this picture. His \nname is Rob Cortez. He will melt your heart. He is about a year old. He \nsuffers from spinal muscular atrophy. For a year, his family has been \nfighting to keep him alive, trying to keep their own courage together, \ntrying to fight his disease, and every day fighting another insurance \ncompany decision that would turn off the ventilator which would be the \nend of his life. Imagine what that family goes through.\n  They had a drug that was prescribed by a doctor to fight infection in \nthis poor little guy, and the insurance company said: No, it is \nexperimental. We will not pay for it.\n  The battle goes on day after day in households across America. The \nRepublicans can come to the floor with their cartoons and their \nslogans, but America's families understand this debate. What is at \nstake is our health and our health insurance. If people across America \ndo not wake up to the reality of this debate, we are going to lose an \nopportunity to give piece of mind to families all across Illinois, all \nacross the Nation, and to protect the lives of other vulnerable little \nkids. That is what the debate is all about.\n\n  I also want to make it clear that this clinical trial approach is \ncost-effective. Sloan-Kettering and M.D. Anderson have made it clear it \nis money saved.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom West Virginia is recognized for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, this is an extraordinary discussion, and it is one of \nthose things where I believe we ill serve the American people because \npoints are made too extremely.\n  The Senator from Idaho was making the point about driving people out \nof health care because of rising costs, and that is just flat out \nundeterminable. GAO says so. CBO says so. He quotes things that say \nthey do. I say they do not. I will be happy to show him the language if \nhe is interested in seeing it.\n  I do not know if this is about ideology or not or if it is about \npreaching. I have no idea. But I do know this, Mr. President: Clinical \ntrials are incredibly important. This has been a battle a number of us, \ncancer groups and others, have been fighting for many years. My friend, \nthe Senator from the State of Iowa, will expand on this more \neloquently.\n  It is a terribly important fight. It is a question of, can people \nhave access to clinical trials? Insurance companies used to pay for \nthem. Insurance companies now do not pay for them. Some people have \ncome to a point where they have exhausted--and they might be in their \nthirties and forties; we are not talking necessarily about people in \ntheir eighties or nineties but people in their thirties, forties, and \nfifties--every possible approach trying to do something about their \nvery dreadful disease, which could be any number of things, not just \ncancer but any number of things.\n  The insurance companies used to pay for that. Now the HMOs will not, \nand they will not for a very good reason: because those things tend to \nbe costly sometimes.\n  It comes down to the classic choice: Does the HMO get the advantage \nat the bottom line or does the patient get the advantage? That is the \nbasic decision and the difference between Members on the two sides of \nthe aisle who are otherwise informed and are trying to do the right \nthing on this subject. All of us are trying to do our best.\n  We have to have clinical trials. The usual and ordinary expenses \nassociated with that have to be paid; otherwise, people will not be \nable to afford it; they will not get clinical trials; therefore, they \nwill die or they have a chance of dying. Finally, of course, clinical \ntrials often are the best experiment and research that can possibly be \ndone because they lead to new discoveries and new opportunities.\n  I hope very much the Dodd amendment can be adopted. It is an \nextremely important amendment. When people hear ``clinical trials,'' \nthey are not sure what we are talking about. There are hundreds of \nthousands of Americans at this point who have given up on regular \ntherapies, but there is something out there on the cutting edge and \nthey are ready to use it, but now the insurance companies will not pay \nfor it, and the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights will do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The time of the Senator from \nWest Virginia has expired. The Senator from Iowa is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the privilege \nof the floor be granted to the following members of my staff during the \npendency of S. 1344: Ann Procter and Bryan Johnson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first I will address the issue that was \nbrought up by the Senator from Idaho who stated that women are going to \nbe driven out of cancer care because of this legislation. I could not \nbelieve what I was hearing. I asked the Senator from Idaho to yield for \na question, but he would not yield to me. Therefore, I will bring it up \nnow.\n  The Senator from Idaho stated that, because of this bill, thousands \nof people with breast cancer and lung cancer will be denied coverage. \nWhy then, I ask, do the following organizations support our bill: The \nAlamo Breast Cancer Foundation, the Alliance for Lung Cancer, Advocacy \nSupport and Education, the American Cancer Society supports this bill, \nthe California Breast Cancer organization, Cancer Care, Inc., Minnesota\n\n[[Page S8434]]\n\nBreast Cancer Coalition, National Alliance of Breast Cancer \nOrganizations, the National Breast Cancer Coalition, the National \nCoalition for Cancer Survivorship, the North American Brain Tumor \nCoalition, the Rhode Island Breast Cancer Coalition, the Susan G. Komen \nBreast Cancer Foundation, the YME National Breast Cancer Organization--\non and on. Why do all these cancer organizations support our bill?\n\n  If you listen to the Senator from Idaho, it is because they do not \nwant anyone treated for cancer. How ridiculous. It just shows the \nridiculous nature of the arguments made on the Republican side on this \nbill. What absolute, total nonsense.\n  That brings me to another ridiculous assertion made earlier. Someone \non the other side of the aisle stated that to have people in clinical \ntrials is going to be very expensive.\n  Sloan-Kettering did a study of the costs associated with clinical \ntrials. They looked at a number of people over 3 years, and here is \nwhat they found: Hospital stays, 24 percent lower for clinical trials; \nradiation therapy, 25 percent lower cost; drugs and supplies, 25 \npercent lower cost; operating room, 8 percent lower cost. These are for \nclinical trials.\n  That was backed up by another study done by M.D. Anderson in Houston, \nand this was done on 3,000 patients enrolled in clinical trials. They \nfound costs for ovarian cancer patients were 35 percent less. They \nfound lung cancer costs 36 percent less. In prostate cancer trials, \nthere was a negligible difference between research and standard care \npatients.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, of all the votes we will have and have \nhad in the Senate yesterday, today and tomorrow, this ought to be the \neasiest. This ought to be the easiest if you are interested in \nresearch, if you are interested in the protection of patients.\n  If we look at what has happened historically, insurance companies \nhave paid for routine care associated with clinical trials. The reason \nthey have paid for it because they knew it was right. Secondly, as the \nSenator from Iowa has pointed out, covering routine costs associated \nwith clinical trials actually provided savings to the insurance \ncompanies. But we now see a dramatic decline in clinical trial \nenrollment.\n  What are clinical trials? What do they represent? This is what they \nrepresent: A woman has cancer--it can be ovarian cancer, breast cancer, \ncervical cancer--and is told the ordinary treatments for cancer will \nnot cure her disease. Her prospects are extremely grim. Her doctor \nadvises that her only chance of survival is a treatment under study in \na clinical trial. We should not permit the insurance companies or their \nbureaucrats to deny her access to that clinical trial. That is what \nthis amendment is all about--access to the only treatment that may give \nher a chance of survival.\n  The greatest progress in cancer treatment has been made in childhood \ncancer, and it is no coincidence that the greatest number of clinical \ntrials performed in this country have been in children's cancer. The \nreason, as most researchers and most cancer centers recognize, is the \ntypes of clinical trials that are taking place.\n  Congress is doubling the NIH budget to take advantage of what I like \nto think will be the life science century. Progress in making \nbreakthroughs in so many different areas of disease--whether it be \nAlzheimer's or cancer or Parkinson's disease--potentially emptying \nnursing homes around this country and improving the health of Americans \ndemonstrate the importance of clinical trials. Clinical trials are the \ncritical aspect in finding effective treatment and cures for diseases. \nThat is why this amendment is so important. All HMOs have to do is \ncontinue what insurance companies have historically done and that is \ncover the routine costs associated with clinical trials. The clinical \ntrial sponsors pay the remaining costs.\n  The Republican proposal to study the importance of clinical trials is \npoppycock. The choice is: Will we maintain what every researcher, every \npatient organization, every doctor who works in the areas of these \ncritical diseases recognizes as absolutely vital for medical progress, \nor will we study this issue some more?\n  The Republican proposal says let's do another study and let's get a \nreport to the committee. We are saying that if the doctor says there \nare sound medical reasons for this type of treatment, access should not \nbe denied by a bureaucrat or an insurance company. That is the issue \nthis amendment addresses.\n\n  This amendment should receive overwhelming support. It is ridiculous \nthat we are spending so much time debating the issue of whether \nclinical trials are important. Every single country in the world envies \nthe progress the United States has made in the area of \npharmaceuticals--every single country. Why? Because we have \nbreakthrough drugs. Why? Because we move these breakthrough drugs from \nthe laboratory to the bedside. How is that done? It is through clinical \ntrials. We cannot move breakthrough drugs from the laboratory to the \nbedside without clinical trials.\n  That is what this issue is about. That is why we have such strong \nsupport from the cancer societies and organizations concerned about \ndiseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease. That is why we have \nthe support of the disability community. That is why we have support \nfrom so many children's disease organizations.\n  That is why I hope the Dodd amendment will be accepted.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Would the Chair state how much time the minority has?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 7 minutes 10 seconds.\n  Mr. REID. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington has 4 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I thank my colleagues who have been on the floor talking about an \nissue this morning that I think is becoming more and more critical, and \nthat is access to clinical trials, the amendment by Senator Dodd.\n  It seems to me that in the Senate we have talked, in a bipartisan \nway, about making sure we have increased funding for NIH so we can have \naccess to the best new research for diseases such as cancer, diabetes, \nand multiple sclerosis.\n  A lot of great research is occurring right now at NIH. Members have \nsaid many times that needs to be increased. In fact, the Labor \nCommittee has worked very hard, and I am very proud of the fact we have \nincreased funding to NIH by almost 40 percent.\n  However, today, citizens, taxpayers, who are paying the dollars for \nthat increased research at NIH, are being routinely denied access to \nthat new research when their HMO says they will not pay for a new \nclinical trial--these are new medications, new medical devices that \nhave been researched and we have paid for the research through our own \ntaxpayer dollars.\n\n  But when it comes to our constituents, who have paid for this \nresearch, having access to the clinical trials, having access to this \nnew research, they are not allowed because their HMO denies it. That is \nwhy I think this amendment is so important to the taxpayers of this \ncountry.\n  I met recently with a number of cancer survivors in my own home State \nof Washington. Some of them were patients at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer \nCenter, a very well known cancer research facility, one of the premiere \ncenters in this country. The doctors and the patients told me about how \nthey were routinely being denied access to these clinical trials--these \npeople who have no other recourse, who may have MS or cancer or another \nsevere illness, who have no other hope out there except for access to a \nclinical trial. It is their last chance at life and their doctors \nrecommended it. The doctors at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center said: \nThis is their chance at life, and their insurance company, their HMO, \nsaid: No, sorry; we're not going to pay for it.\n  One of the things the doctors said, which made an impression on me, \nwas that a patient was going to receive some kind of care with some \nkind of cost that their insurance company was going to have to pay for, \nand, in fact, the clinical trials, for the most part,\n\n[[Page S8435]]\n\ncost less than the treatment this person was going to have. So they did \nnot understand why the insurance company was going to decide which \ntreatment they were going to have. They felt very strongly the doctors \nought to be the ones deciding what kind of medical treatment this \npatient should be having. And the clinical trials were their best \nchance at recovery and hope for life.\n  I hope the Members of the Senate will agree with Senator Dodd and the \nother sponsors of this amendment and allow people to have access to the \nresearch they have paid for by taxpayers when they need it, when they \nare victims of cancer, when they have MS, when they have diabetes, and \nallow them to have access to clinical trials.\n  We will all win in the end because, without these clinical trials, we \nwill not have the research we need to make sure these kinds of medical \ndevices or these prescription drugs are then available to the general \npublic as routine care that is paid for by HMOs.\n  I commend my colleagues for their debate on this issue. I urge all of \nus who have said we are for increased funding at NIH and increased \nfunding for research to now allow our constituents in this country \naccess to that care.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized for \n2 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If I could ask a question, through the Chair, of the \nSenator. You have one of the great cancer research centers in \nWashington--the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center--that is world renowned. \nIt is known throughout the United States as having the very best \nexpertise in treating cancer.\n  I would be interested, as would the American people--we have one of \nthe great children's research center--recognized recently as the No. 1 \nchildren's center doing great research--what does that center do for \nthe citizens of Washington and the citizens of this country in terms of \nresearch programs, clinical trials?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. In response to the Senator from Massachusetts, the \ndoctors at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center are very concerned about \ntheir patients who are being denied access to medical care because they \nsay these trials are what will not only help patients but will help \nthem give the best care to all of their patients. They are not able to \ndo the job we expect them to do any longer, not because of medical \ndecisions they make but because of the decisions made by HMOs.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The doctors at that world-class cancer research are \nrecommending clinical trials because they think those clinical trials \ncan perhaps save the life of an individual who may have breast or \ncervical or ovarian cancer. You are finding in your State that managed \ncare plans are denying access to clinical trials for their members?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely correct. \nThese are world-class physicians, top physicians in cancer research, \nwho think the best thing they can do for this patient is the clinical \ntrial; and they are being told no.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Would the Senator be surprised that the head of the \nLombardi Cancer Research Center, one of the great research centers in \nWashington, DC, testified they had to hire eight individuals to deal \nwith the insurance companies just on the issue of enrolling persons in \nclinical trials. Doctors were referring women to the Lombardi Center \nfor lifesaving cancer treatment--for clinical trials--and the HMOs were \ndenying coverage? These eight individuals were trying to deal with the \nHMOs so that these patients could receive potentially lifesaving \ntreatments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. All our amendment is trying to say is: if there is a \nclinical trial available, the value of the clinical trial is \nestablished, and if a doctor believes his patient can benefit from that \nclinical trial, the HMO ought to allow access. That is what this \namendment is about. Without this amendment, there will be an increase \nin the number of clinical trials that are terminated.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator is absolutely correct. Not only will it hurt \nthe health of the woman who has been denied access to the clinical \ntrial who has ovarian cancer or breast cancer, but it also denies us, \nall the rest of us, access to good health care because we will never \nknow whether or not that clinical trial works, which could then be \navailable to the rest of us.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. In other words, the benefits of the research from the \nclinical trial will benefit people whether they live in the State of \nNevada or the State of Massachusetts?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All the Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I support the amendment offered by \nSenator Dodd to increase patient access to life-saving clinical trials. \nThis amendment could assist in prolonging the lives of millions of \npatients with life-threatening or serious illnesses, for which no \nstandard treatment is effective, by offering them access to new \nexperimental therapies.\n  Clinical trials are the primary means of testing new therapies for \ndeadly diseases such as cancer, congestive heart failure, Alzheimer's, \nand diabetes. Many health insurance plans cover the patient's routine \ncosts associated with clinical trials. Recently, however, research \ninstitutions--particularly cancer centers--are finding that managed \ncare plans will not pay for the costs associated with clinical trials. \nFor many patients whose conditions have not responded to conventional \ntherapies, clinical trials may be the only viable treatment option \navailable.\n  The Dodd amendment requires health plans to cover the routine patient \ncosts associated with these trials. Eligible patients are those with \nlife-threatening or serious illnesses for which no standard treatment \nis effective, and those for whom participation offers meaningful \npotential for significant clinical benefit. Trials are limited to those \napproved and funded by one or more of the following: the National \nInstitutes of Health (NIH); a cooperative group or center of the NIH; \nor, certain trials through the Department of Defense or the Veterans \nAdministration.\n  The Republican bill does not provide for coverage of any routine \ncosts related to clinical trials. Instead, they require only a study on \nthe issue. The Republican bill does not offer hope to patients who have \nexhausted all other options except the promise of experimental \ntreatment. We should not have to tell the thousands of desperate women \nwith terminal breast cancer that we need to study this issue some more \nbefore we can offer them access to clinical treatment that might save \ntheir lives.\n  Republicans claim that we do not have enough information about the \ncosts of clinical trials. They say we need, once again, yet another \nstudy. Every day we delay, with conversations about the need for \nanother study which will undoubtedly demonstrate the continue \nimportance of clinical trials, another patient suffers; another patient \ndies. The Republicans' claim that clinical trials are more expensive \nthan conventional therapies is unjustified. The fact is that the cost \nof conventional therapies is not known with any precision. The cost \nvaries case-by-case.\n  Republicans claim that covering the cost of patient care in clinical \ntrials would be too expensive. The Congressional Budget Office found \nthat 90 percent of health plans already cover routine patient costs in \nclinical trials. In an attempt to block patient access to clinical \ntrials, insurance companies try to claim that a clinical trial is more \nexpensive than conventional therapy. However, at Memorial Sloan-\nKettering Cancer Center in New York, the cost of treating pancreas, \nbreast, colon, lung, and ovarian cancer pursuant to a clinical trial \nwere compared to the costs of treating the same cancers with standard \ntherapies. Utilizing Medicare patients for this comparison, the average \ncost per patient was actually lower for those patients enrolled in \nclinical trials.\n  Let me explain who pays for trials. There are three categories of \ncosts associated with a clinical trial:\n  First, the cost of the investigational drug is provided free of \ncharge by the pharmaceutical sponsor.\n  Second, the costs associated with collecting and analyzing the data \nfrom\n\n[[Page S8436]]\n\nthe trial is covered by the trial sponsor through a federal research \ngrant or other funding source (i.e., National Institutes of Medicine, \nFood and Drug Administration).\n  Third, routine patient care costs--physician charges, hospital fees \nand routine diagnostic tests--are the only costs that managed care \nplans would be asked to cover for patients participating in clinical \ntrials. And as I mentioned earlier, over 90 percent of health plans \nalready cover routine patient costs in clinical trials.\n  By early in the next century, Hispanics, African-Americans, and \nNative Americans will comprise nearly one-half of our nation's. In \nfact, Hispanics are the fastest-growing ethnic group in America today. \nThis is alarming since heart disease, cancer, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS \nand diabetes are disproportionally affecting minority communities.\n  Some specific forms of cancer affect ethnic minority communities at \nrates up to several times higher than national averages. African-\nAmerican males develop cancer 15 percent more frequently than white \nmales. Although the rate of breast cancer among African-American women \nis not as high as that among white women, African-American women are \nmore likely to die from the disease once it is detected. Cervical \ncancer is nearly five times more likely among Vietnamese American women \nthan white women, and it disproportionally affects Hispanics. Liver \ncancer is more than 11 times higher among Vietnamese Americans than \namong whites. Colon and rectal cancer is higher among Alaska Natives \nthan other ethnic groups. Lastly, American Indians experience the \nlowest cancer survival rate of any U.S. ethnic group.\n  However, access to clinical trials is especially limited for racial \nand ethnic minorities. Of the people participating in clinical cancer \ntrials, only 2-3 percent are minorities. The September Cancer March's \nResearch Task Force said that one way of encouraging more participation \nis to require public and private insurers to cover the routine medical \ncosts associated with clinical trials. Senator Dodd's amendment to the \nPatients' Bill of Rights does just that.\n  In addition, women, the elderly, ethnic and racial minorities, and \ncancer patients are not participating in clinical trials proportional \nto the population. The September Cancer March's Research Task Force \ntestified before the Senate Cancer Coalition that only 2 percent of \ncancer patients are enrolled in clinical trials. Of those \nparticipating, only 25 percent are elderly, even though the elderly \nrepresented some 63% of the cancer patient population during the mid-\n1990s.\n  Breast cancer is one of many diseases that cause more deaths among \nminorities than among white women. Researchers and patient advocates \nagree that understanding differences in disease progression requires \nthe recruitment of a representative number of minorities to clinical \ntrials. So why don't more ethnic/racial minorities participate in \nclinical trials? There are several reasons. Lack of access to health \ncare and lack of insurance coverage are major reasons; 43 million \nAmericans are uninsured. This number does not include the millions who \nare under-insured.\n  In closing, real improvements in health care, advancements in medical \nknowledge, are possible only through increased scientific clinical \nresearch and development. We cannot lose sight of the fact that without \ncontinued clinical research and access to clinical trials, life \nthreatening diseases such as cancer will continue to ravage \ncommunities. Encouraging participation in clinical trials is essential, \nif not crucial, to the millions of Americans who live daily with life-\nthreatening diseases. The unrelenting focus by HMOs on cutting rather \nthan focusing on the long-term quality of our health care system is \nharming the American people, and we are not gaining scientific \nknowledge.\n  As our nation continues to move to a managed care based health \nsystem, patient enrollment in clinical trials is dropping. One of the \nreasons for this decline is the unwillingness of many health plans to \ncover routine patient care costs associated with participation in a \nclinical trial. This amendment to the Patients' Bill of Rights is the \nfirst step to ensuring access to clinical trials. We cannot continue to \nlet HMOs put profits before patients.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, how much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 18 minutes 24 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. FRIST. And the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we are currently debating an amendment on \nclinical trials. It is something that is very close to my heart \nbecause, as I said earlier, I have been involved in clinical trials. I \nhave seen the great advantages of having such clinical trials in that \nit allows us, through that final stage, to determine whether or not a \nparticular intervention, whether it be a new medicine that might \npotentially cure prostate cancer or a medical device that might be used \nto hold open the coronary artery after a heart attack, a heart attack \nwhich results in a squeezing down or atherosclerosis or blockage of a \ncoronary artery, put a little stint in that, opens it up, how do you \ntake that to the clinical setting? How do you take that to where it can \nbe distributed broadly across America and across the world, if it is \nbeneficial?\n  I should mention that the United States is the leading Nation in \ntaking such innovation and such creativity, capturing it, studying it \ncarefully, putting it in appropriate clinical trials, and then having \nit applied, if it is safe, if it is effective, to people around the \ncountry and the world. It should give all of us in this body and in the \ncountry a great deal of pride that we are the leaders in medical \ntechnology, medical innovation, whether it be the use of pharmaceutical \nagents; that is, medicines, whether it is treatment of chemotherapy; \nthat is, using medicines to treat cancer, or the application of medical \ndevices.\n  Just a few days ago I was in Boston and visited some of the great, \nyoung, aggressive research people who, by hand, make those little \nstints, the stints that look like little springs, that keep thousands \nand thousands of people's coronary arteries open. They come in with an \nacute heart attack, a little balloon blows up in a vessel, a stint is \nplaced. Twelve years ago those stints were not around. They had never \nbeen placed into a coronary artery. How do you get to that point to \nwhere it is used in just about every hospital, every cardiology \nhospital in the United States of America? Well, the last phase of \ndevelopment is clinical trials.\n  That is why it is so important to me. And it is, in a very direct but \nalso an indirect way, important to every single American, no matter \nwhat age you are because everybody at some point in their lives will be \nsick or will be ill. Anything that we can do as a Nation to lower the \nbarriers between whether it is industry or our investigators or medical \nscience and the delivery, the effective delivery of safe and effective \nprocedures is something we need to work on. We started much of that \nwork 3 or 4 years ago in modernization of the FDA.\n  I spent some time explaining this aspect of clinical trials to \nreinforce how critical it is that we do everything we can to lower the \nbarriers to participation in clinical trials.\n  One thing we have to be aware of in terms of clinical trials is that \nwe don't fully know what--I use the word ``incremental''--the increased \ncost, the incremental cost is when someone goes in to a clinical trial. \nAs I mentioned earlier, usually you have one group of patients who did \nnot get an intervention, one group of patients who did get an \nintervention, get that additional drug. You need to follow them over \ntime and see what the incremental costs are of that clinical trial.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. FRIST. I am happy to yield briefly for a question. My answer will \nbe very short because I don't have enough time to finish.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator yielding for \njust a quick question. Isn't it true that insurance companies, until \nrecently, did pay for clinical trials, and it wasn't until we moved to \nthe HMO era that we are now in that we are being denied access to \nthose?\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes. I really appreciate the question because it shows why \nwe are addressing this today. In part, it is\n\n[[Page S8437]]\n\nbecause we are just beginning to understand the real importance of \nclinical trials. We are just figuring out the cost. The other dynamic \nis just that.\n  We have insurance companies and managed care companies and private \npayers today who basically say: We are in the insurance business. Our \njob is to deliver health insurance. If an individual comes in and they \nare sick, my obligation, as a managed care company or as an HMO or a \nhealth insurance company, is to take that patient and cover them by the \ndefinitions of that contract.\n  The question they are asking us today, and need to ask us on the \nfloor, is shouldn't that be the responsibility of the Federal \nGovernment? Why should I, an HMO, an indemnity plan, a private health \ninsurance plan, be paying for research that has potentially nothing to \ndo with that particular patient? Because this is a mandate, the \nunderlying Dodd amendment is a new mandate.\n  What Senator Mack and I will propose is also a mandate. So both sides \nare going to be hearing it. They are basically asking: Why are you all \nof a sudden thrusting on me the responsibility that is yours, the \nSenate, the Federal Government, the NIH? Why aren't you using Federal \nmoney, taxpayer money to subsidize this research, which is very \nbeneficial? Why are you putting that mandate on my shoulders, the \nprivate insurance company?\n  Now, the answer to that is twofold. We probably need to do a little \nof both. We need to have more appropriate public investment in the \nclinical trials and at the same time have the private health insurance \ncompany in some way subsidized.\n  The problem with that is, if we put this new mandate on the managed \ncare companies and the HMOs, somebody has to pay for it. The Federal \nGovernment is not going to pay for it. Unfortunately, I think we need \nto go back and address this same issue in Medicare. The Federal \nGovernment has basically said that we, except through the NIH, are not \ngoing to. For example, in the Medicare system, the health care delivery \nsystem for seniors, we have not approached the issue of how we \nsubsidize these clinical trials.\n  So the private sector is saying: Why are you making us pay for it, \nwhile you in the Federal Government, at least in Medicare, have not yet \naddressed that?\n  The response to that is, yes, but we have the National Institutes of \nHealth. We need to continue investing in that, and they oversee, along \nwith other public agencies, clinical trials.\n  The private sector says: Why us? What the private sector is going to \ndo is say: I am in the business of taking care of the heart attack that \nI cover under contract. Why am I having to, under your mandate, to have \nthis clinical trial on prostate surgery or prostate cancer treatment? \nWhy are you forcing me to subsidize that?\n\n  We need to answer that question. The general public good and the \ngreat advances are the answer to that question, but then somebody has \nto pay for it.\n  The health insurance companies, what are they going to do? Whatever \nthat incremental cost is, they are going to charge their very next \nperson that they cover. So they are going to pass it back to the \npatients.\n  Then all of a sudden you have the patient come forward basically \nsaying: I came in because of a heart attack. Why are you increasing my \npremiums and making me pay more every year to do general research that \nbenefits everybody across the world? I just want a health care plan \nthat pays for my own insurance.\n  We have to be able to determine what that additional cost of this \nmandate is, and that is very unclear today. We have to determine what \nthat is. Then we have to explain to people why that is going to result \nin increased premiums that are passed on to the individual patients. \nThat is sort of the big picture.\n  Let me go back to the Senator's question because it was a good \nquestion. Twenty years ago we didn't have many HMOs. Twenty-five years \nago, we didn't have coordinated care plans, HMOs, PPOs, provider-\nsponsored organizations. All these are new entities. It used to be that \nprivate health insurance would be able to subsidize or cross-subsidize \nsome of these clinical investigations--not a lot but some. That was at \na time where there was more room to maneuver.\n  Now, with the scarcity of the health care dollar, they have been \nsqueezed down, physicians have been squeezed down. You hear it all the \ntime. People who are in our reception room and here to lobby us all the \ntime say: We are being squeezed down. Managed care companies say: We \nare being squeezed down. Everybody recognizes that in terms of health \ncare dollars, the demand is so huge.\n  Technology allows us such a great opportunity to deliver heart \ntransplants, which I was able to do every week, or putting in heart \nvalves or hip replacements in 95-year-olds, things that we couldn't do \n30 years ago. The overall expense has caused a squeezing down on \neverybody. You hear private health insurance companies saying: No \nlonger can we subsidize; no longer can we take a little money from here \nand subsidize this research out of the goodness of our heart because we \nare squeezed so far. And thus we come in with some sort of mandate \nwhich is going to end up being in this bill, and some say performed to \nencourage and promote the private sector. We need to address it in the \npublic sector in Medicare where we haven't addressed it for the private \nsector in some way to participate in clinical trials.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. If the Senator will further yield, I understand that the \nSenator is a surgeon and has seen clinical trials and knows the benefit \nof them. I listened with respect to his arguments.\n  But in this amendment, we are simply assuring that the patients will \nget the best care. And if the best care for their particular condition \nis a clinical trial that will not only benefit themselves but the rest \nof the people with that condition as well--and NIH has paid for the \nvast majority of this. I understand from CBO that 90 percent of \ninsurance companies have been paying for clinical trials. The amendment \nensures that won't go away. We are seeing more and more HMOs look at \ntheir bottom line and that benefit is being taken away. We want to make \nsure the insurance companies continue to pay their part. Certainly, a \npatient who goes in cannot afford to pay for that clinical trial, but \nthey have been paying premiums for years. Shouldn't that be part of \nwhat they expect when they pay a premium to an HMO?\n  Mr. FRIST. I will respond, through the Chair, to my colleague that \nthe gist of her question is, shouldn't we allow what used to be done to \ncontinue to be done, and we should encourage that. The models of health \ncare are changing rapidly. I hate to look back and say that because \nsomething used to be done, it should be done today. In this case, I am \none who wants to promote the expansion of clinical trials as much as \npossible.\n  How much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes 38 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. FRIST. I yield myself 6 minutes. Please notify me when we have 30 \nseconds remaining.\n  The real issue--and the reason why I urge my colleagues to defeat \nthis amendment, as written--is the following:\n  I have explained the difference between overall cost and incremental \ncosts, and the cost of the clinical trial. Let me say that the data \npresented by Senator Harkin is good data, but it always asks for what \nthe end number is in science, how many cases the data is on. I didn't \nhear that; I didn't know how many. One of the charts was around 100, \nmaybe 130 patients. You are looking at small statistical differences. \nWe need more patients if we are going to be making policy on studies. \nThat involved very few patients.\n  We had the opportunity in committee to look at a number of studies. \nThere have been three completed studies--not ongoing but completed--all \nof which had some limitations. All three included just cancer patients, \nwhich is a very important group. We don't want to extrapolate cancer \npatients to artificial heart patients where they are putting in \nartificial hearts, cardiac valves, or stints. We have to be careful \nwith that. The overall sample and size of the studies is very small.\n  On the other hand, the charts, in essence, are right. If you get into \na clinical study, the medicine continues to be very good. Why? Because \nyou have outside people watching what every move is, making sure every \nlab test is\n\n[[Page S8438]]\n\njustified. If you are going to do a lab test, it gives you the result; \nthat is right. But there is an incremental increase in cost.\n  If you take two patients and you are studying them, you end up doing \nmore testing. The side effect of the drug might be that it lowers one's \nblood test count, so then you have to test the hemateikon more. That \nincreased cost is passed on to the patients in the private sector--not \nthrough Federal taxation going through Medicare and the subsidy coming \ndown, but it is passed on by increased premiums.\n  We have to be able to explain to the patients, for the great public \ngood, why they are having to pay more. I am saying basically that the \nscience of knowing exactly what that cost is very young; it is in \ndevelopment. We should have 100 studies, not just 3, to be able to \ncite.\n  I think it is very important for us to continue as a body to \nencourage the gathering of that information and the academic study, \ncareful study, through carefully controlled perspective trials, to \ndetermine what that cost is before we open the door broadly and pass \nthat cost on to managed care companies, which on the very next day are \ngoing to put it on the backs of everybody who is listening to me speak \ntoday; that is, the patient--the patient who may have appendicitis 30 \ndays from now, or a heart attack 60 days from now. Every day you are \ngoing to say tomorrow you are going to pay for this mandate we put on \nyour managed care company.\n  In Medicare, which insures 36 million senior citizens and individuals \nwith disabilities, we try to address it, and we are going to address \nit. But the reason we have not is we don't know what the cost will be. \nWhere you have Medicare, you have a system going bankrupt over the next \n15 years. We can't get together in this body, working with the \nPresident of the United States, to reform that in a sensible, \nmodernized way. We just can't do it. We are not going to be throwing \nnew mandates out there either--or we should not--which furthers that \nbankruptcy.\n  The question is, Where do we go from here? I think my objective is \nexactly the same as the principal sponsors of this amendment. There is \none huge, gaping door there that I am most concerned about. I think the \npopulations you have drawn from are probably appropriate, so we can get \nthe data, the information to do this right. But basically the \nindication is that qualified individuals to whom this new mandate will \napply in health care broadly--the indication is life-threatening or a \nserious illness. Now, having a category that broad in putting this \nmandate out on managed care, which is going to be passed on to \npatients--it has to be; there is nowhere else to pass it to; we are not \ntaking it out of the Federal Treasury--before we do that, shouldn't we \nget a little more information and narrow the scope so we can learn and \nnot make what could be a tragic mistake?\n  Saying that the people who are qualified is anybody who walks in and \nsays they have a life-threatening illness, or anybody who has a serious \nillness, is very dangerous. If you are a patient and have appendicitis, \nthat is a routine procedure and that is serious. Is it a life-\nthreatening illness? No, but it is serious. As I go in as a patient \nunder this new mandate, I might be able to say I want to be in a \nclinical trial.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. FRIST. Let me finish my statement. What does that actually set \ninto motion? I am not quite certain because we don't know exactly what \nthe overall expense or cost range of those trials would be. So what I \nwould like to see first would be an approach like the one of the \nSenator from Florida--to use the same overall indications but have the \nscope of a particular entity, instead of anybody who comes in and falls \ninto the category of life-threatening or a serious illness because to a \npatient every illness is serious.\n\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty seconds remain.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have 1 minute to \nask a question.\n  Mr. FRIST. The Senator would have to take it off the time of the \nbill.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional \nminute.\n  Mr. FRIST. On the time of the bill?\n  Mr. DODD. On our time, yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. My question to my colleague and good friend from Tennessee \nis this: As we have written this amendment, there are two other \nconditions. It isn't just life-threatening or serious illness. There \nhas to be no other standard, no other option available to the person \nother than the clinical trials. So that is one. And, two, there has to \nbe a limited time. For instance, it can't just be someone who has \ncancer but in certain stages of cancer.\n  So I appreciate his point that it can be pretty broad. But what we \nhave done with our amendment is say that nothing else exists out there \nto possibly treat you, No. 1; and No. 2, it has to be done in a limited \namount of time. He may want to respond to that.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes on the bill--not \non the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator's clarification of \nthat because it is important. The concept is basically that we can't \ncreate a door that is so broad that anybody can come in. If I need a \nheart transplant, is there any other therapy available? Probably not. \nDoes that automatically qualify me for arranging a clinical trial? That \ncan be dangerous. I can tell you that putting an artificial heart in \ncan cost $100,000 or $150,000. I have put in these devices before.\n  We have to be very careful because to put a $150,000 expense into a \npolicy that is translated directly down to the shoulders of patients--\nnot the patient who needs the artificial heart but somebody else--can \nbe dangerous.\n  I want us to work together. We can do that in the underlying \namendment. We may not be able to go as broadly as we all would like to \ngo until we get the appropriate information on the incremental cost and \nhow much of a burden we are placing on society.\n  Again, I think our goals are very similar. I will refuse to move as \nfar as the Senator on that concept in terms of life-threatening or \nserious illness, such as the example I just gave of the artificial \nheart, but I look forward to working with the Senator.\n  I again urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment with the \nunderstanding that the outline Senator Mack put forward as an amendment \nhits right at the principles of a mandate where we will support \nclinical trials without an undue burden on the backs of patients. That \nwill be to the benefit of all Americans.\n  I yield 30 seconds initially to my colleague from Maine so that she \nmay submit her amendment, and I yield the remainder of the time if that \nis appropriate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1241 To Amendment No. 1239\n\n             (Purpose: To enhance breast cancer treatment)\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine (Ms. Snowe), for herself, and Mr. \n     Abraham, Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Crapo, Ms. Collins, Mr. \n     Jeffords, and Mrs. Hutchison, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1241 to amendment No. 1239.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield 20 minutes, or whatever time is \nnecessary, to the Senator from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Thank you.\n  I thank Senator Frist for his leadership on obviously what is a very \nchallenging and very difficult issue.\n  I think even in spite of the debate that has occurred on some of \nthese issues where there may be apparent differences on how to approach \nthis problem, there is no disagreement on the fact that we need to \nbring much needed reform to the managed care system in America today.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to submit an amendment to the Patients' \nBill of\n\n[[Page S8439]]\n\nRights that will ensure that appropriate medical care--not a \nbureaucrat's bottom line--will dictate how long a woman stays in the \nhospital after undergoing a mastectomy.\n  This amendment that I am introducing, along with my colleague from \nMichigan, Senator Abraham, and Senators Fitzgerald, Crapo, Collins, \nJeffords, and Hutchison, is based on bipartisan legislation that I was \npleased to introduce at the beginning of this year with bipartisan \ncosponsors.\n  I have been in Congress for 20 years--10 of those years in the House \nwhen I served as cochairman of the Congressional Caucus on Women, which \naddressed issues that affected women and families in America on a \nbipartisan basis. Throughout that time, I fought long and hard to \nadvance women's health issues, women's health research, and protection \nfor patients who are facing life-threatening diagnoses of breast \ncancer.\n  I feel justified in saying that I come to this debate not only with \nstrong feelings about the issue but with a long history of involvement \nand close familiarity with the problem. It is in that light, I believe, \nthat the amendment I am submitting today, along with Senator Abraham \nand my other colleagues, is the most effective approach to address the \nissue of those individuals who are faced with breast cancer.\n  Our amendment is straightforward. First, it says that the inpatient \ncoverage with respect to the treatment of a mastectomy, regardless of \nwhether the patient's plan is regulated by ERISA or State regulations--\nin other words, all plans will be provided for a period of time--will \nbe determined by the attending physician in consultation with the \npatient as medically necessary and appropriate.\n  Second, it allows any person facing a cancer diagnosis of any type to \nget a second opinion on their course of treatment.\n  Imagine having a life-threatening disease and not having access to \nthe best possible advice. A diagnosis of breast cancer is something \nthat every woman dreads. But for an estimated 175,000 American women, \nthis is certainly the fear that they have to realize. The fact is that \none in nine women will develop this terrible disease during their \nlifetime, and for women between the ages of 35 and 54, there is no \nother disease which claims more lives.\n  So it is not hard to understand why the words, ``You have breast \ncancer,'' are some of the most frightening words in the English \nlanguage, because for the woman who hears them, everything changes from \nthat moment. No wonder the diagnosis is not only accompanied by fear \nbut also by uncertainty:\n  What will become of me?\n  What will they have to do to me?\n  What will I have to endure?\n  What is the next step?\n  For many women, the answer to that question is mastectomy or \nlumpectomy.\n  Despite the medical and scientific advances made, despite advances in \nearly detection technology, and more and more often the need for \nradical surgery, it still remains a fact of life that at the end of the \n20th century these procedures can be the most prudent options in \nattacking and eradicating cancer found in a woman's breast.\n  These are the kinds of decisions that come with the breast cancer \ndiagnosis. These are the kinds of questions women must answer. And they \nmust endure some of the most difficult and stressful circumstances \nimaginable.\n  The last question a woman should have to worry about at a time like \nthis is whether or not her health insurance plan will pay for \nappropriate care after a mastectomy. A woman diagnosed with breast \ncancer in many ways already feels she has lost control of her life. She \nshould not feel as though she has also lost control of her own \ntreatment. All too often that is exactly what happens.\n  Imagine a patient who just had one or both of her breasts removed in \nthe wake of a cancer diagnosis, and she agrees in consultation with her \nphysician that it would be best if she stayed in the hospital for \nanother day or so. Maybe it is because she still needs to learn how to \ntake care of herself. Maybe there are concerns about the possible \ncomplications, like infections or uncontrolled bleeding.\n  Let's remember that this is a very complicated surgical procedure we \nare talking about. What other reason is the decision based on than \nmedical advice from doctors who are likely involved with hundreds of \nthousands of these kinds of operations? Yet in many instances, because \nof the decisions made by accountants and insurance actuaries--none of \nwhom have ever witnessed such operations, let alone go to medical \nschool--that same woman cannot afford to follow her doctor's advice. \nShe is not covered by her plan because whoever wrote her plan already \ndecided that she didn't need inpatient care. Instead, that charge for \nthat extra day in the hospital will come out of her own pocket, and \nunless it is an awfully deep pocket, she is just as likely to take her \nchances at home. That is just plain unacceptable.\n  If we are talking about patients' rights, I can't think of a more \nappropriate place to start than right here. That is why I appreciate \nthat my Democratic colleagues raised this vital issue. As I have said, \nno one is more concerned about this issue than I am.\n  I looked carefully at the amendment and watched the debate very \nclosely. But when all was said and done on this issue, and despite the \ngood intentions of the amendment, I could not support the amendment \nthat was offered yesterday by our colleague, Senator Robb. Let me tell \nyou why.\n  The Robb amendment relied on the phrase ``generally accepted\" medical \nstandard to instruct insurance companies as to what constitutes a \n``medical necessity'' that requires coverage. What exactly does that \nmean, ``generally accepted'' medical standard? That is a good question.\n  The fact is that we are not exactly sure what it means. In fact, the \nproblem is that it means different things in different places. \nMoreover, there has never been a consensus concerning the definition of \n``medical necessity,'' though it has not been for lack of trying.\n  The most recent Federal attempt, as a matter of fact, was in 1993 \nwhen the Clinton health care working group tried and failed. But they \ndidn't give up. Instead, they decided to leave the definition of this \ncrucial term not to physicians and their patients but to a national \nadministrative board.\n\n  Perhaps that working group would have been better served if they \nlooked to 1989 when Medicare tried to define ``medical necessity'' and \nMedicare failed. Medicare failed. Why did it fail? Because terms like \n``medical necessity'' and ``appropriateness'' cannot be defined for an \nentire nation, and they certainly can't be defined by Congress.\n  The standards change with time, they change with individual patients, \nthey change depending on the illness or disease, and they should change \nbecause medicine is marching forward.\n  Likewise, trying to define ``generally accepted medical standard'' is \nlike hitting a moving target, and a low target at that. ``Generally \naccepted medical practices'' will vary tremendously among communities, \nhospitals, and even among doctors.\n  Just look at the chart behind me that was used yesterday by my \ncolleague, Senator Frist. It is a good chart because I think it \nillustrates the point on the very treatment prescribed for breast \ncancer patients. In some cases they use ``lumpectomy'' more sparingly \nthan they do ``mastectomy.'' It obviously varies across regions and \nStates.\n  Looking at the percentages using lumpectomy versus mastectomy \ntreatments, very few were performed in South Dakota; but in the \nNortheast, including parts of New York, there is a higher degree of the \nuse of lumpectomy versus mastectomy.\n  Obviously, the treatment varies. Obviously, the treatment is \ncomplicated. It is a very complicated treatment and set of options for \na woman facing a mastectomy. As the chart shows, in the United States \nof America, the treatments vary all across the land. We cannot \nprescribe the status quo; we cannot prescribe uniformity. We have to \nallow the doctors and patients to have the latitude to determine what \nis best for the individual patient. We hear over and over again that \nthe patient has choices. Let the patient have choices. This is allowing \nthe patient to have choices as to what is in her best interest.\n  This chart illustrates very graphically the differences and the \nvariations across the country in mastectomy and\n\n[[Page S8440]]\n\nlumpectomy surgeries. What is generally accepted in one area is not \ngenerally accepted or performed in another area. That is the way it \nshould be. Should we be telling a woman who can be treated with a \nsmaller, less invasive and less traumatic lumpectomy, Sorry, in your \ncommunity, the generally accepted medical standard is a mastectomy? Of \ncourse not.\n  And the reverse is true. Should a woman have a mastectomy without \nknowing that she can have a lumpectomy first, to determine whether or \nnot it is necessary to go to the more invasive surgery?\n  How can we say what is generally acceptable for a 31-year-old athlete \nin Oregon is generally acceptable for a 78-year-old grandmother in \nMaine?\n  The phrase ``generally accepted medical standard,'' far \nfrom representing the cutting edge of medicine, is nothing more than \nthe medical community status quo, a status quo that simply cannot keep \nup with the pace of medical science and new technologies.\n\n  What we are talking about in this amendment is offering the best \npractice, the best standards, the best quality care. Think how far we \nhave come in the past decade. Mastectomies were once virtually the only \noption. Today, we have a whole host of alternatives available, \ndepending on the woman's circumstance. If a mastectomy is a generally \naccepted medical standard, there are other options a woman may be \nmissing out on in making her decision.\n  The web site of NIH shows a variety of options available to a woman \nto determine for herself, with her doctors, what is best, depending on \nthe progress of her cancer. She could have a lumpectomy; she could have \na segmental mastectomy, a modified radical mastectomy, or, if \nnecessary, even a radical mastectomy.\n  The fact is, hardly a day passes when we don't hear of a promising \nnew treatment or a research breakthrough. Parties need to be able to \ntake advantage of these advancements now. They can't wait for generally \naccepted medical standards to catch up with the times. Under this \namendment, they will not have to.\n  In contrast, my amendment dictates coverage in terms of medical \nstandards. If a doctor and a patient agree on a course of treatment of \ncare and an insurance plan refuses to allow that treatment, the patient \nhas a right to appeal to an independent medical expert in that field of \nmedicine. In turn, that expert can take into account all pertinent \ninformation in determining what is medically necessary and appropriate \nbased on the relevant scientific and clinical evidence. That includes \nevidence offered by the patient and her doctor, expert consensus of \npeer review literature.\n  Not only does this put the patient first, but it also ensures we are \nnot lowering the bar of coverage by handcuffing the physicians in their \nability to employ the best strategy, the latest medical technology, \nwith respect to their specific patient. If anything, this amendment \nraises the bar precisely because the ultimate decisions will be driven \nby physicians and patients, not lawyers and regulators.\n  Let me add another point. I heard over and over again that the \nlanguage offered in the amendment yesterday was the language offered in \nmy bill and the bill offered by Senator D'Amato in the last Congress. \nLet me state for the record, the D'Amato-Feinstein-Snowe legislation \noffered in the last Congress was legislation that said it was medically \nappropriate--medically appropriate. It did not use the definition of \ngenerally acceptable medical standards and practices. The legislation \noffered by myself and Senator Feinstein uses the word ``medically \nappropriate.''\n  The point I am making is, all of the bills that have been addressed \nin recent years on the issue of breast cancer treatment and whether or \nnot the length of stay is to be determined by the doctor and patient \nhave been using the words ``medically necessary,'' ``medically \nappropriate,'' not defining ``medical necessity.'' This would be the \nfirst time we are dealing with a definition of ``medical necessity'' \nwhich heretofore has not been practiced by Medicare, by the President's \nhealth care group, when developing a health care plan, not by CHAMPUS, \nnot by the VA, not by Medicaid, not by legislation introduced on a \nbipartisan basis over the last few years.\n\n  Finally, my amendment will also include the ability to provide full \ncoverage for secondary consultations with a specialist whenever any \ntype of cancer has been diagnosed or a treatment recommended. Imagine \nbeing given a life-threatening diagnosis and not being able to get \nanother doctor's opinion. Patients cannot afford to forgo second \nopinions when it comes to cancer of any kind--from lung cancer, to \nleukemia, to breast cancer, to prostate cancer. Under this amendment, \nthey will not have to. That is important because we all know, when it \ncomes to cancer, time is of the essence and making the right decision \nin terms of treatment is paramount.\n  So often there are no second chances when it comes to taking the best \ncourse of action. Our amendment will allow the possibility of having \nthat second opinion and making sure people are getting the right \ntreatment so we can reduce senseless deaths resulting from false \ndiagnosis, empowering individuals to seek the most appropriate \ntreatment available.\n  The evidence for the need of this amendment is especially important \nwhen it comes to the so-called drive-through mastectomies. It is more \nthan just allegorical, more than symbolism. We have heard time and time \nagain antecdotal evidence that speaks for itself. Between 1986 and \n1995, the average length of stay for mastectomies dropped from about 6 \ndays to 2 to 3 days. Thousands of women across the country undergo \nradical mastectomies on an outpatient basis and are being forced out of \nhospitals before they or their doctors think is reasonable or prudent.\n  I recall the story of one woman from the State of Washington named \nLinda Schrier. Linda was a registered nurse who worked in the \npostoperative recovery room for 18 years before she underwent a \nmastectomy. Linda was doing well after the operation. The pain was \nunder control. She opted to go home instead of staying overnight. \nToday, she believes that was a big mistake. When Linda woke up at home \nthe next day without the benefit of the IV pain medication she had in \nthe hospital, she was in excrutiating pain. She also had tremendous \ndifficulty caring for her wound.\n  Keep in mind, this is someone who worked in the medical profession. \nToday, she feels, very strongly, based on her own experience as a nurse \nand as a patient, that no one should go home the day of their \nmastectomy. She also believes that no insurance company should tell a \nwoman how long her hospital stay should be. It should be up to a woman \nand her doctor.\n  I could not agree more. I know we all could not agree more. This \ndecision must be returned to physicians and their patients. All \nAmericans who face the possibility of a cancer diagnosis must be able \nto make informed decisions about the appropriate and necessary medical \ncare.\n  As we debate the Patients' Bill of Rights this week, let us not \nforget the women and men across the country who are battling cancer. \nLet's do the right thing for all of them.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I have a great deal of admiration for the \nSenator from Maine, Ms. Snowe, who, in my time with her over the last \nseveral years in the Senate, has worked long and hard on behalf of \nwomen's health issues. I appreciate she is offering an amendment that \nwe offered yesterday on this side which deals with the issue of drive-\nthrough mastectomies. The language is very similar to the language \noffered by Senator Robb from Virginia, along with myself, Senator \nMikulski, Senator Boxer, Senator Landrieu, and Senator Lincoln. It was \ndefeated on a 52-to-48 vote yesterday.\n  We would have been delighted to work with our colleagues if they \nwanted to talk with us about a word or two about which they were \nconcerned. We were not given that opportunity. The amendment was simply \ndefeated.\n  We stand very strong on this side that we need to make changes in the \nhealth care delivery system in this country so that the woman from the \nState of Washington the Senator from Maine talked about is not sent \nhome after a radical surgery, a mastectomy,\n\n[[Page S8441]]\n\nto care for herself when she is unable to do so. The doctor and the \nwoman should make the decision based on the best medical judgment, not \nbased on the bottom line from an HMO. I agree entirely with the Senator \nfrom Maine.\n  Unfortunately, because it is offered in this way, what this amendment \ndoes is it gives us a Hobson's choice regarding women who have had a \nmastectomy because this amendment wipes out the amendment by Senator \nDodd on clinical trials that we have debated for the last several hours \non this floor, where we have talked about the need for women with \nbreast cancer or ovarian cancer, or the gentleman with multiple \nsclerosis or the man with heart disease, or the young child with \ndiabetes, to have access to clinical trials so they can get the best \nmedical research possible.\n  Organizations such as the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship, \nCancer Care Incorporated, Candlelighters, Childhood Cancer Foundation, \nSusan G. Koman Breast Cancer Foundation, National Alliance of Breast \nCancer Organizations--and the list goes on--want the access to clinical \ntrials that Senator Dodd's amendment offers because those are the \nclinical trials that will assure that women, maybe, in the future, will \nnot have to have a mastectomy.\n  I agree with the Senator from Maine. We want to make sure HMOs are \nnot having drive-by mastectomies, where a woman is sent home. I commend \nher for the language of her amendment, except for the very first line, \nwhich cynically wipes out the clinical trials that Senator Dodd has \noffered.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if I may inquire of my colleague from \nMaine--I appreciate immensely what the Senator from Washington just \nsaid. It sounds to me what the Senator from Maine has offered is \nsomething with which I could certainly agree. I would add it to my \namendment. There is no reason we ought to ask people to make a choice \nbetween a proposal dealing with breast cancer and a proposal dealing \nwith clinical trials and prescription drugs.\n  So I make a request that this be added to the clinical trials \namendment so we could achieve the goals of both dealing with the \nclinical trials issue and the issue the Senator from Maine has raised.\n  If it is appropriate, I ask unanimous consent the amendment by the \nSenator from Maine be added to the underlying Dodd amendment on \nclinical trials.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am reclaiming my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Reserving the right to object, I would like to point \nout----\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, is this on my time? I do have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is to object or not object. \nIs there objection?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am extremely concerned, as I am sure my \ncolleague from Connecticut is as well, that an objection was heard and \nwe were not able to just add this language directly to the underlying \namendment on clinical trials, because what the Senator from Maine has \nnow done is forced us into a vote where we would be voting against \nclinical trials in order for women not to have drive-through \nmastectomies. That is not a choice Senators ought to be having.\n  In addition, what it says to women across this country is you have a \nchoice, a mastectomy or a clinical trial. That is not a choice we \nshould be offering.\n  I really hope our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will \nreconsider their objection to this and we can work this out. The people \nof this country are watching this debate, asking whether or not we are \ngoing to move forward and give patients the ability to have the best \ncare possible. If we can work out this amendment and add it to the \nclinical trials, we will have done the people of this country a \nservice.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of our time, and I yield.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes off the bill \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I want to explain where we are right \nnow. This monstrosity, whatever you want to call it, of a procedure \nwhich was set up by the leaders in negotiating back and forth leads us \ninto these kinds of situations. We, on the Republican side, are trying \nto end up with the best bill, and we are intending to do that. This \nprovision, which is offered by Senator Snowe, is responding, to the \nextent that we desire to do so, to the question which has been raised \nabout mastectomies.\n  If anybody would try to explain, even to our colleagues, as to this \nchart we use on the parliamentary procedure, we could spend the rest of \nthe week just talking about that. What we are doing now is taking care \nof the issue raised with respect to women's health and mastectomies. We \nhave a good provision. That is recognized by the other side. It is a \nfine position. Everybody ought to adopt it. We hope you do. I hope we \nget 100 votes on this amendment. We are going to take up and the other \nside will have an opportunity to reinstitute clinical trials at some \npoint. This is the process that has been set up. We are trying to \nimprove our bill, and by doing that we are going to make sure we have \nthe best provision possible dealing with women with breast cancer. That \nis what we are doing.\n  The fact we attached it to a provision on clinical trials is the way \nthe game is working back and forth. But we all, each of us, want to end \nup with the best possible bill for our side. Right now I point out we \nwill have an amendment on clinical trials. That will end up eventually \nbeing in our bill which will be voted on at the end. People may \ndisagree with what we end up with on clinical trials. They may have \ntheir own version. We will have a good provision. What we are trying to \ndo right now is to make sure the best possible policy is established \nfor women with breast cancer. So I hope people will try to understand \nthis somewhat convoluted process is going to confuse you all the way \nalong. You have to wait until the end to see what the final product is.\n\n  I reemphasize what the Senator from Maine said, as to what the \nRepublican bill is across the board, the whole bill. It is different \nwith respect to the protections people receive. For the first time, the \nRepublican bill will provide to this Nation a standard which is the \n``best medicine'' standard. It does away with the multiple standards \nacross this Nation, about what is generally practiced in the area. This \nwill give us the opportunity for every woman and every man to be able \nto get the advice as to what the experts, by analysis of all the \nprocesses that have been used, is the best medicine.\n  That is why this bill does a job in an area which has not been \ndiscussed much but we should concentrate on, which is AHCPR. That is \nthe acronym for the agency which has been set up to learn what all of \nthose interested in health care from the beginning of these great \ndiscussions starting in 1994 say we need to determine: How do you \ndetermine what the best results are?\n  How do you determine what the best results are? You set up a system \nwhere you can get outcomes research throughout this country, reporting \nof what was tried and what worked and what did not work.\n  As a result of that, we now will be able to help physicians across \nthis Nation, under certain circumstances when problems occur, to know, \nabout these following systems and methods, whatever was used to try to \ncure this disease or whatever, that these are the ones that worked. So \nthat individual, trying to find out what kind of care they ought to \nget, will have the ability to first appeal it internally. If the doctor \nwill say, ``I do not believe what the HMO tells me I should do is the \nbest medicine,'' they could do that review internally. If they are not \nhappy with the internal review, then they ask for an external review. \nThis external review person must be an expert in the area, an \nindependent person, one who can be relied upon to give an independent \njudgment. If that individual says, ``No we think the best care would be \nthis process which across the Nation\n\n[[Page S8442]]\n\nhas worked the best,'' then the decision can be made. If the patient \ndesires it, ``I want the one that has been best across the Nation,'' \nthey can get it. That is what we are talking about.\n  Right now we are in a convoluted process where people are going to be \nknocking amendments out with an amendment that may even be in a \ndifferent area, but in the final analysis when we get to it tomorrow \nnight, we expect to have a bill which will provide the best possible \nhealth care to all Americans. It is a little confusing.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Maine off the \nbill time.\n  Mr. REID. I am sorry, I did not understand that, Mr. President. The \nSenator is yielding 5 minutes off what?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Off the bill time. The Senator from Maine is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I thank Senator Jeffords for his comment \nand for yielding time.\n  I want to clarify a few points that were made earlier because I do \nthink it is important it does not get lost in the debate.\n  The amendment I am offering is not the amendment that was offered \nyesterday. The language is not identical. I thought I had made that \nabundantly clear. It is different from the D'Amato-Feinstein-Snowe \nlegislation passed in the last Congress. It is different from the \nSnowe-Feinstein legislation offered in this Congress. It is different \nfrom the Feinstein-Snowe legislation because medical necessity is not \ndefined, and that is the issue.\n  Secondly, the Robb amendment did not have a second opinion for cancer \npatients. That is included in this legislation.\n  This amendment is offered to the Republican legislation; that is, the \nsubstitute that was offered by the minority leader. That is the process \nthat has been developed on a bipartisan basis and on unanimous \nagreement. The Republican substitute does not have this language. The \noption was to offer this amendment at this point in time.\n  I should also make it clear the amendment that was offered yesterday \nby the Senator from Virginia was restated in the language that was \nalready included in the Democratic legislation. So it is just restating \na fact. We are in a position to offer this legislation to the \nRepublican substitute, language that has not been included in the \nRepublican substitute.\n  This is the process that has been agreed to. Therefore, that is why \nthis amendment is being offered at this time. I had hoped we could have \nworked on it yesterday, but the Robb amendment was offered to the \nDemocratic plan yesterday, and that was a second-degree amendment. We \nhad no ability to perfect that amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask my colleague----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield such time as the Senator may need.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, before my colleague from Maine sits down, I \nknow she cares about the clinical trials issue. She has one of the best \nbills on clinical trials, of which I am a supporter. What I have \noffered incorporates some of her ideas, some of Senator Mack's, and \nSenator Rockefeller's ideas with the clinical trials.\n  I also agree with what my colleague from Maine is doing on \nmastectomies, on the breast cancer issue. I am perplexed a bit. We have \na chance right now by taking the amendment of the Senator from Maine, \nof which I am supportive, and adding it to the clinical trials \namendment, and we might just do something no one expects. We might \nactually do something in a bipartisan way on the Patients' Bill of \nRights.\n  I do not understand why there is such objection to that. If we agree \nwith Senator Snowe and her amendment, if, by and large, we all agree on \nclinical trials, why does the Republican majority object to adding the \nSnowe amendment to the Dodd amendment, adopting both of them and moving \non to the next amendment?\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DODD. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. It is true, is it not, I say to my friend from Connecticut, \nyesterday we had a drive-through mastectomy provision in the Robb \namendment?\n  Mr. DODD. That is true.\n  Mr. REID. What I understand you are saying is, why don't we take \nthat, which is in keeping with the amendment of the Senator from Maine, \nand----\n  Mr. DODD. I would take the amendment of the Senator from Maine, with \nall due respect to my colleague from Virginia.\n  Mr. REID. They are basically the same.\n  Mr. DODD. We agree on the clinical trials. We can put them together \nand move on to the next issue. That is what I recommend.\n  Mr. REID. Is it not true that the Senator from Connecticut asked \nunanimous consent that the clinical trials, which are so badly needed \nand on which we understand there is agreement, be accepted with the \ndrive-through mastectomy?\n  Mr. DODD. I asked for that and objection was noted by the Republican \nmajority.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I appreciate and applaud the leadership of Senator Dodd on \nclinical trials, and I wholeheartedly agree----\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield the Senator from Maine 5 minutes on the \namendment.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the Senator. It does obviously represent the \nlegislation that I introduced on this issue. I appreciate the Senator's \nforceful advocacy. Obviously, the issue is concerning scope at this \npoint in time. I might agree with him on what he is attempting to do, \nbut obviously there is a big difference in our legislative approaches \nwith respect to scope. There are differences. Perhaps that ultimately \ncan be worked out on the whole issue of clinical trials, and I hope it \nis. I believe it is that important. We were left in the position, given \nthe scenario that has been developed on both sides, because I think \nthis is so important, of having to offer it at this point in time or I \nlost the opportunity. We think it is important to add this language to \nthe Republican substitute. We lost an opportunity yesterday, to be \nhonest with you, with the amendment that was offered to the Democrat's \nplan. We are left in this parliamentary process at this point in time.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield, I gather it is not just her \nvoice but obviously other voices here--the leadership. May I interpret \nthat to mean that if I were to offer my clinical trials amendment as a \nfreestanding proposal, I would then have her support of that proposal \nso we are not asking ourselves to make a choice between two items we \nlike, and instead of adding one to another, we are substituting one for \nanother; therefore, being put in a terrible parliamentary situation, \nunnecessarily, in my view. I am fearful if I offer my clinical trials \namendment freestanding as to whether or not I will be able to have the \nSenator's support on that, maybe even as a cosponsor.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I will look at the language. I would certainly want to \nsupport it. I know it does not include FDA-sponsored trials. I cannot \nspeak for everybody in this conference or in this Senate, but certainly \nit is something I could support and obviously do support, given the \nlegislation I have introduced in this Congress. I will be more than \nhappy to do that.\n  At this point, we have to address the issue of mastectomies. It is \nthat important to this legislation. We lost an opportunity to improve \nupon the Robb amendment, because that was a second-degree amendment \noffered yesterday, and, obviously, that created another Hobson's \nchoice.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). Who yields time?\n  Mr. DODD. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield the time necessary for the parliamentary \ninquiry.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, am I allowed to withdraw my amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would take unanimous consent.\n  Mr. DODD. To withdraw my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, will the Senator from Maine yield for a \nquestion with respect to the process?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Do I still have the time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yielded the Senator from Maine 5 \nminutes.\n\n[[Page S8443]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ROBB. I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senator from Maine.\n  Yesterday, when we were debating the amendment I had the privilege of \noffering on behalf of myself and Senators Murray, Mikulski, Boxer, and \nothers, we had no one from the other side of the aisle here to debate \nor discuss that during the entire period we were discussing that \nparticular amendment. In a few minutes I am going to address the merits \nof what was said, but nothing was said, no engagement on the merits of \nthe amendment that we offered was offered by anyone from the other side \nof the aisle. Was there a decision not to engage this side? Does the \nSenator know how to respond to that?\n  Ms. SNOWE. I was not aware of that. I was certainly not aware what \nwas taking place on the floor. We were aware the Senator from Virginia \nwas offering an amendment. I was aware, in fact, he was offering an \namendment, but there was no strategy on this side to suggest we would \nnot engage in that debate. I think there was some discussion on this \nside about the debate. I do not see that is a valid objection at all.\n  Mr. ROBB. I am only responding to the concern there was not adequate \ntime for discussion. We were actively seeking engagement on this \nquestion, and it did not occur. I look forward to talking about the \nmerits on my own time.\n\n  I thank you and I yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I still have some remaining time.\n  I would like to make a point. I think the point is, there are \nsubstantial differences between the legislation offered by the Senator \nfrom Virginia yesterday and the legislation we are offering in this \namendment. We are not defining ``medical necessity.'' As I indicated \npreviously, there has been no other legislation on this issue that \ndefines ``medical necessity,'' legislation that has been introduced on \na bipartisan basis over the last few years.\n  That is going to take away from women the variety of treatments and \nprescriptions for breast cancer, as you can see what is illustrated on \nthis chart. I think we ought to opt for the best treatment, the best \npractice, the best standard, and the best principles. No one else, no \nprofessional, no government agency, no private association with medical \ncredentials has defined ``medical necessity'' because you can't.\n  Leave it up to the doctor and the patient. That is what we are asking \nwith respect to women who have breast cancer. That is a huge difference \nbetween this amendment and the one that was offered yesterday. By the \nway, the language offered yesterday was already included in the \nminority's plan, so it did not have to be restated. I think we could \nhave worked something out that we could have agreed to on a bipartisan \nbasis, as we already have in legislation that has been introduced on \nthis very issue.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized for 7 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the Senator from Vermont. I think I will be \nfinished in that time frame.\n  Mr. President, I would like to speak to the Snowe amendment \nsubstantively at this point. As I have a number of times over the past \nfew years, I rise to join her in sponsoring an amendment to address the \nincidence of breast cancer in this Nation.\n\n  This year alone, 180,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer. \nYet, in this Nation of vast medical resources a number of those women \nare being denied the best health care available. It is time we did \nsomething about it.\n  I have made increasing awareness and funding for breast cancer \nresearch a central part of my agenda since coming to the US Senate.\n  That is why I have fully supported the efforts of Breast Cancer \nAwareness Month, the Race for the Cure, and WeCan. This last \norganization, which stands for ``We Encourage Cancer Awareness \nNetwork,'' brings together people we are interested in cancer control \nand prevention in Michigan, with a focus on breast and cervical cancer.\n  Awarness is important. Breast cancer survival rates are much higher \nwhen the disease is diagnosed early.\n  That is why I have participated in a number of campaigns aimed at \nencouraging women to have regular mammograms. It also is why I fought \nthe National Cancer Institute's short-lived recommendation against all \nwomen in their forties getting mammograms.\n  As I said, awareness is critical. But it is not enough. Research also \nis desperately needed to fight this deadly disease. That is why I have \nsupported Defense Department research in this area and cosponsored an \namendment to the Treasury-General Government appropriations bill in \n1997 to authorize creation of a new stamp to fund breast cancer \nresearch.\n  Like awareness, research is critical. And like awareness, research is \nnot enough. Women must be empowered to make the best use possible of \nexisting research and technologies in fighting breast cancer. And that \nmeans putting health care decisions in the hands of patients and their \ndoctors.\n  The Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act, which my colleague and I \nare offering as an amendment to the underlying bill, would empower \nwomen; it would help them take charge of their own medical care during \nthe time of crisis surrounding a breast cancer diagnosis.\n  Our amendment would require all--and I mean every--group health plan \nto cover inpatient care following a mastectomy, lumpectomy, or lymph \nnode dissection for the treatment of breast cancer.\n  The length of stay would be determined by the physician, in \nconsultation with the patient, and would be based solely on what is \nnecessary and appropriate for that patient.\n  There would be no minimum stay required, and outpatient treatment \nwould also be covered if the patient and her doctor agree that that is \nthe best course.\n  Under current law, insurers may have guidelines recommending that \nmastectomies be performed on an outpatient basis. But a mastectomy is, \nin fact, a complicated surgical procedure, one from which significant \ncomplications can arise.\n  Under these circumstances, sending a woman home immediately after a \nmastectomy may not be the right thing to do. The woman may not have the \ninformation she needs, or even the care she needs during this critical \ntime.\n  We must see to it that doctors are not pressured by health plans to \nrelease mastectomy patients before it is medically appropriate.\n  Women suffer immense emotional trauma from mastectomies. They also \nsuffer from scarring and may suffer from significant and even dangerous \ncomplications hours after surgery.\n  It simply is not appropriate, then, to have anyone other than the \npatient and her physician deciding when it is safe and proper for her \nto go home.\n  Our amendment does just that. It allows patients and their physicians \nto make the critical, life-changing decisions concerning how to treat \nbreast cancer.\n  In addition to these provisions, our amendment would help patients \ndiagnosed with cancers of all kinds by empowering them to seek second \nopinions.\n  Under the language of this amendment, patients diagnosed with any \nform of cancer by their primary care physician would be able to get a \nsecondary consultation with a specialist. Group health plans would be \nrequired to include coverage for these visits.\n  Even if the specialist finds no cancer, the health plan would be \nrequired to cover that visit. And members of HMOs will still be covered \nif they go outside the HMO for their secondary consultation.\n  These provisions will defend a patient's right to a second opinion in \naddressing a cancer diagnosis. In a nation with the vast health care \nresources of our country, there simply is no excuse for not allowing \npatients to seek an independent second opinion when dealing with a \ncancer diagnosis.\n  This amendment would place these key health care decisions in the \nhands of patients and their physicians. It will put the priority back \non patient care, where it belongs. It is an important element of our \nongoing fight against cancer, and breast cancer in particular.\n  I urge my colleagues to lend their support for this important \namendment.\n\n[[Page S8444]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would like to yield myself 3 minutes.\n  Could I have the attention of the Senator from Michigan just for a \nmoment?\n  I notice on page 3 of the amendment, talking about ``Inpatient \nCare,'' under the title ``In General'' it states:\n\n       . . . the treatment of breast cancer is provided for a \n     period of time as is determined by the attending physician, \n     in consultation with the patient, to be medically necessary \n     and appropriate. . . .\n\n  This is going to be universal. Why does the Senator from Michigan \nthink we should protect a woman who has breast cancer and needs a \nmastectomy but not provide the same protection for a woman who has \novarian cancer and needs a hysterectomy. Why shouldn't we provide the \nsame protection for someone who has brain cancer? Why do you believe \nthis should be applicable to all HMO members--that a decision should be \nmade by the doctor and the patient, using the best health guidelines--\nbut not provide the same protections for these other diseases? What is \nthe justification for this different treatment? Our bill does provide \nthose protections.\n  These are in the findings, on page 3, under the ``Inpatient Care,'' \n``In General.'' You provide:\n\n       . . . is determined by the attending physician, in \n     consultation with the patient, to be medically necessary and \n     appropriate. . . .\n\n  You do it for a mastectomy, a lumpectomy, and for a lymph node. Why \ndo it universally for all HMOs for these three procedures yet not \nprovide the same protection for women with ovarian cancer, brain \ncancer, or other illnesses? That is what we would like to know. Because \nour bill would provide protection for all of these illnesses; yours for \njust one. What is possibly the rationale and justification for that?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I will answer with respect to this--would \nit be on your time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Obviously, a number of people have worked in this area \nof breast cancer treatment. I believe Senator Snowe, who has been the \nforemost leader on this in the Senate on working on this issue, will \nprobably comment on this as well. We are attempting to work on getting \nlegislation which she has spearheaded in the Senate into this bill.\n  I have no idea what other Senators may come to this floor with, with \nregard to other forms of cancer or other types of diseases or other \ntypes of treatment. They may well come here with such areas that are \nspecialty areas and offer similar amendments. I would defer to them to \ndo that. This is an area we are working on which we think, in fact, is \njustified in this respect and which is consistent with last year's \namendment on reconstructive surgery.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 3 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 more minutes.\n  It isn't a question of the particular process or procedure. The \namendment says ``as determined by the attending physician, in \nconsultation with the patient, to be medically necessary.'' Why not use \nthat standard on any of the other kinds of health care needs? Why apply \nthis standard nationwide on the question of mastectomy and not provide \nit for protection of other areas health needs?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Which standard is that?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As is determined by the attending physician, in \nconsultation with the patient, to be medically necessary and \nappropriate following a mastectomy, lumpectomy, or a lymph node \ndissection.\n  I am asking you, why can't you use that same protection: by the \nattending physician, in consultation with the patient, to be medically \nnecessary, leaving it up to the doctor? That is what you do for these \nthree procedures. You leave it up to the doctor.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Perhaps the Senator could direct the question to \nsomebody who voted on the other side of that issue yesterday.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is what I am asking.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I voted yesterday, when we had the issue of medical \nnecessity.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Does the Senator agree----\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. That is how I voted yesterday. So perhaps the Senator \nshould ask somebody who voted against it yesterday.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Good. So if I understand--the Senator can obviously \nanswer any way he wants to--you believe that decisions with regard to \nhealth care ought to be decided by the doctors and their patients?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. That is how I voted yesterday.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. When we came to the scope amendment, would you agree \nthen that we ought to apply whatever we are going to do with the 48 \nmillion self-insured to the other \\2/3\\ of Americans left out under the \nRepublican plan?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. In general principle, I believe that these areas in \nwhich the Federal Government has not chosen to oversee, where the scope \nhas already been provided to States to address--in my State, very \naggressively--that we shouldn't preempt the significant progress that \nhas been made in Michigan. I don't want to come to the floor to wipe \nout what I consider to be very effective patients' rights laws that my \nState has passed, which a scope amendment that would cover every single \nplan in every setting would have done in my State. There may be Members \nwho have States that are in various ways deficient and ineffective. \nThey may want to supersede what they have done. But this Senator chose \nnot to, at least with respect to my State.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 2 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 15 seconds.\n  There isn't a single State in the country that has that kind of \nprotection. I know my friend from Vermont keeps insisting the State of \nVermont does. We will give him that. But there isn't a single other \nState, if Vermont complies with those kinds of protections.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I feel really bad about what is happening here. Every \nsingle amendment, the people lose and the HMOs win.\n  There is a cruel irony in the Snowe amendment, which the Senator from \nConnecticut tried to repair and could not. Let me tell my colleagues \nabout the cruel irony of the Snowe amendment.\n  That amendment treats women who need mastectomies with dignity, and I \nam for that. That is why I supported the Robb amendment yesterday, and \nthat is why I agree with the Snowe amendment. But let me tell my \ncolleagues what else the Senator from Maine does that makes this a real \ncruel irony. At the same time she gives dignity to women who have to \nundergo mastectomies and gives them bed care, she strikes the Dodd \namendment which would allow those same women to choose another option \nother than mastectomy by getting into a clinical trial.\n  To explain that specifically, I have a dear friend who I have known \nfor many years. She was diagnosed with breast cancer. The doctor said: \nYou have three alternatives: One, you can get into a clinical trial on \ntamoxifen; two, you can get into a clinical trial on a new drug called \nreluxifen; three, you can have a double mastectomy. My friend wanted to \navoid the mastectomy. She is doing everything she can to get into a \nclinical trial, and she is reaching obstacle after obstacle after \nobstacle.\n  The Dodd amendment says, if someone is in need of a different type of \ntherapy--and it is very tightly drawn--they have a right to get into \nthat therapy.\n  What the Snowe amendment says to women is: Yes, my dear, if you need \na mastectomy, we will treat you fairly. That is good. But, no, my dear, \nwe cannot guarantee you the right to get into a clinical trial to avoid \nthat amputation, as my friend from Maryland called it yesterday.\n  That is just one example, a personal example of someone I know. There \nis no reason we can't get around the parliamentary hurdles. We are good \nat\n\n[[Page S8445]]\n\nthat. We know how to do it. As a matter of fact, I am going to make a \nunanimous consent request at the end of my remarks, I alert the Senator \nfrom Vermont, to solve our problem and to put the two together, the \nSnowe amendment and the Dodd amendment.\n  The Dodd amendment ensures that if your doctor says you need a \ncertain type of drug to solve your health problem, your HMO cannot keep \nthat prescription drug away from you by claiming it is not in their \nformula.\n  Here we have the Snowe amendment, which takes a giant step forward in \nthe treatment of women with mastectomies but, at the same time, strikes \nthe opportunity for women to get into clinical trials to get the drugs \nthey need that are necessary to give them their health. This is a sad \nday.\n  What is the response from the Senator from Maine? Gee, I am sorry \nabout this; it is parliamentary.\n  I am very sad. I have never seen the Senate be as partisan as it is \non this issue. This is a sad, sad day. What happened to the days of \nKennedy-Kassebaum? It wasn't that long ago that we worked together when \nwe could agree. I think the American people are the losers, and women \nare the losers.\n  Yesterday, we had a situation on this floor--I have handed out on \neach desk an example of this--where Senator Robb offered an amendment. \nSenator Robb said that OB/GYNs want the right to be primary care \nproviders. Senator Frist stands up and says: They don't want to be \nprimary care providers. He quoted a particular doctor and said this \ndoctor, an OB/GYN, doesn't want to be a primary care provider.\n  That was false. That was false. I have the proof right on your desk. \nThis doctor says:\n\n       Senator Frist's misuse of my statement in support of \n     his position that OB/GYNs could not act as primary care \n     physicians . . . is, to say the least, misleading and does \n     an injustice to the true intent of my statements.\n\n  He supports OB/GYNs being designated as primary care providers.\n  Then a letter from the organization that says it is imperative that \ndoctors who are OB/GYNs be primary care providers.\n  Let's stop the misstatements, and let's put together the Dodd \namendment and the Snowe amendment.\n  As a matter of fact, I ask unanimous consent that S. 1344 and the \nDaschle substitute amendment be modified with language from the Snowe \namendment No. 1241 prohibiting drive-by mastectomies and requiring \ncoverage for second opinions, and this will keep the clinical trials \nand the drive-by mastectomies provision.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 20 seconds.\n  Under the Senate rules generally, as the Senator from California \nknows, if we were not forced into this agreement, the Senator from \nConnecticut could modify his amendment to include that. We have tried \nto get this legislation to the floor so that we could follow the \nhistoric rules of the Senate and were precluded from that, basically \nforced into this time element, voting Thursday evening. But we are \ngetting very close to the point where we will not have the opportunity \nfor having a full airing of these issues. We are getting very close to \nwhere some of us will believe that there has not been the full, \ncomplete fulfillment of the agreement. These issues may very well be \nleft outstanding for future considerations.\n\n  We are getting very close to the point, Mr. President, where you have \nsuch a basic corruption of the rules. By denying what has historically \nbeen the rule--that would have permitted a Senator to modify an \namendment prior to the time they get the yeas and nays--we are close to \nhaving a basic corruption of the rules. We had an agreement, and we are \nsticking with that agreement. Nonetheless, it will delay the Senate and \nfrustrate, obviously, the opportunity for the good debate.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, we are at a fork in the road today. We \nare at a fork in the road to show whether we really are engaged in a \ndebate over partisan politics or whether we are engaged in a debate \nover how we can best help patients in the United States of America.\n  I urge my colleagues, in the situation we now find ourselves, to put \npartisan politics aside and reach out to what is in the best interests \nof patients, what is in the best interests of the people of the United \nStates of America. That is why I think the suggestion of taking the \nSnowe amendment and attaching it to the Dodd amendment would show the \nAmerican people that in this debate, at this time, at this moment, we \nare willing to put patients above politics. That is what I hope we can \ndo.\n  There is much to be commended in the Snowe amendment. It is a very \ngood amendment. I congratulate the Senator from Maine on this \namendment. I would so like to support it. Unfortunately, it knocks out \nthe Dodd amendment providing patients with access to clinical trials.\n  The Senator from Maine has had a longstanding reputation of really \nbeing an advocate for providing access to clinical trials. I recall \nwith great fondness our battles, going back to the days in the House of \nRepresentatives, when she and Congresswoman Schroeder cochaired the \nwomen's caucus. We fought to get women included in the clinical trials \nat NIH. The Senator from Maine and all others will recall when we were \nsystematically excluded. We worked together on a bipartisan basis when \nshe came to the Senate. Working with her, Congresswoman Morella, and \nCongresswoman Schroeder, we were able to literally call NIH's bluff on \ntheir shallow and unscientific reasons for not including women in \nclinical trials.\n  When President Bush appointed Bernadine Healy as head of NIH, Senator \nKennedy and I worked to establish the Office of Women's Health at NIH, \nand now women are included in the clinical trials. What a hollow \nvictory it will be today if we deny them the access to the very \nclinical trials we fought so hard to open up for women.\n  I am sorry we have come to this. At this fork in the road, let's not \nmake another fork in the road over partisan politics. We can show the \nAmerican people that we really want to be concerned about patients. We \nhave done it before. We have done it with the people in this room. Some \nof the greatest pleasures and joys of my life have been working on a \nbipartisan basis, opening up clinical trials and establishing quality \nstandards for mammograms.\n  So I am going to offer one more opportunity, and I plead with my \ncolleagues to allow this to happen. I want to have the Snowe amendment \nattached to the Dodd amendment.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that S. 1344, the Daschle \nsubstitute amendment, be modified with language from the Snowe \namendment, No. 1241, prohibiting drive-through mastectomies and \nrequiring coverage for second opinions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nTexas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I have to take exception to the comments \nthat Senator Kennedy made. I am not trying to get into an argument, but \nas anyone who has followed this debate knows, for 2 years we have \noffered the Democrats the ability to bring up their bill. Then we would \nbring up our bill and let the Senate choose. The Democrats dictated the \nformat we are debating under, and they would not allow us to pass an \nappropriations bill until they got exactly the procedure they have \ntoday. Now that they have exactly the procedure that they dictated by \nholding the Senate up, they are unhappy with the procedure.\n  Might I also say, with all of these cries of partisanship, not one \nDemocrat voted for any amendment offered by any Republican yesterday or \nMonday. Now, I don't understand bipartisanship as existing when \nRepublicans vote to let the Government take over the health care system \nand to bring lawyers into the system rather than doctors but it is \nsomehow not bipartisan when Democrats refuse to vote for our proposals. \nYou can't have it both ways.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will use 30 seconds, Mr. President. The Senator had \nbetter get his facts straight. We have just offered to accept the \namendment of the\n\n[[Page S8446]]\n\nSenator from Maine. Yesterday the Democratic leader offered to accept \nthe Nickles amendment on deductibility. So the Senator is fundamentally \nand actually wrong.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, my heart is heavy because, as I \nbelieve the Senator from Vermont knows, I was the lead Democratic \nsponsor of the D'Amato bill on mastectomy and cancer rights in the last \nCongress. Then Senator Snowe became the lead Republican author on it \nwhen Senator D'Amato left the Senate and I am the lead Democratic \nsponsor in this Congress. So I feel very strongly about this bill and \nthe amendment before us.\n  But what I see in the tactics being used is of very deep concern to \nme. Yesterday, we saw the Frist language on medical necessity \nessentially wiping out the Democratic language requiring that medical \nnecessity be based on generally accepted principles of medicine. Our \namendment would have covered a hospital stay for mastectomy as well any \nother hospital stay, by simply giving the physician the responsibility \nto make the call on how long a patient should stay in the hospital.\n  Now we have these individual cases like hospitalization for \nmastectomy. It is a very strong case that the Senator from Vermont \nmakes. I myself saw, in 1996, where a major HMO in California was doing \na same-day mastectomy and women who had surgery at 7:30 in the morning \nwere being pushed out on the street in the afternoon, not recovered \nfrom anesthetic, with drains in their body, not knowing where they were \nor how to care for themselves. That simply is not the good practice of \nmedicine.\n  So I think all of us have resolved that we want to do something about \nthis situation. But at the same time, you give us a Hobson's choice, \nand that is unfortunate because Senator Dodd's amendment, requiring \nplans to cover the routine costs of clinical trials, is a good \namendment.\n  I am the vice chairman of a national cancer dialogue initiated by the \nAmerican Cancer Society. President George Bush is the chairman. Not too \nlong ago I had the pleasure of spending the day with President Bush on \none side of me and Mrs. Bush on the other while I chaired a meeting of \nthe cancer dialogue. One of the outstanding results of that particular \nday was strong support for more access to clinical research trials. The \nentire clinical trial research effort is not going to be successful \nunless there is more access to these trials, and particularly by the \nminority population where participation is very small, largely because \nmanaged care plans do not cover the non-research, routine costs of \ncare.\n  Therefore, Senator Dodd's amendment is timely, it is necessary, it is \nscientifically correct, it will help us speed these trials, add more \ntrials, and it will mean a quicker cures for diseases if we pass the \nDodd amendment.\n  The Hobson's choice, for those of us who have worked on this now for \nover 3 years, is that by voting for Senator Snowe's amendment, we \nnegate the Dodd amendment. That is not right. It is not good medicine. \nIt is not good politics.\n  I, too, join in complimenting my colleague and friend from California \nand the Senator from Maryland, both of whom spoke eloquently on this. \nPlease, please, please don't do this.\n  Senator Dodd asked that his amendment be modified to include the \nSnowe amendment in his amendment. Twice I heard the Senator from \nCalifornia and the Senator from Maryland propound a unanimous consent \nrequest. I am also going to do the same thing. Don't present this body \nwith this kind of Hobson's choice. Both amendments are necessary. Don't \nwipe out the clinical trials coverage amendment while attempting to put \nin patient protections for cancer patients. The American public \ndeserves to be able to participate in clinical trials which, after all, \ncould save your life, save the lives of the women of America, and men, \nbecause breast cancer affects men too. My father-in-law died of breast \ncancer when my husband was 10 years old.\n  Please, don't do this.\n  I, too, propound a unanimous consent request. I ask unanimous consent \nthat S. 1344, the Daschle substitute, be modified with language from \nthe Snowe amendment No. 1241 prohibiting drive-through mastectomies and \ncoverage for second opinions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. FRIST. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Tennessee 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, very briefly--I will not take 5 minutes--a \nnumber of issues have been discussed. Let me comment on a couple of \nissues.\n  The first has to do with some statements made by my colleague from \nCalifornia about obstetricians and primary care specialists; second, \nabout clinical trials; and, third, scope.\n  I know my colleague from Texas has been waiting. I will conclude my \nremarks in 2 minutes, and then, hopefully, we can turn to her.\n  No. 1, do obstetricians want to be designated by their managed care \ncompanies to be primary care physicians? It sounds as if they do.\n  I have to say that if you are a primary care physician--that means if \nyou are responsible for that managed care company, insurance, group, \nplan, or HMO--you are responsible really to become the gatekeeper. That \nmeans you have a specialist, obstetrician or gynecologist, who wants to \nbe able to take care of the woman as a whole but doesn't necessarily \nwant to take care of her ingrown toenails, appendicitis, headaches, or \nlaryngitis.\n  That is the danger. It sounds good to say the OB/GYN is the primary \ncare specialist for the patient. They are the primary care physician, \nthe gatekeeper. That means the OB/GYN is going to be doing things that \nthey are simply not trained nor want to do.\n  What women want in this country is to at any time be able to go to \ntheir obstetrician or gynecologist, whether it is an emergency or not, \nfor routine care. That is what our bill does. That is what the American \npeople want--to remove the barriers that exist today.\n  Yes, we need legislation. That is what our bill does. It drops that \nbarrier so at any time a woman can go to, and be taken care of by, \ntheir obstetrician and gynecologist. It is in our bill.\n  The designation of ``primary specialist'' sounds benign. In truth, \nthey are dangerous to the system. Obstetricians as a group may want it, \nand some may not.\n  I quote on behalf of 100 patients and provider groups, The Patient \nAccess Coalition. They talk about these specialist amendments. They \nwrite to us very specifically:\n\n       We do, however, wish to express concern about specialists \n     being defined as primary-care providers.\n\n  It is very important that people do not come in and legislate and \nmake them primary care providers. We want to remove the barriers to \naccess to specialists. That is what we do.\n  No. 2, clinical trials. Again and again, the Dodd bill has some very \ngood points in it. We are for clinical trials. We believe clinical \ntrials should be part of the system, and I have spent most of the \nmorning talking about that. But we don't know the overall cost. Before \nwe know that cost, a managed care company is going to take care of that \nmandate from here, and they will put it on sick people who are getting \nsick and paying the tax. We don't have any idea what it is.\n  The amendment that will be offered tomorrow by Senator Mack looks at \nthe cost issues. It has a mandate to cover clinical trials in an \nappropriate setting and in an appropriate way, but not in an \nirresponsible way.\n  We remove the Dodd language. We take what is very good in his \namendment, and we will build on it and have a better amendment for the \nAmerican people.\n  On the issue of scope in the underlying amendment about breast \ndisease and cancer, the reason this scope is different from the other \nthings is, they wanted to make this particular amendment consistent \nwith the D'Amato approach from last year that had this with mastectomy \nand reconstruction of a breast--a procedure. What we did--and what was \ndone by the Senator from Maine--was very specifically match that scope \nfor this type of disease in a way that is consistent. That is why\n\n[[Page S8447]]\n\nthat scope is different. They are exactly right. There is some \ndifference there.\n  Those are the three points I wanted to make on that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a question on my time?\n  Mr. FRIST. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Last year the Republican proposal had this measure. Most \nof us who followed the Patients' Bill of Rights understood the reason \nfor this measure. It was to get the Senator from New York, who felt so \nstrongly about this provision, to support the overall Patients' Bill of \nRights. When the Republicans introduced their bill this year, the \nprovision was kept out. Now they are trying to put the provision back \nin.\n  Mr. FRIST. Does the Senator have a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am asking, is that not correct?\n  Mr. FRIST. That is incorrect.\n  Does the Senator have another question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. No.\n  Mr. FRIST. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will take 1 minute.\n  The fact is, that is exactly what happened. That is exactly what \nhappened. I will put in the Record within the next hour this bill that \nshowed that they took the provision out of this year's bill. I will put \nin the Record the bill that had the provision, and then the bill that \ntook out the provision. Now the Republicans are trying to put the \nprovision back in again after they voted against the Robb amendment. \nThey now have the willingness of the principal sponsor of the amendment \nto accept it.\n  Who is playing games around here?\n  Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ROBB. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my distinguished \ncolleague from Massachusetts.\n  I am pleased that the Senator from Tennessee is on the floor.\n  First, let me observe that I see a disturbing trend as we consider \nthe basic proposal to grant patients' rights, however defined. Every \ntime we have a Democratic amendment, we find some small objection to \nit, technical or otherwise, causing everyone on the other side to have \nto vote against it with the promise that tomorrow we will resubmit it \nwith a word or two changed so it will be acceptable to our side.\n  If my observation is incorrect, I look forward to being corrected.\n  Yesterday the Senator from Tennessee, Senator Frist, took the floor \nto say that he supported 98 percent of the amendment I offered on \nbehalf of myself and Senators Murray, Mikulski, Boxer, and others, but \nhe had just a couple of objections to it. He stated that the problems \nwith our amendment were such that he had to urge all Members to vote \nagainst it and it could only be fixed with the alternative that Senator \nSnowe and Senator Abraham would cover today.\n  At the time my friend from Tennessee was speaking, I asked if he \nwould yield for a question. He declined to do so. That is, of course, \nhis right. But since my friend from Tennessee would not yield during \nyesterday's debate for a question on his claims, I want to take just a \nminute to correct the Record.\n  First of all, Senator Frist said he had spoken with the chairman of \nthe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' Primary Care \nCommittee, Dr. Robert Yelverton. My colleague said Dr. Yelverton told \nhim that OB/GYNs would not qualify as primary care physicians. A number \nof OB/GYNs took exception to the claim of the Senator from Tennessee \nthat Dr. Yelverton told him OB/GYNs are unqualified, including Dr. \nYelverton.\n  I received a fax this morning from Dr. Yelverton which clarified \nthese comments for me and for our colleagues. Let me read part of what \nhe said.\n  He said:\n\n       I have never spoken directly to Senator Bill Frist (R-TN) \n     or any member of his staff on the subject of OB/GYNs as \n     primary care physicians or on any other subject. The quote \n     that Senator Frist attributed to me on the floor of the \n     Senate today came from an article in the June 13, 1999, \n     edition of the New York Times.)\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Senator Frist's misuse of my statement in support of his \n     position that OB/GYNs could not act as primary care \n     physicians because of the ``high standards'' that managed \n     care organizations set for primary care physicians, is \n     regrettably misleading to say the least, and does an \n     injustice to the true intent of my statements.\n\n  Again, I am quoting Dr. Yelverton. He went on to say:\n\n       I personally supported then and I support now the amendment \n     sponsored by ACOG to allow OB/GYNs to act as primary care \n     physicians and to allow direct access for women's healthcare \n     and did, in fact, spend a portion of this very afternoon e-\n     mailing my senators and encouraging them to vote in support \n     of the amendment.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the doctor's letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n     To Lucia DiVenere, ACOG Government Relations.\n     From Robert W. Yelverton, M.D., Chairman, Primary Care \n         Committee.\n       I received your fax tonight and offer the following in \n     response.\n       I have never spoken directly to Senator Bill Frist (R-TN) \n     or any member of his staff on the subject of OB/GYNs as \n     primary care physicians or on any other subject. The quote \n     that Senator Frist attributed to me on the floor of the \n     Senate today came from an article in the June 13, 1999, \n     edition of the New York Times. The article may be viewed on \n     the New York Times website (go to www.nytimes.com, then click \n     on Health and Science). I was contacted by the article's \n     author, Larry Katzenstein, and asked to comment on the impact \n     of managed care on women's healthcare in this country. In my \n     interview with Mr. Katzenstein, I discussed ``barriers'' that \n     managed care organizations have raised against the efforts of \n     OB/GYNs to become primary care physicians. The quote \n     attributed to me by Senator Frist was from a non-quote in \n     this article. I told Mr. Katzenstein that some managed care \n     organizations have placed barriers consisting of such \n     stringent (not ``high'' as Senator Frist stated) standards \n     for their qualifications as primary care physicians that most \n     OB/GYNs would not be able to meet them without further \n     training.\n       One objective of my comments was to demonstrate that the \n     College's interests were to allow OB/GYNs to provide women's \n     healthcare to their patients unimpeded by the cumbersome \n     requirements of managed care referral systems. Mr. \n     Katzenstein's article did not emphasize to the degree it \n     should have that these were barriers to OB/GYNs being \n     designated primary care physicians--not ``high standards''--\n     as has been discussed repeatedly in meetings of the Primary \n     Care Committee. I went on to say to Mr. Katzenstein that the \n     qualification requirements that some managed care \n     organizations impose on OB/GYNs in certain instances exceed \n     even those required of family physicians. He chose not to \n     include that statement in his article.\n       Senator Frist's misuse of my statement in support of his \n     position that OB/GYNs could not act as primary care \n     physicians because of the ``high standards'' that managed \n     care organizations set for primary care physicians, is \n     regrettably misleading, to say the least, and does an \n     injustice to the true intent of my statements.\n       I personally supported then and I support now the amendment \n     sponsored by ACOG to allow OB/GYNs to act as primary care \n     physicians and to allow direct access for women's healthcare \n     and did, in fact, spend a portion of this very afternoon e-\n     mailing my senators and encouraging them to vote in support \n     of the amendment.\n       Please contact me at (813) 269-7752 after 9:00 a.m. \n     tomorrow (Wednesday). I will be glad to discuss this matter \n     with you at that time and will support any effort that you \n     want to undertake to clarify this issue now on the floor of \n     the Senate.\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, the same doctor my colleague quoted said the \nRepublican arguments against our amendment are off base. Contrary to \nthe comments of the Senator from Tennessee yesterday, the American \nCollege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists endorses our amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed their letter on this issue.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 12, 1999.\n     Hon. Charles S. Robb,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Robb: On behalf of the American College of \n     Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), an organization \n     representing 40,000 physicians dedicated to improving the \n     health care of women, I am pleased to offer ACOG's strong \n     endorsement of the Robb-Murray Amendment to be offered during \n     Senate consideration of managed care reform legislation this \n     week. This amendment assures women access to obstetrician-\n     gynecologists and the critical services they provide.\n\n[[Page S8448]]\n\n       The Robb-Murray amendment allows women access to their ob-\n     gyns in two important ways. First, it allows women to select \n     a participating obstetrician-gynecologist as her primary care \n     physician. Second, if a woman chooses a primary care \n     physician of another speciality, this amendment allows her to \n     have direct access to her ob-gyn provider without having to \n     secure prior authorization or a referral from her primary \n     care physician.\n       It is imperative that women's direct access to their ob-\n     gyns not be limited by Congress' failure to classify ob-gyns \n     as primary care physicians. Ob-gyns are often the only \n     physicians many women regularly see during their reproductive \n     years. Insurers often put barriers between women and their \n     ob-gyns. The Robb-Murray amendment would allow them to choose \n     the type of physician they want.\n       In addition, the Robb-Murray amendment makes clear that \n     direct access to ob-gyn care is not at a managed care plan's \n     option but rather a guarantee for women. The amendment also \n     provides women access to all ob-gyn services covered by their \n     health care plans, not just a subset of those services \n     designated by the plan as routine. Ob-gyn providers would \n     also be able to order appropriate covered follow-up ob-gyn \n     care, including referrals for related care, without prior \n     authorization.\n       Thirty-seven states have acted to address these issues, but \n     these laws do not protect the many women enrolled in self-\n     insured plans. The Robb-Murray amendment extends meaningful \n     direct access to ob-gyn care to women in federally regulated \n     plans. ACOG applauds your efforts in offering this important \n     amendment for America's women.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Ralph W. Hale, MD,\n                                         Executive Vice President.\n\n  Mr. ROBB. I ask my Republican friends: What are their objections to \nthe proposal to allow women access to care that they want and need? How \ndo those who voted against our amendment yesterday, which is so \nimportant to American women, justify doing so?\n  I want to clarify something my colleague from Tennessee said about \nour proposal to guarantee that doctors and patients--not insurance \ncompanies--decide how long a woman stays in a hospital after a \nmastectomy. Senator Frist criticized a provision in our amendment that \nsaid physicians shall make decisions about the length of stay in a \nhospital in accordance with ``generally accepted medical standards,'' \narguing this standard would be used in determining whether a woman has \na mastectomy, a lumpectomy, or a lymph node dissection.\n  I want the record to reflect that our amendment said nothing of the \nsort. The Robb-Murray amendment simply said that after a woman has had \none of these procedures, a doctor and patient can then decide how long \na woman stays in the hospital. That is what the amendment actually \nsaid. Our Republican colleagues are simply wrong when they say that the \namendment would somehow apply to the decision of the kind of surgical \nprocedure a woman undergoes.\n  Mr. President, I know there is a broader issue being debated over the \ndefinition of ``medical necessity'' and whether or not this definition \nis problematic. But that debate has nothing to do with the amendment we \noffered yesterday. Our amendment specifically said that physicians \nwould be empowered to overrule insurance companies only when deciding \nhow long a woman stays in the hospital after a woman has had a \nmastectomy, a lumpectomy, or lymph node dissection. Their argument that \nour amendment had a broader application is simply without merit.\n  The Republican arguments in this case against the mastectomy portion \nof our amendment were off base. Their argument against guaranteeing \nbetter care by an OB/GYN has been discredited by the doctor whom they \nquoted yesterday.\n  I hope we can come to some truly bipartisan resolution of these \nissues. They are important. They are important to women. They are \nimportant to all of the people in this country who are not currently \ncovered. To restrict the scope of this amendment in such a way that \nspecifically excludes women from having direct access to the type of \nhealth professionals with whom they are most comfortable is \nunconscionable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, it seems to me in watching the debate \nyesterday and today, both sides of the aisle want access to better care \nfor every American who is in some form of an HMO or managed care plan. \nI think we should acknowledge that we do have different approaches on \nhow to get there.\n  We can summarize the differences in three ways:\n  No. 1, we are looking at the costs. Many Members are concerned that \nif we raise the cost of a premium, a family has worse than a Hobson's \nchoice as our colleagues have complained we are giving them with regard \nto floor debate. If the cost of health care rises too much, millions of \nAmericans will have no choice at all when they lose their coverage. \nThat has to be a consideration.\n  No. 2, on the issue of who defines the standards, our amendments and \nour underlying bill put the emphasis on the patient and the physician. \nThey give the patient the right to have an internal appeal and then an \nexternal appeal to make sure they get the quality of care the physician \nbelieves is best for that patient.\n  No. 3, it is a matter of access to lawsuits. We have to make a \nfundamental choice: Do you want good care or do you want good lawsuits? \nThat is going to make a big difference in the longevity of the HMOs and \ntheir ability to continue to give health care service.\n  Do we need better service? Absolutely. I don't know anyone who hasn't \nhad a complaint about an HMO. That is why I think our approach of an \ninternal review with a time limit, an external, binding review process, \nagain with strict time limits, by medical experts outside of the HMO is \nfar preferable to costly litigation that can take years to resolve.\n  This has been tested. It has been tested in my home State of Texas. \nWe passed an internal and external review process in Texas that has \nworked for over a year. Part of it has been struck down by a Federal \ncourt because they said it was a Federal law that takes precedence over \nthe State law. Some of it has been knocked out. But it was working, \nand, on a voluntary basis, still is. People were satisfied they had the \nright to a quick appeal to get the care they needed. About half of the \nappeals were won by patients and about half by the health insurance \ncompanies, which tells me it was probably a pretty fair system. Most \npeople want to have the quality care and a fair, quick system to \nredress their complaints rather than the ability to sue. Our bill would \nestablish a national system very similar to that passed in Texas, but \nwithout creating new incentives to sue.\n  Quality care is prospective; a lawsuit is retrospective. If a person \nwants good care, they are not as interested in a lawsuit later. They \nare interested in getting the access that the patient and the physician \nis seeking.\n  The Snowe-Abraham amendment is a good amendment. It does add to the \nRobb amendment from yesterday. I think it is a better approach. Our \napproach, saying we are not going to have any arbitrary time limits on \nhow long a woman can stay in the hospital if she has a mastectomy or a \nlumpectomy, is a good approach. Everything I have read says the quicker \na patient can go home and be cared for at home, the better off they are \nand the more likely they are to have a quick recovery. However, if you \nhave a problem, a complication in your surgery, we don't want an \nartificial time limit on the length of the hospital. That is what the \namendment of Senator Snowe and Senator Abraham provides.\n  Secondly, we have heard a lot of discussion this week about whether \nan OB/GYN would be primary care physician designee for a woman. The \nunderlying Republican bill provides that both OB/GYNs and pediatricians \nwill have direct access to a woman, in the case of the OB/GYN, or for \nthe parent and the child, in the case of a pediatrician. That is very \nimportant.\n  We have direct access. It is unnecessary to go through a gatekeeper \nin the Republican bill to see an OB/GYN physician for an OB/GYN \nproblem; nor does a child who needs to see a pediatrician have to go \nthrough a gatekeeper. I think that is very important.\n  I do know a number of women who only go to an OB/GYN and don't have \nregular checkups, although I have tried to talk my friends into getting \nregular physical exams. I think it is important to have a full checkup. \nNevertheless, many women don't do it. So at the very least, our bill \nassures that they will have direct access to their OB/\n\n[[Page S8449]]\n\nGYN, without going through a gatekeeper.\n  We are approaching this from different standards, there is no \nquestion about that. I think our approach is better. They think their \napproach is better. But I think we need to argue these points based on \nthe merits. I think the Snowe amendment is a good amendment.\n  The issue of clinical trials will come up again. I believe there \nshould be access to clinical trials to be paid for by HMOs, I really \ndo. There is going to be an amendment on that. It will be somewhat \ndifferent in approach. Again, the difference is going to be on who \ndefines and what the standards are, and I think Senator Mack will have \na good amendment that will be better than the Dodd amendment. Just as \nSenator Snowe's amendment and Senator Robb's amendment are very \nsimilar, but the differences are real, I think people will be able to \nmake a choice. I think we are going to provide a very strong women's \nhealth care amendment with the Snowe amendment that will strengthen \nwomen's ability to have direct access to their OB/GYN and have the care \nthey need based on consultations with their physicians, not a Federal \nrule that would have a one-size-fits-all approach.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time remains, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 11 minutes \n2 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 9 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let's make that 8 minutes; let me know in 8 \nminutes so my colleague from Nevada and anyone else can be heard on \nthis. I don't think I need that much time.\n  Regarding this issue of clinical trials and the issue that has been \nraised by Senator Snowe dealing with breast cancer, I guess you could \ndivide the country into two groups. There are those who have had to \ndeal with someone in their family who was dying or was threatened with \ndeath because of a serious illness, and those who have not been through \nit yet. You will; whether it is someone in your own family or a \nneighbor, someone you feel deeply about. Then you will understand, if \nyou are not in the latter category, what my amendment tries to do. That \nis why I think it is so outrageous that on five different occasions in \nthe last 2 hours, an effort to join together the Snowe amendment with \nthe Dodd amendment has been objected to.\n  It is incredible to me that we are in the Senate dealing with two \nissues that cry out for a solution dealing with breast cancer and how \nwomen are treated by HMOs and hospitals and the right to get a clinical \ntrial if you are dying. On five occasions in the last hour, a unanimous \nconsent request has been made that would allow these two amendments to \nbe joined, and I suggest be agreed to unanimously. And on five \ndifferent occasions objection has been heard.\n  Someone may think they are scoring a political point here. Try to \nexplain that to the people in the waiting room at a hospital in any \nState in the country at this very hour. Try to explain that to a family \nmember who is looking at someone in a bed who is plugged into about 50 \ntubes. The doctors said: Look, there is only one way your husband, your \nwife, your child is going to survive and that is if you get into a \nclinical trial. That is it. And at 1:05 on this day, the 14th of July, \nwe have a chance to do something about it and we are not going to do it \nbecause of gamesmanship, because someone may score a point. Instead of \ntaking these two amendments and doing what any reasonable American \nwould ask us to do--not Democrat, Republican, conservative, or \nliberal--we are not going to do it. Explain it to someone who says my \nfamily member needs clinical trials; my family member needs to get that \nbreast cancer treated.\n  I have listened today to the most incredible arguments against this \nclinical trial amendment. I wouldn't mind if there were questions about \nfacts, but it is just not factual. We limit clinical trials. Let me \ntell you how we do it. There are five conditions you must meet before \nyou can qualify for a clinical trial.\n  Only those clinical trials sponsored by NIH, the Department of \nDefense, and the Veterans' Administration qualify. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, there is no other standard treatment available anywhere in \nAmerica for you. If there is, you do not get into the clinical trial. I \nam glad my colleague from Tennessee is here because he raised these \nissues earlier. If there is another standard procedure available to \nyou, you do not get the clinical trial under my amendment.\n  No. 3, you have to be suffering from a life-threatening or serious \nillness.\n  No. 4, you have to have the potential to benefit from the trial that \nwould be covered.\n  Last, you only get routine costs. My colleague from Tennessee said if \nyou are going to get a heart, it is going to cost you a lot more \nbecause that is expensive. This amendment says no, no, no; only the \nroutine costs are compensated by the HMO, not the device, not the \nprescription drugs--only the routine costs, under my amendment.\n\n  I beg the leadership on the majority side, let us take the Snowe \namendment and take the Dodd amendment, if you will, on clinical trials, \nand let's move on to the next issue and say to the American public on \nthis question we agree. Ironically, the trade association for the HMOs \nagrees. They have sent out bulletins saying to their own HMOs: We think \nyou ought to have clinical trials and make them available to people. \nHow ironic that we are about to vote down the right to have clinical \ntrials which the HMOs think they ought to have.\n  I gather an amendment will be offered. ``Wait until tomorrow. There \nwill be an amendment tomorrow.'' Let me predict what the amendment will \ndo. It will provide clinical trials for cancer. You tell that to \nsomeone who has AIDS or someone who has Alzheimer's or Parkinson's \ndisease. You tell that family: I am sorry, we think clinical trials are \nOK for cancer but not OK for the other illnesses. What is the logic in \nthat?\n  I think we have narrowed this pretty well. You limit it to NIH, \nDepartment of Defense, Veterans'; no other standard treatment is \navailable in the country; you have to be dying; and it has to be able \nto treat the covered problem you have, and you only pay for routine \ncosts, not for the devices or the equipment.\n  I am preaching to the choir when I talk to my colleague from Maine. \nShe has written a good bill. I mentioned it earlier. Senator Mack has \nbeen on this bill, Senator Rockefeller, others have been involved on a \nbipartisan basis. So my appeal in the last remaining minutes of this \ndebate on this amendment is that we drop the objections, the five \nobjections that have been raised. The costs on this are negligible. The \nestimates are 12 cents per covered patient per month--12 cents.\n  In fact, Sloan-Kettering Cancer Institute and the M.D. Anderson \nCenter, two of the finest in the world, in their report stated that \nthey believe the costs are lower for the clinical trials than for the \nother procedures--actually a lower cost. So you have Sloan-Kettering \nand M.D. Anderson lowering costs of clinical trials on their analysis \nof our amendment. Lower costs, 12 cents a month, you pick it.\n  We have narrowed it tightly so you limit it, as limited as I know how \nto make it, to life threatening, no other standard procedure available \nto you. You have to use one of the only three, clinical trials \nsponsored by NIH, Department of Defense, Veterans'. How much more \nnarrow can we get? There is only one of three or four ways that we get \nnew products out to people. You test it in a lab first. Then you give \nit to animals. Then you have to have clinical trials. You have to have \nthem. If you do not have the clinical trials, then you cannot get the \nproduct to people. So it is not just the patient today who needs it, \nwho is lying somewhere wondering whether or not they can get their HMO \nto include a clinical trial, but future patients. If we do not have the \nclinical trials today, that future patient will not get that medicine \nor may be delayed in getting it.\n  Mr. President, there may be other issues which divide us. This one \nshould not. This one should not divide us. Can we not, for 5 minutes--\n--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes.\n\n[[Page S8450]]\n\n  Mr. DODD. I will take 30 additional seconds. Can't we find 5 minutes \nthis week to come to an agreement on the Snowe amendment and the Dodd \namendment and move on to the next issue? Do we really have to make this \na huge battle and fight, where we go through a battle to say, no to \none, yes to another, maybe tomorrow. This is not fair to the American \npublic. They expect I think a little more from us than this.\n  Mr. President, I will try one more time--one more time, the sixth \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 30 seconds have expired.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask for 30 additional seconds. I ask unanimous consent--\nthis is the sixth time this will be made in the last hour--that S. \n1344, the Daschle substitute amendment, be modified with language from \nthe Snowe amendment No. 1241 prohibiting drive-through mastectomies and \nrequiring coverage for second opinions be included in the Dodd \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am saddened by this objection. The \nAmerican people ought to be deeply saddened by what they have heard on \nthis issue in the last hour and half.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Snowe \nAmendment--an amendment to rid the tragic practice of drive-through'' \nmastectomies.\n  Mr. President, one out of nine American women will suffer the tragedy \nof breast cancer. It is today the leading cause of death for women \nbetween the ages of 35 to 54.\n  Alaskan women are particularly vulnerable to this disease. We have \nthe second highest rate of breast cancer in the nation.\n  1 in 7 Alaska women will get breast cancer and tragically it is the \nNumber One cause of death among Native Alaskan women.\n  We know that these deaths are preventable--and the key to prevention \nis early detection. It is estimated that breast cancer deaths can be \nreduced by 30 percent if all women avail themselves of regular clinical \nbreast examination and mammography. I'm proud of the work that this \nbody has done in the recent past to expand Medicare and Medicaid \ncoverage for mammographies.\n  I am also proud of the efforts that my wife Nancy has done in \nexpanding early detection efforts throughout Alaska. You see, Mr. \nPresident, for many Alaska women, especially native women living in one \nof our 230 remote villages, regular screening and early detection are \noften hopeless dreams.\n  For 25 years, my wife Nancy has recognized this problem and did \nsomething about it. In 1974, she and a group of Fairbanks' women \ncreated the Breast Cancer Detection Center, for the purpose of offering \nmammographies to women in remote areas of Alaska--regardless of a \nwoman's ability to pay.\n  Now, the Center uses a small portable mammography unit which can be \nflown to remote areas of Alaska, offering women in the most rural of \nareas easy access to mammographies at no cost.\n  Additionally, the Center uses a 43-foot long, 14 foot high and 26,000 \npound mobile mammography van to travel through rural areas of Alaska. \nThe van makes regular trips, usually by river barge, to remote areas in \nInterior Alaska such as Tanana.\n  Julie Roberts, a 42-year-old woman of Tanana, who receives regular \nmammographies from the mobile mammography van, knows the importance of \nearly screening:\n  There's a lot of cancer here (in Tanana)--a lot of cancer. That's why \nit's important to have the mobile van here . . . I know that if I get \nchecked, I can catch it early and can probably save my life. I have \nthree children and I want to see my grandchildren.\n  I am proud to say that the Fairbanks Center now serves about 2,200 \nwomen a year and has provided screenings to more than 25,000 Alaska \nwomen in 81 villages throughout the states. To help fund the efforts of \nthe Fairbanks Center, each year Nancy and I sponsor a fishing \ntournament to raise money for the operation of the van and mobile \nmammography unit. After just three years, donations from the tournament \nhave totalled over $1 million.\n  Mr. President, Nancy and I are committed to raising more funds for \nthis important program so that every women in Alaska can benefit from \nthe advances of modern technology and reduce their risk of facing this \nkiller disease.\n  But, Mr. President, the fight against breast cancer does not end with \ndetection of the disease. That is why I stand in strong support of \nSenator Snowe's amendment. Her amendment will once and for all put an \nend to the practices of so-called drive-through'' mastectomies.\n  In too many cases women who survive the trauma of a mastectomy are \nbeing forced to get out of the hospital only hours after their surgery. \nHow can medical care professionals allow this? Simply because many \ninsurance companies demand that the procedure of a mastectomy be \nconsidered an out-patient service.''\n  Here's the horror that many insurance companies cause:\n  Nancy Couchot, a 60 year old woman had a radical mastectomy at 11:30 \na.m. She was released from the hospital five hours --even though she \nwas not able to walk or use the rest room without assistance.\n  Victoria Berck, had a mastectomy and lymph node removal at 7:30 a.m. \nSeven hours later, she was given instructions on how to empty two \ndrains attached to her body and sent home. Ms. Berck concludes, No \ncivilized country in the world has a mastectomy as an out-patient \nservice.''\n  Mr. President, it's for these very reasons that I am in strong \nsupport of Senator Snowe's amendment. Specifically, the amendment will \nrequire health insurance companies to allow physicians to determine the \nlength of a mastectomy patient's hospital stay according to medical \nnecessity. In other words, the bill makes it illegal to punish a doctor \nfor following good medical judgment and sound medical treatment.\n  This amendment is important follow-up to legislation that I and many \nin this Body worked on worked on to ensure that mastectomy patients \nhave access to reconstructive surgery. Prior to our efforts in last \nyear's Omnibus bill, scores of women were denied reconstructive surgery \nfollowing mastectomies because insurers have deemed the procedure to be \ncosmetic'' and, therefore, not medically necessary.\n  Mr. President, far too often breast cancer victims, who believe that \nthey have adequate health care coverage, are horrified when they learn \nbasic and sound medical practices are not covered in their health plan.\n  Mr. President, these issues are not partisan issues. We may have our \ndifferences regarding managing and financing health reform, but I think \nwe all endorse accessible and affordable health care that preserves \npatient choice and physician discretion. Cancer does not look to see \nthe politics of its victims.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, earlier I said that I would enter into \nthe Record the fact that last Congress, the majority's version of the \nPatient's Bill of Rights included a mastectomy provision that was quite \nsimilar to the provision offered by Senator Robb yesterday and by \nSenator Snowe today. Yet, this mastectomy provision was conspicuously \nabsent from the majority's bill this year. Drive-through mastectomies \nwere discussed during committee markup but were not added back. In \nfact, the majority rejected an amendment by Senator Murphy to end \ndrive-through mastectomies. Now, in response to popular pressure, the \nmajority is offering the Snowe amendment on mastectomies as a way of \nundermining our attempt to provide coverage for patients in clinical \ntrials. I ask unanimous consent that the table of contents and relevant \npages of the Republican bills from the last Congress and from this \nCongress be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nS. 2330, July 20, 1998\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n[[Page S8451]]\n\n              Subtitle C--Women's Health and Cancer Rights\n\n       Sec. 531.

It is with \nsome difficulty that I have to remind those across the aisle that we \ntried last year and we tried this year to have a face-off with the two \nbills: You put the best bill forward you have, we will put the best \nbill forward we have, we will allow amendments back and forth, 20 to a \nside, something like that. No, they did not want that. Why? They \nfigured they would lose. We had a better bill. We have a better bill \nnow.\n  No. 1, this bill, after the vote, assuming we win on the vote, the \nSenator from Connecticut will have the opportunity, the minority will \nhave the opportunity to offer their provisions on clinical trials \nagain. We will have several opportunities to do that. We are not \ncutting off the opportunity for that one to be reexamined.\n  What we are saying is, right now, we want to make sure we clear up \nthe problems with respect to mastectomies and want to make sure this \nbody will have an opportunity to, once and for all, bring back the so-\ncalled amendment of Senator D'Amato to make sure all women in this \nNation have an opportunity for the best possible care for the very \ndifficult problems of breast cancer.\n  We are ready to do that. There will be other votes. We will have more \nvotes, I do not know, 5, 10 more votes between now and the time this \ndebate ends. Right now, we want to have the vote on our amendment \nwhich, under this convoluted process we were talked into by the \nminority, which is very confusing--and maybe they want it that way--\ncreates a mess for the public and even us as Members to understand what \nthe process is or what is going to happen next or how we are going to \nend up.\n  I want to let everyone know I am sincerely in favor of good clinical \ntrials, and I am sincerely in favor of taking care, as we would right \nnow, of the problems of the mastectomies and also OB/GYN. We will be \ndoing that. Since I am the one who is objecting, I want everyone to \nknow that is my job as leader on the floor. I do not want it to be \nutilized as some way I am against these things personally.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, again I stand as an advocate for clinical \ntrials and say at the end of the next 48 hours, we are going to have a \nvery good amendment that will be added to this bill which will address \nthe issue of getting clinical services to people earlier by lowering \nthe barriers to get into clinical trials with a mandate on managed \ncare, HMOs that will be very effective, that will be accountable, that \nwill be affordable, and that will get things to people quickly.\n  Let me go back to the examples. It is so hard. You use an example and \nsomebody plays off it. Artificial hearts are expensive. A clinical \ntrial opens up. It is life-threatening; there is no alternative. Two \npatients: one dying of cardiomyopathy. The patient will hardly last 2 \nweeks. You put in an artificial heart to see if it works. The patient \ndies 2 weeks later. It is terrible. The artificial heart in the other \npatient keeps him alive and 2 weeks, 3 weeks has a stroke to the brain. \nHe has a massive stroke and stays in the hospital for a week, 1 month \nor 2 months. He takes hematinics. He has about $4,000 to $5,000 of \ntesting every year. There are 15 people or so monitoring that patient \nfor the next week, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, or 8 weeks. Two different \npatients: the intervention, the artificial heart you introduced as part \nof the clinical trial, and this patient dies. The incremental cost, the \ndifference between these two is the hospitalization for 3 weeks, 4 \nweeks, or 8 weeks and the medical care.\n  Again, the incremental cost you are going to make the managed care \nplan pay--since everybody is bashing managed care, that seems to be \nOK--but remember, all the managed care plan does is pass that cost on \nto the people who are sick. You have sick patients, whose premiums go \nup, who pay this bill. It is unintended. I know that is not what you \nmeant, but by using life-threatening or serious illness where there is \notherwise no alternative, using the example you introduced, which I \nrefuted--I am going to throw it right back at my colleague--it is very \ncomplicated. We need to stay sharp and focused and pass a sharp bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Who yields \ntime?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Maine such time \nas we have remaining.\n  Ms. SNOWE. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I want to make a few points to wrap up. I \napplaud the leadership of Senator Dodd with respect to clinical study \ntrials. Obviously, I could not agree with him more on this issue.\n  This is an issue that will be addressed further in this debate, as it \nshould. But the Senator is frustrated, and if other Senators are \nfrustrated at the process, then we all have a collective responsibility \nto make sure it does not happen again. We cannot pretend we do not know \nhow we got here. It is unfortunate we have a Hobson's choice today, but \nwe had a Hobson's choice yesterday when it came to mastectomies when \nthe amendment was offered by Senator Robb to the legislation that \nalready had the identical language. I had planned to offer this \nlegislation well before the recess because I wanted to improve upon the \nRepublican legislation on managed care. I thought it was absolutely \nessential.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts asked, why did we just identify \nmastectomies and women with breast cancer? I say to the Senator, why? \nFor the same reason the Senator singled out mastectomies in his own \nlegislation and Senator Robb singled it out in his amendment that he \noffered yesterday. Because we have an identifiable problem with drive-\nthrough\n\n[[Page S8455]]\n\nmastectomies and HMOs. That was the genesis of the legislation to begin \nwith when former Senator D'Amato had introduced that legislation with \nSenator Feinstein and myself several years ago. I introduced the same \nlegislation this year with Senator Feinstein for that very reason, \nbecause there has been a problem with managed care and drive-through \nmastectomies.\n  We have all heard the horror stories. That is why this legislation \nwas developed. That is why I am offering this amendment to the \nRepublican legislation, because it does not have that language.\n  Some suggest there is some partisan political ploy. I will compare my \ncredentials on bipartisanship with anybody across the aisle. We have \nworked on a bipartisan basis on issues concerning women's health since \nI came to the Congress 20 years ago. I would have hoped yesterday we \nwould have had the opportunity to work it out rather than having to \nvote on an amendment that included language that was already in the \nDemocratic bill.\n  We should have been working together, but now we are having to \naddress the issue of defining ``medical necessity'' that no other \nlegislation, no board, no governmental agency, no association has \ndefined. It is going to limit the treatment that is offered to women \nwhen it comes to breast cancer. That is a fact.\n  So the choice is, are you going to get the best care, the best \ntreatment, the best principles when it comes to breast cancer? Or are \nyou going to lower the threshold and say: Well, everybody offers this, \nno matter what, when there are other options? There is better science \ndeveloping all the time, and it could be available to a woman who has \nbreast cancer.\n  Those are the choices. That is why we are at this point. I just say \nto everybody in this Chamber, if we want to avoid this kind of \ncontrivance when it comes to this amendment process, then I suggest it \nis the responsibility of each of us to make sure it does not happen, so \nthat we get the very best legislation, that we can walk across the \naisle, rather than being constrained by the parliamentary procedures \nthat we confront today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada has 1\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I will take 2 minutes off the bill in addition to that.\n  Mr. President, the statements of the Senator from Vermont and my \nfriend from Maine basically are cynical and very unreasonable. We have \ngiven the majority the opportunity to vote on drive-through \nmastectomies and also to maintain clinical trials. We could do that by \nvoice vote. We could save a lot of time. The decision has been made by \nthe majority to make sure that we do not have the opportunity to pass \nthe clinical trials aspect of this bill.\n  They are always promising they are going to come back with something \nelse a little better later. The fact of the matter is, this is not a \nHobson's choice. What they are attempting to do is cynical and \nunreasonable.\n  Senator Lott said this morning in his opening statement, Republicans \nhave a medical doctor to support their positions. And I have the \ngreatest respect for the junior Senator from Tennessee. The fact is, \nwith his medical knowledge, though, he should relate the facts. And the \nfact is, on page 8341 of the Congressional Record of July 13, 1999, \nSenator Frist said, among other things, ``Let me share with Members \nwhat one person told me. Dr. Robert Yelverton, chairman of the American \nCollege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.' . . .''\n  Fact: My friend from Tennessee never spoke to Dr. Yelverton.\n  Fact: Dr. Yelverton, even if he had spoken to him, disagrees with \nstatements made by Senator Frist about him.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record page 8341 of \nyesterday's Record. I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a memorandum to Lucia DiVenere from Dr. Yelverton, wherein that \nmemorandum states:\n\n       Senator Frist's misuse of my statement in support of his \n     position . . . is regrettably misleading . . . and does an \n     injustice to the true intent of my statements.\n\n  Further, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \nletter to Dr. Frist, dated July 14, 1999, from Dr. Hale, executive vice \npresident of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.\n  That letter, in part, says:\n\n       The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and \n     Dr. Yelverton fully support efforts in Congress, including \n     the Robb/Murray amendment, which would enable ob-gyns to be \n     designated as primary care providers. A recent . . . survey \n     found that nearly one-third of all ob-gyns in managed care \n     plans are denied the opportunity to be designated as primary \n     care physicians. Ob-gyns are often the only health care \n     provider many women see through their [entire] adult lives \n     and are best suited to understand and evaluate the health \n     care needs of their patients. . . .\n       We also strongly endorse the Robb/Murray amendment's \n     provision that would require managed care plans to allow \n     women direct access to the full array of covered ob-gyn \n     services under the plan.\n       While the amendment failed yesterday on a 48 to 52 vote, we \n     are hopeful the Senate will take up this important issue \n     again. Dr. Yelverton and I urge you to vote in favor of these \n     important policies.\n\n  I would hope my friend, Senator Frist, and the other Republicans \nwould take this to heart. I believe we need to review some of the votes \ntaken yesterday.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Excerpt From Record of July 13, 1999\n\n       Mr. Frist. In the Kennedy-Robb amendment is the issue of \n     access.\n       Again, my colleagues on the other side hit it right on the \n     head: Women today want to have access to their obstetrician. \n     They don't want to go through gatekeepers to have to get to \n     their obstetrician or gynecologist. That relationship is very \n     special and very important when we are talking about women's \n     health and women's diseases.\n       In the Kennedy-Robb amendment, the language is that the \n     plan or insurer shall permit such an individual who is a \n     female to designate a participating physician who specializes \n     in obstetrics and gynecology as the individual's primary care \n     provider.\n       It is true that in our underlying bill we don't say the \n     plan has to say that all obstetricians and gynecologists are \n     primary care providers. That is exactly right. The reasons \n     for that are manyfold.\n       Let me share with Members what one person told me. Dr. \n     Robert Yelverton, chairman of the American College of \n     Obstetricians and Gynecologists' Primary Care Committee, \n     stated:\n       The vast majority of OB/GYNs in this country have opted to \n     remain as specialists rather than act as primary care \n     physicians.\n       He attributes this to the high standards that health plans \n     have for primary care physicians, saying:\n       None of us could really qualify as primary care physicians \n     under most of the plans, and most OB/GYNs would have to go \n     back to school for a year or more to do so.\n       You can argue whether that is good or bad, but it shows \n     that automatically taking specialists and making them primary \n     care physicians and putting it in Federal statute is a little \n     bit like taking Bill First, heart and lung transplant \n     surgeon, and saying: You ought to take care of all of the \n     primary care of anybody who walks into your office.\n                                  ____\n\n         Doctors Yelverton, Lerner, Fallieras, Kilbride, Marston, \n           Jaeger, Minton & Brown,\n                                         Tampa, FL, July 13, 1999.\n     To: Lucia DiVenere, ACOG Government Relations.\n     From: Robert W. Yelverton, M.D., Chairman, Primary Care \n         Committee.\n       I received your fax tonight and offer the following in \n     response.\n       I have never spoken directly to Senator Bill Frist (R-TN) \n     or any member of his staff on the subject of OB/GYNs as \n     primary care physicians or on any other subject. The quote \n     that Senator Frist attributed to me on the floor of the \n     Senate today came from an article in the June 13, 1999, \n     edition of the New York Times. The article may be viewed on \n     the New York Times website (go to www.nytimes.com, then click \n     on Health and Science). I was contacted by the article's \n     author, Larry Katzenstein, and asked to comment on the impact \n     of managed care on women's healthcare in this country. In my \n     interview with Mr. Katzenstein, I discussed ``barriers'' that \n     managed care organizations have raised against the efforts of \n     OB/GYNs to become primary care physicians. The quote \n     attributed to me by Senator Frist was from a non-quote in \n     this article. I told Mr. Katzenstein that some managed care \n     organizations have placed barriers consisting of such \n     stringent (not ``high,'' as Senator Frist stated) standards \n     for their qualifications as primary care physicians that most \n     OB/GYNs would not be able to meet them without further \n     training.\n       One objective of my comments was to demonstrate that the \n     College's interests were to allow OB/GYNs to provide women's \n     healthcare to their patients unimpeded by the cumbersome \n     requirements of managed care referral systems. Mr. \n     Katzenstein's article did not emphasize to the degree it \n     should have that these were barriers to OB/GYNs\n\n[[Page S8456]]\n\n     being designated primary care physicians--not ``high \n     standards''--as has been discussed repeatedly in meetings of \n     the Primary Care Committee. I went on to say to Mr. \n     Katzenstein that the qualification requirements that some \n     managed care organizations impose on OB/GYNs in certain \n     instances exceed even those required of family physicians. He \n     chose not to include that statement in his article.\n       Senator Frist's misuse of my statement in support of his \n     position that OB/GYNs could not act as primary care \n     physicians because of the ``high standards'' that managed \n     care organizations set for primary care physicians, is \n     regrettably misleading, to say the least, and does an \n     injustice to the true intent of my statements.\n       I personally supported then and I support now the amendment \n     sponsored by ACOG to allow OB/GYNs to act as primary care \n     physicians and to allow direct access for women's healthcare \n     and did, in fact, spend a portion of this very afternoon e-\n     mailing my senators and encouraging them to vote in support \n     of the amendment.\n       Please contact me. I will be glad to discuss this matter \n     with you at that time and will support any effort that you \n     want to undertake to clarify this issue now on the floor of \n     the Senate.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           The American College of\n\n\n                              Obstetricians and Gynecologists,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 14, 1999.\n     Hon. Bill Frist\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Frist: As Executive Vice President of the \n     American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists (ACOG), I \n     feel it necessary to clarify ACOG's position on the Robb/\n     Murray amendment to allow women in managed care plans direct \n     access to ob-gyn care. I've also attached a memo from Dr. \n     Robert Yelverton, Chairman of ACOG's Primary Care Committee, \n     correcting your misuse of his statements in a June 13 New \n     York Times article.\n       ACOG and Dr. Yelverton fully support efforts in Congress, \n     including the Robb/Murray amendment, which would enable ob-\n     gyns to be designated as primary care providers. A recent \n     ACOG/Princeton Survey Research Associates survey found that \n     nearly one-third of all ob-gyns in managed care plans are \n     denied the opportunity to be designated as primary care \n     physicians. Ob-gyns are often the only health care provider \n     many women see throughout their adult lives and are best \n     suited to understand and evaluate the health care needs of \n     their patients. While not all ob-gyns may choose to accept a \n     PCP designation, all ob-gyns should have the opportunity to \n     be designated as a woman's PCP under managed care.\n       We also strongly endorse the Robb/Murray amendment's \n     provision that would require managed care plans to allow \n     women direct access to the full array of covered ob-gyn \n     services provided under the plan.\n       While the amendment failed yesterday on a 48 to 52 vote, we \n     are hopeful the Senate will take up this important issue \n     again. Dr. Yelverton and I urge you to vote in favor of these \n     important policies.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Ralph W. Hale, MD,\n                                         Executive Vice President.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, do we still have a minute and a half on \nthe amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time on the amendment has been consumed.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 1 minute off the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a letter from the National Partnership for Women & \nFamilies and a letter from the National Breast Cancer Coalition. Both \nof these organizations support the Dodd amendment, and they urge \nopposition to the Snowe amendment because it strikes the underlying \nDodd amendment on clinical trials.\n  The letter from the National Partnership for Women & Families says:\n\n       It is essential that women and families have access to \n     clinical trials. We oppose any effort to deny such access.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that both these letters be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              National Partnership\n\n\n                                         for Women & Families,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 14, 1999.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: The National Partnership for Women & \n     Families urges you to oppose the pending Snowe amendment \n     because it strikes the underlying Dodd amendment on clinical \n     trials. It is essential that women and families have access \n     to clinical trials. We oppose any effort to deny such access.\n           Sincerely,\n     Judith L. Lichtman,\n                                                        President.\n     Joanne L. Hustead,\n     Director of Legal and Public Policy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             National Breast Cancer Coalition,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 14, 1999.\n     Hon. Thomas Daschle,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: On behalf of the National Breast \n     Cancer Coalition (NBCC), I want to express our deep concern \n     about the fact that a choice has to be made between the \n     length of hospital stay and the clinical trials amendments. \n     If a choice must be made, NBCC's priority is access to \n     clinical trials.\n       As you know, NBCC is a grassroots advocacy organization \n     made up of more than 500 organizations and tens of thousands \n     of individuals working since 1991 to eradicate this disease \n     through advocacy and action.\n       While it is important for doctors and patients to make \n     decisions about how long women should stay in the hospital \n     following a mastectomy, an even more important amendment is \n     Senator Dodd's access to clinical trials amendment. Clinical \n     trials provide the best evidence of whether an intervention \n     will work. Without them, we will never know how to prevent \n     breast cancer, how best to treat it, or how to cure it-and \n     our demands for ``quality care'' will have no meaning.\n       NBCC truly appreciates Senator Snowe's support of breast \n     cancer issues. Unfortunately, under these circumstances we \n     believe the length of hospital stay amendment should not be \n     supported in lieu of ensuring access to the lifesaving \n     therapies in clinical trials.\n       Thank you for your leadership. We look forward to working \n     with you to get this important patient protection, and a \n     comprehensive and enforceable ``Patients Bill of Rights'' \n     enacted into law. Please do not hesitate to call me, or \n     NBCC's Government Relations Manager, Jennifer Katz if you \n     have any questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Fran Visco,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nMurkowski be added as a cosponsor to the Snowe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the Snowe \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n\n[[Page S8457]]\n\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Daschle), for himself, \n     Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Reid, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Wyden, \n     Mr. Reed, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Chafee, and Mrs. Feinstein, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1242 to amendment No. 1239.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a unanimous \nconsent?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes. I yield for that purpose.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank my friend from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Rebecca Pastner of my \nstaff be given the privilege of the floor today during votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 7 minutes.\n  All patients, regardless of where they live or how they purchase \ntheir insurance, deserve to know that their health plan will cover the \nbenefits they need when they are ill or injured.\n  When we say ``all,'' we mean all.\n  That is a fundamental principle of HMO reform. But it is a \nfundamental principle that is ignored in the Republican minimal \nalternative.\n  The amendment that Senator Daschle, I, and others are offering makes \nclear that every provision of the Patients' Bill of Rights should apply \nto all 161 million Americans with private insurance coverage.\n  No patient should be turned away at the emergency room door, denied \naccess to the specialist they need to save their life, or be told that \nthey will not get the prescription drug they need to treat their \nillness because they live in Mississippi instead of Massachusetts or in \nOklahoma instead of Ohio.\n  No child or parent or grandparent should be denied the medical care \nthey need because they happen to work for a small business instead of a \nlarge corporation or because they are a teacher in a public school \ninstead of an executive on Wall Street.\n  Of the 161 million Americans with private insurance, only 48 million \nare covered under the Republican plan; 113 million Americans are left \nout or are left behind. The Republican plan limits protections to those \nwho receive their coverage from an employer who self-insures their \nhealth plan rather than purchasing an insurance policy.\n  Only the largest corporations self-fund their insurance plan. \nHowever, many employees of even the largest employers get their \ncoverage through an fully-funded health plan. These employees would not \nbe protected by the Republican bill.\n  What an incredible irony. Much of the public desire for patient \nprotection legislation comes from the concern about the abusive \npractices of HMOs. But virtually no one enrolled in an HMO is covered \nby the Republican bill because HMOs are rarely part of self-funded \narrangements.\n  These reforms are supposed to protect patients against HMO and \ninsurance company abuses. But people with coverage from insurance \ncompanies and HMOs are not protected by the Republican bill.\n  Nothing more clearly demonstrates that the Republican bill is an \nindustry protection act, not a patient protection act.\n  It is no wonder insurance companies support the Republican bill. It \nis no wonder that over 200 groups of doctors, nurses, patients, and \nadvocates for women, children, and families oppose the Republican bill.\n  The ``dishonor role'' of those left out under the Republican plan is \nlong.\n  We are talking about 75 million Americans who work for businesses \nthat purchase insurance. We are talking about 15 million Americans who \nare small business men and women, self-employed salesmen, home day-care \nworkers, early retirees, farmers, or others who purchase their own \ninsurance instead of receiving it through their employer.\n  We are talking about 23 million schoolteachers, police officers, \nlibrarians, nurses, and other employees of State and local government.\n  Why are these people excluded?\n  This chart indicates exactly the point that we are making.\n  The Republican bill covers 48 million people. These are the people \nwho receive health insurance through self-insured employer plans. These \nare the plans in which the company self-insures and, therefore, pays \nfor the various medical treatments.\n  It doesn't cover the 75 million persons whose employers provide \ncoverage through an insurance policy or HMO even though approximately \n85 percent of the 75 million are enrolled in HMOs. It doesn't cover the \n23 million State and local government workers. It doesn't include the \npeople buying individual health insurance policies. Those are the very \nsmall businessmen, the farmers, and others.\n  Why are these people excluded, even though the Republican plan in the \nHouse of Representatives includes most of these individuals?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. SARBANES. As I understand this, we are dealing here with a \nPatients' Bill of Rights which is designed to, in effect, curb some of \nthe practices of the HMOs. The proposal from the other side of the \naisle by our Republican colleagues does not cover the bulk of the \npeople who are in HMOs, is that correct?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It covers virtually none of the people who are in HMOs.\n  Mr. SARBANES. What is the purpose of their exercise? It is a \npretense, is it not, to assert some sort of Patients' Bill of Rights to \ndeal with problems people are having with HMOs and then not to cover \nthe very people who are in the HMOs? That is a pretense, is it not?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I believe it is.\n  This chart clearly reflects the point the Senator has made. The 48 \nmillion who are covered are covered through self-funded plans. The \nlargest group of persons receiving health care through HMOs are the 75 \nmillion where the employer purchases coverage through an insurance \npolicy or an HMO; about 85 percent of the 75 million are enrolled in \nHMOs. This bill does not cover them.\n  This bill doesn't cover State and local workers, and it does not \ncover people buying individual policies.\n  The bill supported by the Republicans, which is a bill allegedly \ndealing with the problems occurring in HMOs, covers few if any of the \nmembers of Health Maintenance Organizations.\n  Is it any wonder the insurance industry is supporting their \nparticular proposal and is opposed to the proposals we have supported? \nIsn't it understandable that the major medical groups and professions, \nthe doctors and nurses who are concerned about managed care abuses--who \nunderstand the abuses happen to those with employer-provided plans, \nState and local government plans, and individual plans--uniformly \nsupport our legislation?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I did a fast calculation. As I calculate, more than 70 \npercent of the people who we are concerned about with respect to how \nthey get their health care and the practices which are followed are \nexcluded--not included, excluded--from the Republican proposal.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct. That is why this debate has been \nrather empty until now. We heard much stated by the principal \nsupporters of the other side's bill about all the benefits of the \nRepublican bill. Now we have found out that the benefits do not apply \nto two-thirds of all those with insurance coverage, and most of those \nit may protect are not enrolled in HMOs.\n  (Mr. GREGG assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield.\n  Mr. BIDEN. In my State, the vast majority of the people who have \ninsurance work for Dupont, General Motors, Chrysler, the major \npharmaceutical firms such as Zeneca and Hercules. Do you mean all those \npeople--and they all have employer-provided health care--are excluded \nfrom coverage in the Republican bill?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Not knowing whether those particular programs are self-\nfunded offhand, it would be difficult to respond concerning particular \ncompanies.\n  However, only the larger companies self-fund. They are the only \ncompanies that have the resources to self-fund. It is generally the \nmajor companies and\n\n[[Page S8458]]\n\ncorporations that have the adequate resources to self-fund health \ncoverage.\n\n  The people buying individual policies are the farmer, and the small \nshopkeeper. It is the men, women and children on Main Street who are \nnot protected under the Republican plan.\n  When we talk about State and local government employees, we are \ntalking about policemen and firefighters putting their lives on the \nline every day, their spouses, their children, their parents. They are \nthe State and local government employees. About 75 percent are covered \nby an HMO--they are getting no protections under the Republican plan.\n  I am reminded by my staff that 89 percent of the people in Delaware \nwho have privately purchased health insurance will not be covered under \nthe Republican plan.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Eighty-nine percent?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. 89 percent will not be covered by the proposal. We have \na breakdown for each State. In Delaware, it is 89 percent not covered \nby the Republican proposal. The protections they are talking about \ndoing, or will do, will not cover 89% of the people in Delaware, with \nthe exception of the amendment of the Senator of Maine that has just \nbeen adopted, which is universal. That is another issue we will come \nback to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. As I understand the Senator's chart, there are 15 \nmillion people buying individual policies. Under the Republican \nproposal, they will not be covered, is that correct?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. There are another 23 million people, State and local \ngovernment workers, as I understand it, under the Republican bill, who \nwill not be covered, but they will not receive any protections with \nrespect to the practices of the HMOs, is that correct?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Furthermore, there are another 75 million people whose \nemployers provide coverage through an insurance policy or an HMO, 75 \nmillion, and those people will not be covered, is that correct?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is a total of 113 million people not covered.\n  As I understand it, the only people covered in this Republican \nproposal are 48 million people covered through a self-funded employer \nplan, which is less than 30 percent of the total number of people about \nwhom we should be concerned.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is quite correct.\n  That raises the question about supporting that plan. It is a \nlegitimate question--whether we ought to be representing to American \nfamilies that we are doing something to protect them when we are not, \nwe are failing. By failing to provide universal protection, if the \nRepublican proposal comes before the Senate and Members support it, we \nare failing 70 percent of the American people.\n  It is a fraud to represent that we are providing them with \nprotections when we are not. This is why I think we are putting the \nSenate to the test this afternoon. We are testing the seriousness \nMembers have for ensuring that whatever is passed will apply to \neveryone in this country who has insurance.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Does the Senator have information on what percentage are \ncovered in New York?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The answer to that is, yes, we do. Mr. President, 79 \npercent of those who are insured in the State of New York will not be \ncovered. There are 10,300,000 individuals who are covered with \nprivately purchased insurance, and the number of persons not covered \nunder the Republican bill is 8,101,000, practically 80 percent. Four \nout of five of the citizens of New York will not be covered under the \nRepublican program unless this amendment is accepted.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. And, further asking a question, that means that four out \nof five would not get emergency room coverage; four out of five would \nnot get the right to specialists; four out of five would not get the \nextended appeals, the independent appeals; four out of five would not \nhave any right to sue.\n  So this amendment that the Senator from Massachusetts is offering is \nprobably, I would guess, the most important amendment because every \nother amendment is dependent on it. No matter how good an amendment you \nagree to, if the amendment of the Senator from Massachusetts is not \nagreed to, it does not matter to most Americans because they simply \nwill not be covered. We would be voting for a bill that would do one-\nfifth as much, at best, as a proposal that would cover everybody. Am I \ncorrect?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is quite correct. It is the difference \nbetween substance and process. You can have the greatest substance in \nthe world, but if you control the process, you can limit it and \nrestrict it in such a way to preclude people from being protected. That \nis exactly what is happening here.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Right.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Even the underlying substance of the Republican proposal \nwe believe has fallen short in the areas mentioned by the Senator from \nNew York. We are going to try, during the latter part of the afternoon, \ntonight, and tomorrow, to continue to address those inadequacies, and \nhopefully we will have some support.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. One final question. This chart would indicate it all. It \nis 48 million/161 million. Under our proposal, the Democratic proposal, \n161 million Americans are covered for emergency room, for specialists, \nfor independent review, for the right to sue. And, at best, even if all \nthe other amendments are agreed to, under the Republican proposal under \n48 million would be covered?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is quite correct. On the other side of the \nroom--I am glad to see our two colleagues. We are missing some of our \nother colleagues for this debate on a matter of such great importance.\n  I rarely see, and I ask my other colleagues how many times have they \nseen, legislation written that effectively excludes 72 or 73 percent of \nall Americans but meets American's needs? Yet we effectively exclude 72 \nor 73% of Americans who need these protections. This, I think, makes \nthe proposal fraudulent in its representation to the American people.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield further?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I think the Senator from New York has again emphasized \nan extremely important point. People watching this debate have to \nunderstand, we have had these amendments arguing about what practice \nshould be covered--what practice should be covered. So we have an \nimportant difference there. But the fact of the matter is, under the \nRepublican proposal, no matter what practice is covered, it is only \ngoing to reach less than 30 percent of the people.\n  For the remainder, the other 70 percent, the 113 million, this debate \nfor them is completely irrelevant because they are not going to be \ncovered at all. So all of this other argument about whether you cover \nthis procedure or that procedure--which I think are extremely important \narguments in and of themselves, and important issues--but unless we \ndeal with this issue of coverage, which is the sharpest contrast \nbetween the two proposals, well over 70 percent of the people are \nsimply going to be left out altogether. Is that not correct?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct. But let me mention an additional \nfact you will hear from the other side. They will say: We want to cover \nthese 48 million individuals, but the States are covering all the \nothers; therefore, you have an empty argument, Democrats have an empty \nargument.\n  Do you know the answer to that? There is no State in this country \nthat provides all the protections provided in the Democratic proposal--\nnot one State. There is no State in the country that guarantees \npediatric specialty care for children who may have cancer or other \nkinds of serious illness--not one.\n\n  You can pick and choose and find out that there are 18 States that \nhave require some type of external appeal; almost all reject the kinds \nof appeal the Republicans have, the self-serving appeals where the HMO \nappoints the reviewer. They can fly-speck all afternoon and say we have \nthis here and\n\n[[Page S8459]]\n\nthis here, but there is not a State that provides all the protections \nwe provide.\n  I ask any of my colleagues who are on their feet if they differ with \nthe concept that we ought to provide a basic floor of protections for \nall Americans. Then, if the States of New York, California, \nMassachusetts, or Maryland want to build on those protections, we may \ndo so. This is the model used in the bipartisan legislation Senator \nKassebaum and I sponsored which passed the Senate that allows employees \nto move from job to job while retaining health care coverage. We follow \nthat pattern very closely with this legislation. We follow the same \ntype of model--a federal floor--in COBRA legislation. We follow the \nsame model for mental health programs.\n  We have followed that model with bipartisan support on 10 different \nprograms, and I will have them printed in the Record this afternoon, \nand yet we have the Republicans saying no to the model on this \nlegislation.\n  Why? The answer is, the insurance companies will not let them. That \nis the answer. There is no other answer. We challenge our Republican \nfriends. They are not here. We challenge them. How do you justify \nfollowing the same type of process and procedure we have used in 10 \ndifferent programs that have bipartisan support and yet now saying no, \nno, no, we are not going to do it on this bill? Can they give me an \nanswer? Can they give us a clear answer on why they will not do that?\n  I do not know. I think it is important, however, in giving a complete \nanswer to the Senator, to at least know what they are saying and how \ninaccurate and implausible their explanation is.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I see my friend and colleague from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask my colleague from Massachusetts, who \nI think has hit the nail on the head when he talks about what the \ninsurance companies will allow or not allow, for the average American \nlistening to this, the immediate question is--it seems \nincomprehensible--how can we not be covered if that is the purpose of \nthe bill?\n  The Republicans are going to hide behind a number of false arguments. \nI wonder if my colleague would share with us what the reality is of the \ncost, because the Republicans are going to hide behind the notion that \nsomehow what the Democrats want to do, which is cover more Americans, \nis too costly, and they will bring out the old Harry and Louise chart \nagain and try to confuse Americans about what will happen.\n  Will my colleague share with us and with the American people what the \nreal costs are of what the Democrats are talking about doing?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we have put into the Record the letter \nfrom the General Accounting Office that said it is 4.8 percent over 5 \nyears. That figure was used by the majority leader, Senator Trent Lott, \non ``Meet The Press.'' He basically subscribed to that cost over a \nperiod of 5 years.\n  If you take the average program, it averages about $2,000 for an \nindividual; $1,000 for a child; about $5,000 for a reasonably good \nfamily plan. Maybe it is somewhat more costly in the Northeast than it \nis in the South. If you look at a 5 percent cost, it would be $250 over \n5 years; that is $50 a year. If you look at the percentage paid for by \nthe worker, it is typically about 20%. If you do that for 12 months, do \nthat over 1 year, it is less than $2 a month, it is a Big Mac.\n  I see a number of my colleagues. I think all of them would agree, \nevery time we talk about family and medical leave we get a study done \nby the Chamber of Commerce. When we talk about minimum wage, we get \nthose studies that are done by the restaurant association on the \nincrease in the minimum wage. They talk about the escalation of costs \nand how it is going to put everybody out of business. The studies about \ncost used in this debate are studies that are bought and paid for by \nthe insurance companies--bought and paid for by the insurance \ncompanies.\n  We have heard from our Republican friends for months and years, as \nthe President of the United States said yesterday: We always rely on \nthe CBO figures. Now we have a CBO figure, and they do not like it.\n  Their second point is that all those people are going to lose their \nhealth insurance. The fact is that the individuals and groups which \nhave fought for expansion of health insurance coverage for years \nsupport our bill. Now we have the insurance industry saying pass this \nbill because it is going to mean the loss of health insurance coverage. \nThat is poppycock. That is wrong.\n  The facts, again, is that the General Accounting Office--and I have \nput in the Record the particular provision--has said there may very \nwell be an expansion in total coverage because there will be good \nbenefits and good protections.\n  The line I like is the one that was stated so well by our good friend \nfrom Maryland earlier today at a press conference: Around here it used \nto be when you bought insurance, it was what you were buying, what you \ncould expect; what you paid for is what you were going to get. Now when \nyou give your money and buy insurance, it is what the insurance company \nis prepared to give you.\n  That is what has happened in the United States of America. It is what \nthe insurance company is going to give you. As a result, it fails to \ngive adequate coverage to those children and women, the disabled and \npeople who have bought the insurance and deserve appropriate coverage. \nThat is what is happening.\n  When they talk about costs, I wish they at least had the decency to \naddress who picks up the cost when people fall through the cracks? It \nis charity care in the States. It is taxpayers who pick up the costs.\n  What about the cost of all that advertising we see every day? Mr. \nPresident, the profits of the top 10 HMOs total $1.5 billion. There are \ntens of millions of dollars spent for CEO salaries. Who is paying for \nall that? That is going to result in higher premiums for American \nworkers, and that is what they should be outraged about.\n  I will take a couple more questions, and then I will be glad to yield \nthe floor. Can I finish with my colleague?\n  Mr. KERRY. One further question, if I may. We have talked about some \nother States. In the State the Senator and I represent, Massachusetts, \nit is my understanding that 77 percent of the privately insured would \nnot be protected under the Republican plan.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is my understanding as well, 3 out of 4.\n  Mr. KERRY. How can you describe the rationale for the Republicans \ncoming to the floor and saying that, in fact, they are offering \nAmericans a Patients' Bill of Rights?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I find that has been the question for a long time. We \nhad hoped to work in a bipartisan way as we did to get coverage for 5 \nto 10 million children with the Republicans on our committee. We had \nhoped to work in a bipartisan way as we did with Senator Kassebaum to \nallow health insurance to become more portable. We are hopeful of \nworking some of the privacy issues out in a bipartisan way. Yet when it \ncomes to the Patients' Bill of Rights, the wall came down. The \ninsurance companies said absolutely not, not an inch.\n  I was listening to my colleagues say this is a regrettable situation; \nI wish we could get together. The insurance companies will not let them \nget together with us. They will not let them. This bill has been bought \nand paid for by the insurance industry; no question about it.\n  I yield to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the Senator yielding. I was standing here \nlistening and thinking of Mark Twain. He was asked to engage in a \ndebate at one point. He said: Fine, as long as I can be on the opposing \nside.\n  They said: We haven't told you what the subject is.\n  He said: It doesn't matter. Being on the opposing side doesn't \nrequire preparation.\n\n  There is no preparation here. We do not have a Republican on the \nfloor at the moment. I am sorry, Senator Jeffords is here.\n  You can fill in the blank. It would not matter if you talk about \nmanaged care, minimum wage, clean air. You can talk about Medicare, you \ncan talk about child labor laws, and there will be the same folks \ncoming to the floor saying: It is not the Federal Government's \nresponsibility; let the States do it.\n\n[[Page S8460]]\n\n  The Senator from Massachusetts made the point that most of the people \nare left out of the Republican plan. If people wonder if it is us \nagainst them, here is a USA Today editorial. It says: ``100 million \nReasons GOP's Health Plan Fails.''\n\n       That is how many people the proposal will leave \n     unprotected. Judging from the health insurance reform package \n     announced this week by Senate Republicans, at least the title \n     is correct. The proposal is called the ``Patients' Bill of \n     Rights,'' and if you are waiting for this perfunctory plan to \n     protect you, you'll need to be patient indeed. Many of the \n     plan's key protections are restricted to the 51 million \n     Americans who get their insurance through self-insured plans, \n     subject to Federal regulations, but another 100 million or so \n     whose health plans are subject to state regulations are \n     excluded.\n\n  The same editorial points out, as the Senator from Massachusetts has, \nthat most of the States do not have these protections.\n  These folks who come to the floor and say the States already have the \nprotection--access to nonnetwork providers, 35 States do not have that. \nI just do not understand. Instead of coming to the floor and being \nhonest and saying: We have no interest in this bill, all we want to do \nis obstruct, we have no interest in passing anything similar to that. \nInstead of doing that, they come with all these fuzzy shells. You wrap \na package. It looks to be the same package that is sitting across the \ndesk, but it has nothing in it. That is what is happening. Amendment \nafter amendment is an empty shell, a package with nothing in it.\n  USA Today says it right: ``100 Million Reasons GOP's Health Plan \nFails.''\n  Isn't it the case, I ask Senator Kennedy, because of this every \nsingle health organization in this country opposes the Republican plan \nand supports the Democratic plan? Is that not the case?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct. Generally around here it is a \npretty good test to take a piece of legislation and ask who is \nsupporting it and who is going to benefit. That is not a bad test for \nthe American public: Who is supporting the legislation--which groups, \nwhich people--and who is going to benefit.\n  What you find out is that our plan has the support of every health \nprofessional and every patient group. They are the ones supporting our \nbill.\n  Who is opposing it? The insurance industry. Who is supporting the \nopposition program? The insurance industry.\n  As this debate goes on and we get involved in technicalities, people \nought to know at the bottom line of each and every one of these issues \nwho supports our plan. On the OB/GYN issues, the medical professionals \nsupport our proposal in spite of the misrepresentations put forth in \nthis Chamber.\n  That is what is happening. The reason for that, as the Senator \nunderstands, is we have worked this out with consumers and health \nprofessionals. We tried to find out what is needed from the consumers--\nthe people who have suffered--and also the health professionals who \nhave tried to protect the consumers. We were out there listening.\n  I will take these last two and yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have two quick questions. One involves the largest \nState in the Union, and that is the State I represent. This is really \nkey. We have 33 million people living in California. How many of them, \npercentagewise, will not be covered by this Republican plan?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It just so happens I have that information: 18 million \nprivately insured persons, 18.6 million; 14,477,000, 77 percent of the \npeople of California will not be covered if our amendment is not \nsuccessful--77 percent of the people in California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I think it is very important that the people in my home \nState understand that the Republican plan does not do anything for very \nmany of them.\n  The second question I have deals with children. As the Senator from \nNorth Dakota pointed out, we do have national laws. This is one Nation, \nunder God, indivisible, and we do have national laws. I find it \nunbelievable that colleagues on the other side--a couple came over and \nsaid: States are taking care of all these issues.\n  I want to talk about children. Every Senator in this body I know \ncares about kids. I know they care about kids. They care about their \nown kids, their grandkids, and the kids they represent. I ask my friend \nto elaborate on this. If we can have child labor laws which say you \ncannot hire a child, you have to wait for a certain age, and when you \ndo, there are certain rules that apply, should we have a national law \nthat protects every child in this country so if that child comes down \nwith a cancer, they are not told by their HMO: Go see a general \nsurgeon; you don't need a pediatric surgeon?\n  I know my friend has had experience with this. Can he talk just a \nmoment about why the Democratic plan is for the children of this \ncountry and the Republican plan is a sham?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As the Senator knows, the kinds of protections for \nchildren are included, including the preventive programs, specialty \nprograms, the clinical trial programs, and the specialty care programs. \nOur good friend, Senator Reed, is one of our real experts on these \nissues. The range of different protections and guarantees is out there \nfor children. That is why every child's health group supports our \nprogram.\n  But let me mention something of interest that is on point. The Senate \nhas just accepted the amendment of the Senator from Maine on the issue \nof mastectomies. In her amendment it says:\n\n       [I]n order to provide for uniform treatment of health care \n     providers and patients among the States, it is necessary to \n     cover health plans operating in 1 State as well as health \n     plans operating among [all] States.\n\n  So perhaps we could find a distinction. I know the Senator believes \nstrongly that is the kind of coverage we should have for women. But \ncould the Senator possibly explain to me how we could justify \nsupporting that particular provision and not say we need similar \nprotection for children? Are we missing something on this? They will \nsay: We will do it for this.\n  Right above that it says:\n\n       [H]ealth care providers located in a State serve patients \n     who reside in the State and [also] patients who reside in \n     other States. . . .\n\n  What they are acknowledging is, people move from State to State, so \nthey are going to provide for them.\n  It talks about the amendment covering all health plans. What is the \nrationale? Can the Senator tell me?\n  Mrs. BOXER. The only rationale I could find--I was here when my \nfriend asked Senator Abraham the same question--this Republican plan \nhas been pieced together. It makes no sense. It is a political \nresponse, I believe, to the Democratic proposal. They looked at this \nissue, and they said: OK, when it comes to mastectomies, we'll make our \nplan apply to everybody.\n  But, by the way, if you get ovarian cancer, under the Republican plan \nyou do not get the benefits. If a man gets prostate cancer, he doesn't \nget the benefits. If you are a little child and you have a rare form of \ncancer, like one of my constituents, Carley Christie--and there were \nonly a couple doctors who knew how to handle it--you are out of luck.\n  They say leave it to the States? Fine. If the States want to do a \ngood job, we are happy. We are just setting a floor in this bill, as \nthe Senator from Massachusetts points out.\n  So I can only respond by saying their approach is pieced together. It \nis a political response to a real issue. They are doing the least they \ncan do to try to say, with a straight face, they have done something. \nThe bottom line is, their bill is hollow, and if my friend's amendment \ndoes not pass, it will make virtually no difference to most of the \npeople in this country.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I finally yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I was going to hold up my own chart, but I would \nrather ask the Senator from Massachusetts, could you just give me the \nfigures?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. You have your Minnesota figures there.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I enjoyed when you said: I just happen to have figures \nhere.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As the Senator well knows, the State of Minnesota has \n3,400,000 privately insured persons and 1,986,000 not covered. So you \nare going to have some 58 percent--58 percent will not be covered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The reason I asked my colleague for those figures is, \nthat is over half the State's population.\n\n[[Page S8461]]\n\n  Minnesota does better than some other States in terms of the number \nof families that would be covered under the Republican plan because we \nhave more people who are self-insured.\n  But let me just be clear about this. The Senator from Massachusetts \nhas made it clear that our amendment provides basic protection for \nevery family in the country. We want some kind of floor. Any State that \nwants to do better, any State that wants to do better by way of \nprotecting children, more access to specialty services, stronger \nconsumer protection, can do so. But this amendment is an amendment to \nmake sure that every family in the United States of America has some \nbasic protection. Is that correct?\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Let me just ask the Senator from Massachusetts one \nmore question to finally put this debate in sharp focus--if we are \ngoing to have a debate. I do not know that we will.\n  Do you believe there is some correlation between the fact that the \nplan we now have on the floor of the Senate, the Daschle-Kennedy \nDemocratic plan, altogether covers an additional 113 million people and \nthe Republican plan only covers 48 million people altogether? The \nRepublican plan provides as little coverage as possible to people. Is \nthat why all the consumer organizations, all the provider \norganizations, doctors and nurses, support our plan and the insurance \nindustry is the only interested party that supports the Republican \nplan? Do you believe there is any correlation on this whole question of \nhow many people are covered?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I think the Senator is correct in his statement. It is \nbasically because the industry is putting its profits ahead of the \nprotection of the patients.\n  We had reaffirmation yesterday, in an indirect way, with the \npublication of an article in the medical journal JAMA, that says the \nfor-profit HMOs provide a good deal less service for the coverage of \nindividuals than those which are not-for-profit. It is, I think, a kind \nof intuitive, self-evident factor that this is taking place.\n  I would be glad to yield time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would like to take 3 more minutes if I may.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am advised by my friend and colleague, 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is fine. That is all we have left?\n  Mr. REID. We have 7 and a half minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will do it in 1 minute. Then I will pass it on to \nothers.\n  Let me just finish my line of questioning by saying here on the floor \nof the Senate that one of the things I have been most interested in as \na Senator from Minnesota is reform and how to revitalize democracy, how \nto make sure that the Government belongs to the people, how to make \nsure that the Senate belongs to the people.\n  I really do believe that this vote on this amendment about whether or \nnot we are going to cover all the families in our country and provide \nthem with some basic protection, so that they can make sure they \nthemselves and their loved ones receive the care they need and deserve, \nis a test case as to whether or not we have a system of democracy for \nthe many or democracy for the few.\n  This vote ultimately is about more than health care. This is a vote \nabout whether the Senate belongs to people in Minnesota and people in \nMassachusetts and people in New York and people in North Carolina or \nwhether it belongs to the insurance industry. It is that simple.\n  I hope every citizen will hold all of us accountable for how we vote \nand whom we represent and for whom we fight.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. On behalf of Senator Kennedy, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to \nSenator Dorgan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. REID. Could we change that to 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized \nfor 2 minutes.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Senator Kennedy has been talking about the issue of the \nnumber of Americans who would be covered under these two competing \nproposals. The point I have made in the past in quoting the USA Today \neditorial is the same point that a number of us have made: The fact is, \nour opponents' plan does not cover most of the American people. They \nsay: Well, the States provide protection for those their bill leaves \nout. But the facts do not bear that out.\n  My preference would be that if they do not want to legislate in the \narea of health care, just say that. Do not make a pretense of coming \nover here and saying, we support all these issues, we support each and \nevery one of them but then vote against the kinds of reforms that will \nreally accomplish them.\n  My understanding is that the amendment we just agreed to by Senator \nSnowe on the issue of breast cancer covers everyone in the country. Why \ncover all Americans on just that issue? Apparently you are willing to \nprovide some protection for everyone on only that one issue but you are \nunwilling to cover everyone when it comes to all of the other issues. I \ndo not understand that.\n  I wish I had the time to again show you the pictures of real victims \nof our current system to illustrate that this debate is not about \ntheory; it is about real people. Unfortunately, I do not have the time. \nBut this debate is about what kind of treatment patients will get in a \nhealth care system that in some cases--not in all, but in some cases--\nhas put profits ahead of patients' medical needs.\n  Some in this Chamber say these stories don't matter. We stand with \ninsurance companies. We stand with profits, and we don't believe \npatients need protection.\n  Others of us believe very strongly that it is time to provide the \nkinds of protections on a uniform basis that patients ought to expect \nwhen they purchase insurance or when they receive insurance through \ntheir employer.\n  Again, to those who have spent this week fuzzing up this debate, if \nyou don't like the Federal Government legislating in this area, just \nsay that. Don't bring a bunch of empty vessels to the floor of the \nSenate and then pretend they do something because you know better.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 2 minutes has expired.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Joshua Segall, \nan intern in the office of Senator Paul Wellstone, be granted the \nprivilege of the floor today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. How much time does the minority have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from New \nYork and, following that, 2 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator from Nevada.\n  There are two crucial numbers to look at as we debate this entire \nbill: 48 and 161--48 million Americans covered by the Republican plan, \n161 million Americans covered by the Democratic plan. We are saying 70 \npercent of all Americans will get no protection.\n  Do we say 70 percent of all Americans are not covered by minimum \nwage? Do we say 70 percent of all Americans are not covered by Social \nSecurity? Do we say 70 percent of all Americans do not get child labor \nlaws applied to them, do not get the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts \napplied to them? I have never heard anything such as this in my life--\ntake a proposal needed by all people and arbitrarily say 30 percent of \nAmericans will be covered and 70 percent of Americans will not.\n  This vote on the amendment of the Senator from Massachusetts will be \nthe most crucial vote in the entire debate, because it will determine, \ndo we really wish to cover all Americans.\n  Should only 30 percent of Americans get the right to emergency room \ncare? Should only 30 percent of Americans get the right to see a \nspecialist? Should only 30 percent of women get to treat an OB/GYN as \ntheir primary care specialist? Who would agree with that?\n  Anyone who votes against the amendment of the Senator from \nMassachusetts, anyone who votes for the Republican plan is arbitrarily, \nunfairly,\n\n[[Page S8462]]\n\nand inhumanely cutting off 70 percent of all Americans.\n  The cost: $2 a month. The cost argument is bogus.\n  The real issue is, who will be covered and who will not be. Under \nthis plan, we cover 161 million; they cover 48 million.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Nothing more must be said.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this is, indeed, the most important vote \nwith respect to this issue. I congratulate my colleague from \nMassachusetts for his extraordinary leadership in putting this issue \nbefore the American people.\n  It is extraordinary to me; in the years I have been in the Senate, I \nthink this is perhaps the single most contradictory, craven moment, in \nsome regards, before the Senate. To come to the Senate and suggest you \nare going to have a Patients' Bill of Rights that in State after State \nafter State leaves out 77, 80 percent, 89 percent of the American \npeople is a contradiction on its face that denies any kind of \nreasonableness. I think most people in America will understand that our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle have spent more time and \nenergy protecting the right to bear arms than the right for citizens to \nget decent medical care.\n  What will happen in this legislation if the Republican charade \npasses--and they have the votes--is, once again, the American people \nwill be left behind and business--and business only, the bottom line--\nwill be the victor.\n  They are going to suggest there are costs, there is administrative \noverhead. We are going to go through the whole ``Harry and Louise'' \nthing again. Literally millions of dollars are being spent to scare \nAmericans and confuse them.\n  When it is convenient for the Republicans, they love the \nCongressional Budget Office. The Congressional Budget Office provides \nthe best figures, the most neutral and independent assessment of \nexpenditures. But here, the Congressional Budget Office comes out and \nsays the real costs of this are only 3 to 13 cents per month per \nbeneficiary. There isn't an American I know who wouldn't pay 3 to 13 \ncents to have the decent kind of coverage and the protections they need \nin order to guarantee that coverage in a health care system that has \nrun amok.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Who yields \ntime?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains for each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 2 minutes, \nand the Senator from Tennessee has 15.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this amendment really gets to the heart of \nthe debate: how many Americans will we leave behind when it comes to \nreforming our health insurance protection.\n  Senator Kennedy and Senator Daschle offer an amendment which will \nreform health insurance plans across the country. The Republican side \nof the aisle would leave behind 113 million Americans. They argue that \nthese families should not be protected by a national standard. Just by \naccident of birth or residence, some people would be disqualified.\n  Who are we talking about? We are talking about people such as the \nself-employed, small businesspeople, and farmers, those who have a \ntough enough time securing health insurance. They pay higher premiums \nfor it, and they are not in a good position to really bargain when it \ncomes to buying their health insurance.\n  This amendment gets to the heart of which party and which approach \nreally care for American families and the challenges they face. I \nsupport Senator Kennedy and Senator Daschle in this effort.\n  I just left the chatroom right off the floor of the Senate, where \npeople have been, through the Internet and by telephone, calling in \nfrom across the United States. I think many people on the Republican \nside of the aisle have not really taken into consideration how \nimportant this issue is to Americans. They can vote with the insurance \nindustry, and a Republican majority can defeat us on these amendments, \nbut eventually they will have to go face the same families who I have \nspoken to and who write to my office--families who worry on a daily \nbasis about whether their doctors are making medical decisions or the \ndecisions are being made by insurance company professionals.\n  This amendment, which is about protecting all insured Americans, is \none I am proud to support. The idea of picking and choosing the winners \nand losers across America is inconsistent with the policy that we \nshould have coming out of this Chamber.\n  I hope a handful of Republican Senators will come forward and join \nthe minority on the Democratic side and enact a bipartisan approach \nthat is sensible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Who yields \ntime?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes, followed by \nSenator Gramm for 10.\n  The issue we are talking about is an amendment which came on the \nfloor about 50 minutes ago. We are currently looking very carefully at \nthat amendment. It is the first time we have seen the amendment. It \ncomes down to a critically important issue, and that is one of scope.\n  We have a Patients' Bill of Rights. We have spent much of yesterday \nand the day before and this morning on what those rights should be. Are \nthey consumer protections? Are they patient protections, gag clauses, \naccess to specialists, access to emergency rooms, poststabilization in \nemergency rooms, continuity of care? We have talked about the issues of \nthe internal and external appeals process. All are very important.\n  Now we turn to this underlying discussion of scope. We have heard \nagain and again that our bill excludes a large number of people. No. 1, \nthe whole information section of our bill applies to all 124 million \npeople, the information to understand what is in that insurance policy, \nin that contract.\n  On the whole issue of genetic discrimination, something the other \nside has not even mentioned, again we apply it to all 124 million \npeople. Why? Because it has not been adequately addressed in the United \nStates of America today because projects such as the human genome \nproject are just coming on line. Yet in advance we want to make sure \nthat an insurance company does not use a predictive test in some way to \neither exclude somebody or raise policies.\n  No. 3, the internal and external appeals process, the whole \naccountability process, grievance procedures, inside, outside, applies \nto all 124 million people.\n  The issue which has been discussed over the last 40 to 45 minutes is \nthat of the 48 million people who are uncovered today by State plans, \ncannot be regulated by State plans. It is to those 48 million people \nthat we address the patient protections of gag clauses, access to \nemergency rooms, continuity of care, poststabilization in the emergency \nroom. That is the focus. In our bill, internal and external appeals \ncovers everybody; discrimination, everybody; information, everybody; \nrecover the uncovered, regulate the unregulated.\n\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, will the Senator from Texas yield before \nstarting?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we have now listened to the minority use up \ntheir time. I think it is time for us to speak. So with all due \nrespect, I didn't ask for them to yield on their time. I don't yield on \nmy time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we have heard, for the last hour, in almost \ntearful terms, our colleagues talk about how in the amendment they now \nhave before us ``we are down to the heart of what separates the two \nparties.''\n  Well, I don't know whether it is the heart, or the lungs, or the \nliver, but we are sure down to what separates the two parties. Our \ncolleague from Massachusetts has a sign that talks about how we are not \nprotecting Tennessee. That is interesting because Tennessee protected \nitself by electing one of the Nation's premier physicians to represent \nthem in the Senate and to become the Nation's foremost spokesman\n\n[[Page S8463]]\n\non health care. Yet Senator Kennedy believes he is somehow here to \nprotect the people of Tennessee. I don't think they elected Senator \nKennedy. I think they elected Senator Frist. I think they elected him \nbecause he does represent their views.\n  What is in this amendment that is supposed to be the heart of what \ndefines the two parties? Well, it is very interesting. It is about two \nthings. No. 1, they want to raise taxes about $5 billion. That does \ndefine the difference between the two parties. Whether it is the heart \nof the difference, or some other body part, I don't know. But the first \nthing that is different--and they are speaking in such passionate, \ntearful tones about it--is they want to raise taxes by $5 billion on \nthis amendment.\n  So to take them at their word, if you want to know the difference \nbetween the two parties, the difference between the two parties is that \nthey, by their own words and deeds and amendments, are the party that \nwants to raise taxes in the Senate. The tax burden is at the highest \nlevel in American history, but it is not high enough to suit them. They \nwant $5 billion, and they want to take it $50 per household in America, \nand they want it in this amendment. That is the first thing they say \ndefines the heart of the difference between the two parties.\n  The second thing they say defines the heart of the difference--and I \nagree with them--is that when they read the Constitution, they quit \nreading too soon because what the Constitution says in the tenth \namendment is that those powers not specifically delegated to the \nFederal Government are reserved for the States and for the people.\n  Why is that relevant? Why it is relevant is, despite all the efforts \nto confuse people, under existing law, the States regulate insurance. \nThere is a Federal statute that carves out between 40 and 50 million \ninsurance policies where the companies actually underwrite the \npolicies--a law called ERISA--where the Federal Government in these \ncircumstances established its primacy and its jurisdiction so that the \nState legislature of Tennessee, and the State legislature of Texas, and \nthe State legislature of all the States in the Union are prohibited \nfrom legislating in these ERISA plans where the company assumes \nliability for the insurance.\n  What we have done in our bill is, where the States can't reach, we \nhave passed a bill that guarantees patients' rights, including the one \nright the Democrats preclude. The Democrats will let a patient look in \nthe phone books' Blue Pages and call the Government if they are unhappy \nwith an HMO, and they will let them look under ``attorneys'' in the \nYellow Pages and hire an attorney if they are unhappy with an HMO; but \nthe Democrats don't give them the freedom to fire the HMO. We give them \nthat freedom.\n  Now, we have written a bill that is aimed at dealing with the part of \nthis problem that comes under the Federal Government. Our Democrat \ncolleagues are very unhappy because they want a national health plan. \nThey believe Senator Kennedy and President Clinton know everything \nthere is to know about health care, that Dr. Frist knows nothing about \nhealth care, and they would like to write health care policy for Texas.\n\n  Now, they want to do it without the inconvenience of having to move \nto Texas, pay taxes in Texas, and run for office in Texas. They want to \nassume that if you are elected to the Senate from Massachusetts, that \nallows you to tell people in Tennessee how insurance ought to be \nregulated, and that allows you to tell people in Texas how things ought \nto be. Now, Texas has already passed a comprehensive patients' bill of \nrights, but that doesn't stop those elected to the Senate from some \nother State from the right to come in and say to Texas: You don't know \nwhat you are doing, you don't know anything about health care, and you \ndon't care about the people of Texas.\n  Having been elected in Massachusetts, they care about people from \nTexas; but they believe the people in the senate and the house of the \nTexas Legislature are somehow deficient in caring to suit them. So the \nsecond thing they differ on is that while States throughout the Union \nhave tried to tailor their programs to meet their individual needs, the \nDemocrats would have us say: Take everything Texas has done, everything \nMaine has done, everything the 43 States have enacted, and the other \nStates that are about to act, and throw it in the trash can because all \nwisdom emanates from Washington.\n  So this ``heart'' of the difference between the two parties that we \nhave been listening to for an hour really boils down to two \ndifferences. They want to raise taxes by another $50 per family on the \namendment they just offered and they want to say to States: We are \ngoing to take away from you a right that has been historically \nguaranteed under Federal law and under the tenth amendment to the \nConstitution, which allows States, in the area of insurance where they \nregulate, to state their own policy, to decide what kind of policies \nthey want operating within their own State borders.\n  Our colleagues have decided taxes are too low and that we don't have \nenough Federal regulation. So what they would do is attempt to \nsubstitute Federal mandates for what our Texas Legislature has decided, \nwhich would be dictated and enforced by Federal bureaucrats.\n  With all due respect, who is doing a poorer job than HCFA in \nregulating health care in America? Who is doing a poorer job than we \nare doing at the Federal level?\n  Our approach is an approach which says where we have responsibility, \nwhere only we can deal with a problem, we have put together a \ncomprehensive program that makes sense. Granted, we didn't do a public \nopinion poll; we didn't get together focus groups and try to say if you \nran a 30-second TV ad on this subject, would people tend to agree with \nit? We have Dr. Frist. We have Susan Collins. We have Jim Jeffords. We \nsat down for over a year with people who knew something about the \nproblem and we wrote a bill we believe people will be glad we wrote 10 \nyears from now. But the reality is that there are two differences \nDemocrats want to highlight today. There are two things they claim \nrepresent the heart of what separates the two parties.\n  They believe taxes ought to be higher. So they raise taxes by $5 \nbillion with this amendment.\n  Second, they don't believe that Maine ought to set its health policy. \nThese people in Maine don't understand health, and they don't care \nabout people in Maine. Only people in Massachusetts care about people \nin Maine. Only people in Massachusetts care about people in Texas. And \nwe don't understand it.\n  They are right. We don't understand it. We don't accept it. We reject \nit.\n  If the best they can do in telling us what is right with them and \nwhat is wrong with us is that they want higher taxes and they want to \ntell every State in the Union how to run health care, they are going to \nbe in the minority a very long time.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a dialog?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nWyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I believe I asked a question.\n  Mr. GRAMM. The Senator has no time.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I not be \ninterrupted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is that the time shall be \ncontrolled by the managers, and time has been yielded to the Senator \nfrom Wyoming.\n  Mr. KERRY. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Could we have regular order, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is unable to propound a \nparliamentary inquiry. Time has been yielded to the Senator from \nWyoming.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Patrick \nThompson, my HELP subcommittee staff person, and Mark Battalini, my \nlegislative fellow, be granted floor privileges during debate on S. \n1344, the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S8464]]\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President. I rise in opposite to this amendment. Among \nthe handful of principles that are fundamental to any true protection \nfor health care consumers, probably the most important is allowing \nstates to continue in their role as the primary regulator of health \ninsurance.\n  This is a principle which has been recognized--and respected--for \nmore than 50 year. In 1945, Congress passed the McCarran-Ferguson Act, \na clear acknowledgement by the federal government that states are \nindeed the most appropriate regulators of health insurance. It was \nacknowledged that states are better able to understand their consumers' \nneeds and concerns. It was determined that states are more responsive, \nmore effective enforces of consumer protections. And, as if we need to \nre-learn this lesson yet again, it is usually for the best when we let \neach state respond to the needs of its own consumers. State \nlegislatures are watching, wondering how far we are going to dip into \ntheir authority.\n  As recently as this year, this matter of fact was re-affirmed by the \nGeneral Accounting Office. GAO testified before the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee, saying, ``In brief, we found that many \nstates have responded to managed care consumers' concerns about access \nto health care and information disclosure. However, they often differ \nin their specific approaches, in scope and in form.''\n  Wyoming has its own unique set of health care needs and concerns. \nBut, despite our elevation, we don't need the mandate regarding skin \ncancer that Florida has on the hooks. My favorite illustration of just \nhow crazy a nationalized system of health care mandates would be comes \nfrom my own time in the Wyoming Legislature. It's about a mandate that \nI voted for and still support today. You see, unlike in Massachusetts \nor California, for example, in Wyoming we have few health care \nproviders; and their numbers virtually dry up as you head out of town. \nSo, we passed an any willing provider law that requires health plans to \ncontract with any provider in Wyoming who's willing to do so. While \nthat idea may sound strange to my ears in any other context, it was the \nright thing to do for Wyoming. But I know it's not the right thing to \ndo for Massachusetts or California, so I wouldn't dream of asking time \nto shoulder that kind of mandate for our sake when we can simply, \nresponsibly, apply it within our borders.\n  An extra, unnecessary layer of mandates, whether they be for certain \nkinds of coverage or for a protection that not everybody needs or \nwants, are so-called ``protections'' we simply shouldn't force people \nto pay for. If we were all paying for skin cancer screenings that only \na few of us need or want, or if we were all paying for any willing \nprovider mandates that only some of us need to assure access, then we'd \nall be one of two things--either over-charged, not-so-savvy consumers, \nor we'd be uninsured.\n  As consumers, we should be downright angry at how some of our elected \nofficials are responding to our concerns about the quality of our \nhealth care and the alarming problem of the uninsured in this country. \nIt is being suggested that all of our local needs will be magically met \nby stomping on the good work of the states through the imposition of an \nexpanded, unenforceable federal bureaucracy--kind of a one-size-fits-\nall plan. It was complicated before.\n\n  This is an overlay of how the plan will work under the Democratic \nplan. It is considerably more complex and considerably tougher to deal \nwith. It is being suggested that our local needs would be magically met \nby stomping on the good ground of the States that have kept it simple \nand have the bureaucracy already in place.\n  It is being suggested the American consumers would prefer to dial a \n1-800 number to nowhere versus calling their State insurance \ncommissioner, real people who can be talked to each time you call. You \ndon't have to repeat the same ground to bring them up to speed on where \nthe problem is, and chances are because they know you they will get it \nsolved right away. They are the people you meet in the grocery store \nafter church on Sundays.\n  As for the uninsured population in this country, carelessly slapping \ndown a massive new bureaucracy on our states does nothing more than \nsquelch their efforts to create innovative and flexible ways to get \nmore people insured. We should be doing everything we can to encourage \nand support these efforts by states. We certainly shouldn't be throwing \nup roadblocks.\n  And how about enforcement of the minority's proposal?\n  One of the findings of the amendment reads as follows, ``It would be \ninappropriate to set federal health insurance standards that not only \nduplicate the responsibility of the 50 State insurance departments but \nthat also would have to be enforced by the Health Care Financing \nAdministration (HCFA) if a State fails to enact the standard.''\n  That is a name you hear thrown around a lot because HCFA has some \nproblems. HCFA is as much as 10 years late in sending out some notices \nwhich they need to send. They are already overburdened. If you don't \nbelieve me, talk to the people who are working with home health care, \nanother area of health that is very important. They will tell you how \nHCFA is able to solve their problem. They are going out of business \nbecause of HCFA.\n  In other words, not only is it being suggested that we trample the \ntraditional, overwhelmingly appropriate authority of the states with a \nthree-fold expansion of the federal reach into our nation's health \ncare, they want HCFA to be in charge. HCFA, the agency that leaves \npatients screaming, has doctors quitting Medicare, and, lest we not \nforget, is the agency in charge as the Medicare Program plunges towards \nbankruptcy.\n  And you want to give them all of this now, too?\n  I could go on at length about the very real dangers of empowering \nHCFA to swoop into the private market with its embarrassing record of \npatient protection and enforcement of quality standards. For example, \nit took ten years for HCFA to implement a 1987 law establishing new \nnursing home standards intended to improve the quality of care for some \nof our most vulnerable patients. According to the General Accounting \nOffice, HCFA missed 25 percent of its implementation deadlines for the \nconsumer and quality improvements to the Medicare Program which were \nrequired under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.\n  Even more alarming is that HCFA is still using health and safety \nstandards for the treatment of end-stage kidney disease that are 23 \nyears old. Equally astonishing is that HCFA has yet to update its 1985 \nfire safety standards for hospitals. HCFA is a federal bureaucracy at \nits worst, making it the last place to which we want our consumer \nprotection responsibilities to revert--let alone complicating it such \nas this.\n\n  To me, the message is pretty clear. Expanding the role of the Federal \nGovernment well beyond its lawful authority would be a big mistake.\n  The scope of Federal authority under the Employment Retirement Income \nSecurity Act, ERISA, with regard to the regulation of health care, is \nwell understood. Duplicating, complicating, and ultimately unraveling \n50 years of State experience and subsequent action makes no sense. For \nthose of my colleagues who think no one is bothered by that, I and 117 \nmillion Americans currently protected by State health insurance beg to \ndiffer.\n  Our Federal responsibility lies with those 48 million consumers who \nfall outside the jurisdiction of the State regulation. That is our \nscope. That is our charge. That is what the States are politely \nreminding Members of now. If we go through with this, they may remind \nus less politely.\n  In March of this year, the National Association of Insurance \nCommissioners implored Members to not make a mess of what they have \ndone for health care consumers, saying:\n\n       The states have already adopted statutory and regulatory \n     protections for consumers in fully insured plans and have \n     tailored these protections to fit the needs of their states' \n     consumers and health care marketplaces. In addition, many \n     states are supplementing their existing protections during \n     the current legislative session based upon particular \n     circumstances within their own states. We do not want states \n     to be preempted by Congressional or administrative actions.\n\n  I am stunned that their pleas is so easy for some to ignore.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Maine.\n\n[[Page S8465]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I start by commending the Senator from \nWyoming for his excellent statement. He has provided Members with a \nvery clear explanation of the issue that is before the Senate.\n  I am disappointed to hear my friends and colleagues from the \nDemocratic side of the aisle once again completely disregard and, \nindeed, belittle the tremendous efforts that the 50 States have made to \nprotect health care consumers. It is disappointing to once again hear \nSenator Kennedy completely ignore the good work of the States in this \narea.\n  The health committee bill builds upon the good work that the States \nhave undertaken to protect health care consumers. Our legislation \nprovides the key protections that consumers want, without causing costs \nto soar so high that we add to the growing number of uninsured \nAmericans. We would apply the protections responsibly where they are \nneeded.\n  Current Federal law prohibits States from acting to regulate and to \nprovide consumer protections in self-funded plans. They are covered by \nFederal law, by ERISA, which specifically prohibits the States from \nacting in this area.\n  The States have had the primary responsibility for regulation of \nhealth insurance since the 1940s, more than 50 years. I served for 5 \nyears in State government as commissioner of a department that included \nthe Bureau of Insurance. I know how hard the civil servants at the \nBureau of Insurance worked to protect Maine consumers. I know Maine \nhealth care consumers who are having problems with their insurance \ncompanies' coverage or have a dispute would rather call the Bureau of \nInsurance in Gardiner, ME, than have to go through the maze of the \nERISA office in Boston. That is what this debate is about.\n  The fact is, the States have done a good job of responding to the \nneeds and concerns of their citizens. In fact, every single State has \ndebated and enacted legislation to protect health care consumers. That \nhas been totally ignored by our friends on the other side of the aisle.\n  This chart shows the enormous number of State laws regulating health \ninsurance. There are more than 1,400 State health insurance mandates--\nmore than 1,400. Every single State has enacted legislation to protect \nhealth care consumers by mandating either specific coverages or \nspecific procedures. It is not as if the States have ignored this \nresponsibility. In fact, they have acted far ahead of Washington. They \nhave acted without any prod from Washington. They have acted \nresponsibly and swiftly--indeed, much more quickly than we have--to \nprotect their consumers.\n  The next chart shows State laws protecting parties are extremely \ncommon. This chart demonstrates 47 States have passed laws prohibiting \ngag clauses that restrict communications between patients and their \ndoctors. This is something I think every single Member of the Senate \ncan agree on: Gag clauses should be prohibited. Mr. President, 47 \nStates have acted to do just that; 50 States have consumer grievance \nprocedure laws; 28 have external appeals; 36 have direct access to OB/\nGYN; 40 States have provisions dealing with access to emergency rooms.\n  The States have acted. They have acted in a way to tailor their laws \nto the problems within their particular State. These problems vary from \nState to State. We have rural States such as those represented by my \nfriend from Wyoming which do not have a high penetration of managed \ncare. Therefore, imposing all these burdensome new regulations is not \nnecessary. In other States where managed care represents a high degree \nor a high concentration of the coverage provided, there may be a need \nfor many more State laws.\n  The point is that the States have acted. They have acted without any \nmandate or prod from Washington, and they have acted in a way so as to \ntailor their laws to their marketplace. One size does not fit all. We \ndo not know what is best for every State-regulated plan. What may be \nappropriate in one State may not be necessary in another.\n  A State that has been mentioned today, Florida, provides for a direct \naccess to a dermatologist. That is because Florida has a very high rate \nof skin cancer. That mandate makes a great deal of sense in the State \nof Florida. It does not make much sense in many northern States where \nother problems occur and need to be addressed.\n  That is why the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, \nwhich is a bipartisan group, supports the approach that we have taken \nin our health committee bill. In a March letter to the chairman of the \nhealth committee, the NAIC pointed out:\n\n       The states have already adopted statutory and regulatory \n     protections for consumers in fully insured plans and have \n     tailored these protections to fit the needs of their states' \n     consumers and health care marketplaces. In addition, many \n     states are supplementing their existing protections during \n     the current legislative session based upon particular \n     circumstances within their own states. We do not want states \n     to be preempted by Congressional actions.\n\n  The letter continues:\n\n       It is our belief that states should and will continue the \n     efforts to develop creative, flexible, market-sensitive \n     protections for health consumers in fully insured plans, and \n     Congress should focus attention on those consumers who have \n     no protections in self-funded ERISA plans.\n\n  That is precisely the approach taken in our Republican bill. We \nrecognize the States cannot protect those health care consumers who are \ncovered in self-funded ERISA plans. That is why we need to act on the \nFederal level. That is why we need to pass health care protections to \nreach those consumers whom the States cannot protect.\n  We received a letter today from the Republican Governors' \nAssociation. I ask unanimous consent to have that letter printed in the \nRecord following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Ms. COLLINS. Let me quote from the letter because I think it captures \nthe issue before the Senate.\n\n       As Congress begins debate on managed care reform \n     legislation, we would like to emphasize our confidence in \n     states' achievements in managed care and ask that any \n     legislation you consider preserve state authority and \n     innovation. We applaud the Republican Leadership's efforts to \n     complement the states' reforms by expanding managed care \n     protections to self-insured plans without preempting state \n     authority.\n       Historically, regulating private insurance has been the \n     responsibility of the states. Many, if not all of the ideas \n     under consideration now in Congress, have been considered by \n     states. Because the saturation of managed care is different \n     throughout the nation, each state has its own unique issues \n     relative to its market place. We have concerns about the \n     unintended consequences of imposing one-size-fits-all \n     standards on states which could result in increasing the \n     number of uninsured and increasing health care costs.\n       As Governors, we have taken the reports of abuses in \n     managed care seriously and have addressed specific areas of \n     importance to our citizens.\n\n  That is exactly the issue before us. We do need to act to protect \nthose consumers who are beyond the reach of State regulation. We do not \nand should not act to preempt the good work done by our States.\n  Another issue that is before us, raised by the Kennedy one-size-fits-\nall approach, is what if a State has made an affirmative decision not \nto act in one of the areas which Senator Kennedy would impose upon that \nmarketplace? What if the legislature, perhaps even a legislature \ncontrolled by the Senator's own party, has reached the decision that a \nparticular mandate is not appropriate for that State and would increase \nhealth care costs?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I know there are \nothers waiting to speak. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                             Republican Governors Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 14, 1999.\n     Hon. Don Nickles,\n     Assistant Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     U.S. Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nickles: As Congress begins debate on managed \n     care reform legislation, we would like to emphasize our \n     confidence in states' achievements in managed care and ask \n     that any legislation you consider preserve state authority \n     and innovation. We applaud the Republican Leadership's \n     efforts to complement the states' reforms by expanding \n     managed care protections to self-insured plans without \n     preempting state authority.\n       Historically, regulating private insurance has been the \n     responsibility of the states.\n\n[[Page S8466]]\n\n     Many, if not all of the ideas under consideration now in \n     Congress, have been considered by states. Because the \n     saturation of managed care is different throughout the \n     nation, each state has its own unique issues relative to its \n     market place. We have concerns about the unintended \n     consequences of imposing one-size-fits-all standards on \n     states which could result in increasing the number of \n     uninsured and increasing health care costs.\n       As Governors, we have taken the reports of abuses in \n     managed care seriously and have addressed specific areas of \n     importance to our citizens. As you know, some analysts \n     estimate that private health insurance premiums could grow \n     from the current 6 percent to double-digit increases later \n     this year. This does not include the costs of any new federal \n     mandates. Health resources are limited.\n       We hope the Congress' well-intended efforts take into \n     account the states' successful and historical role in \n     regulating health insurance.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Frank Keating,\n\n                                             Governor of Oklahoma,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n                                                   Ed Schafer,\n\n                                         Governor of North Dakota,\n                                                    Vice Chairman.\n\n                                                Don Sundquist,\n\n                                            Governor of Tennessee,\n                              Chairman RGA Health Care Issue Team.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise to alert those who followed the \nminority's debate earlier. It was not only confusing but most \ninaccurate as to scope. The Democrats claim: ``The Republican plan \nwould only apply to 48 million Americans.''\n  This is accurate for one aspect, but it ignores many extremely \nimportant provisions. Further, charges regarding actions by the \ninsurance industry were not only inaccurate but totally baseless.\n  Let me set forth what the scope of the protections actually is.\n  The Republican plan contains nine major patient protection \nprovisions. One of the nine major components has six new access \nstandards to ERISA for the 48 million in self-insured plans that State \nconsumer protection standards cannot reach.\n  These include: the prudent layman's standard for emergency care; a \nmandatory point of service option; direct access to OB/GYNs; direct \naccess to pediatricians; a continuity of care provision; and a \nprohibition of gag rules.\n  The majority of Americans already enjoy these protections, since most \nof the states have already adopted these standards through their \nregulation of health insurance companies.\n  The other major components of the Patients' Bill of Rights provide \nsignificant new protections for millions of Americans. Of these, some \nprovisions are not even included in the Democratic bill. The provisions \ninclude:\n  1. A new health plan comparative information requirement to benefit \nall 124 million Americans covered by group health plans under ERISA;\n  2. Grievance procedures and internal and external appeal rights for \nall 124 million Americans covered by group health plans under ERISA;\n  3. Providing all 140 million Americans covered by group and \nindividual health plans with new rights that will prevent \ndiscrimination based on predictive genetic information; and\n  4. Benefit all 270 million Americans by providing a stronger emphasis \non quality improvement in our health care system with a refocused role \nfor AHCPR.\n  The GOP plan creates new enforceable federal health care standards to \ncover those 48 million of the 124 million Americans covered by ERISA \nplans that the states, through their regulation of private health \ninsurance companies, under the McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945, cannot \nprotect. We feel that it would be inappropriate to set federal health \ninsurance standards that not only duplicate the responsibility of the \n50 state insurance departments--but, that we know from a new GAO report \nwon't be enforced.\n  The Democrats, by contrast, would set health insurance standards that \nduplicate the responsibility of the 50 state insurance departments and \nmandate that HCFA enforce them if a state decides not to adopt them. \nBuilding a dual system of overlapping state and federal health \ninsurance regulation is in no one's best interest.\n  The federal regulators at HCFA have faced an overwhelming new set of \nhealth insurance duties under HIPAA. In the five states that have \nfailed to or chosen not to pass the legislation required by HIPAA \n(California, Massachusetts, Michigan, Rhode Island, and Missouri), the \nHCFA is now required to act as insurance regulator for the state HIPAA \nprovisions.\n  A GAO report that I released found that HCFA officials have confessed \nthat their agency has thus far pursued a ``minimalist'' approach to \nregulating health insurance standards under HIPAA, and they attribute \nits limited involvement to a lack of experienced staff, as well as \nuncertainly about its actual regulatory authority.\n  There is a related concern that HCFA cannot fulfill its \nresponsibilities for administering the Medicare program. At a July \n16th, 1998 House Ways and Means hearing, HCFA's administrator stated \nthat she intended to postpone the development of a Medicare prospective \npayment system for outpatient hospital care and home health services; \nthe consolidated billing for physician and other Medicare part B \nservices in nursing homes; and a new fee schedule for ambulance \nservices. Delaying the implementation of these mandates will result in \nmany home health providers and other providers not receiving the \nreimbursement that they deserve. It will put many home health agencies \nin the position of having to chose between turning Medicare patients \naway and insolvency.\n  Given HCFA's demonstrated inability to carry out its current \nresponsibilities under both HIPAA and BBA, we believe it would be \nirresponsible to promise the American people that they will be able to \nreceive new federal health insurance guarantees and then rely on HCFA \nto enforce these rights when we know they can't do the job.\n  Our proposal, by keeping the regulation of health insurance where it \nbelongs--at the state level--provides the American people with a real \nPatients' Bill of Rights that they know from their personal experience \nwill be enforced. The principle that the states should continue to \nregulate the private health insurance market, and that Congress should \nonly set health care standards in those areas where the states have \nbeen preempted, guided the design of the six access standards in the \nRepublicans' Patients' Bill of Rights because we know it works.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 18 minutes remaining. Who \nyields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, there is no issue more important to the \nAmerican people than ensuring quality health care for themselves and \ntheir families. We all agree on that. It is the great common \ndenominator in our society.\n  All of us in this debate, my Democratic colleagues and my Republican \ncolleagues, want to help the people we serve. We want every citizen to \nhave access to good, affordable health care. As a member of the \nRepublican Health Care Task Force, I am very proud of the bill the \nRepublicans have brought to the floor, the Patients' Bill of Rights \nPlus.\n  I think it is important that we focus on the completeness of what \nthis bill is about, what it would do. This bill would increase the \nquality of health care, the accessibility of health care, and the \naffordability of health care for millions of Americans. Our bill \nprotects 48 million Americans whose health care plans are not now \ncovered by existing State regulations. Specifically, it provides the \nfollowing:\n  Guaranteed access to emergency room care; health plans would be \nrequired to use the prudent layperson standard for providing in-network \nand out-of-network emergency care.\n  No. 2, guaranteed access to the doctor of your choice. Under our \nbill, these health plans must provide point-of-service and continuity-\nof-care options that allow persons to see physicians outside of their \nhealth care network.\n  No. 3, access to medication. Health plans would be required to \nprovide access to noncovered drugs in cases where they are medically \nnecessary and appropriate.\n  No. 4, our plan provides access to specialists, and no gag clauses \nthat restrict doctors from discussing treatment options with their \npatients. Health plans would be required to ensure that patients have \naccess to covered specialty care within the network or, if necessary, \nthrough contractual arrangements with specialists outside\n\n[[Page S8467]]\n\nthe network. If the plan requires authorization by a primary care \nprovider, then the plan must have a defined referral and authorization \nprocess. Moreover, under our bill providers are given the unfettered \nright to discuss all treatment options with their patients.\n  No. 5, guaranteed access to an OB/GYN specialist. Health care plans \nwould be required to allow direct access to obstetricians/gynecologists \nand pediatricians without the need for referral or the plan's prior \nauthorization.\n  No. 6, timely appeals by patients who believe they were improperly \ndenied coverage. This is a key part of our bill. Our bill would allow \ntimely review of a patient's claim by medical experts not affiliated \nwith the plan. In emergencies, the review would be within 72 hours. The \ndecision of the outside review panel would be binding. This way, a sick \nor hurting patient gets the matter resolved now, quickly, rather than \nlanguishing in court proceedings for years in a typical lawsuit.\n  No. 7, it guarantees consumers access to plan information. Our bill \nrequires all group health plans to provide consumer information about \nwhat is covered, what is not covered, how much they will have to pay in \ndeductibles and in coinsurance, and how to appeal adverse coverage \ndecisions.\n  No. 8, it protects patients from being discriminated against on the \nbasis of genetic information. This is a very big part of why our bill \nis better. The Democrats do not cover this. Our bill expressly \nprohibits all health care plans and health insurers from collecting or \nusing predictive genetic information about a patient or their family to \ndeny insurance coverage or set premiums. The Democrats' bill has no \nsuch prohibition.\n\n  No. 9, changes in the Tax Code to make health care coverage more \naffordable and increase the number of people with health insurance. \nIsn't that what we are about--bringing more people on our health rolls; \nmaking quality, accessible health care affordable? If we want to help \nincrease access to health care, one thing we could do is change the Tax \nCode. The self-employed ought to be able to deduct 100 percent of \npremiums for themselves and their families. Our Patients' Bill of \nRights Plus does exactly this.\n  Our bill would give all Americans the opportunity to open a medical \nsavings account, an MSA, to save for their health care needs. Many \nAmericans work for employers who do not now offer health insurance, and \nthey must pay for it out of their own pockets. An MSA would be a \ntremendous benefit for these individuals and would greatly expand the \nnumber of individuals with coverage for their health care needs. \nAccording to the General Accounting Office, nearly one-third of the \nparticipants in the MSA pilot program authorized by Congress a couple \nof years ago had been uninsured before utilizing these tax-free \naccounts.\n  It is also time to enact full tax deductibility for premiums that \ncover long-term care. The average annual cost of caring for a person in \na nursing home is $50,000. Stories, of course, are legion of people \nexhausting their access and resorting to Medicaid to pay for nursing \ncare. We address this issue in our bill.\n  What does the Republican bill not do? There are several important \nthings that the Republican Patients' Bill of Rights does not do. Let's \nstart with liability. The Republican bill achieves the proper balance \nbetween legal rights and affordability. Our bill would preserve one of \nthe most important rights patients already possess, and that is the \nright to file a class action injunction to get coverage. The class \naction is one of the strongest protections of patient rights under \nERISA.\n  You cannot sue your way to better health care. Let me say it again. \nYou cannot sue your way to better health care. Rare are the patients \nwho can afford a legal challenge against a big, well-financed insurance \ncompany. Mr. President, 22 States including Nebraska, my State, have \nalready refused to expand liability and open up the opportunity for \ncountless, endless lawsuits.\n  The Democrat bill would make employers liable for medical \nmalpractice. That is an incredible thing. Their bill would make the \nemployer liable for medical malpractice. Patients could sue the \nemployer. I cannot think of a more certain way to drive up both the \ncost of health insurance and the number of uninsured. Small businesses \nare especially vulnerable. One huge claim could wipe them out \ncompletely. It is no surprise that in a verified recent poll of small \nbusinesses across this country, 57 percent of small businesses said \nthey would drop their health coverage rather than expose themselves to \nruin under the provisions of the Democrat health proposal.\n  The scope? Our bill does not unnecessarily duplicate State \nregulations, which adds more Federal Government mandates and increases \ncosts. We do not need more Federal mandates. We do not need more \nGovernment mandates. We need more options for the patients and better \nhealth care. Our bill targets the 48 million Americans who have self-\nfunded insurance policies. Democrats, including Vice President Gore in \na recent CNN interview, and Senators, my friends on the other side of \nthe aisle, have accused the Republican Senators of ignoring the roughly \n100 million Americans insured in other ways.\n  If the Republican Patients' Bill of Rights is so good, my friend \nSenator Kennedy asks, then why doesn't the GOP offer it to everybody? \nThe answer is quite simple: Not everybody needs what we are offering. \nState laws and insurance regulations protect the rights of patients in \nall other plans but not necessarily in self-funded plans. We protect \nthe people who need the protection. The Democrats duplicate the plans \nand protections already available under State laws.\n  Cost: Our focus should be on providing access to quality, affordable \nhealth care for more Americans. We heard a lot on the floor in the last \nfew days about quality and access, but we have heard very little about \naffordability, who can afford health care, especially from those on the \nother side of the aisle who want to talk about this. Pricing people out \nof health insurance systems is no way to improve access.\n  The rate increases that would hit individuals would also hit \nemployers. Dramatic hikes in health care costs cost employees their \njobs, and what are we doing for America when we throw people out of \nwork?\n  Back when I had a real job--and I did have a real job once; I was a \nsmall business owner--I remember poring over numerous health insurance \nplans to determine which were the best, which could I afford for my \nemployees. I have yet to meet a small business owner who does not want \nto give their employees health insurance.\n  In conclusion, as I said at the outset of my remarks, there is no \nissue more important to more Americans than ensuring quality health \ncare for themselves and their families, but in an effort to improve \nhealth care, it makes no sense to drive up costs and leave millions of \nAmericans without health insurance.\n  I look forward to the passage of the Republican bill, the Patients' \nBill of Rights Plus, and as one of the architects, one of the Senators \nwho helped write it, I am very proud of it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). The Senator's 10 minutes has \nexpired. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield me 1 minute?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield 1 minute to the majority whip.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip, the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, we \nare going to be voting on this amendment probably in another 10 \nminutes. I urge my colleagues to vote no for all the reasons that have \nbeen so amply discussed by my colleague, Senator Hagel, just a moment \nago, and Senator Collins earlier, Senator Gramm, Senator Enzi, and \nothers.\n  They are exactly right. We should not have ``one size fits all'' or \n``Government knows best.''\n  There are a couple other reasons why they should vote against the \nKennedy amendment. It is a big tax increase. I look at page 14, section \n(H) and there is a tax increase, a tax increase that boils down to \nabout $3.5 billion over the next 10 years. Section (I) on page 14 is a \ntax increase that is $1.2 billion over 10 years. Section (J), page 16, \nanother tax increase of $288 million over 10 years. If you add all that \ntogether, this amendment we will be voting on increases taxes by $5 \nbillion. I urge my colleagues to vote no on this amendment.\n\n[[Page S8468]]\n\n  I thank my friend and colleague from Vermont. I compliment him for \nhis outstanding leadership.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I, too, congratulate all those who have spoken. I do \nnot want to repeat what has been said. They said it well. In the \nRepublican bill we are not leaving 100 million people uncovered. The \nfact of the matter is, the States that have the authority under the \nlaw, under the Constitution, and under the McCarran-Ferguson Act, to \nregulate insurance do the job and do it very well.\n  What this is all about, in my mind, is arrogance. This is about \npeople walking around in Washington, DC, thinking: This is the center \nof the universe, and unless we decide what is best for all of you, you \ncretins out there in central Pennsylvania or in Wyoming or in \nTennessee, you folks just do not understand what we, the enlightened in \nWashington, know what is best for you. So we are going to impose on \nyou, State legislators, insurance commissioners, what we think you \nshould be doing, even though you have gone through the process, an \nexhaustive process.\n  Pennsylvania went through an exhaustive debate in the House and the \nSenate and with the Governor on what kinds of patient protections they \nwere going to provide for the people who were covered by State \ninsurance, those 100 million people who are ``uncovered.''\n  For the people in Pennsylvania, rest assured, there was a fine \nPatients' Bill of Rights passed by the Pennsylvania Legislature and \nsigned by Governor Ridge. In fact, I spoke with the sponsor of that \nbill over the weekend. He came up to me and said: Rick, please, please, \ndon't pass a bill that is going to wipe out what we so carefully \ncrafted that we believe is in the best interests of Pennsylvania.\n  Dr. Tim Murphy, the sponsor of the bill in the Pennsylvania Senate, \nsomeone who I think cares deeply about the concerns of children and \nconcerns of the well-being of Pennsylvanians, said: Please, don't \nundermine what we have done. Don't put a layer of bureaucracy, the \nHealth Care Financing Administration, overseeing the kinds of patient \nprotections we have passed in Pennsylvania. Please, let us do what we \ndo well, and if there are problems, we will deal with them, we will \ncome back, and we will revisit this issue--just like the issue here is \nnot over. But give us some credit that we know what is going on in our \nown States. We care about the people in Pennsylvania more than Senators \nfrom California or from Louisiana or from Massachusetts. We care about \nour people because they are our constituents.\n\n  We see a lot of examples of arrogance in Washington, of the ``we know \nbest'' attitude in this town. This is an amendment that says: \nWashington knows best. What goes on in State capitals is irrelevant \nbecause they do not really care about their constituents. If I am in \nMassachusetts, I care more about what goes on in Pennsylvania than the \nGovernor or the State legislators, State senators.\n  That is ridiculous. The fact of the matter is, the States are engaged \nactively. Frankly, they are much more active than we have been in the \nCongress. They have been actively engaged in dealing with the problems \nin their States, and we should let the States do what they do best, and \nwe should do--and the Republican bill does--what only we can do, and \nthat is to regulate ERISA plans, with patient protections and, I add, a \nlot more.\n  The one thing that really sort of irks me about this whole debate is \nthat it is not just about protecting rights with HMOs. What our bill \ndoes is much broader and deals with issues of quality and choice, \ngiving people alternatives to HMOs, not just locking them in and trying \nto fix something that may or may not be broken.\n  We say you can fire an HMO, go somewhere else, and get health care in \na different way. The Democrats will not let you do that. We do.\n  We provide tax breaks for the self-employed which, again, increases \naccess to the system. They do not. We have not only quality assurance; \nwe have choice; we have access. The thing we do not do--and I am very \nproud we do not--we do not drive up cost and drive people out of the \ninsurance market. They do.\n  On all four counts of what health care reform is supposed to be \nabout--choice, quality, access, and cost--we are the winners, not the \nother side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The time of the Senator has \nexpired. The Senator from Vermont has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time \nand ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes off the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I have listened with a good deal of interest to our \ncolleagues on the other side complaining. They want it both ways. On \nthe one hand, they are supporting covering 48 million Americans and \nleaving out 113 million Americans--so they are covering some \nAmericans--but they are not covering all Americans. Then they are \ntroubled, evidently, because they are covering some Americans. Many of \nour colleagues on the other side, as we have just heard, do not think \nthere ought to be any kind of protection for the American citizens, \nthat we ought to just leave this up to the States.\n  My response is, the law of the jungle may be good in the jungle, but \nwe do not accept that in the United States, when people are being \nexploited by the private sector. In this case, the insurance industry \nrefuses to provide the protections for women and children in our \ncountry. The insurance industry refused to provide protections for \nworkers in our country.\n  That is basically the fact of it. We hear repeatedly, mistakenly, \nthat the States have provided protections. I will include in the Record \nthe Families USA analysis of the various States.\n\n       An examination of state legislation in 13 areas of basic \n     managed care consumer protections finds that no state has all \n     13 on the books. . . .\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that analysis printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [Press Release from Families USA Foundation]\n\n   Despite State Managed Care Laws, Most People Still Go Unprotected\n\n\n families usa releases comprehensive review of state managed care laws\n\n       (Washington, DC) An examination of state legislation in 13 \n     areas of basic managed care consumer protections finds that \n     no state has all 13 on the books according to a new report \n     released today by the national consumer group Families USA.\n       Hit & Miss: State Managed Care Laws examines state laws for \n     a number of patient protections including the right to \n     independent eternal appeals when health care services are \n     denied, access to emergency room coverage, the right to sue \n     health plans for wrongful denials of care, and the \n     establishment of state funded consumer assistance programs. \n     (See table 1, attached, for a list and explanation of the \n     protections studied in the report.)\n       The study reveals that only one state, Vermont, had passed \n     10 or more of the protections, 16 states enacted 5 to 9 of \n     the basic protections, 33 states had passed only 1 to 4 of \n     the protections and South Dakota had passed none. (See table \n     1 attached.) The report also reveals that, despite state \n     legislation on managed care, many consumers are not protected \n     by those laws.\n       According to the report, one in three people with employer-\n     based coverage are in self-insured health plans and are not \n     covered by state consumer protection laws. The federal \n     Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) exempts self-\n     insured employer plans from state health insurance laws. \n     Approximately 51 million Americans are not covered by any of \n     the managed care consumer protection laws in their state \n     because of ERISA.\n       ``Not only do managed care consumer protections vary \n     greatly from state to state,'' said Ron Pollack, executive \n     director of Families USA, ``but even with laws on the books, \n     many consumers who get their coverage from their employer are \n     not protected because of ERISA. Only a federal patients' Bill \n     of Rights would ensure consumer protections for all Americans \n     who receive employer provided coverage.''\n       Other key findings of the report include:\n       The requirement of disclosure of treatment options and \n     protection advocacy (that is a ban on ``gag rules'') has been \n     passed by the most states--45 states and the District of \n     Columbia.\n       Thirty-one states and the District of Columbia have passed \n     laws requiring health\n\n[[Page S8469]]\n\n     plans to pay for emergency room care when a person believes \n     he or she is experiencing a medical emergency.\n       Only 15 states have passed laws establishing an independent \n     external appeals process for consumers who believe they have \n     been wrongfully denied care.\n       Eight states have passed laws requiring plans to have a \n     procedure to allow individuals to obtain prescription drugs \n     that are not on the managed care plan's list or \n     ``formulary.''\n       Of the 13 key protections studied, the establishment of \n     independent consumer assistance programs and changes in \n     liability laws had been passed by the fewest states.\n       Vermont is the first and only state to pass a law that \n     provides funding for an independent statewide consumer \n     assistance program.\n       Two states, Texas and Missouri, passed laws that open the \n     door so that consumers can hold their health plans \n     accountable through litigation. This issue is still being \n     debated in the courts.\n       While the ERISA statute preempts state insurance laws for \n     people in self-insured plans, the statute goes even further \n     in preventing Americans from suing their health plan for \n     damages in the event of wrongful denials of care. The study \n     found that 83 percent of Americans who get their health care \n     from their employer, 124 million people, cannot hold their \n     health plans liable for their denials of care because of \n     ERISA preemption of state laws relating to grievance \n     resolution. Public employees (state and federal workers) are \n     not preempted.\n       ``ERISA--which was intended to protect employees in \n     pensions and health plans--has become a protective shield for \n     managed care plans even when they wrongfully deny care, \n     either through negligence or malicious indifference,'' added \n     Judy Waxman, director of government affairs at Families USA. \n     ``Health plans have no accountability for their decisions to \n     deny needed care and treatment. This lack of meaningful \n     remedies invites abuse.''\n       Current proposals in Congress address many of the \n     protections studied in the new Families USA report. The \n     Patients' Bill of Rights introduced by Senators Daschle and \n     Kennedy and Representatives Dingell and Gephardt would \n     establish all 13 of the protections studied. The House \n     Republican proposal, which is not yet in legislative form, \n     would address from two to four of the issues. (See table 2 \n     attached.)\n       ``The American public has said very clearly that they want \n     managed care protections, but because of ERISA they are \n     denied the protections passed by their state,'' added \n     Pollack. ``Because of the federal ERISA law, this issue can \n     not be left up to the states. Federal protections are needed \n     to ensure all Americans get fair treatment from their managed \n     care plans.''\n\n              Consumer Protections Examined in Hit & Miss\n\n       The 13 areas selected for special analysis in Hit & Miss \n     were chosen for a combination of reasons. First, they are \n     important rights to help ensure that health plan enrollees \n     get the care promised by their plans. Second, these rights \n     are sufficiently specific and understandable that consumers \n     can assess their significance. And third, these rights \n     provide good illustrations of the diverse state-by-state \n     approaches to regulating managed care. The 13 protections \n     are:\n       the right to go to an emergency room, and have the managed \n     care plan pay for the resulting care, if a person reasonably \n     believes he or she is experiencing an emergency;\n       the right to receive health care from an out-of-network \n     provider when the health plan's network of providers is \n     inadequate;\n       the right of a person with a serious illness or disability \n     to use a specialist as a primary care provider;\n       the right of a seriously ill person to receive standing \n     referrals to health specialists;\n       a woman's right to gain direct access to an obstetrician or \n     gynecologist;\n       the right of a seriously ill patient or pregnant woman to \n     continue receiving health care for a specified period of time \n     from a physician who has been dropped by the health plan;\n       the establishment of a procedure that enables a patient to \n     obtain specific prescription drugs that are not on a health \n     plan's drug formulary;\n       the right to appeal denials of care through a review \n     process that is external to, and independent of, health \n     plans;\n       the establishment of consumer assistance, or ombudsman, \n     programs;\n       prohibitions against plans' use of so-called ``gag \n     rules''--rules that prevent physicians and health providers \n     from fully disclosing treatment options to patients;\n       prohibitions on plans' reliance on inappropriate financial \n     incentives to deny or reduce necessary health care;\n       the establishment of state laws that prevent plans from \n     prohibiting participation in clinical trials; and\n       the establishment of state laws enabling enrollees to sue \n     their health plans when they improperly deny care.\n\n                                                                                                                 TABLE 1.--HIT AND MISS: STATE

Details of the proposal are too sketchy to determine whether the proposal meets the standard.\n* None of these laws apply to people in self-insured ERSIA plans (one in three Americans who have employer-based\n  coverage).\n Applies to all consumers with employer-provided health coverage.\n) Only applies to consumers in self-insured ERISA plans (one in three Americans who have employer based\n  coverage).\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Vermont has 10 out of the 13, but no State has all 13. \nThese are basic and fundamental standards that can be built upon. If \nTexas wants to do more, so be it. If Pennsylvania wants to do more, so \nbe it. But these are the most basic and fundamental protections. That \nis what this legislation is all about. These are basic kinds of \nprotections which, in most instances, have been included in the \nprotections of the Federal employees, who include every Member of this \nbody.\n  I have been so interested in listening to this debate about how we do \nnot want the Federal Government having anything to do with health care. \nThe Federal employment insurance has 11 million members. Every Member \nof this body has an opportunity to go in there and check a little box \nand say: We don't want the Federal employment protections. We don't \nwant that. We want the private sector. Yet very few Members of this \nbody have done that.\n  Eleven million Federal employees have these protections. It is so \nnice to hear: Well, we're glad to have protections for our children. We \nrefuse to provide them for other people's children.\n  You don't hear anyone suggesting we are going to give up our Federal \nemployees' health care. We should not say, when we provide this kind of \nprotection for our children that we are going to provide the protection \nfor other people's children. That is the heart of this issue.\n  I yield myself another minute off the bill.\n  I have included in the Record an analysis of which States provide \nthese 13 basic protections and which States do not. They are rather \nbasic and fundamental protections. They are protections concerning \nemergency care, OB/GYN care, access to clinical trials, access to \nspecialists, ensuring adequate accountability, and eliminating the \nfinancial incentives that lead to denying people quality health care.\n  For all those who say they do not want these protections, I do not \nknow what their States are like. I do not know the last time they \ntalked to their insurance commissioners. I doubt if there is anyone in \nthis body--1 more minute--anyone in this body who could call their \ninsurance commissioner this afternoon and not hear scores of \ncomplaints. That is what is happening, maybe not in the Senate, but all \nacross this Nation.\n  This amendment will make an important difference in terms of \nprotection.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I need off \nthe bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am glad my colleague is sitting down. \nWe might need Dr. Frist on the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Could the Senator yield, on my time, on that issue?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We couldn't see a specialist like Dr. Frist under the \nRepublican bill. I am glad to use him if I need him. I thank the \nSenator.\n  Mr. FRIST. He is here.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, just a couple comments on the underlying \namendment. I am always kind of amazed with the philosophy of saying, \nwell, millions of people are not protected, as if the States have not \nbeen doing a good job. It is as if saying to the States: We don't care \nwhat you have done, it is not good enough. Senator Kennedy has decided \nyou haven't done good enough. HCFA should be running your health care \nplans. States need not apply. States, don't bother. We know better. The \nFederal Government knows better. HCFA, the Health Care Financing \nAdministration, basically should be running your health care plans. We \ndon't care what you have done, States. We don't care if 42 States have \nalready passed a health care bill of rights or 50 States already have \nconsumer grievance procedures or 47 States already have a ban on gag \nclauses. We are going to pass things that supersede what you have done. \nWe know what is best.\n\n  The Health Care Financing Administration has done a crummy job, \nfrankly, in administering rules dealing with home health care. We have \nhome health care problems all across the country. A lot of it is \nbecause of HCFA. Or HCFA is getting information out to Medicare--which \nwe passed in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. They are supposed to give \nseniors information. They have not done it. Yet we are going to \ntransfer the entire regulatory authority of all the health insurance \nplans of America over to this governmental agency? To a bunch of \nbureaucrats thinking they can do a better job than all the States? I do \nnot think so.\n  If people are somewhat familiar with the labyrinth of regulations \ndealing with insurance plans, if we pass the Kennedy bill, as now \nproposed, the amendment that is before us, this is the kind of \nregulatory scheme we are going to have.\n  You talk about duplication, you talk about confusion, you talk about \nalmost an impossibility if the State has a plan--wait a minute, do we \ncomply with Federal regulations dealing with the bill of rights or do \nwe comply with the State, or do we comply with the State ban on gag \nclauses or ours? Somebody says, well, if there is confusion, we will \nhave HCFA decide. HCFA will decide, the Government will decide, the \nFederal Government will decide.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on this amendment. In addition, I \nwould like to let my colleagues know there is $5 billion worth of new \ntaxes in this amendment that is before us. If you want to increase \ntaxes by another $5 billion, vote in favor of the Kennedy amendment. I \nurge my colleagues to vote no on this amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 1 minute.\n  Mr. President, what about the bureaucrats in the insurance industry \nwho are denying coverage for children in these emergency rooms? What \nabout the bureaucrats who are denying women the right to be able to be \nin the clinical trials? What about those? This isn't HCFA. The Senator \nfrom Oklahoma knows this.\n  When the General Accounting Office recommended they get additional \nresources for HCFA, they led the fight against giving them resources to \nenforce the Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation. Go back and look at the \nRecord, I say to the Senator. You know that.\n  I am not interested in going back and forth on this issue. But I \ndaresay the\n\n[[Page S8471]]\n\nbureaucrats in the insurance industry are the ones about whom people \nare most concerned. Americans know what the insurance industry is \ndoing. They are looking at the bottom line. I think maybe HCFA has its \nproblems--maybe they made some mistakes--but, by and large, they are \ndedicated men and women who are committed to public service who are \ntrying to do a decent job. It is easy to beat up on employees, \nGovernment employees, but for my money, they do a great job.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. All time \nhas expired on the amendment. The question is on agreeing to amendment \nNo. 1242. The nays and nays have been ordered.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1243 to Amendment No. 1232\n\n  (Purpose: To expand deductibility of long-term care to individuals; \n   expand direct access to obstetric and gynecological care; provide \n timely access to specialists; and expand patient access to emergency \n                             medical care)\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, on behalf of myself, Senator Hutchinson, \nSenator Frist, Senator Jeffords, Senator Grassley, and Senator Grams, I \nsend an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine (Ms. Collins), for herself, Mr. \n     Hutchinson, Mr. Frist, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Grassley, and Mr. \n     Grams, proposes an amendment numbered 1243 to amendment No. \n     1232.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, may we be in order. The Senate is not in \norder. The Senator is entitled to be heard. We have had a good debate \nover the course of the day. Members have been attentive. We would like \nto make sure that the good Senator has the attention of the membership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. Will the Senate come \nto order.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Presiding Officer. I thank my friend and \ncolleague from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of myself, Senator Hutchison, Senator Frist, \nSenator Jeffords, Senator Grassley, and Senator Grams, I have sent to \nthe desk a four-part amendment.\n  We explained in producing our health committee bill that two of our \ngoals were to expand access to health insurance and also to provide \nimportant consumer protections to those individuals who are insured in \nself-funded plans that the States cannot reach, cannot regulate, and \nthat come under Federal jurisdiction. The amendment which I and my \ncolleagues have proposed seeks to advance both those goals.\n  The legislation would permit individuals who purchase long-term care \ninsurance that is not subsidized by their employer to deduct 100 \npercent of the cost of that coverage.\n  That is the first part of the amendment.\n  The second part of the amendment includes the access to emergency \nservices provision which Senator Hutchinson and Senator Frist have been \nworking on. We believe it strengthens those provisions. It includes \nsome of the language which Senator Graham of Florida had offered \nyesterday, but that has been refined. It takes a somewhat different \napproach.\n  The third part of this amendment includes language developed by \nSenator Frist dealing with timely access to specialists. Senator Frist \nwill explain that provision in more detail.\n  The fourth provision in this amendment has been developed by Senator \nJeffords dealing with access to OB/GYNs. It is an attempt to improve \nupon and strengthen the health committee legislation.\n  I am not going to address the provisions that deal with long-term \ncare insurance. Most Americans mistakenly believe that either Medicare \nor their regular health insurance policies will cover the costs of \nlong-term care should they develop a chronic illness or a cognitive \nimpairment such as Alzheimer's disease.\n  Unfortunately, far too late, far too many Americans discover their \nfamilies do not have the coverage they need until they are confronted \nwith a difficult decision of placing a frail parent or loved one in a \nlong-term care facility and face the shocking realization they will \nhave to bear those enormous costs themselves. With nursing home costs \nranging from $40,000 to $70,000 a year, a chronic illness requiring \nlong-term care can easily bankrupt a family. It can also result in the \ntaxpayer eventually having to pick up the costs through the Medicaid \nprogram. Concerns about how to finance long-term care will only \nmultiply as our population ages and is at greater risk of chronic \nillness.\n  By the year 2030, the demographics of 32 States will resemble those \nof Florida today. The number of people over age 65 will nearly double. \nMoreover, the fastest growing segment of our population are Americans \nwho are age 85 and older. These older Americans are at least five times \nmore likely to reside in a nursing home than people who are age 65.\n  Americans should obviously think about and plan for their future \nlong-term care needs as they plan for their retirement or purchase life \ninsurance to protect their families. Private planning for long-term \ncare through the purchase of long-term care insurance will not only \nprovide families with greater financial security, but it will also ease \nthe growing financial burden on Medicaid and strengthen the ability of \nthat program to serve as a vital safety net for those Americans most in \nneed.\n  Moreover, private long-term care insurance policies provide Americans \nwith much greater choice in the type of services they can receive. \nWhile government programs predominantly pay for nursing home stays, \nprivate long-term care policies provide a wide variety of services, \nranging from personal assistance with activities of daily living such \nas bathing or eating or dressing, to 24-hour skilled nursing \nassistance. Many policies also cover assisted living.\n  In addition, policies often cover home care, adult day care, and \nrespite\n\n[[Page S8472]]\n\ncare, giving seniors greater flexibility and enabling them to retain \nthe dignity of choice and to have the most appropriate care in their \nsenior years.\n  The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 made \nlong-needed changes in our Tax Code to give long-term care insurance \nessentially the same tax treatment as other health insurance. As a \nconsequence, long-term care insurance premiums are now deductible for \nthose employers who choose to offer the coverages of benefit and also \nare excludable for taxable income for the employee. Moreover, premiums \nfor long-term care insurance are treated as a medical expense for the \npurposes of itemized deductions for medical expenses and are also \npartially deductible for self-employed individuals.\n\n  The amendment I am introducing today will expand the tax \ndeductibility of long-term care insurance to encourage and to help more \nAmericans to purchase it. In this regard, I want to acknowledge the \nleadership of Senator Grassley as chairman of the Aging Committee on \nwhich I am privileged to serve. Senator Grassley has been a long-time \nadvocate of expanding the tax deductibility for long-term care \ninsurance.\n  The legislation I am proposing will permit individuals who purchase \nlong-term care insurance on their own, without any kind of subsidy from \ntheir employer, to deduct 100 percent of the cost of that insurance. \nProviding additional financial incentives for individuals to plan for \ntheir own future long-term care needs is particularly important in \norder to encourage younger people to purchase the coverage.\n  By encouraging individuals to plan now for retirement through the \npurchase of long-term care insurance, not only are we helping to ensure \ntheir future financial security; we are also giving them the peace of \nmind knowing that should they develop a chronic illness, should they \nbecome ill with Alzheimer's disease, for example, they will be covered \nby private insurance. Moreover, the insurance will ensure that they \nreceive the choice of care they need and on their own terms.\n  Finally, encouraging individuals to plan and prepare for their future \nlong-term care needs will help strengthen and preserve the financial \nsolvency of the Medicaid program. This is an idea that I hope will have \nthe support of colleagues from both sides of the aisle. I encourage all \nof my colleagues to join me in this effort to make this critical \ncoverage more affordable to millions of Americans.\n  I yield such time as he desires to my colleague from Arkansas for an \nexplanation of the emergency care provisions of this amendment.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I applaud the Senator from Maine for her outstanding \nleadership on this legislation and particularly for this amendment and \nthe tax provisions which I believe are going to provide significant tax \nrelief. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that 3.8 million \ntaxpayers benefit from this provision on long-term care. It is an \nimportant provision. Senator Collins and Senator Grassley have been \ngreat leaders in pushing for this. I applaud their efforts.\n  I will briefly address the provisions in this amendment regarding \naccess to emergency services, an issue we debated at some length \nyesterday. I think the provisions in this amendment adequately and \nsignificantly improve the Republican bill and address the concerns that \nhave been expressed.\n  Let me compare briefly the Kennedy bill and the Republican bill in \nthis area. Both bills, with the adoption of this amendment, will \neliminate prior authorization for visiting the emergency room. This was \nincluded in the committee bill as it came out. We reaffirmed that in \nthe amendment. It eliminates the need for the requirement for prior \nauthorization, something that is obvious, something that is common \nsense. If you have an emergency event, you don't want to get \npreauthorization before you go to the emergency room. We eliminate that \nrequirement for prior authorization. For policies that have it, we \nprohibit that.\n  Both bills require coverage for medical screening exams and \nstabilization services under the prudent layperson standard for \nemergency.\n  That language, that provision, is included in both the Democrat bill \nand the Republican bill. Both bills, with the adoption of this \namendment, will ensure that patients will not have to pay more for \nemergency services provided by an out-of-network provider than an in-\nnetwork provider. Many of the stories and examples we have heard on the \nfloor of the Senate regarded individuals who had to pass by an \nemergency room when something tragic occurred, drive across town to \nfind a provider that was in the network. That should never happen. It \nshould not ever be required. No one should bypass an emergency room \nthat is close to them because they are afraid of having to pay a \npenalty or pay a higher copay because that emergency room is not in the \nnetwork. So we would prohibit that kind of differential. The Democrat \nbill has that provision. With the adoption of this amendment, we would \nprohibit that. You would go to the closest emergency room.\n\n  Both bills, with the adoption of this amendment, would provide the \ncoverage of poststabilization services. The Republican amendment will \ndo the following. It will require coverage of services to maintain the \nstability of the patient, those services which are related to the \nemergency condition, treatment related to the emergency condition, \nprovided in the emergency room, and under the condition that the health \nplan has been contacted by the nonparticipating provider regarding \napproval for such services.\n  If the plan has not responded within 1 hour--this is exactly what is \nrequired under Medicare--to arrange for transfer, discharge, or for \nfurther care at a nonnetwork facility, the plan continues to be liable \nfor the care needed to maintain stability and those conditions related \nto the emergency situation.\n  So we believe this is very strong language. It provides the kind of \nprotections we need for poststabilization services. What it does not \ndo--and this is the difference, this is the distinction--it does not \nallow someone to go into the emergency room with a genuine emergency \nand then ask for treatment of a condition totally unrelated to the \nemergency event. If you go in and you have a knee injury because of a \nfall and then, after you have been stabilized, you tell the doctor you \nhave not had your heart checked and you haven't had an x ray and you \nwant this done or that done, on conditions totally unrelated to the \nemergency event, that should not be required to be covered by the \ninsurance policy.\n  We clarified what we believe was ambiguous language, where there had \nbeen abuses, to ensure that in fact treatment has to be related to the \nemergency event.\n  I think it is a very strong provision, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the overall amendment and this provision regarding access to \nemergency services.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I commend the efforts of the Senator from \nArkansas. He has worked very hard on this issue. What he and the \nSenator from Tennessee have developed clearly strengthens the bill \nreported by the HELP Committee. I think it is an excellent refinement, \nand I commend him for his efforts.\n  I now yield such time as he may need to the Senator from Tennessee to \nexplain the access to specialists provisions in the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maine for laying \nout so well what this amendment is all about.\n  The amendment has four parts: Long-term care deductibility, which has \nbeen spelled out. The Senator from Arkansas has just laid out the \nsecond portion of this amendment on access to emergency services, \nsomething he and I have worked on very closely that I think really \npulls together so much of the debate over the last 3 days and \ndemonstrates we are working together to improve the underlying \nlegislation as we go forward. Another demonstration of that is the \nthird component, the access to specialists, which I will outline. Then \nI will turn to the Senator from Vermont to discuss the fourth component \non access to obstetricians and gynecologists--again, an issue that has \nbeen on the floor again and again and again.\n  I think overall this amendment demonstrates our very sincere effort \nto\n\n[[Page S8473]]\n\nwork together as we go forward, taking ideas, bringing ideas forward, \nand improving this bill as the day develops.\n  Under access to specialist, we do four things:\n  No. 1, we ensure timely access to specialty care. ``Timely\" is the \nkey word. Timely is important. I will come back to why it is important \nand what we do.\n  No. 2, we expand the provision to ensure access to primary care \nsubspecialists. It is an expansion to the underlying provision, but \nagain I think it is one that is very important to clarify the intent to \nwhich I believe both sides agree.\n  No. 3, the third component of the access to specialists is that we \nacknowledge, in very specific language, that a specialist could be the \npatient's case manager. That is important. It is very important to \nunderstand what a case manager is, and I will come back to that very \nbriefly.\n  The fourth point I want to make in describing my aspect of this \namendment is that there are concerns that referrals do not require a \ntreatment plan to be in place.\n  No. 1, timely access to specialty care. This amendment is necessary \nto improve the underlying bill. It does so by requiring the plans to \nensure ``timely''--it is in the bill--access in accordance with the \nsurrounding medical circumstances in the case. That is very important.\n  It is important to me as a physician, to patients, and to doctors \nbecause the last thing in the world we want to do is have something on \nthe books that says you have access to a specialist, which we have in \nour bill, but to have a plan be able to delay in some way, or say, yes, \nthe provisions are there; we are going to work on it. So we want to put \na temporal component in it to make sure you have timely access, that \nyou can see that specialist in a timely way so you get that care when \nyou actually need it. Therefore, we have timely access.\n  Why is it in the Patients' Bill of Rights? Basically to guarantee to \nthe patients, to assure the patients, the plan has to respond in a way \nthat meets the circumstances of their particular care--appendicitis, \nheart disease, lung disease; that they will have a timely response to \nthat with a specialist.\n  No. 2, we expand the provision to ensure access to primary care \nsubspecialists. Again, this is something very close to me. Again we \nfocus on access because that is what patients want. They don't care \nwhat titles these people have, but what they say is: If I need a \ncardiologist, I can get to a cardiologist; I can get to a heart \ntransplant surgeon. I want to make sure that care is there. So we \nremove the barriers. We do not try to dump people into categories and \ngive them labels.\n\n  There are some subspecialties within primary care that are actually \nsubspecialties under primary care, and we want to make absolutely sure, \nbecause for those individuals it is critical that they are involved in \nchronic care--we want to make sure it is very clear. We want to reach \nout and expand that amendment to include that definition of specialty \ncare to include both primary and specialty health care professionals \nwho are appropriate to the patient's condition. If you have heart \ndisease, it needs to be a cardiologist. If you have cancer, it needs to \nbe an oncologist.\n  A typical example to bring this home is a cardiologist. I am a heart \ntransplant surgeon. We also have cardiologists. I operate on patients. \nCardiologists are the medical end of the study of the heart. To become \na cardiologist, you go through training to become an internist, or \ninternal medicine. Internal medicine is considered a primary care \nspecialty. But a subspecialty of internal care medicine is cardiology. \nYou may go for 3 or 4 years of internal medicine training, which is a \nprimary care field; then you go ahead and do a subspecialty of internal \nmedicine, and that is cardiology, an additional 2 or 3 years.\n  I want to make clear that we are talking about access, we are talking \nabout the subspecialties underneath the primary care of internal \nmedicine. This amendment ensures that access.\n  No. 3, I want to make sure, what this amendment does is it \nacknowledges that many times the treating specialist could be the \npatient's case manager, the person who is coordinating that care. \nTherefore, our amendment adds the words ``case manager'' where \ninformation may be required to be communicated to a patient, to a \npatient's primary care provider, in the creation of a whole section \ncalled Treatment Plan. Both the Democratic bill and the Republican bill \nhave a section called Treatment Plan. This also applies to obtaining an \nadequate number of referrals.\n  The fourth point: The Republican bill follows the recommendation put \nforth by the President's own quality commission, the commission we \nreferred back to that was in effect for about a year and produced a \ndocument. Under their section, Access To Specialists, they use the word \n``authorization.'' I quote from that:\n\n       Authorization when required should be for an adequate \n     number of direct access visits.\n\n  I wanted to actually take that language and put it in our bill.\n\n       Authorization when required should be for an adequate \n     number of direct access visits.\n\n  Again, that is from the President's commission, his quality \ncommission. What we have done there is follow their recommendations. \nWhat our amendment does is revise and amend and improve that \nrecommendation to clarify that a treatment plan is not required to \nobtain an adequate number of referrals. We need to make very clear that \nthe treatment plan does not have to be the provision in order to get an \nadequate number of referrals. It is a necessary clarification because \nthe underlying bill simply states that a plan may require the \nspecialist to put together a treatment plan in consultation with the \npatient and primary care provider or case manager, but we do not \nrequire or expect that a treatment plan will be required or necessary \nfor every patient.\n\n  I have spoken long enough on this whole issue of access to \nspecialists. The timely component, the case manager component, the \naccess to subspecialists, and adequate number of direct visits are very \ndirect components. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Tennessee. As \nthe Senate's only physician, he brings a unique perspective and a very \nuseful perspective to these important health care issues. He has been a \nleader in working to improve still further on the work that was done in \nthe HELP Committee.\n  The task force has been working on this issue for some time. We first \nstarted working on the issue in January of last year. We met every week \nfor many months. That is an indication of our determination to produce \na balanced bill that will really make a difference to millions of \nAmericans.\n  Our efforts did not cease. Once we went to the HELP Committee, we \ncontinued our work, and we are continuing our work today. That is why \nwe have come up with this amendment to further strengthen and improve \nthe legislation reported by the HELP Committee.\n  I yield as much time as he would like to the chairman of the HELP \nCommittee, the Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, women have special health needs that \nrequire the expertise of practitioners trained in obstetrics and \ngynecology. We must offer them the best means to provide for their \npreventive women's health needs, as well as access to an obstetrician \nto ensure a safe pregnancy and delivery of healthy children. Under our \nbill, direct access for women to routine gynecological care will be \nensured. Obstetrical care and needed follow-up are also ensured without \nrequiring preauthorization by the plan. For coordination of care, \nproviders may be asked to provide on a continuing basis the medical \ntreatment plans in order to allow for good coordination of a woman's \nhealth care needs.\n  In Vermont, legislation has ensured that women have direct access for \ntheir obstetrical and routine gynecological needs in order to \nfacilitate optimal care. Vermont's law however does not cover 42 \npercent of women in Vermont who are in self-insured group health plans. \nOur bill will ensure that all women in Vermont will be guaranteed \ndirect access for their preventive women's gynecological health needs, \nas well as obstetrical care.\n\n[[Page S8474]]\n\n  I do not support the Democratic bill that requires health plans to \ndesignate their practitioners specialized in obstetrics and gynecology \nas primary care providers. This provision in the Democratic bill would \nforce practitioners specialized in obstetrics and gynecology to \npractice primary care, independent of whether they feel qualified or \nhave the desire to do so. Some obstetricians and gynecologists may be \nadequately trained and experienced in primary care medicine as well as \ntheir specialty. In those special cases, the plan will be able to \nreview their competency and comfort level, and determine if women in \nthe plan would be well served to be able to designate them as their \nprimary care doctor as well. We must protect our women's health care \nneeds to the same degree as we protect our men's, and ensure that women \nare being cared for by the people best trained to do so.\n  I want to ensure that women's health care needs are met the best \npossible way. We will do so by requiring direct access in self-ensured \ngroup health plans for obstetrical and routine gynecological services \nto practitioners specialized in these areas. We will also expect the \nsame degree of training for the providers looking out for the overall \nhealth needs of women, by not assuming that all obstetricians and \ngynecologists are as well trained in primary care as providers who have \nhad focused training and practice experience in providing for the total \ngeneral health. I strongly urge my colleagues to ensure that the best \nhealth care needs for women is met. This will be done by supporting our \nbill.\n  I reserve the remainder of the time and yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator will yield for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. On your time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from California up to 5 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am very interested in the comments by the Senators who \nsupport this amendment because if one reads their bill, first of all, \nthey say women deserve OB/GYN care, and they are right. That is why \nSenator Robb offered his amendment to cover all the women in America.\n  I ask my friend from Vermont: How many patients are covered by this \namendment?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. As we are going along here, we have two different \napproaches, and the approach we take is that we are trying to help \nthose women who are primarily under ERISA prohibitions----\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am just asking the Senator if he can tell us how many \nwomen are covered, just the number.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I can give you a number.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Perhaps I have the answer to the question.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Somewhere around 20 million.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Twenty million.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. There are 48 million. It is higher. Somewhere in that \narea. From 20 to 48.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, 50 million are left out. I say to my \nfriend, the vast majority of women are left out. In the last amendment \nby Senator Snowe, the one good thing she did is cover all the women in \nterms of her amendment that dealt with mastectomies. We are facing an \namendment, whereas the underlying bill will guarantee--that is the \nDemocratic bill--all women these protections, this only applies to a \nvery small percentage of the women. Let's make sure people know this is \na sham.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator from California yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator will include in her question why \na proposal would have been offered by one Senator, Senator Snowe, that \ncovers all the women. With respect to mastectomies, but the proposal \noffered on OB/GYN leaves out up to 50 million women.\n  Mrs. BOXER. It would leave out about two-thirds. My friend is \ncorrect. I wonder, I say to my friend, what his response is. I was \nasked that question by Senator Kennedy. The only thing I can come up \nwith is politics. The heat was on on the mastectomy issue, the light \nwas on, so they covered everybody. Now on this other amendment, they do \nnot cover all the women.\n  If my colleagues will turn to page 8 of this bill, I say to my friend \nfrom Maine and my friend from Vermont, if they will read the way they \nhave structured this, it says:\n\n       A group health plan described in this paragraph may treat \n     the ordering of other care that is related to obstetrics or \n     routine gynecological care.\n\n  ``May treat.'' It does not say they have to. This, I say to my \nfriends, is a sham proposal. It does not do anything for the women of \nthis country. It leaves out two-thirds of the women, and it leaves it \nup to the health plan if they are going to give this kind of care.\n  Let me tell my colleagues specifically what I mean. Yes, they provide \naccess for routine gynecological care. Suppose you finish your checkup, \neverything is fine and a month later you find a lump in your breast. \nYou cannot go to that OB/GYN, except if the Democratic bill passes \nbecause we give direct access to women and make OB/GYNs the primary \nhealth care provider.\n  In the debate yesterday, the Senator from Tennessee stood on this \nfloor and said the OB/GYNs do not want to be primary care providers. \nThat was an untruth. We have a letter on the desks from the \norganization that represents them, and the gentleman who was cited on \nthe floor of this Senate said it was a misrepresentation; they support \nthe Democratic proposal. They want to be primary care providers.\n  So we have an amendment here that purports to help women, but, A, it \ndoes not help the vast majority of the women in this country; B, it \nundermines the Democratic bill, which says you can go to your OB/GYN \nany time you want without having to go through a gatekeeper; and, C, it \ndoes not treat women the way they ought to be treated.\n  So I would call on my colleagues to support the underlying Democratic \nbill.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Instead of saying this helps women, this amendment should \nbe characterized as saying it helps some women but not most women. \nWould that be accurate?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would say some women just a little bit. Not as much as \nthey say.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 9 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would like to direct a question to the \nmanager of the bill, the Senator from Vermont. There is a provision in \nyour bill--by the way, let me, for everyone, just explain. Because of \nthe way we were forced to debate this issue, we have been unable to \nlook at this amendment. We just got this amendment. What happens in the \nordinary course in the Senate is if somebody offers an amendment, under \nnormal conditions, we would ask for a quorum call so we could take a \nlook at the amendment before the debate started. We cannot do that. Our \ntime is running as we speak. So we are trying to work our way through \nthis amendment they have jammed in here at the last minute without \ngiving us any notice as to what was going to be in it.\n  But my question to the Senator from Vermont is, there is a \nprovision--in fact, it is the first provision in the bill--that \nincludes long-term care insurance. Would the Senator from Vermont tell \nthe minority how much this is going to cost and from where the money \ncomes?\n  I would like the Record to note the dull silence.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield while waiting for an answer?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I think there are two other questions on that point: Not \nonly how much does it cost, but because this is a tax provision, is it \nnot the case that this clearly is a blue-slip provision? A tax \nprovision cannot start in the Senate.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator explain what this means to the people \nwatching?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Constitutionally you must not start a tax provision in \nthe Senate; it has to originate in the House. Second, is it offset? If \nso, how would one pay for this tax incentive? I think those questions \nshould be asked as well. I wonder if we could get an answer to that.\n  Mr. REID. I would ask, through the Chair, the manager of the bill to \nanswer those questions, if he would,\n\n[[Page S8475]]\n\nplease. We have just received a copy of the amendment from the pages a \ncouple minutes ago.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I will defer to the distinguished Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Let me make a couple comments on the bill in general. I \nam assuming I am on our time.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. How much time remains on the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 23 minutes 6 seconds; the \nminority has 42 minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, one, I understand some of my colleagues \nmade the statement, what about a blue slip? If we pass a tax cut, won't \nthe House of Representatives automatically blue-slip it? For those \npeople who are not aware of what that means--and probably a lot of \npeople watching do not have the faintest idea what that means and what \nthat has to do with health care--the idea of a blue slip is that the \nConstitution of the United States says: All revenue measures must \noriginate in the House. If the Senate originates a tax cut or revenue \nmeasure, the House can refuse to take it. They can blue-slip it and not \nhave it go anywhere. We do not plan on having that on this particular \nbill. We have seen it before.\n  I might mention, in the unanimous-consent agreement that was agreed \nto, that outlined the procedures for the bill. We agreed:\n\n       That following passage of the bill, should the bill upon \n     passage contain any revenue blue slip matter, the bill remain \n     at the Desk; that when the Senate receives the House \n     companion bill, the Senate proceed to its immediate \n     consideration; that all after the enacting clause be \n     stricken, the text of the Senate-passed bill be inserted in \n     lieu thereof, and the bill, as amended, be passed; and that \n     the Senate insist on its amendment and request a conference \n     with the House, all without any intervening action or debate.\n\n  What that means is, obviously, we knew in the Senate bill it was our \nintention to deal with tax issues because we want to increase access; \nwe want to improve access; we want to increase the number of people who \nare insured. Unfortunately, our colleagues' bill, the Democrat bill, \nthe Kennedy bill, will increase the number of people who are uninsured. \nIt is estimated by people to increase the number of uninsured by 1.8 \nmillion, maybe 2 million people who would lose their insurance. We \ndon't want to do that.\n  I stated on the floor of the Senate, maybe 2 years ago, that whatever \nwe did we should do no harm, we should not increase health care costs, \nand we should not increase the number of uninsured. We should be doing \njust the opposite. We should be increasing the number of insured.\n  In the amendment the Senator from Maine has offered, we have given a \ntax credit for people with long-term health care, a provision I believe \nand I hope and expect will improve the access to long-term health care, \nwhich is a problem for millions of Americans. That will improve it \ndramatically. It will be a very positive change.\n  I compliment my friend and colleague from Maine for basically saying: \nWe want this in our bill. Long-term health care is a very significant \nproblem. There are a lot of people going into nursing homes and they \nare going bankrupt or their families are going bankrupt trying to take \ncare of loved ones in nursing homes.\n  Shouldn't we do something to address that? In the Tax Code we have \nincentives to help with health care, rather significant incentives. \nLarge corporations get to deduct 100 percent. Unfortunately, the self-\nemployed only get to deduct 45 percent. We have already addressed that. \nThat was one of the amendments we agreed to yesterday, allowing 100-\npercent deductibility for the self-employed. That is a positive change.\n\n  This change, as offered by our colleague from Maine, and others, is a \nvery positive change saying, let's give a tax deduction for people in \npurchasing long-term health care coverage so they will not be so \ndependent on their kids or their grandkids, in some cases, or other \nfamily members, so they can start working on preparing for their later \nyears and making that available for them now. That will improve their \nquality of health care now, or they will be ready for it now. Most \npeople do not do that. Most companies do not do it. Most plans do not \ndo it. We want to encourage it. We want to jump start it. We want to \nmake it a common option, a common fringe benefit that, frankly, right \nnow is not there. Most people do not have it, do not think about it \nuntil it is too late, until a loved one goes into a nursing home or \nmaybe a loved one has a real problem with Alzheimer's or something, and \nthe expenses are very large.\n  So the provision my friend and colleague, Senator Collins, has \noffered allows individuals with no employer subsidy to deduct 100 \npercent of the cost of long-term care insurance and allows long-term \ncare benefits to be offered through a cafeteria plan.\n  The estimated cost--I think somebody asked that--is $5.4 billion over \n5 years and would benefit an estimated 3.8 million taxpayers. I make \nthat clear.\n  One of my colleagues said: How is it paid for? How are you going to \npay for it? What is your intention on how to pay for it?\n  We actually do intend on having some offsets. We have not introduced \nthose yet. We will at the appropriate time.\n  I have been somewhat critical and maybe have had a little fun with my \ncolleague, Senator Kennedy, because he had some tax increase in some of \nthe provisions including Superfund and others. I do not think Superfund \nbelongs in this bill. We do plan on having some offsets at the \nappropriate time. We do not have to, under this UC, have them in the \nbill at this point or else my colleague could make a point of order on \nit. That is not allowed in the unanimous consent agreement that was \nalready reached by both sides, and so I just mention that.\n  But at the appropriate time we expect to have an offset. Even if we \ndid not have an offset, the bill would not pass the Senate; it would be \nheld at the desk until we received the appropriate vehicle from the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I think this is an interesting argument, to say the least. \nWe have, on this side, striven, worked very hard to make sure there are \nsome benefits for long-term care. It is great that there is some \nacknowledgement they want to do that, but in this age of frugality, it \nis interesting that the majority is willing to spend $5.4 billion with \nno offset. Anything we have set forth in this bill had offsets. We \nlooked at the Superfund as an appropriate offset, and the only \ncomplaints we heard were from the majority in this regard. In short, it \nappears that we have, as the Senator from California pointed out, a \nprovision to help women that really doesn't help women. Helping the \nwomen which is about 20 million women, is not mandatory. The HMO could \ndo it if they want to. It is permissive. It is like having nothing.\n\n  We have learned from a letter from the President of the American \nCollege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists that at least a third of the \nwomen who want to go to a gynecologist in these HMOs are refused. This \namendment, the little bit that we have been able to see in the last few \nminutes, it is clear, has no substance. It is a sham. It is a phantom.\n  It is, as I pointed out in my opening statement, a game that I first \nlearned when I went to New York, the shell game. Every time you look \nunder one of these shells that the majority gives us, it is empty. \nThere is nothing there. You keep looking, hoping that one of the times \nyou are going to pick up a shell and there is going to be something of \nsubstance. This amendment that we have been able to see, again, is \nsimilar to the rest of the game that has been played here the last 3 \ndays.\n  The shells appear. We anxiously pick one of them up. And just like \nthe street game in New York, they are empty.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator will yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. This all reminds me of that old moonwalk that you have \nseen people do, where they look like they are walking forward, but, in \nfact, they are making no progress. A famous singer used to do that \nmoonwalk. That is what I see on the floor of the Senate.\n\n[[Page S8476]]\n\n We offer a proposal that has the support of virtually every health \norganization in this country and every consumer and patient group in \nthis country.\n  Mr. REID. My only correction is, not virtually every group. Every \ngroup.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Every group. And the proposal deals with care by \nspecialists, emergency care, OB/GYN. It covers the vast array of the \nAmerican people.\n  Then we have amendment after amendment that is kind of like \ndecoration. It is kind of like the paint and the chrome and the hood \nornaments to try to dress things up and make it look like it is \nsomething, but it is a vehicle without an engine.\n  The engine is what we have produced on the floor in terms of a bill \nthat says we are going to do something real for patients who are not \ngetting the health care they need. So we will give them some \nprotection.\n  The response we get is to come out here with some empty vessels and \nsome dressing up of some empty vessels saying: We share your concern \nand so here is how we address it.\n  On the issue before us, isn't it the case that when someone stands up \nand says: Women have a right to get treatment by their OB/GYN, except \nwhen they offer the proposal, it is a right for only some women, but a \nright that will be denied to most women? Isn't that the case?\n  Mr. REID. And a right that doesn't mean anything. It says that the \ngroup health plan described in paragraph 2 may treat the ordering of \nother care, ``may treat.'' That says, as my friend from Massachusetts \nhas talked about for 3 days, if the insurance company decides it is \ngood for them; right? What are they going to decide is good for them? \nThe bottom line, what is going to give the HMOs another top $10.5 \nbillion in profits.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. One additional question: Wouldn't it be the case that if \nthe Senator from Nevada brought to the floor a tax proposal, or a \nspending proposal for that matter, that costs $3 or $5 billion, our \nfriend would chase you off the floor and say: If you are bringing \nsomething to the floor that is not paid for, come on, that violates all \nthe rules of the Senate?\n  Yet we just heard from our friend from Oklahoma that this provision \nprovides tax incentives. It is going to cost billions of dollars. How \nare you going to pay for it? Well, we don't pay for it in this bill, \nbut we have an intention to pay for it at some point along the way.\n  Do you think our friend from Oklahoma would let you get by with that, \nbringing a provision to the floor that says we are going to have a tax \nincentive and you are not going to pay for it, but you will come up \nwith an answer later?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from North Dakota, maybe it is going to \nbe paid for the same way as the huge cuts that American veterans are \ngetting. It could be paid for the same way: Cut them some more, as the \nbudget that passed this body that not a single Democrat voted for.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Talking about health care.\n  Mr. REID. I am talking about health care for veterans. Maybe that is \nwhere we could get part of it, cut them some more, the veterans.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Obviously, the Senator is talking about the budget that \nwas passed by the Senate on a partisan basis. I did not support that. \nIt is not the right approach to have substantial veterans' health care \ncuts. The Second World War veterans are reaching a time when they need \nmaximum health care that was promised them. The right approach is not \nto cut veterans' health care. The need is to increase it. Getting back \nto the point, we have an amendment that was offered, which we had not \npreviously seen, that suggests it will provide some protection. In \nfact, it denies that protection to the majority of the American women. \nIt doesn't guarantee it, in any event, and provides tax cuts that are \nnot paid for.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, it guarantees them that they may, if \nthe insurance company or HMO decides they want to give it to them, get \nit. It is permissive. That is what it does. It guarantees nothing.\n  Has my friend from Florida--again, we have had little opportunity to \nlook at this--has my friend from Florida, who has done such an \noutstanding job in previous days talking about our second amendment \nthat we offered on emergency medical care, had an opportunity to look \nat their provision in this amendment, beginning page 15?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I say to my colleague, the answer is, briefly, yes. I \nhave a couple of questions. Maybe I could engage in a dialogue with \nSenator Hutchinson on these matters.\n  Mr. REID. I yield my friend from Florida 3 minutes for this question \nso that we leave the Senator from Massachusetts ample time. If you need \nmore time, we will consider it. Three minutes to the Senator from \nFlorida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. That depends on how long it takes to respond to the \nquestion. I will get started\n  As I said last night, there were two principal differences between \nthe Republican and Democratic emergency medical care provisions. The \nfirst of those was the question of, if your child has a 103-degree \nfever and needs to go to an emergency room, and the closest emergency \nroom is one that doesn't belong to your HMO, but you are taken there \nanyway, can you be required to pay higher charges for that closest \nemergency room as opposed to taking him to the more distant hospital \nthat belongs to your HMO's network?\n  What had concerned me was the language in the original Republican \nbill. I am looking at subpart (C), section 721, Patient Access to \nEmergency Medical Care, in the original Republican bill. On page 5, \nlines 5 through 18, is the outline of the uniform cost-sharing \nprovision. I had read the equivalent language in the amendment which \nappears on page 18, line 13 through line 2 on page 19. I have tried to \nread them, and I believe the language is verbatim the same.\n  This is what the committee report which was issued by the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions and signed by all of the \nRepublican Members said about that language:\n\n       Plans may impose cost sharing so long as it is uniformly \n     applied to similarly-situated individuals and to all benefits \n     consisting of emergency medical care. The committee believes \n     that it would be acceptable to have a differential cost \n     sharing for in-network emergency coverage and out-of-network \n     emergency coverage, so long as such cost sharing is applied \n     consistently across a category.\n\n  The language is verbatim in the amendment as it was in the original \nRepublican bill. So can I assume that that committee language, which \ninterprets what section (B)(1) on page 5 of the original Republican \nbill, lines 5 through 18 meant, is the same thing that the verbatim \nlanguage in your amendment says?\n  (Mr. ABRAHAM assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I respond to the Senator from Florida by, first of \nall, complimenting him for his concern and interest in this issue and \nfor, I think, pointing out clearly some improvements that were needed \nin the committee bill. I do not believe it was the intent of the \ncommittee to allow a differential in cost sharing for out-of-network \nproviders.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Would the Senator look at page 29 of the committee \nreport, the first full paragraph?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I have looked at that. I cannot explain that \nlanguage, but I believe a clarification was necessary. We have made \nthat clarification in the amendment.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Then why is the amendment--what concerns me is that the \namendment has, word-for-word, much of the same language as contained in \nthe underlying Republican bill to which this paragraph relates.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I say to the Senator, the change in the amendment is \nin in-network uniform cost sharing. That was the intent to be \npermitted. The amendment, on page 19, on out-of-network care, makes it \nabundantly clear that such differentials in going to an emergency room \nthat may not be in the network and requiring a penalty, requiring an \nadditional copayment because you went to an out-of-network, would not \nbe permissible.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. That language is also verbatim in the underlying \nRepublican bill. There is a paragraph in the committee report that \ninterprets that, as well. That says:\n\n       The committee adopted an amendment offered by Senator \n     Hutchinson, adding a new paragraph (2) to Section 721(b)--\n\n  Which is the same language in the amendment--\n\n\n[[Page S8477]]\n\n\n     clarifying that plans may not hold a participant or \n     beneficiary liable for any additional charges--\n\n  That is not the issue of copayments or deductible; that is additional \ncharges. This is what we used to refer to as double billing.\n\n       --from a nonparticipating provider who has provided \n     emergency services for the participant or beneficiary. In \n     many communities, plans and MCOs typically contract with \n     specific providers and hospitals. However, an individual as a \n     prudent layperson may seek services at the nearest facility, \n     depending on the severity of the symptoms. It is the \n     committee's intent to ensure that individuals acting under \n     the prudent layperson standards are not held liable \n     financially for exercising this right when they seek care at \n     a non-network facility.\n\n  That refers to the double billing; that is, if you go to a \nnonparticipating emergency room, they can't charge you more. But the \nissue--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The subject of subparagraph 1 is the issue of whether \nthey can charge you a different copayment or deductible; that is, if my \nstandard deductible, if I go to an in-network emergency room, is, let's \nsay, 20 percent, can I be charged a 70-percent copayment because I am \ngoing to an out-of-network? That is what both subparagraph 1 and the \nparagraph on top of page 29 of the committee report refers to. They are \ntwo significant and different concepts.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on our time, I say to my friend from \nFlorida, he has answered his own question. The fact of the matter is, \nthey have copied the old stuff from the old bill. They have changed \nnothing. They have packaged it in this fancy package with all these \nribbons and bows, as the Senator from North Dakota said. As I have \nsaid, we have this shell game being played. We pick it up and there is \nnothing under it.\n\n  I respect and admire so much the Senator from Florida, who is an \nexpert in emergency room care. He has given a number of dissertations \non the floor that have been outstanding. I say that sincerely. \nObviously, he understands this issue much better than some who have \ntried to speak on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. REID. I yield the Senator another minute.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If we both have the same objective, which is to ensure \nthat a family with a child with a 103-degree temperature won't be at an \neconomic disadvantage by going to the nearest emergency room--if our \ndesire is to encourage that, let's not be vague about it. Let us not \nleave this ambiguous.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. On your time?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. No one is served by ambiguity.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I don't think it is ambiguous at all. There has been \na misunderstanding of the language in the amendment.\n  Certainly, there can be a differential in a network plan between \ngoing to an emergency room and going to a provider other than an \nemergency room. That is what is clear both in the bill and in the \namendment. If you will listen to the language of the out-of-network \ncase, I think it is as unambiguous as any language can be:\n\n       The plan shall cover emergency medical care under the plan \n     in a manner so that, if such care is provided to a \n     participant or beneficiary by a nonparticipating health care \n     provider, the participant or beneficiary is not liable for \n     amounts that exceed the amounts of liability that would be \n     incurred if the services were provided by a participating \n     provider.\n\n  I believe that is as clear and unambiguous as language can be. It was \nour intent that you should not have any incentive to drive across town \nwhile your child or your spouse is in jeopardy, that you should be able \nand would be able to go to the closest emergency room without incurring \nadditional costs. That is what the amendment does, and that is what I \nthink should be done.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Here is the problem. I am a court or I am an \nadministrative agency trying to apply this law. I have exactly the same \nlanguage in this amendment as was reported by the Senate committee of \njurisdiction. That committee issued a report that, in very unambiguous \nlanguage, specifically interprets these words to mean that you can't be \ncharged more if you take your kid to the closest emergency room that \ndoesn't happen to be a part of a participating network.\n  Now, you have said, Senator Frist has said, and I think everybody \nagrees, that we don't want that to be the result. So why don't we get a \nset of words that removes any ambiguities so that no one, a year from \nnow, can go back to this same report and read what the committee \nallegedly meant as applied to the Senate words. It is not a complicated \nconcept to articulate. We ought to do it.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes. To clear this up, \nthe three of us have had discussions. The issue in the underlying bill \nwas not clear. The question was raised two or three nights ago by the \nSenator from Florida that there is a potential barrier there that we \nneed to clarify, to make sure you can go to the closest emergency room, \nthat there is not an economic barrier there, believing you are going to \nbe charged more if that is an out-of-network provider or participant.\n  I agreed on the floor openly two or three nights ago. The committee \nreport I disagree with, he disagrees with it, and Senator Hutchinson \ndisagrees because it says--I don't have the exact words, but it implies \nthey are allowed to charge more out-of-network. Therefore, agreeing \nwith that, we have come up with this wording, which is as clear as we \ncan make it. I want to make sure the Record is clear that I agree with \nthe Senator from Florida and with Senator Hutchinson, and this is our \nbest effort to be as clear as we can, and that the language in the \ncommittee report is inconsistent with the amendment on the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I don't mean to be repetitive, but my concern is that the \nlanguage in the amendment is exactly the language that is in the \nunderlying bill to which that committee report was written.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Marc Schloss \nbe allowed privilege of the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Rhode \nIsland to talk about the provision in this amendment dealing with \nspecialists.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank Senator Reid for \nyielding.\n  This amendment contains many elements, one of which is apparently an \nattempt to provide access to specialty medicine and specialists. But it \nis an attempt that I think falls far short of the mark.\n  If you look at the definition of specialty care, it means, according \nto the legislation, someone who has ``adequate expertise.'' I don't \nknow of any medical professional who would define themselves as a \nspecialist using that terminology--it seems oxymoronic--``adequate \nexpertise.''\n  It also says ``age appropriate expertise.'' That is one of the \ncrucial issues we must address. It is one of the critical differences \nbetween the Democratic proposal and the Republican amendment that is \nbefore us today, because in our proposal we specifically guarantee \naccess to pediatric specialists. For example, these are individuals who \nwe hope have more than ``adequate expertise.'' These are individuals \nwho have been recognized by their colleagues as in fact highly \nqualified, highly specialized practitioners of medicine.\n  Their amendment is somewhat illusory. It talks about specialists. But \nthen it just says to the insurance company that if you can find someone \nwith adequate expertise, you can call him or her a specialist. And with \nrespect to age, it doesn't have to be a pediatric specialist; it can \njust be someone who has, as I quote, ``age appropriate expertise.''\n  What does this mean? Someone who 2 years ago saw a 12-year old or a \n13-year old--the individual might, in fact, be a cardiologist, or a \nnephrologist, but saw the child a couple of years ago--is that ``age-\nrelated expertise?\"\n  That is not what I think we have to ensure in this legislation. We \nshould be able to guarantee to every parent that if their child is seen \nby a general practitioner--a pediatrician, we hope, in the case of a \nchild--and that child needs a consultation, or referral, to a pediatric \nspecialist, that is what will\n\n[[Page S8478]]\n\nhappen. Sadly, this legislation falls far short of that. We must do \nthat.\n  I just spent several hours on Monday at the Providence, RI, General \nHospital. I met with pediatricians and pediatric specialists. They all \ntold me the same thing. They have a lot of difficulty getting referrals \nin managed care to pediatric specialists. They sometimes might be \noffered a referral to an adult specialist. But there is a difference. I \nthink anyone with any knowledge of the medical profession--in fact, far \nmore than I--would identify and recognize immediately that a pediatric \ncardiologist and a pediatric nephrologist are in a different subset of \nspecialties from what you find at the adult level.\n  Our legislation guarantees this type of elasticity to the family.\n  The other chorus I heard from listening to these practitioners is the \nfact that the primary care physician in the pediatric field today are \noverwhelmed because they are seeing children--particularly in the \ncontext of some of these attention-deficit disorders--and they are in \nfive or six different types of medicines that they don't see frequently \nor commonly in their practice. They need to get a referral to a \nspecialist in child psychiatry, for example, or someone who has much \nmore expertise. And, once again, without hard, iron-clad guarantees of \naccess to pediatric specialists, this will not happen. It is not \nhappening now.\n  I seriously question the effectiveness of this particular language \nwhen it comes to doing what we think can and must be done; that is, to \nhave, particularly with some of the children--I have made this point \ntime and time again--to have children be with pediatric specialists and \nnot just with people with ``adequate expertise,'' not just someone who \nmay have seen a few children a few years ago but recognized pediatric \nspecialists.\n  I continue to hammer away at this issue of children because typically \nthey are so poorly served in managed care in regard to access to \nspecialists. For one reason, there is a very small volume of \nchronically ill children who need this access. As a result, managed \ncare panels seldom will employ these pediatric specialists.\n  For this reason, and for the reasons from the other side, my \ncolleagues, I think this amendment falls far short of what we need to \ndo. I strongly urge its rejection and acceptance of the Democratic \nalternative.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nNorth Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I say to my colleagues and to the Senator \nfrom Tennessee that I suffer from the disadvantage of having seen this \namendment only for a short period of time, as my other colleagues have. \nBut just in that short period of time, I have found what appear to me \nto be--and I am perfectly willing to listen to an explanation--three \ngaping holes in this amendment, particularly as it relates to the issue \nof specialty care. I think our amendment completely closes those holes.\n  Hole No. 1: Even though the bill provides for timely specialty care \nin accordance with the exigencies of the case of access to primary and \nspecialty care specialists--that on the surface sounds wonderful--here \nis the problem. There are three huge holes in that provision.\n  No. 1, the plan can still do anything it wants to control costs, \nwhich means the plan can have a provision that essentially wipes out \naccess to some particular specialty, or some particular kind of \nspecialty care, in order to control costs. All they have to do is \njustify it on that basis, which is to control costs.\n  So they can essentially eliminate the value and substance of this \nprovision by simply saying, as they do every day now: We are doing this \non the basis of cost. That is the reason the HMO is doing this. We have \nto do it for cost control--so they can keep kids from seeing \nspecialists and so they can keep adults from seeing specialists. And \ntheir justification is, they are controlling costs.\n  Huge gaping loophole No. 2: They can still condition access to a \nspecialist in a treatment plan, which means the HMO can provide a \ntreatment plan that is completely contrary to what the medical \nprofessionals taking care of the patient believe the patient needs to \nsee in terms of a specialist.\n  If that treatment plan--written by the health insurance company, \nwritten by the HMO--is inconsistent with what the doctor is doing in \ntaking care of, for example, a young child whom he believes he needs to \nsee in terms of a pediatric specialist, then the right to see a \npediatric specialist is gone.\n  So we already have two huge gaping holes:\n  No. 1, the HMO can keep people from seeing specialists by just \nsaying, we are controlling costs. That is as simple as that. It is \nover. Control is in the hands of the health insurance company.\n  No. 2, if they say we have a treatment plan that is different from \nwhat the treating doctors say the child needs, they can keep the child \nfrom seeing a specialist, completely eliminating the right.\n  And the killer is gaping hole No. 3, particularly working in \ncombination with the other two, which is, there is no right to an \nexternal appeal.\n  The result of this is, if the HMO says, we are not going to let you \nsee a specialist because of cost, we are not going to let you see a \nspecialist because we have a treatment plan that is inconsistent with \nwhat the treating doctors say, the patient is completely out of luck. \nThey can't do a single thing about it. They have no right to an \nexternal appeal. They are completely stuck. The power remains entirely \nin the hands of the HMO and the health insurance company.\n  It doesn't cure it in any way because of the extraordinary problems \nwe have with access to specialty care today.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, I rise to lend my voice in support of Senator Collins' \namendment regarding deductibility for long-term care insurance.\n  I know some of those on the other side call this a sham-type \nproposal. But to the minority, a lot of times a sham, or empty vessel, \nor a shell game, if the Government doesn't do it, or buy it, or provide \nit somehow, if you encourage personal responsibility, if you encourage \nindividuals to buy in the private sector, that doesn't count. The \nGovernment is left out.\n  I think by offering this amendment--by offering the tax incentives--\nto try to level the playing field between big employers, self-employed, \nand employees who do not have coverage, and giving them this incentive, \nmany will take the option to buy this long-term insurance because they \nwill have more access and because it will be more affordable.\n  That is the heart and basis of this amendment.\n  As Senator Collins mentioned, the long-term care provision of this \namendment was contained within the Health Care Access and Equity Act \nwhich I introduced last month. I am pleased the Senate will get a \nchance to vote on this issue because it is such an important issue for \ntoday's seniors and tomorrow's retirees.\n  Mr. President, it is estimated that, in the history of the world, \nhalf of the people who have ever reached age 65 are alive today. As the \nbaby boom generation ages, the population of those over age 65 will \nincrease quicker than at any time in history. The increase in the aged \npopulation brings with it a number of complex and vexing issues, one of \nwhich is long-term care.\n  The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act tinkered \nslightly with the issue of long-term care insurance, but we need to \nmeet the issue head on rather than skirt the edges.\n  I have believed we should encourage individuals to save for their \nretirement needs and, for a number of reasons, usually cost, long-term \ncare insurance is often overlooked during retirement planning. \nUnfortunately, I think this often leads to individuals spending \nthemselves down to poverty and relying on Medicaid in order to pay for \nlong-term care.\n  Again, the heart of this amendment is to encourage people when they \nare\n\n[[Page S8479]]\n\nplanning for those years to also include long-term care to protect \ntheir estate, to protect their heirs.\n  By allowing individuals to deduct the costs of long-term care \ninsurance, we can prevent many of our elderly from impoverishing \nthemselves in order to receive long-term care.\n  I also wanted to express my appreciation to Senator Hutchinson for \nhis work on the prudent layperson language which is so important to all \nof our constituents.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I have been working on emergency \nmedical services issues for the past 3 years and believe this provision \nwill not only help patients in their time of emergency, but it will \nhelp our EMS providers continue to offer the most advanced emergency \ncare in the world. This will help do that.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I'd like to express my appreciation to the \nphysician Senator from Tennessee for not only his work on the access to \nspecialists provision, but also his work throughout this debate \nproviding a voice of experience and reason.\n  Again, I would urge my colleagues to vote for this much needed tax \nrelief for long-term care insurance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Before my friend from Minnesota leaves the floor, I am \ncurious as to how you are going to pay for the $5.4 billion that the \nlong-term care would cost. Where would that money come from?\n  Mr. GRAMS. We have discussed that. I believe Senator Nickles has \ntoday talked about that. We do have provisions that will be offered.\n  The plan is there. Don't think Republicans would offer this without a \nplan to go along with it.\n  Mr. REID. What is the plan?\n  Mr. GRAMS. As Senator Nickles said, it will be offered.\n  Mr. REID. He said it would be offered later.\n  Mr. GRAMS. It will not come out of the Superfund money, I assure you \nof that.\n  Mr. REID. What other ideas do you have as to where it would come \nfrom?\n  Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the chance to speak about \nthe pending amendment, particularly about the specialty care provision \nof the pending amendment.\n  I read it recently, but I think there are some serious concerns that \nneed to be addressed. The Senator from North Carolina has raised them. \nI know others have as well.\n  As I understand the amendment now, there is no provision in it to \nrestrict an HMO from charging additional for a patient if they need to \ngo outside the plan to get specialty care. One of the things we have \ntried to do in the amendment we drafted on specialty care is to ensure \nnot only that a person has the right to specialty care but that they \ncannot be charged whatever the HMO determines in additional charges \nthey want to tack on in order to get that access.\n  I think this is important. Clearly, if a person has signed on to a \nhealth care plan, they expect to be able to access the care they need \nwithout incurring additional costs, particularly when there is no \nrestriction in this legislation or this pending amendment, that I am \naware of, which would in any way restrict the amount of the additional \ncost that might be added. That is a very real concern which I think we \nhave to bear in mind.\n  Another concern is, the amendment we intend to offer on specialty \ncare tries to specify that if a person has a chronic illness that \nrequires the care of a specialist, that specialist could be designated \nas the primary care provider. For example, someone who is diabetic and \nwho needs to see a specialist, an endocrinologist--which I believe is \nthe specialty that is focused on dealing with the problems of \ndiabetics--a person could have that endocrinologist designated as their \nprimary care physician so they could go directly to that person and not \nhave to go through a primary care provider in each case.\n\n  As I read this amendment, it says nothing in this section shall be \nconstrued to prohibit a plan from requiring the authorization of a case \nmanager--that is, the person working for the insurance company--or the \nprimary care provider each time you go to see a specialist.\n  I think that is another defect in the bill, as I understand it. Now, \nI could be corrected on any of this if the author of the amendment can \npoint to other language that I am not aware of.\n  The third point I want to make is the same question the Senator from \nNorth Carolina raised. He referred to it as ``gaping hole No. 3.'' That \nis the question about what do you do when the health maintenance \norganization says no, we will not allow you to access a specialist. \nThat is a real-life circumstance that many people face.\n  In the amendment we intend to offer, we provide if you are denied \naccess to a specialist, you can get an independent reviewer to review \nthat decision on a very timely basis and then abide by that decision. \nThere is nothing in the pending amendment I can see that would provide \nfor any such appeal if the HMO turns down a patient's request for \nspecialty care.\n  We had a very good opportunity earlier today to hear from a mother of \na 4-year-old boy about the problems she encountered in trying to get \naccess to specialty care for him. That circumstance is one that many \npeople face. She was delayed and delayed and delayed by the health \nmaintenance organization constantly saying they would not allow her to \nsee anyone but her primary care physician for the various ear \ninfections her 4-year-old son was having because they believed those \nshould be treatable by that primary care physician. After more than 2 \nyears of being delayed, she finally did get access to a specialist. The \nspecialist did a surgical operation which corrected the problem.\n  Unfortunately, because this situation existed at this time in her \nson's life, her son now has a speech impairment and is having to go \nthrough therapy for that. Again, she is encountering problems getting \naccess to that speech therapy for her son through the HMO.\n  I don't believe the specialty care provision in this amendment that \nis pending solves the problem for most Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to support Senator Collins' \namendment that addresses several important areas. In particular, I am \nglad to support the provision to allow a 100% above the line tax \ndeduction for the long-term care insurance.\n  As chairman of the Special Committee on Aging, addressing the \nchallenges of long-term care have been high on my list of priorities. \nDuring the past two years, I've heard first-hand from individuals and \nfamily members about the financial challenges that go along with \nmanaging long-term care needs, such as those associated with \nAlzheimer's Disease.\n  In too many cases, families experience financial devastation when \nfaced with long-term care needs. Unfortunately, many families do not \nplan for costs associated with long-term care. And many families are \nmis-informed about what Medicare and Medicaid cover in respect to long-\nterm care.\n  Today's average cost of nursing home care is about $40,000 a year. \nWhen individuals are faced with a chronic or disabling condition in \nretirement, they often quickly exhaust their resources. As a result, \nthey turn to Medicaid for help.\n  In fact, the care for nearly 2 out of every 3 nursing home residents \nis paid for by Medicaid. As many seniors realize too late, Medicare \ndoes not cover long-term care costs.\n  I introduced legislation last Congress and again this Congress to \nprovide an incentive for individuals to plan and prepare for long-term \ncare cost. Like the provision in Senator Collins' amendment, my bill \nwill allow Americans--who do not currently have access to employer \nsubsidized long-term care plans--to deduct the amount of such a plan \nfrom their taxable income.\n  This encourages planning and personal responsibility by helping to \nmake long-term care insurance more affordable for middle class \ntaxpayers.\n  Longer and healthier lives are a blessing and a testament to the \nprogress and advances made by our society. But Americans must be alert \nand prepare for long-term care needs. The role of private long-term \ncare insurance is critical in meeting this challenge. Over the past ten \nyears, the\n\n[[Page S8480]]\n\nlong-term care insurance market has grown significantly. The products \nthat are available today are affordable and of high quality.\n  As policy makers, our job is to develop policies for public programs \nthat can deliver efficient and cost-effective services. Yet, equally \nimportant is the role of private long-term care financing. We must take \nsteps to inform Americans about the importance of planning for \npotential long-term care needs. And, in turn, we should provide \nincentives now for the families to prepare financially for their \nretirement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Maine such time \nas she may take.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Michigan, Mr. Abraham, be added as a cosponsor to the pending \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Tennessee as \nmuch time as he may desire.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 7 minutes; the \nSenator from Massachusetts has 10 minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, a number of issues have been raised again. \nI appreciate the debate. I think it has been very good on a number of \nthese issues, some of which we have talked about in the past and some \nof which have come up on the floor. It is difficult, with the \namendments being presented, to know exactly what to address and what \nnot to address. Those of us who have been looking at this for the last \nyear, and through the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, \nhave looked at a number of these issues. Let me comment.\n  The allegation has been made the Republican bill does not assure \naccess to specialty care. The fact is the following: The Republican \nbill guarantees access to specialists. Period. Section 725 states that \nplans ``shall ensure access to specialty care when such care is covered \nunder the plan.'' We brought up again and again that the problem with \nthe Democratic bill is that it guarantees that 1\\1/2\\ million \nAmericans, if it were adopted, would not have any health insurance at \nall and, therefore, would not have access to specialty care.\n  No. 2, we have heard that under the Republican bill there is no \nguarantee a child with cancer will have access to a pediatric \noncologist. That came up earlier in the debate. The Senator from Rhode \nIsland brought it back up, so let me just clarify what we have done. \nAgain, it has been a process, as we talked again and again about that.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island says we need to specifically say \n``appropriate pediatric expertise.'' We talked about it in the \ncommittee. The reason we use the words ``age appropriate expertise'' \ninstead of just pediatric, which is much more narrow than ``age \nappropriate expertise'' is because it includes pediatrics but it also \nincludes a terribly important part of our population and that is the \ngeriatric aspect of health care.\n  We are going to have a doubling of the number of seniors over the \nnext 30 years in this country. We have to write this legislation for \ntoday and 10 years from now and 20 years from now. By using the words \n``age appropriate expertise'' instead of the very narrow construction \nof ``appropriate pediatric expertise,'' we include the geriatrician, \nboth of today and the future, as well as the pediatrician; on either \nend of the spectrum. That is the intent. That is the way it is written. \nThat is the way it is spelled out very clearly in the committee \nlanguage in the report.\n  Going through, we have heard again and again: Under the Republican \nbill, patients could be charged more for out-of-network specialty care, \neven if the plan is at fault for not having access to appropriate \nspecialists.\n  Again, let me read from the committee report, on page 33, because \nsome people have not gone back to read the original committee report \nwhich is the intent behind the language. We say:\n\n       . . . the committee intends that when the plan covers a \n     benefit or service that is appropriately provided by a \n     particular type of specialist not in the network, the benefit \n     will be provided using the ``in-network'' cost-sharing \n     schedule.\n\n  I want people to understand that. It is on page 33 of the committee \nreport, for people to refer back to that.\n  I heard again and again: The Republican bill will not allow patients \nto appeal a denial of access to a specialist, to make that appeal to an \nindependent reviewer. The fact of the matter is the Republican bill \nprovides the right to an independent, external review by a medical \nexpert when the access to a specialist is denied on the basis that care \nis not medically necessary or not medically appropriate.\n\n  So, again, let me summarize for, I think, the Senator from Rhode \nIsland. The ``pediatric expertise'' I have explained to be more ``age \nappropriate expertise.'' The Senator from North Carolina listed three \ngaping holes which I simply contend are not gaping holes.\n  I have not addressed one. The first was the plan can do anything to \ncontrol costs. That was his point No. 1. Let me say that what we have \nused in the bill is, in fact, almost the exact words out of the \nDemocratic bill. He is referring to the rule of construction under the \ntimely access provision, section 104. Basically, we lifted--used the \nexact same wording as the rule of construction. It goes something like:\n\n       Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to require the \n     coverage under a group health plan of particular benefits or \n     services or prohibit a plan from including providers . . .\n\n  And it goes on forward.\n  With that, I will simply refer him to the rule of construction on \npage 34 and 35 of their bill, of the underlying Kennedy bill, because \nthat is where we took that rule of construction, about not requiring \ncoverage.\n  The second so-called hole was the treatment plan issue and the \nlimitation. Again, from your bill, if you look at page 12 where we say \nwe require a treatment plan, your bill requires the same sort of \ntreatment plan as what we actually required. Again, you can be critical \nof it in our plan, but explain why it is in your plan on page 12.\n  The third is this right to appeal. It is very important to deal with \nthat right to appeal. Saying there is no right to appeal is, basically, \nabsolutely false. We have obtained a legal opinion on this to make \nabsolutely sure. If required, the treatment plan is required--what they \ntold me, it is to be an element of medical judgment; that is, is it \nmedically necessary or not necessary, which takes it in the realm of \nmedical judgment. If that is the case, there can be an appropriate \nrequest for an external appeal, where you have a medical physician, \nindependent reviewer, have the final say as to whether or not that \ncoverage is there.\n  That is about 9 or 10 of the complaints that have been discussed over \nthe course of the day.\n  Senator Bingaman mentioned cost sharing. Again, I would refer him to \npage 33 of the report where we talk about in-network cost sharing.\n  His second point where the specialists have to be primary care \nphysicians, I have gone on and on about this. I just disagree. \nSpecialists today--a heart transplant surgeon does not need to be \ndesignated a primary care physician from an access standpoint when you \nhave removed the barriers, and that somebody does have access, as \nguaranteed in the bill.\n  I see there to be no reason why you designate a heart transplant \nsurgeon to be a medical specialist. We just disagree. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has expired on the time of the Senator \nfrom Vermont. Who yields time? The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to go over where we are in the \ndebate. The amendment that has been proposed by our Republican \ncolleagues covers, as close as I can figure, four different areas: One \nis the tax credit of long-term care. It is being defined. We have asked \nthe Treasury Department to look at that because many of us are \ninterested in the long-term care issue. We have not heard back from the \nTreasury Department. Time has expired on this particular amendment.\n  There is also the issue of changes to the OB/GYN provision and \nwhether this is a change which gives the protections to women which we \nhave included in our legislation. The provisions have\n\n[[Page S8481]]\n\nbeen examined by various OB/GYN specialists. We will include in the \nRecord the inadequacies of those particular provisions in achieving the \nobjectives described on the floor. The OB/GYN specialists find the \nlanguage included in that amendment fails. That will be available to \nthe Members.\n  Third is the speciality issue. Our good friends, the Senator from New \nMexico and the Senator from Iowa, as well as the Senator from Rhode \nIsland and the Senator from North Carolina, and others will address in \ngreater detail the issue of specialists.\n  I want to make a brief comment in response to the particular proposal \nof the Senator from Tennessee. In reading through the language--and it \nis important to read the language, as the Senator has said--it says:\n\n       Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a \n     group plan from requiring that speciality care be provided \n     pursuant to a treatment plan so long as the treatment plan--\n     --\n\n  Is developed by the specialist. On page 12, it says:\n\n       . . . appropriate to the conditions of the participant or \n     beneficiary, when such care is covered under the plan, such \n     access may be provided.\n\n  ``When such care is covered under the plan'' makes the provision \nmeaningless because the care is covered only if authorized by the \ngatekeeper. It says when the care is covered, but it does not say it \nhas to be covered.\n  Then it says:\n\n       Such access may be provided through contractual agreements \n     with specialized providers outside the network.\n\n  That is optional. You can read all the lines you want about age-\nappropriate speciality if they include it in the plan, but if you start \nright out and say it is not included and is optional, it is \nmeaningless. That is not only my opinion, but it will be gone into to \nsome degree by others.\n  I listened to my friend and colleague from Tennessee say the issue is \nappealable. Why not write that in the bill? We wrote it in. Why leave \nany question? Why does he have to quote a letter from some law \nprofessor? I have a letter from a law professor that says it does not. \nWhy not just write it in the bill?\n  I hope there will be some kind of response. I will be glad to yield \nfor a minute. We wrote in our bill that it is appealable if a \nspecialist such as a pediatric oncologist or necessary specialist is \ndenied. Why isn't it included in the Republican plan? It is not.\n  We will have an opportunity to debate that issue.\n  I do not want to get off message, but I hope our good friend from \nOklahoma, as well as our good friend from Texas, will now look at what \nthe Republican bill is costing.\n  This is what the Republican bill is costing. According to joint tax, \nit is $1 billion for patient protections; 100 percent deductibility for \nsmall business is $2.9 billion; liberalized MSA, $1.5 billion; flexible \nspending account is $2.3 billion. That adds up to $7.7 billion. Long-\nterm care is $5.4 billion. That is $13 billion--$13 billion for the \nRepublican plan.\n  I hope we do not hear any more about the cost of the plan with no \noffsets. I hope we can get rid of that argument. It has taken us 2\\1/2\\ \ndays. Under CBO, ours is $7 billion. The Republican plan with this will \nvirtually be doubled. I hope we are going to be free of that argument. \nWe want to focus on what we are interested in, and that is the \nPatients' Bill of Rights.\n\n  We are going to have an amendment when I yield back the time in just \na moment. I want the membership to understand, this amendment will not \nbe targeted to OB/GYN. It will not be targeted to long-term care. It \nwill not be targeted to emergency room care, though there are many \ndifferent provisions in that with which we take issue, which our friend \nfrom Florida has pointed out. This will only be targeted to the \nprovisions of the Republican amendment on speciality care.\n  Our amendment is accepted and those who will put forward and present \nit are Senator Bingaman, Senator Harkin, Senator Edwards, and others \nwill debate that for the next 50 minutes. It will only be amending that \nparticular provision. We will have an opportunity to make a judgment on \nthe rest of the provisions later, depending upon what happens on this.\n  We are limiting this debate to what we have always wanted: a debate \non the Patients' Bill of Rights, and that is, protecting people from \nthe abuses of HMOs. Long-term care is not a part of that provision, \nalthough it was brought in and that is important. We do not believe it \nbelongs on this, but it is here.\n  Many of us are unprepared to make a judgment on that since we just \nfound out about that particular provision. We will be interested in \nwhat the offsets are going to be.\n  The next proposal will be the amendment that will be offered by the \nSenator from New Mexico which will be targeted to speciality care. We \nare protecting patients, and we insist they get the specialty care we \nbelieve is so essential.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a question prior to yielding \nback his time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Not at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is now yielded back on the Collins \namendment.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1245 to Amendment No. 1243\n\n            (Purpose: To guarantee access to specialty care)\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy], for Mr. \n     Bingaman, for himself, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Dodd, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \n     Reid, Mr. Edwards, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Graham, Mr. \n     Kennedy, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Rockefeller, Mrs. \n     Feinstein, and Mr. Reed, proposes an amendment numbered 1245 \n     to amendment No. 1243.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am going to yield the floor. If the \nSenator has a question, I will be glad to yield for a minute to \nrespond. I want to have our colleagues talk about this amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. I can respond on our time relative to this amendment. I \nwill do it then.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Fine. I did not want to be discourteous to the Senator. \nI yield 7 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized for \n7 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senator from \nMassachusetts for yielding this time.\n  Mr. President, this is a very important amendment. This is the \namendment that I believe is the most significant for many Americans in \nthis entire debate. This is the amendment that relates to the question \nof whether they are going to have access to speciality care as part of \ntheir arrangement with their health maintenance organization.\n\n  Often, if speciality care is denied or if access to speciality care \nis delayed for a substantial period of time, it can involve a real \nhealth risk and even death for a patient. This is not an insignificant \nmatter. This is a very important matter which is essential we deal with \nif we are going to put in place some protections for patients in this \nlegislation.\n  The amendment that Senator Kennedy has sent to the desk on my behalf \nestablishes, first of all, a general right to speciality care if it is \nmedically necessary. If a plan cannot provide such care within its own \nnetwork, then it must allow the patient who needs that care to go \noutside the network at no extra cost to the patient. This is in sharp \ncontrast to the amendment we were talking about before which the \nSenator from Maine sent to the desk. In that case, there was no \nrestriction on the HMO in its ability to charge additional amounts to \nthe patient if they went outside the plan.\n  We provide that no additional charges can be imposed. This is a \nprocedure which is in place in many of our managed health care plans, \nbut unfortunately not in all. What we would do is say that this is a \nbasic right that people in this country are entitled to if they have \nhealth care through health maintenance organizations.\n\n  The second thing this amendment does is it allows people who have a\n\n[[Page S8482]]\n\nchronic or a serious ongoing illness that requires specialty care to \nreceive that care either through a standing referral to a specialist or \nby designating a specialist as their primary care provider.\n  This is very important. This is an important protection for disabled \npeople, for individuals with serious chronic illnesses, such as \ndiabetes. In my comments a few minutes ago, I referred to the fact that \na person with diabetes clearly needs access to a specialist on an \nongoing basis. They receive most of their care from a specialist who \nunderstands their condition, and that specialist is in the best \nposition to coordinate their care.\n  The plan which the Republican Members offered a few minutes ago does \nnot guarantee access to that specialty care without additional cost. It \ndoes not guarantee access to that specialty care for all patients. And \nit does not guarantee access to that specialty care on an ongoing basis \nwith that specialist being designated as a standing referral or as a \nprimary care provider.\n  So there is a very great difference between what we are offering in \nthis second-degree amendment and what was earlier discussed.\n  This amendment I think is absolutely crucial for people who suffer \nfrom these ongoing chronic diseases. This is an issue which we heard \nvery dramatically described earlier this morning in a press conference \nthat occurred outside the Capitol.\n  We had a woman attend who talked about the problems--she is a nurse \nherself, so she knows a great deal about providing medical care to \nindividuals--and she talked about the problems she and her husband had \nin gaining access to specialty care for their young child, their 4-\nyear-old son Matthew. What she said I think rings true to a lot of \nAmericans.\n  Let me just go briefly through her story. She talked about Matthew \nhaving a significant speech delay that had been directly linked to his \nrepeated ear infections. She said for the first 2 years of his life \nMatthew suffered 14 ear infections. In most cases this is a normal \nchildhood illness that is treatable by antibiotics, but in the case of \nMatthew it was not a normal childhood illness.\n  The doctor who treated Matthew repeatedly used antibiotics instead of \ngranting the request, which the parents made, for a referral to an ear, \nnose, and throat specialist. As a nurse, this mother, Beth Gross, knew \nthe risks of the chronic condition. She grew frustrated at how a simple \nsurgical procedure called an ear tube placement could have immediately \ncorrected this problem, and eventually her frustration grew to a level \nwhere she made the decision to change her primary care physician.\n  She called the insurance company at that point. She said when she \nexplained the dilemma she was in, she was outraged by the response she \nreceived from the insurance company.\n  This is a quotation from her statement. She said:\n\n       We could not get a referral for Matthew because it was \n     their policy [the policy of the insurance company] to impose \n     monetary sanctions on the physician for giving a referral for \n     something that he is able to treat.\n\n  It was the view of the insurance company that he was able to treat \nthis. They were going to impose monetary sanctions on him if there was \na referral made. On that basis, they would not allow the referral. So \nshe had to fight for another year to get the referral that Matthew \nneeded.\n\n  By that time, Matthew was 18 months old and was still not speaking. \nAlthough she had changed doctors, she could not change insurance \ncompanies. When they finally did see the specialist they needed, the \nspecialist immediately knew the right procedure and performed it to \ncorrect the problem. So Matthew finally did receive this ear tube \nsurgery that he desperately needed. After that, his hearing cleared up; \nthe problem was solved.\n  Unfortunately, though, if Matthew had only been treated earlier he \nwould have been able to avoid the speech problem he now has as a 4-\nyear-old. She said in her statement:\n\n       Now our family must work to correct his speech problem. Our \n     insurance company has changed since then, but it has been \n     another fight with another HMO to cover speech therapy. They \n     denied coverage for that service until the National Patient \n     Advocate Foundation stepped in and won that battle for \n     Matthew.\n\n  We have a serious problem in gaining access to specialty care in the \ncase of many of these HMOs. The amendment we have prepared has the \nsupport of a tremendous number of groups: The National Alliance for the \nMentally Ill, the Patients Access Coalition, the Religious Action \nCenter of Reform Judaism, the Coalition of Cancer Organizations, the \nOncology Nursing Society, the American Thoracic Society, and on and on.\n  So there is a very long list of organizations that believe very \nstrongly we need to have this protection built into the law. I believe \nvery strongly in that.\n  When I travel through New Mexico and talk to people about their \nhealth care problems, of all the issues that I am told about, probably \nthis issue of gaining access to specialty care is the most significant.\n  People are very concerned that if a circumstance befalls them or \ntheir child or their parent, they will be denied access to specialty \ncare unless we do something to ensure that that access is there. The \namendment we are offering will provide that access. It will ensure that \naccess is there. It is a basic right that we ought to ensure.\n  Let me mention one other thing because I think this is a point that \nwas made several times this morning.\n  We spend billions and billions of dollars in this country, and we \nvote for those dollars right here on this Senate floor, to support the \nvery best medical research in the world. At the National Institutes of \nHealth, I think their budget this year is somewhere in excess of $13 \nbillion. We do have the specialists that the rest of the world envies. \nPeople come here from all over the world to gain access to these \nspecialists.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator's time has \nexpired.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Unless we put some of these protections in the law, we \nare denying our own citizens, in many cases, access to the specialists \ntheir tax dollars have paid to train in the specialty care their tax \ndollars have gone to develop. So we need to put these protections into \nplace. The great research and the great health care that is developed \nat NIH needs to get to the patient, and that is what this amendment \nwill try to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I very much hope that all Members of the Senate will \nsupport this amendment.\n  I yield to the Senator from Nevada the remainder of my time and yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. REID. I yield 7 minutes to the junior Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this is an extremely important issue that \nSenator Bingaman has come up with. I am proud to be a cosponsor of the \namendment with him. I will just read the list of additional cosponsors: \nSenators Dodd, Murray, Reid of Nevada, Edwards, Boxer, Durbin, Graham \nof Florida, Kennedy, Daschle, Feingold, Rockefeller, Feinstein, and \nReed of Rhode Island.\n  This is an important issue. I have worked, as Senators know, for a \nlong time on issues dealing with disabilities, people with disabilities \nin this country. This is an extremely important issue for people with \ndisabilities and people with long-term chronic health conditions such \nas cancer and others. The Bingaman amendment would ensure access to \nspecialty care would be guaranteed to individuals in a group health \nplan so they have access to the specialty care they need. The inability \nto access specialists is the No. 1 reason people give for leaving HMOs. \nWhen I hear criticism of managed care from my constituents, it almost \nalways involves some sort of problem with access to specialists.\n\n  Senator Bingaman has articulated the differences in the bill. I want \nto review them again so people have a clear understanding of what the \nBingaman amendment does.\n  First, the amendment guarantees patients access to specialists who \nare qualified to treat their conditions. If the specialist in the \nplan's network cannot meet a patient's needs, this amendment allows the \npatient to see a specialist outside of the HMO's network at no \nadditional cost.\n\n[[Page S8483]]\n\n  For example, there are several rare and deadly forms of cancer that \nstrike children at an early age. Pediatric oncologists often have \nadvanced skills and technical knowledge that general oncologists do not \npossess. We have to make sure the parents of these kids can gain access \nto such specialists, even if the plan they have doesn't have pediatric \noncologists in its network. We have to ensure they can get these \nwithout additional cost. The Republican proposal fails to provide this \nbasic protection.\n  Secondly, our amendment allows a specialist to be the primary care \ncoordinator for patients with disabilities or life-threatening or \ndegenerative conditions. For example, imagine a woman with severe heart \ndisease who also has diabetes and hepatitis. She recently had heart \nsurgery and wants her cardiologist to coordinate her care. The Bingaman \namendment would allow her to have her cardiologist as her primary care \ncoordinator, who would then coordinate her care under a treatment plan \nin collaboration with her internist, endocrinologist, \ngastroenterologist, and the health plan.\n  Again, the Republican proposal fails to provide this logical \nprotection. According to their version of patients' rights, a patient \nwith a serious illness could be required to entrust important decisions \nto a primary care doctor who has no knowledge of the specific disease \nthe patient may have. If someone has a chronic or degenerative illness \nor disability, it is only logical to have a specialist who understands \nthose special needs to coordinate the patient's care.\n  The third element of this amendment provides for standing referrals \nfor people who need ongoing specialty care, which enables them to go \nstraight to the specialist instead of jumping through hoops time after \ntime after time with primary care doctors or insurance companies.\n  Here is a true story: A San Diego woman with paraplegia wanted a \nstanding referral to a rehab specialist, but her HMO primary care \nphysician refused that. After she developed a severe pressure wound, \nsomething a rehab doctor would have caught and treated, her primary \ncare physician still refused a referral. Eventually this woman had to \nundergo surgery and spent a year on her back in the hospital with \nround-the-clock nursing care. Later the HMO's medical director was \nquoted as saying, managed care ``doesn't accurately meet the needs of \nthe special patient.''\n  Again, the Republican proposal fails to provide this commonsense \nprotection. According to the Republican's version of patients' rights, \na patient receiving ongoing care from a specialist would have to go \nback and go back and go back to her or his primary care doctor whenever \nhe or she needed to visit the particular specialist.\n  From anyone's point of view, this does not make sense. By requiring a \npatient with an ongoing medical condition to continue to go back time \nand time again to a primary care doctor, every time they need to be \ntreated by a specialist, inhibits the process of making the patient \nwell.\n  Some people say our amendment would create onerous new burdens on \nplans. In fact, many plans already allow specialists to be primary care \ncoordinators, and they let people have standing referrals. In addition, \nthe numerical estimates don't factor in the importance of Americans' \ntrust in the health care industry. The patients' rights we are \nlegislating on will build consumer trust in the health care industry \nand consumer satisfaction. I believe that is in the best interest of \nour entire health care system.\n  Most importantly, when you step back and consider the policy of the \nBingaman amendment, it is very simple: Insured Americans should get \naccess to specialty care when and how they need it. They shouldn't be \ncharged a single dime more than what they bargained for--nothing more \nand nothing less.\n  A lot of organizations support this amendment, including the American \nAcademy of Pediatrics, the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities, \nand the Patient Access Coalition.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join in supporting the Bingaman \namendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from North \nCarolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, first, I join my colleagues, Senators \nBingaman and Harkin, in support of their amendment. I strongly support \nit. They have made great cases for it.\n  There is another issue I will address that goes to this amendment but \nalso goes to the amendment presently pending from the other side which \ndeals with issues of specialty care, emergency room care, and OB/GYN \ncare. I want the American people who are listening to this debate to \nlisten carefully to what I am about to say.\n  There is a huge, fundamental issue we are debating in the Senate this \nweek. That issue is, are health care decisions going to be made by \ndoctors and patients, or are they going to be made by insurance \ncompanies and HMOs.\n  Every provision that has passed and has been proposed, including this \namendment presently before us, leaves power in the insurance company. \nIt leaves power in the HMO. The arguments we hear that these bills are \ntrue patient protections are entirely circular.\n  If the American people believe insurance companies and HMOs should \ncontinue to make all the decisions, should continue to have control of \nthe process, then they should support what our colleagues on the other \nside have been supporting. If they believe there needs to be a change \nin that system, then they should support what we are proposing and \nsupporting.\n  The very simple reason--it is easy to understand--why their bills \nchange nothing about the present system is because there is no way to \nenforce them. They allow appeals only on the issue of what is medically \nnecessary. It is the only thing that is appealable. What is medically \nnecessary is determined by the HMO and the health insurance company. \nThey write in the contract what is medically necessary. So no matter \nwhat we do in the Senate, no matter what we pass, so long as the \ninsurance company and the HMO can define what is medically necessary--\nand we have seen some ludicrous definitions discussed on the floor, \nincluding, for example, that it shall be in the sole discretion of the \nHMO and health insurance company to determine what is medically \nnecessary, which means they can do anything they want, since that is \nthe only thing that is appealable and, therefore, the only thing that \nis enforceable--the HMO has total control over this process. The \npatient has no power whatsoever.\n  To me, it is as if having a law saying you can't steal money from \npeople but not having a court system to enforce it, not having a police \nforce to enforce it. So when somebody steals something from you, you \nsay: Wait a minute, you can't do that. That is against the law. And the \nperson who has just stolen from you says: So what? What are you going \nto do about it?\n  What we have done is left the power entirely in the hands of the HMO \nto determine what is medically necessary and, as a result, to determine \nwhat is appealable. The only enforcement that any patient has is the \nappeal, which means the health insurance company has total control of \nthe entire process.\n  This argument is completely circular. It makes no difference what we \npass. We can pass anything--OB/GYN reform, emergency room reform, \nspecialists reform. It doesn't matter. The health insurance company \ngets to determine what is medically necessary. The health insurance \ncompany gets to determine, therefore, what is appealable.\n  Those things have already passed, before this debate that is going on \nright now.\n  The bottom line is this: Patients have no power; they have no ability \nto enforce anything. As long as the health insurance company maintains \ncontrol over the appeal and grievance process, as long as they maintain \ncontrol over the only enforcement mechanism that exists, we have no \npolice, we have no court, we have no way to hold the HMOs accountable.\n  When we finish the debate this week, and whatever passes here, HMOs \nare going to have a field day. They are going to go back with their \nteams of lawyers, and they are going to write contracts that completely \nprotect them from any patient ever being able to appeal anything. That \nis all they\n\n[[Page S8484]]\n\nhave to do. There is nothing in anything we have passed thus far that \nwill prevent them from doing that. They can write their contracts any \nway they want. They get to decide what is medically necessary. What I \nhave just talked about applies to everything; it applies to everything \nthat has passed thus far.\n  I will say what my colleagues have said. If what I am saying is not \ntrue, why don't we simply say, for example, in the amendment that is \npresently pending from the other side, which deals with OB/GYN, \nemergency room care, specialist care--why don't we put one sentence in \nthat says: Any denial of services under this amendment shall be subject \nto independent appeal and review.\n  That is all it would take. Then it is enforceable. Then you have \npolice and a court system. But when that doesn't exist --and it doesn't \nexist, in my opinion, for a reason, in that amendment. I might add, \nthat it is clearly stated in the amendment that Senator Bingaman has \njust offered. There is a direct, independent appeal if the HMO denies \nservice.\n  It is very simple. It is a question of who has power. The way we live \nin the health care system in this country, the power rests with the HMO \nand the health insurance company. I hoped that the debate on the floor \nthis week would be about how we can go about shifting that pendulum so \nwe put more power in the hands of patients, more power in the hands of \ndoctors, that we would pass some thoughtful, moderate legislation that \nwould move the pendulum back to the middle.\n  Unfortunately, as long as there is no way to enforce it, as long as \nthe HMO can write the contract any way they want, they can define \nmedical necessity. They define the appeal process and, therefore, they \ncan eliminate the right to enforce anything. The power rests entirely \nwith the HMO and entirely with the health insurance company, which is \nwhere it is today, and that is what I believe we need to do something \nabout.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I have listened to the Senator, and I guess he has not been listening \nto the debate because the very argument he made, which has been made \nbefore--and we spent the time of this body going through the law, going \nthrough the definitions, going through the committee reports--is 100 \npercent wrong. The patient is in control. The patient has the right, \nfirst of all, to an internal review. First of all, the standard is not \njust necessary; it is necessary and appropriate.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Let me talk first and then I can yield. I want to \ninform you because, obviously, you are talking from a poor base of \ninformation, so there is no sense discussing it until I explain to you \nwhat is in the bill.\n  First of all, we have established for the first time in this country \nthe right of patients to be able to get the necessary and appropriate \nhealth care that they deserve and are entitled to under their plan. \nThat is why we have set up an internal review process first, which can \nbe appealed within the HMO. And then if care is not given to the \npatient that the patient thinks is appropriate and necessary, there is \nan external review. That external review is made by someone outside of \nthe HMO who is a qualified individual, knowledgeable on the subject, \nwith the authority to overrule the HMO.\n\n  So how can the Senator get out of that the fact that they have no \nrights, when for the first time we give them rights? We give much more \nrights than your bill does to ensure that people in these HMOs have the \nabsolutely necessary and appropriate care that they are entitled to.\n  So I hope that we will not continue to hear this repetition of things \nthat are not true. Yesterday, the Senator from Pennsylvania came and \nread this to all of you. He read all this, which explains and details \nthis and gives you exactly what the process is. And now you turn around \nand say it doesn't exist. It does exist.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Will the Senator yield for a question? I request \npermission to ask the Senator a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Yes, I yield for a question.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I have two questions.\n  First, let me ask the Senator, is it his understanding that the \ninsurance company, the HMO, writes in the contract what the definition \nof what medically necessary is?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Yes, but that is appealable.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Is it the Senator's understanding that what is \nappealable is based upon the insurance company's definition that is \ncontained in the contract?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. No, that is not correct.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Can he show me that in any bill, in anything we have \npassed----\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. We have read it to you.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Let me finish the question. I don't mean to interrupt \nyou. Can he show me anyplace, in anything we have passed, where we have \nput any confines, any kind of restrictions on how the HMO or health \ninsurance company can define what is medically necessary? Can he show \nme anything to prevent them from defining what is medically necessary \nany way they want?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. They can do that, but it will not be legally binding. \nThe patient will have an appeal because in the law it says it must be \nnecessary and appropriate care that must be provided. They cannot \ndefine necessary. They cannot define appropriate. That is a standard \nwhich we established after evidence as to what the best care is that \nshould be available to them. The provisions are in the bill.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I am reading from your bill, page 173, where it says \nwhat is appealable is what is medically necessary and appropriate \n``under the terms and conditions of the plan.''\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I want to continue this only if it is on \nthe Senator's time. I don't have the ability----\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield such time as the Senator from North \nCarolina needs to finish his statement.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I am reading from your bill, where it specifically says \nwhat is appealable is what is medically necessary and appropriate \n``under the terms and conditions of the plan''--under the terms and \nconditions of the plan written by the health insurance company. Your \nown bill specifically says that the only thing that is appealable is \nwhat the insurance company's written plan says is medically necessary. \nHow does that change the power from the insurance company having total \ncontrol over the enforcement mechanism?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, will the Senator from North Carolina yield?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. We are getting into a lengthy dissertation. I think the \nSenator is reading from the old bill, which is a starting problem.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I respectfully suggest that what I am reading from is \nthe actual bill.\n  Let me ask the Senator one last, simple question. If what he is \nsaying is true, is the Senator willing to put in the amendment \npresently before us OB/GYN care, specialty care, and emergency room \ncare? On those three provisions, is he willing to put in a specific \nprovision that says denial of any of those services is directly \nappealable to an independent body? Would he be willing to do that?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. It is unnecessary. It is already in the bill.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Is the Senator not willing to do it?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. We have legal opinion given to us to exonerate.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. What is the right to do it?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. We believe what we have is absolute protection for the \npatient. Not only that, it establishes a new national standard, which \nyours does not. You are using generally acceptable practices, which is \na much lower standard. We establish a higher standard that every \npatient is entitled to the best medical care which is necessary and \nappropriate. That is a new standard. That is why the doctors are \nconcerned, because they are going to have to reach a new standard.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. On my time, I am only asking the Senator, if that is \ntrue,\n\n[[Page S8485]]\n\nwhy does he have any objection to a simple sentence in this amendment \nthat says denial of services under any of those areas is directly \nappealable to an independent body? Does the Senator object to that?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. It is already in the bill, so why should I need to put \nit in?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have gone over this before. Senator \nKennedy made the same offer. Our legislation says that anything, as set \nforth by the Senator from North Carolina, is appealable. It is as \nsimple as that. It is appealable. They are depending on a legal opinion \nfrom some insurance lawyer. We are not willing to do that. We want \nappealable as part of the legislation. They are unwilling to do that \nfor obvious reasons, because their legislation is dictated by the \ninsurance companies.\n  I also say that the majority leader today bragged about one of his \nMembers. I would like to brag about one of our Members.\n  We have John Edwards, a new Senator from the State of North Carolina, \nwho has represented the injured, the maimed, and the wrongfully killed \nfor many years. He is one of the prominent attorneys in the United \nStates. He is one of the finest representatives of protecting the \nrights of the oppressed and injured.\n  That should be spread across the Record of this Senate.\n  We have heard some people boasting about Members on the other side. \nWe have one of the finest lawyers in America, now a Member of the \nSenate. We are very proud of that.\n  I think he has made a very clear case that the reason they are \nunwilling to agree to his simple words ``it is appealable'' is that \nthey don't want it appealable. They know it is not appealable.\n  Mr. President, will the Chair indicate to the Senator how much time \nthe minority has left on this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 26 minutes 11 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. REID. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I rise in strong support of the Bingaman amendment and the Harkin \namendment and all my colleagues who are supporting it.\n\n  This amendment is particularly responsive to the needs of children in \nthe health care system. That is why it has been endorsed by the \nChildren's Defense Fund.\n  We find when we look at the access to pediatric specialists that \nchildren don't have that kind of adequate access. As a result, they are \nthe ones who will suffer the most, I believe, if we do not have strong, \nexplicit language giving the right to access to pediatric specialists.\n  There was a survey done in 1992 by Pediatrics magazine. This survey \nindicated that of the pediatricians who were asked, 35 percent \nrepresented that they thought their patients' health outcome was \nseverely upset by denial of access to a pediatric specialist. They \nfound that this practice was all too common. For children, in \nparticular with chronic illnesses, they must seek specialists. It must \nbe clear. It must not be some type of very ambiguous language, as we \nfind in the Republican version of the legislation.\n  Let me suggest another area when it comes to children where access to \nspecialists is difficult. I have a letter from Paul L. Schnur, who is \npresident of the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive \nSurgeons. He points out that approximately 7 percent of American \nchildren are born with pediatric deformities and congenital defects \nsuch as birthmarks, cleft lips, cleft palates, absent external ears, \nand even more profound facial deformities. Yet, even in these \ncompelling circumstances, he reports that it is very difficult to get a \nreferral from a managed care plan to a specialist, and it is probably \neven more difficult to get a referral to a pediatric specialist.\n  Of the surgeons who indicated they had trouble getting referrals, 74 \npercent had patients denied coverage for initial procedures and 53 \npercent had patients denied coverage for subsequent procedures.\n  What you see is, access to specialists is difficult for children. \nAccess for pediatric specialists is extraordinarily difficult for \nchildren. And unless we do something about this, we are going to find \nthe situation where children will again and again be shortchanged by \nthe managed care system.\n  The Republicans have said, listen, we have some in here who say it is \n``age specific.''\n  We have a great deal of respect and esteem for our colleague from \nTennessee, who is a physician. I suspect if he were making these \ndecisions about referrals to specialists, he would be sensitive to \n``age specificity.'' But that is not who makes these referral \ndecisions. It is attorneys, reviewers, bureaucrats, and technicians. \nAnd, frankly, when they see ``age specific,'' they are going to say: \nWell, you know, we don't have a pediatric specialist on our panel. But \nthat is OK, because we can find somebody who perhaps saw a child in the \nlast year or two, and that is ``age specific'' enough for us.\n  This whole approach is an invitation, once again, to the HMO to make \nup the rules and then make those rules work against the interests of \ntheir patients, and particularly I am concerned that they will work \nagainst the interests of children.\n  There has been some various research done about managed care plans \nthroughout the country. But I received some firsthand information from \na doctor in Los Angeles who is conducting a very interesting program. \nIt is Dr. Craig Jones. He is at the UCLA Medical School. He has \ndeveloped a ``Breathmobile program.'' This program goes right to the \nschools in Los Angeles, and they deal with the No. 1 environmental \nillness affecting children, and that is chronic asthma.\n  Dr. Jones has treated lots of children. He has had a great outcome. \nBut they collected data. The startling thing about their data is that a \nchild in managed care gets the same kind of treatment for severe asthma \nas a child without any insurance. If they look at the numbers, there is \nno difference, because a child in managed care doesn't get the referral \nto a pulmonary specialist or a respiratory specialist. They get--like \nevery other child who shows up in the emergency room--a little bag with \nan inhaler, and some medicine, and are told to go home.\n\n  We can do better, and we must do better. But we will not do better \nuntil health care plans are required to make references to specialists \nand, in the particular case of children, pediatric specialists. I have \nsaid this over and over again, but it still remains true. There is a \ndifference between an adult oncologist and a pediatric oncologist. I \ndon't think anyone in this body would dispute that.\n  One other final point, if I may make it, is that when you go around \nand look at how physicians are categorized and how specialists are \ncategorized, you are not going to find an ``age appropriate'' \nspecialty. You are not going to find someone who says, I am qualified \n``age appropriate.'' They are pediatricians, neurologists, and a whole \nhost of people who have special qualifications. We have to work with \nthose categories and not some vague, disingenuous category which will \nbe severely distorted by the insurance companies.\n  I urge passage of the Bingaman amendment.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the amendment that myself, Senator \nHarkin, and many of my colleagues are offering today guarantees \nAmerican families the right to access medical specialists. Our \namendment is fair. It is what working families pay for each month, and \nvery simply put; this amendment can literally save lives.\n  Let me briefly outline the fundamental components of this amendment.\n  First, our amendment says that if you pay for health insurance, you \nare guaranteed the right to see a specialist if medically appropriate.\n  Second, if a plan cannot provide such care within its network, it \nmust allow the patient to go outside the network to an institution or \nindividual competent to provide the care, at no cost to the patient \nbeyond what would be required if the patient were treated in network.\n  Third, this amendment allows people with chronic or serious ongoing \nillnesses that require continued specialty care to receive that care \neither through a standing referral to a specialist or by designating \nthe specialist as their special care coordinator.\n\n[[Page S8486]]\n\n  The current requirement that patients must go back to a primary care \ndoctor whenever they need to see a specialist or when additional care \nis ordered is at best an inconvenience, and at worst, a real detriment \nto timely, appropriate medical services. This is especially critical \nfor the disabled and for people with chronic disorders and serious or \ncomplex medical conditions.\n  Our Republican colleagues have said that they cover access to \nspecialists in their bill. In fact, their bill does not guarantee \naccess to specialists. Under their bill, patients could actually be \ncharged more for out-of-network specialty care--even if the plan is at \nfault for not having access to appropriate specialists within the plan.\n  Our amendment will have a profound effect on the lives of American \nchildren and the families who care for them.\n  For example, our amendment would allow a child with leukemia to go \ndirectly to a pediatric oncologist instead of being hauled from doctor \nto doctor.\n  A sick child should not have to go through such an additional ordeal. \nThis makes perfect sense to me and the American people overwhelmingly \nagree. People who are fighting to stay healthy should not have to \nbattle their HMO as well.\n  This amendment has other common sense effects. The access provisions \nin this amendment, when combined with a right to a meaningful and \nspeedy independent appeal, will help minimize the need for litigation \nby helping ensure patients get the benefits they need from \nappropriately qualified providers in a timely fashion. The guaranteed \nright to have access to a specialist should not be a controversial \nissue. This is a simple matter of allowing working Americans to get \nwhat they pay for--the best medical health care available.\n  Mr. President, I believe this amendment is fair. The current system \nwasn't fair for Henry, a 40-year-old man from Albuquerque, New Mexico \nwho had what the doctors refer to as ``lymphocytic lymphoma'' a form of \ncancer.\n  Henry was not responding to conventional therapy and quickly required \na specialized procedure. This was not an experimental procedure and he \nwould most certainly die without it. His doctor immediately applied for \nthe referral.\n  Since there were no facilities for such a procedure in Henry's \nmanaged care network, his doctor requested a referral to a specialist \nout of network, a right he would have guaranteed under our amendment.\n  Even knowing exactly what kind of speciality procedure was necessary, \nwhere that specialist was, and that time was critical, the managed care \ncompany held multiple meetings which dragged on for more than a year.\n  Under our amendment speciality care is guaranteed to be available and \naccessible because we recognize the importance of providing timely, \nappropriate medical services.\n  A final meeting was held between Henry's doctors and the managed care \ncompany personnel. During that meeting, the managed care company \nrequired that Henry's doctor explicitly relate descriptions of what \nwould happen to Henry without the referral for the necessary procedure.\n  Henry's doctor writes:\n\n       I had to sit in front of this patient and his wife and \n     explain in graphic detail just exactly how he would die, how \n     that would be, and how little hope there actually was that \n     anything else would occur.\n\n  Henry's doctor continues, ``Henry had been pretty strong until that \ntime, but this broke him and after that point he lost any spirit to \nfight.''\n  After one year of requests and delays, the managed care company did, \nin fact, approve the referral, but by that time Henry's condition had \ndeteriorated and it was too late. Henry died.\n  In a final, sad epilogue to this story, the managed care plan is on \nrecord as having approved the referral to the specialist for the \nprocedure.\n  We are fortunate to live in a country that has seen so many medical \nadvances. We all have family or friends who have benefited from the \nknowledge and expertise of specialists. Blocking access to these health \ncare professionals is wrong and it is well past time to address this \nissue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nletters in support of the amendment from the American Academy of \nPediatrics, the Children's Defense Fund, the American Academy of \nPhysical Medicine and Rehabilitation, the National Breast Cancer \nCoalition, Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities, the National \nAssociation of People with AIDS, the Oncology Nursing Society, and the \nNational Multiple Sclerosis Society.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               American Academy of Pediatrics,\n\n                                  Washington, D.C., July 12, 1999.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Bingaman and Harkin: On behalf of the 55,000 \n     physician members of the American Academy of Pediatrics, I am \n     writing in support of your amendment to guarantee that \n     managed care enrollees have access to appropriate providers \n     of care.\n       In many ways, children differ from adults. They have a \n     wider spectrum of disorders and much of their care is more \n     complex than similar care in the adult patient. Also, because \n     children are rapidly developing, they often require more \n     comprehensive services in order to promote appropriate \n     development. Physicians who are approximately educated in the \n     unique physical and developmental issues surrounding the care \n     of infants, children, adolescents, and young adults should \n     provide their care.\n       Your amendment would ensure access to specialty care, \n     including, in the case of a child, pediatric medical \n     subspecialists and pediatric surgical specialists. The \n     Academy strongly believes that pediatric-trained physician \n     specialists should have completed an appropriate fellowship \n     in their area of expertise and be certified by specialty \n     boards in a timely fashion if certification is available. \n     These practitioners should also be engaged actively in the \n     ongoing practice of their pediatric specialty and should \n     participate in continuing medical education in this area. \n     This is a critical guarantee for the pediatric population.\n       The Academy also agrees that an efficient process for \n     approving referrals to pediatric specialists, in- and out-of-\n     plan, should be developed and publicized widely to plan \n     members. In some instances, this might include the provision \n     of standing referrals for children with certain health care \n     needs. Your amendment would make this possible.\n       Additionally, we support proposed arrangements to allow a \n     specialist to serve as primary care provider in certain \n     cases. Though the role of the ``gatekeeper'' should be \n     assumed by the primary care pediatrician (i.e., the physician \n     who assures that all referrals are medically necessary), this \n     function might be transferred to a pediatric specialist team \n     for certain children with complex physical health problems \n     (e.g., those with special health care needs such as cystic \n     fibrosis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, etc.) if the \n     specialist assume both responsibility and financial risk for \n     primary and specialty care.\n       Finally, we strongly support the ability of a beneficiary \n     to go out of network, at no additional cost, if the plan has \n     not contracted with appropriate specialty providers or they \n     are not available. For children in need of specialty care, \n     this protection is crucial. Because children tend to be \n     generally healthy and a majority of them do not require \n     specialty services, in some areas and/or within some plans, \n     pediatric medical subspecialists and pediatric surgical are \n     not available. This should never, however, be an excuse to \n     force a family to take a child to a lesser-qualified \n     provider.\n       If we can be of assistance or provide additional \n     information in support of your efforts, please do not \n     hesitate to contact us.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Graham Newson,\n     Director, Department of Federal Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                      Children's Defense Fund,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 13, 1999.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: I am writing to let you know that \n     the Children's Defense Fund supports the access to specialty \n     care amendment that you and Senator Harkin plan to offer \n     during the Senate debate this week on the Patients' Bill of \n     Rights. As you know, the mission of the Children's Defense \n     Fund is to Leave No Child Behind' and to ensure \n     every child a Healthy Start, a Head Start, a Fair Start, a \n     Safe Start, and a Moral Start in life and successful passage \n     to adulthood with the help of caring families and \n     communities. Your amendment will ensure that families and \n     their children in managed care get access to needed specialty \n     care to help those children get the healthy start in life \n     that they deserve.\n       Children with special health care needs often need out-of-\n     network specialty care. Cost cutting and profit maximizing \n     managed care decisions all too frequently serve as a bar to \n     access to specialty care for these children. Also, when these \n     children receive on-going specialty care treatment, they \n     should be able to designate their specialists as their \n     primary care providers.\n       Your amendment will guarantee that children will get access \n     to the specialty care they need and ensure that children in \n     managed care have the opportunity to grow and\n\n[[Page S8487]]\n\n     develop. Without such protection, children will suffer harm \n     that is unconscionable. Thank you for taking a leadership \n     role in raising this important amendment for consideration by \n     the Senate. We look forward to implementation of meaningful \n     managed care reform that includes these important specialty \n     care provisions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Gregg Haifley,\n     Health Division Deputy Director.\n                                  ____\n\n         American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation,\n                                       Chicago, IL, July 13, 1999.\n       Dear Senator Harkin and Senator Bingaman: The American \n     Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, representing \n     6,000 physicians who provide comprehensive rehabilitation \n     services to people with physical disabilities, strongly \n     endorses your amendments to assure direct access to \n     specialists for people with disabilities who need specialty \n     care and others who may have ongoing specialty care needs.\n       While S. 326 includes a provision on access to specialty \n     care, it does not assure access for it does not enable a \n     person with a condition requiring ongoing specialty care, \n     such as spinal injury, brain injury or stroke, to have direct \n     access to a specialist. Primary care providers are empowered \n     to continue as gatekeepers in such cases under S. 326. Your \n     amendments would authorize standing referrals to specialists \n     or allow a person with conditions such as spinal injury to \n     utilize a specialist as the care coordinator. Your amendments \n     would therefore assure direct access to the specialist while \n     S. 326 would not.\n           Sincerely\n\n                                       John Melvin, President,\n\n                                      American Academy of Physical\n     Medicine and Rehabilitation.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             National Breast Cancer Coalition,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 13, 1999.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: On behalf of the National Breast Cancer \n     Coalition (NBCC), I am writing to thank you for your \n     leadership in offering the access to specialists amendment to \n     the ``Patients' Bill of rights'' being debated in the U.S. \n     Senate this week. NBCC is a grassroots advocacy organization \n     dedicated to eradicating breast cancer through action and \n     advocacy. Formed in 1991, the Coalition now has more than 500 \n     member organizations and tens of thousands of individual \n     members. NBCC seeks to increase the influence of breast \n     cancer survivors and other activists over public policy in \n     cancer research, clinical trials, and access to quality \n     health care for all women.\n       As you know, NBCC believes that this amendment is an \n     essential component of a meaningful patients' bill of rights. \n     By offering this amendment and making it a priority, you \n     highlight the importance of ensuring that individuals in \n     group health plans have access to the specialty care they \n     need.\n       We appreciate that your amendment includes standing \n     referrals that would allow patients to go straight to their \n     oncologist instead of jumping through hoops with primary care \n     doctors or insurance companies. This direct access is \n     extremely important for women who are fighting for their \n     lives against breast cancer.\n       We look forward to working with you to get this important \n     patient protection, and a comprehensive and enforceable \n     ``Patients' Bill of Rights'' enacted into law. Please do not \n     hesitate to call me, or NBCC's Government Relations Manager, \n     Jennifer Katz, if you have any questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Fran Visco,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    Consortium for\n\n\n                                   Citizens With Disabilities,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 9, 1999.\n     Re CCD strongly supports the Bingaman/Harkin amendment on \n         access to specialists.\n\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC 20510\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: We are writing as Co-Chairs of the \n     Health Task Force of the Consortium for Citizens with \n     Disabilities (CCD) to express our strong support for the \n     amendment you intend to offer along with Senator Harkin to \n     ensure appropriate access to specialty care during the \n     upcoming debate on the Patient's Bill of Rights. CCD is a \n     Washington-based coalition of nearly 100 national \n     organizations representing the more than 54 million children \n     and adults living with disabilities and their families in the \n     United States.\n       Ensuring that people with disabilities and others with \n     complex medical conditions can designate a specialist as the \n     primary care provider (PCP) is among the most necessary new \n     patient protections, along with the right to go out of \n     network for specialty care when such specialty care is not \n     readily accessible within the network. Most people with \n     disabilities live with extremely complex conditions and \n     getting access to appropriately trained providers with the \n     knowledge and skill to treat their condition can have an \n     enormous impact on their health status. When persons are \n     treated by providers without the expertise or experience with \n     their particular condition, many people unnecessarily become \n     further debilitated, their capacity to function independently \n     is often diminished, or their quality of life could be \n     substantially eroded.\n       The Republican Leadership's reform plan clearly fails \n     Americans who may ever need access to a specialist. Consider, \n     for example, a person with a neurological condition. Under \n     the Republican Leadership's proposal, a health plan could \n     refuse to allow the patient to designate a qualified \n     neurologist as their primary care provider. Or, the health \n     plan could restrict the patient's access to a limited number \n     of specialty visits--even when the nature of the condition \n     clearly justifies the need for on-going specialized medical \n     treatment. Any legislation that purports to protect patients, \n     but doesn't give them the basic right to be seen by \n     appropriately trained providers does not deserve to be \n     enacted--and does not address the widespread concerns of the \n     American people.\n       The CCD Health Task Force is pleased that you will offer an \n     amendment that will ensure that people whose health condition \n     warrants it are guaranteed that their health plan must enable \n     them to seek the specialty care they require. This amendment \n     addresses the dual issue of access to a specialist as a \n     primary care provider and access to out-of-network \n     specialists when such specialty care is not available within \n     the health plan's network.\n       The CCD Health Task Force is grateful for your leadership \n     on this critical issue and we look forward to working with \n     you and your staff to ensure that this amendment is adopted.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jeffrey Crowley,\n                         National Association of People with AIDS.\n     Bob Griss,\n                                  Center on Disability and Health.\n     Kathy McGinley,\n                                     The Arc of the United States.\n     Shelley McLane,\n         National Association of Protection and Advocacy Systems.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       The National Association of\n\n\n                                             People With AIDS,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 9, 1999.\n     Re NAPWA strongly supports the Bingaman Harkin amendment on \n         access to specialists.\n\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: I am writing on behalf of the \n     National Association of People with AIDS (NAPWA) to express \n     our strong support for the amendment you intend to offer \n     along with Senator Harkin to ensure appropriate access to \n     specialty care during the upcoming debate on the Patient's \n     Bill of Rights. NAPWA serves as a national voice for the \n     nearly one million people living with HIV and AIDS in the \n     United States. We advocate on behalf of all people living \n     with HIV in order to end the HIV pandemic and the human \n     suffering caused by HIV and AIDS.\n       Ensuring that people living with HIV and AIDS and others \n     with complex medical conditions can designate a specialist as \n     the primary care provider (PCP) is among the most necessary \n     new patient protections, along with the right to go out of \n     network for specialty care when such specialty care is not \n     readily accessible within the network.\n       In recent years, medical advances and the development of \n     highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) have given hope \n     to hundreds of thousands of people living with HIV in the \n     United States. This new drug therapy has been successful in \n     preventing or slowing HIV progression for many people. Making \n     appropriate treatment decisions, however, is incredibly \n     complex. If we were to look only at the complexities involved \n     in devising a medication regimen, there are numerous factors \n     to be considered. Most current antiviral combinations involve \n     taking at least three medications. Some of them produce \n     certain types of side-effects more commonly than others. Some \n     must be taken with food, while others must be taken without \n     food. Some medications develop resistance in ways that if you \n     become resistant to one drug you could become resistent to \n     all of a particular class of drugs--and this impacts \n     decisions about which drugs you should take first and which \n     ones you should reserve in case your treatment regimen begins \n     to fail.\n       Keeping up with the latest research, working with patients \n     to devise a regimen to which they can adhere, and monitoring \n     HIV progression is very complex. Unless providers have the \n     training and spend time treating many people living with HIV, \n     they cannot treat them well. Shouldn't people have a right to \n     designate a primary care provider that has the training and \n     expertise to treat them effectively? I am glad you think so. \n     Unfortunately, the Republican Leadership proposal would not \n     give America's health care consumers that right. Shouldn't a \n     person be guaranteed that if their health plan does not have \n     the in-network specialists they need, they can go out-of-\n     network, and the health plan will pay for such care? I think \n     this is common sense. And I think the American people think \n     that is what health care is supposed to be all about.\n       I am hopeful that you and Senator Harkin will prevail in \n     convincing a majority of your colleagues to support ensuring \n     access to specialists. Now that our nation's scientists have \n     delivered us medications that provide hope to people living \n     with HIV until a cure is found, Congress needs to take the \n     next step and make sure that heartless managed\n\n[[Page S8488]]\n\n     care does not deny people the specialty care that can help to \n     keep them alive.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                . Cornelius Baker,\n     Excecutive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     Oncology Nursing Society,\n\n                                    Pittsburgh, PA, July 13, 1999.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: The Oncology Nursing Society (ONS) \n     is the largest professional oncology group in the United \n     States and is composed of over 29,000 nurses dedicated to \n     improving the care of oncology patients and oncology health \n     services. We endorse the Harkin-Bingaman amendment to assure \n     that managed care plans do not discriminate among providers, \n     such as the care provided by a nurse practitioner. We urge \n     the Senate to pass provisions to allow for the non-\n     discrimination of providers in managed care plans.\n       This amendment is extremely important to patients in \n     managed care, especially in rural and underserved areas, such \n     as New Mexico. Many areas in this country do not have enough \n     physicians to adequately care for patients in our growing \n     health care system. Many private and managed care plans do \n     not allow nurse practitioners to be reimbursed for their \n     services, thus preventing them from being full partners in \n     our health care system.\n       Advanced practice nurses, such as nurse practitioners, \n     provide competent and needed health care resources and \n     information, particularly to the under-served. In one study \n     in Tennessee, it was shown that nurse practitioners provided \n     more care to women and to young clients than physicians. It \n     has been shown that nurse practitioners provide more teaching \n     and counseling services, smoking cessation counseling, weight \n     reduction counseling, as well as nutrition counseling than \n     other providers. These are valuable and needed services to \n     improve many patient's overall health and ultimately reduce \n     future health care costs.\n       Nurse practitioners are well prepared to care for the \n     health care needs of patients. Nurse practitioners are well-\n     educated to provide health care services. Most nurses \n     entering advanced degree programs already have a wealth of \n     experience in their planned specialty even before entering \n     the advanced educational programs to prepare them as a nurse \n     practitioner. As our population ages, more individuals will \n     have cancer, and the majority of nurse practitioners working \n     with oncology patients have many years of experience as \n     oncology nurses. This type of specialization and care for \n     patients with cancer must be supported. Also, as health care \n     moves from hospital-based care to more care given in out-\n     patient settings, nurse practitioners will become more needed \n     to fill the growing gaps in health care resources. It is of \n     outmost importance that they are recognized and receive \n     reimbursement for their health care services.\n       The Oncology Nursing Society fully endorses the Harkin-\n     Bingaman amendment to provide for the non-discrimination of \n     providers in managed care. We urge the Senate to pass this \n     amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n     Robert Strohl, RN, MN, AOCN,\n                                                        President.\n     Pearl Moore, RN, MN, FAAN,\n     Chief Executive Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 National Multiple\n\n\n                                            Sclerosis Society,\n\n                                      New York, NY, July 13, 1999.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman, The National Multiple Sclerosis \n     Society is pleased to support the Bingaman/Harkin amendment \n     (access to specialists) to the Patient's Bill of Rights \n     legislation pending in the Senate. Passage of patient \n     protection legislation is one of the top public policy issues \n     for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. The MS Society \n     supports legislation that would assure the right to quality \n     medical care for all people, including those with chronic \n     illnesses such as MS.\n       Our top priority for patient protection legislation is \n     access to specialists. The Society supports legislation that:\n       Provides for direct access to a specialist when there is a \n     life-threatening or chronic illness;\n       Provides for standing referrals when a patient regularly \n     needs to see a specialist, thereby eliminating unnecessary \n     delays;\n       Allows an individual with a life-threatening or chronic \n     illness to choose a specialist as primary care physician.\n       We commend your continued leadership in the managed care \n     reform debate and look forward to working with you on the \n     common goal of getting the best medical care possible for \n     patients. Please let us know what we can do to help persuade \n     your colleagues to pass comprehensive bipartisan managed care \n     reform legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                   Mike Dugan,\n\n                                              General, USAF, Ret.,\n                                                President and CEO.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me begin by complimenting Senator \nJeffords, the chairman of the committee, for the work the committee has \ndone, and all of the members of the committee, in bringing forth this \nlegislation. I make a point to those who might be watching, this \ndebate, frankly, is not quite as cut and dried, as black and white, as \npeople on both sides of the aisle are attempting to make it. This is a \ncomplicated issue. I want to compliment some of my friends on the \nDemocratic side for insisting the issue be brought before the Senate \nfor debate.\n  There are, indeed, situations around this country in which some HMOs \nhave abused their position. In order to cut costs--which we all would \nlike to see--some HMOs have denied the highest-quality care to people \nunder their care. That is something about which we all should be \nconcerned.\n  Just as much, we need to be concerned about how much it will cost to \nfix the problem. If it costs too much, the cost of insurance escalates \ntoo high, too many people will no longer be able to buy the insurance \nthat is offered.\n  We have to be very careful that in working out a solution to what is, \nin fact, a real problem, we don't go too far. That is where the \ndifferences of opinion are. They should be considered reasonable \ndifferences between reasonable people. But I fear that too much of the \ndebate has been characterized by finger-pointing and by both sides \ncharacterizing the other side's ideas as absolutely off the wall, or \nthat no one could possibly ever think such a thing could solve the \nproblem, when, in reality, there are some common answers and there are \nsome good ideas on both sides.\n  One of the problems Senator Edwards was referring to a moment ago was \na problem during the external review process and what would be included \nin that external review process. There is going to be a change made by \nSenator Ashcroft and myself that I am sure will be fully acceptable to \nthe Senator from North Carolina. It accepts part of the definition he \nand others have offered with respect to what ought to be considered. \nSpecifically, among the factors to be considered are not just what the \nHMO writes as its ``practice guidelines or definitions,'' but also \n``recognized best practice'' and ``generally accepted medical \npractice.'' I know the Senator would be pleased with that.\n  The fact of the matter is if we continue to talk about this we are \ngoing to be able to come to some common agreement about what will make \nthis work. We have to be careful it doesn't end up costing so much that \nit drives people off of insurance plans.\n  I will talk about that for a moment. David Broder, a respected \ncolumnist, wrote on April 7 in the Washington Post that the cold truth \nabout health care raises this critical policy issue which is the \nirrefutable link between health care premium increases and the number \nof Americans without insurance. He said as we debate these various \nproposals, we have to keep this linkage in mind.\n  My colleagues on the other side are quick to point out their bill \ncould improve health care, but they are not so quick to admit it will \nraise costs. That is the problem. If it raises costs too much, some \nemployers will stop offering health insurance as a benefit. That will \nmake insurance unaffordable for more Americans. Obviously, that means \npeople are worse off, not better off.\n  Here are some statistics I think we should keep in mind. The Lewin \nGroup, a very respected consulting group, said for each 1 percent of \npremium increase, an additional 300,000 citizens will lose their \ninsurance; 300,000 people will lose their insurance for every 1 percent \npremium increase.\n  The Barents Group, another respected entity, projects a 5-percent \npremium increase would cause 1.6 million Americans to become uninsured. \nIt further points out the increase would force employees who already \nhave insurance to pay an additional average of $935 per household in \nout-of-pocket expenses. Most families are not going to be able to \nafford that.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has concluded the bill offered by our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle, the Daschle-Kennedy \nDemocratic proposal, would increase premiums by 6.1\n\n[[Page S8489]]\n\npercent. That is the Congressional Budget Office. That is not a biased \ninsurance company study. By these projections of these specialty \ngroups, this would result in almost 2 million more uninsured \nnationally.\n  In my own State of Arizona, over 34,000 people who are currently \ninsured would be uninsured as a result of the increased premium costs, \nif the Democratic proposal were to pass. That is why some of the people \non this side of the aisle are so concerned about what is being done. \nYes, there is a problem, but the physician's first rule of thumb is to \ndo no harm. We are concerned on this side that the proposal of the \nDemocrats is so costly that it would, in effect, remove 3 million \npeople from the insurance rolls. That is a worse result than is \ncurrently the case.\n  We believe, and David Broder concluded in his column, by correctly \npointing out, that additional benefits for those with insurance are \nless vital than providing access to basic care for the uninsured. This \nis one of the reasons why we have provisions in our bill which would \nprovide more of an opportunity for people to actually get insurance and \nwhy we think the Democratic version of this bill is just too expensive.\n  What does the Congressional Budget Office score the Republican bill \nas costing? Less than 1 percent. That is why we believe ours is a \nbetter approach. We would not preempt the laws of 50 States, as would \nthe Democratic bill.\n  Here are some of the things the Republican bill would do:\n  First, we make health care more affordable for the self-employed by \nletting them deduct 100 percent of their health premiums in the year \n2000, 3 years ahead of schedule.\n  We give more patients more control over their medical care and make \nit more affordable by expanding access to medical savings accounts. \nThese MSAs can provide coverage for a lot of Americans who currently \nare not covered.\n  We require the health plans actually provide the benefits that have \nbeen promised.\n  We require the health plans provide care based on the best scientific \ninformation available.\n  We require the health plans provide patients with access to their \nmedical records and ensure that the medical information will only be \nused to provide better care, not to increase their premiums.\n  We require the health plans provide reasonable access to specialists \nsuch as OB/GYNs and pediatricians without the need for referral.\n  We require them to remove so-called gag clauses. I worked on that \nwith my colleague, Ron Wyden.\n  We require they be held accountable through the appeals process. This \nis where I refer back to the colloquy Senator Jeffords and Senator \nEdwards had a moment ago. It is true that HMOs write their contracts. \nThey are the ones that write the contract. They can't force any \nemployer to contract with them. This is a matter of bargaining. It is a \nmatter of competition. It is a matter of what they cover. Once a \ncontract has been written and an employer has bought that contract and \nprovided coverage to his employees, the question then is in any given \ncase whether or not a particular procedure may be medically necessary.\n  What we provide in our legislation is a two-step process by which \nthis matter can be reviewed. It is by an independent party with the \nexternal review. Not by the HMO, not by somebody the HMO picks; rather, \nit is by an independent external medical reviewer, someone who has \nexpertise in the area in which the diagnosis is involved.\n  This has to be done on an expedited basis so if there is a concern \nabout time, the care can be provided in a timely way.\n  Senator Ashcroft and I will be proposing two changes to the language \nwhich I think solves two big problems. The first is the problem Senator \nEdwards raised. We add to the factors that the external review \nspecialist has to consider not only the party's records and the \nevidence submitted by the plan and the guidelines offered by the plan \nbut also the external review expert would have to examine the \nrecognized best practice and generally accepted medical practice as \npart of the consideration of what is appropriate in any particular \ncase. It wouldn't be bound by any of these specifics but would have to \nconsider these factors.\n  Another thing we have added, and I think it is very important, in the \nevent for some reason the HMO would decide, even though it had been \nordered by the external reviewer to provide a certain procedure or \ncare, should it decide not to do so, then in that case we have provided \na new process whereby the patient will be able to go to some other \nphysician or some other provider and have that care provided by the \nother provider and bill the HMO that refused to follow the \nrecommendation or the order of the external reviewer. So in no case \nshould there be a situation where after the expert external review \nprocess takes place and a particular procedure has been ordered, in no \ncase should the party be denied that care.\n  There is one final thing I want to say. There has been a lot of \nfinger-pointing about HMOs, about doctors, and so on. I think it is \nimportant to recognize that HMOs have provided an important \ncontribution to reducing costs and providing quality care to the \ncitizens of our country. It is equally important to note that \nphysicians have done a tremendous job in working under the conditions \nthat were unfamiliar to them--the conditions of managed care--which \nrequire them in many cases to submit their diagnosis, plans, and care \nplans to someone else for review, something they are loath to do. And \nin many cases they have been overruled with respect to the care they \nwould like to provide. The physicians are not just out to put money in \ntheir pockets. They are guaranteed only a certain amount by these HMOs, \nand it is a less and less amount each year. They are concerned for the \ngood of their patients. I do not think we ought to be constantly \npointing our fingers at doctors as if they are somehow the problem. \nPhysicians are fighting for their patients, for the kind of care they \nthink their patients need.\n\n  When a group such as the American Medical Association, for example, \nlobbies legislation, they are trying to do what they think is right for \nthe good of their patients. Even though I do not support the \nlegislation they have been sponsoring primarily, I am going to be the \nfirst to defend the physicians of this country, and specifically the \nAmerican Medical Association, for doing what it thinks is right.\n  So I urge my colleagues, as we trade charges back and forth, that we \njust lower the rhetoric a little bit, recognize there is a problem to \nbe solved, recognize that both sides of the controversy have something \nimportant to contribute, and try to come together with an idea that \nwill solve the problem at an affordable cost.\n  That is what I think the Republican bill does. I again commend \nSenator Jeffords and his committee for coming forth with this \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have been keeping score of these votes, \nwhere the HMOs are in every single vote. It may not be an All-Star \ngame, but 7-0, HMOs over patients, that is where we are. Every single \namendment they have won on their position, and the vote on every single \namendment has basically been party line. To me, it is a sad day in this \ngreatest of all deliberative bodies to have such partisan voting.\n  I wanted to mention a couple of things to the Senator from Arizona \nbefore he leaves the floor. In his opening he was very gracious. He \nsaid: Yes, it is true, some HMOs have made mistakes in their zeal to \ncut costs. I think he was very accurate in the way he talked about it.\n  The Republican bill--and this is such an irony--does not even cover \nHMOs. It covers only the 48 million people who essentially have self-\nfunded plans. So the Republican bill doesn't even reach to the people \nin this country who utilize HMOs.\n  Mr. KYL. Will the Senator yield on that?\n  Mrs. BOXER. On your time I will be happy to.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask Senator Jeffords for 30 seconds, if I \ncould?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield 30 seconds.\n\n[[Page S8490]]\n\n  Mr. KYL. Is the Senator from California aware the external review \nprocess and internal review process, the appeal process we have been \ntalking about, applies to all people, to HMOs, too, not just the ERISA \nplans?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes. I will take this on my own time. As Senator Edwards \npointed out, it is a meaningless situation which I hope the Senator is \ngoing to correct. We talked about correcting it after the Senator from \nVermont said it is perfect. Now we hear there is an amendment coming. \nGood, we are looking forward to seeing it.\n  But the basic bill, as Senator Kennedy has pointed out, does not \ncover the vast majority of the people. Take the Collins amendment. The \nCollins amendment does not cover the vast majority of women in its \nprovisions, or the vast majority of patients. Mr. President, 77 percent \nof the people in California are not covered by the basic bill. If you \nlook at the whole Nation, it is about 70 percent or so. So it is 7-0, \nand we have many more amendments to go. I do not have much hope this is \ngoing to change. That is why I have this little flip chart. But we are \nhoping for something better in the later innings.\n  Let me say to my friends who support the Collins amendment, do not be \nfooled. You better look at this letter that just came in from the \nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Let me tell you \nwhat it says.\n\n       This amendment is an empty promise to the millions of women \n     enrolled in managed care plans, covering only one in three \n     women in ERISA-regulated plans. . ..[It erects] new barriers \n     to follow-up care for both ob and gyn services.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                           The American College of\n\n\n                              Obstetricians and Gynecologists,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 14, 1999.\n     Senator Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader.\n\n     Senator Thomas Daschle,\n     Minority Leader.\n       Dear Senators Lott and Daschle: The American College of \n     Obstetricians and Gynecologists, representing the nation's \n     39,000 ob-gyns and the women they serve, does not support \n     passage of Amendment 1243 to the Patients' Bill of Rights, \n     offered by Senator Collins. This amendment is an empty \n     promise to the millions of women enrolled in managed care \n     plans, covering only one in three women in ERISA-regulated \n     plans.\n       While this amendment supposedly addresses the weaknesses in \n     the Majority's managed care reform bill, it takes away as \n     many protections as it provides. It removes barriers to \n     access to obstetrical care while erecting new barriers to \n     follow-up care for both ob and gyn services. While under this \n     amendment, health plans would be required to provide direct \n     access to the full range of initial obstetrical services, \n     plans would still be able to limit direct access to needed \n     gynecological care. The amendment would also weaken access to \n     follow up ob and gyn care if a problem is identified in a \n     routine or periodic visit. Indeed, by changing ``shall'' to \n     ``may'' the follow up care provisions does no more than \n     restate current law.\n       We continue to look forward to working with both sides of \n     the aisle, but are disappointed that this amendment offers \n     women less than half a loaf of needed protections.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Ralph W. Hale, M.D.,\n                                         Executive Vice President.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this debate is very interesting, but it is \nvery sad because we, on our side of the aisle, are offering amendments \nto try to correct real problems that are happening to real people. On \nthe other side, we get empty promises. Not my words, the words of the \nOB/GYNs: Empty promises, sham, shells, but nothing real. So it is 7-0.\n  I rise also in support of a very fine amendment. I rise in very \nstrong support of Senator Bingaman's amendment on specialists.\n  I want to tell you about one of my constituents, Carley Christie. I \nmet her dad a long time ago. These are his words:\n\n       Carley was 9 years old when she was diagnosed with \n     malignant kidney cancer: When the HMO insisted we trust our \n     daughter's delicate surgery to a doctor with no experience in \n     this area, we were forced to find an expert and pay for it \n     ourselves.\n\n  Mr. President, $50,000 Mr. Christie had to come up with. He said:\n\n       You only get one chance at removing a Wilms' tumor \n     correctly and successfully to ensure the highest probability \n     of survival in children, and we weren't going to take that \n     chance with our daughter's life because the HMO wanted to \n     save money.\n\n  And he goes on to say:\n\n       Congress must close the ERISA loophole and hold health \n     plans accountable for cost-cutting decisions that result in \n     patient injury.\n\n  These are the words of a dad, a loving dad. We have a lot of loving \ndads in this institution. We have a lot of loving granddads in this \ninstitution. One is on the floor right now, the Senator from Utah.\n  I have to tell you, we have to start acting to help loving moms and \ndads such as this because we are not doing that.\n  I ask for 30 additional seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield the Senator from California 30 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. We are not acting on behalf of loving dads such as Harry \nChristie. We are turning our backs on them and we are acting in favor \nof the HMOs against the patients, against the Carley Christies, against \nthe Harry Christies. It is wrong and we ought to change and we ought to \nsupport the Bingaman amendment and get on the right track.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from \nIowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the Bingaman amendment offered by the \nSenator from New Mexico, I began speaking about it, the Senator from \nCalifornia spoke about it, Senator Reid spoke about it, but I have not \nheard one word on the other side about the Bingaman amendment that \nallows people to go outside their plan to get specialty care, as \nSenator Boxer just mentioned. Not one word from the Republican side \nabout this amendment.\n  What is it? Are they going to support it? Are they going to oppose \nit? What are they going to do? Not one single word about it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we are nearing the end of debate on \nlegislation that is, unquestionably, one of the most important measures \nto be considered in the 106th Congress.\n  We have heard the horror stories about denials of coverage for \ncertain treatments. We have heard about the bureaucratic nightmares \nsuffered by family members who have a simple question: Why can't the \ninsurance companies understand a family's anxiety as well as they \nunderstand the costs of diagnostic tests or the arcane science of \nfilling out forms?\n  As a matter of fact, our constituents may be surprised to know that \nmany of us have also experienced the bureaucratic two-step, many of us \nhave also sat on ``hold'' trying to get past an automated switchboard.\n  Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have made it seem that \nwe are completely oblivious to the health care needs of the American \npeople.\n  On the contrary, we are well aware of the public's frustration and of \nthe need for effective legislation to ensure that those individuals \nenrolled in managed care plans are provided quality health care.\n  Over the past several years, numerous hearings have been held in both \nthe Senate and the House of Representatives, exposing story after story \nabout individuals who had complaints about their managed care plans.\n  The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) recently \npublished figures that, in 1998, more than 35,000 health insurance \ncomplaints were made to state insurance departments.\n  According to an article in the February edition of the Employee \nBenefit Plan Review magazine, ``consumer complaints about health \ninsurers and HMOs are surging.'' The article goes on to say that \n``these complaints encompassed matters such as health care claim \ndenials, disputed claims, slow payments by health insurers, and \npremium-related matters.''\n  But the article also reports that insurance commissioners in 12 \nstates where the data were collected ``doubt the rise implies a \ndeterioration in care but rather that the numbers reflect greater \npublic readiness to fight HMOs, and encouragement by states for \nconsumers to file complaints.''\n  Enrollees in managed care plans are not likely to acquiesce and abide \nby\n\n[[Page S8491]]\n\ncoverage decisions as final--when their lives are at stake. That is why \nwe are here today and that is why the Senate is now poised to take \nsignificant action in addressing this issue for the American people.\n  The question before the Senate this week is not so much will we pass \na patients' bill of rights measure--and I hope and believe that we \nwill--but rather what kind of patients' rights bill will the Senate \npass and send over to the House of Representatives for consideration?\n  All of us in this Chamber know very well there are numerous competing \nbills that have been introduced over the years that provide a variety \nof legislative remedies to address these concerns. In many respects, \nthese bills have common components intertwined with similar and, in \nsome cases, identical provisions.\n  It is my understanding that there are presently 47 various bills that \nhave been introduced in the Senate and House this year alone which are \ndesigned to provide patient protections to managed care enrollees.\n  Clearly, we are all concerned. But, for Congress to act and pass \nresponsible and workable legislation, we must come together in a \nbipartisan fashion and put forth the best bill for the American people. \nWe have done this many times on health care legislation in the past, \nand there is no reason why we cannot succeed again today and do what is \nright for the country.\n  I have joined 49 of my colleagues in sponsoring one of the proposals \ncurrently under consideration, S. 300, the Patients' Bill of Rights \nPlus Act of 1999. This legislation, along with its companion bill, S. \n326, represents a balanced approach at addressing the concerns over \nmanaged health care.\n  This bill is sound public policy that avoids unnecessary and costly \nfederal mandates that would ultimately undermine the affordability and \navailability of health insurance to millions of Americans.\n  S. 326 was considered in the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee, where extensive hearings were held affording an \nopportunity for all points of view to be heard on the various \nprovisions of the legislation.\n  The HELP Committee reported S. 326 on March 18, 1999, and I want to \ncommend Senator Jeffords and the members of the HELP Committee--\nSenators Frist, Collins, Gregg, and others--for their work on this \nlegislation.\n  S. 300 is identical to S. 326 except that it contains important tax \nprovisions that will make health insurance more affordable for those \nwho either do not have insurance, or are paying high premiums for such \ncoverage out of their own pocket.\n  For instance, pursuant to the Title V provisions of S. 300, self-\nemployed taxpayers would be permitted a 100 percent deduction for \nhealth insurance premiums. This provision would be effective beginning \nnext year thereby easing the financial burden for self-employed \nindividuals.\n  Moreover, S. 300 removes the current law provisions restricting \nMedical Savings Accounts, or MSAs, to employees of small employers and \nself-employed individuals, making MSAs far more generally available to \nindividuals than they are today. This legislation also eliminates the \nexisting 750,000 policy cap on the number of taxpayers who can have \nMSAs as well as the cap placed on Medicare+Choice MSA plans.\n  I would emphasize that a December 1998 report from the General \nAccounting Office concluded that 37 percent of those individuals who \nenrolled in MSAs were previously uninsured. Clearly, with greater \navailability and flexibility in the MSA design, these plans will \nattract even more of the uninsured.\n  These tax provisions will provide much needed reforms in tax-based \nassistance to those individuals without employer-subsidized insurance. \nThey also will help millions of employees and business owners in \nobtaining coverage.\n  Today, however, the pending bill is S. 1344, championed by Senator \nKennedy and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. For months, \nwe have heard from a number of our colleagues on the Democrat side \nabout their desire to bring their bill to the floor for a vote. I am \nglad they got their wish, although I happen to believe that Senator \nLott was quite generous in agreeing to this debate before we had even \nfinished the appropriations bills. So, I hope we will hear no more \nabout the majority's unwillingness to have this debate.\n\n  So, tomorrow, with the roll call of the clerk, we will decide which \napproach to managed care reform will be in the best interest of our \nconstituents. So I encourage the American people to listen carefully to \nthis debate. I encourage them to listen with discernment. They will \nhave to separate a lot of fact from fiction and a lot of reality from \nrhetoric.\n  Let me see if I can shed some light on the fundamental differences \nthat distinguish the Republican bill from the bill being advanced by \nSenator Kennedy and President Clinton.\n  Contrary to the allegations made by some of my colleagues, the \nRepublican bill that was reported by the HELP Committee--S. 326--is not \nthe insurance industry's bill. In fact, the insurance industry's idea \nof a bill is no bill at all. Officials from the insurance and managed \ncare industry tell me they not only oppose the Democrats' bill, S. \n1344, but they also oppose the Republican bill, S. 326.\n  S. 326 would, in fact, impose a number of new rules on group health \nplans relating to access to care, scope of coverage, disclosure of plan \ninformation to enrollees, and appeals of claim denials.\n  Our Democrat colleagues assert that our bill is limited in scope and \nthat it does not apply to all enrollees in ERISA plans. That simply is \nnot true. Our bill includes many important features that will provide \npatient protections for enrollees in self-insured ERISA plans, about 48 \nmillion people.\n  However, our bill also provides protections to all ERISA enrollees, \nor 124 million people, regarding the critically important issues \nrelating to an internal and external appeals process, patient \ninformation disclosure, and on discrimination in underwriting based on \ngenetic information.\n  On the surface, the Democrats' criticism of our bill sounds credible. \nBut the fact of the matter is that states have historically regulated \nthe insurance market for those individuals not in self-insured ERISA \nplans. Why should Congress now suddenly preempt these regulations and \nimpose a whole new series of costly federal mandates on plans that are \nalready state regulated?\n  In Utah, there are currently 21 state mandates on fully insured \nhealth insurance plans. Let me just highlight some of these rules:\n  Direct access to OB-GYNs was adopted in 1995.\n  The ban on the so-called gag clause was adopted in 1997.\n  We have rules on drug abuse treatment, alcoholism treatment, \nmaternity stays, coverage for optometrists, nurse midwives, \npodiatrists, psychologists, chiropractors, and well-child care.\n  Why does the Congress need to duplicate and preempt what the states \nare already doing? And perhaps the single most driving reason why we \nshould not impose these rules on all health plans is that the Health \nCare Financing Administration would ultimately regulate this whole \nprogram. Frankly, I have more confidence in our state legislature and \ngovernor in deciding what is best for Utah.\n  I mean, if you think health insurance is complicated and bureaucratic \nnow, just wait until HCFA is second-guessing everything from \nWashington, D.C. HCFA is that federal agency that administers Medicare \nand Medicaid--both of which have regulations that are the size of the \nNew York City telephone directory.\n  Mr. President, our constituents will benefit absolutely nothing if we \nmerely transfer regulatory power from states to the federal government. \nOn the contrary, they will suffer even more frustration since \ndecisionmaking is more remote in terms of both distance and impact.\n  Under the Republican bill, those plans which historically have been \nsubject to state insurance regulation will remain subject to state law.\n  This is consistent with the McCarren-Ferguson Act of 1945 which \nessentially codified the states traditional role in regulating the \ninsurance industry. This is a wise policy that has worked well in many \nsectors including life insurance, automobile insurance, business \ncasualty insurance, as well as health insurance.\n\n[[Page S8492]]\n\n  All of these areas are important, and thank goodness we don't hear \ncries to federalize matters like car insurance.\n  The McCarren-Ferguson Act embraces the important principles contained \nin the 10th Amendment to the Constitution, which reserves to the states \nall governmental functions not specifically assigned elsewhere in the \nConstitution to the federal government. Elected state and local \nofficials can weigh unique state and local conditions. As well, state \nand local officials can be held politically accountable for their \ndecisions concerning state and local matters--including insurance \nregulation.\n  So, while it may be true that health care is a vitally important \nmatter, it does not necessarily follow--as my colleagues across the \naisle apparently believe--that we should rush headlong into \nfederalizing every aspect of health care delivery. The Congress wisely \nrejected this type of misguided thinking in 1994 when the public \nregistered its adamant opposition to the Clinton/Kennedy/Gephardt \nhealth care reform bill.\n  I do not think my friends on the other side of the aisle really mean \nto send the message that only the federal government can tackle \n``important'' matters and that states and local governments are okay to \nhandle the insignificant, less important issues. If that isn't the \nheight of federal elitism, I don't know what is.\n  From the beginning of our nation it has been left to the states to \nregulate the licensure of doctors and nurses. What is more important to \nthe integrity and performance of the health care system than the \ncredentialing of health care professionals? Do my colleagues want to \ntake that over as well?\n  Don't be fooled by the false argument that if something is not \nfederally controlled and regulated by Washington that somehow that it \nwill be second-rate.\n  The Republican bill recognizes the traditional role of the states in \nthe health insurance arena. By and large our states do a first-rate job \nwith the responsibilities assigned to them under the Constitution and \nby law. States have done a good job in regulating the insurance \nindustry--a task assigned to the states back in 1945 by the McCarren-\nFerguson Act.\n  This is not to say that every aspect of the insurance industry should \nbe beyond some reasonable federal requirements. The bipartisan Health \nInsurance Portability legislation is one example where we all worked \ntogether to fashion a narrow, targeted, and effective set of federal \nrules that apply to health insurance.\n  The challenge for legislators is to evaluate carefully which \nparticular issues require national rules and which issues are best left \nto the states. In this regard, I must highlight the Republican bill's \ntreatment of one of the most important aspects of this legislation--\ndispute resolution.\n  Under our bill, the important appeals process protections, which are \nthe fundamental heart of this debate, apply to all ERISA plans. The \nRepublican bill revises and improves the existing internal appeals \nprovisions and adds new external appeal and nonappealable grievance \nprocedures. And, as under current ERISA law, the claims procedures \napply to both self-insured and fully-insured group health plans.\n  I would add that the issue of ensuring a patient's right to an \nappeals process, for both internal and external review, is one of the \ncentral issues in the patient protection debate. Under the Republican \nbill, health plans are required to issue an internal coverage decision \nwithin 30 days after the date on which the request for review \nis submitted. The notice of the decision must be issued no later than 2 \nworking days after the decision is made.\n\n  For matters in which a patient's life or health is in jeopardy, a \nplan's decision must be made within 72 hours after a request for review \nis submitted. A notice of that decision must be made within that 72 \nhour period.\n  Moreover, the review is to be conducted by an individual with \nappropriate expertise who was not involved in the initial \ndetermination. Appeals involving issues of medical necessity or \nexperimental treatment are to be conducted by physicians with \nappropriate expertise.\n  With respect to appeals for external review, the Republican bill \nrequires that after a patient's internal appeal is denied, he or she \ncan then submit a written request for review which must be submitted \nwithin 30 days after the date of the internal review decision. Within 5 \nworking days after the receipt of a request for review, the plan will \nselect an external appeals entity that will designate external \nreviewers.\n  These entities could include an independent expert in the diagnosis \nor treatment under review, or certain state or federally authorized or \nprivately accredited entities using appropriate credential experts.\n  In addition, external reviewers are required to make an independent \ndetermination and consider all appropriate and available information on \nthe patient. The review must be conducted no later than 30 working \ndays, or earlier, after either the date on which a reviewer is \ndesignated, or all necessary information is received. And, finally, the \ndecision of the external reviewers is binding on the health plan.\n  With respect to the consumer protection standards, our bill provides \nfor the following:\n  Our bill requires that a group health plan ensure that enrollees have \naccess to specialty care when covered by the plan.\n  Our bill would require a plan to provide coverage for emergency \nmedical care, including severe pain, without prior authorization by \napplying the so-called prudent layperson standard to medical screening.\n  Our bill would permit individuals, with their providers consent, to \ncontinue a covered course of treatment for up to 90 days when a \ncontract between a group health plan and health care provider is \nterminated.\n\n  Our bill would permit women to obtain gynecological and obstetric \ncare from a participating OB-GYN specialist without prior authorization \nby a primary care provider.\n  Our bill would permit a child to obtain pediatric care from a \nparticipating pediatric specialist without prior authorization by a \nprimary care provider.\n  And, under our bill, a plan could not impose a prohibition or \nrestriction on advice by a health professional for medical care or \ntreatment. In effect, our bill prohibits the imposition of the so-\ncalled gag rule.\n  With respect to the issue of information disclosure by managed care \nplans, S. 326 requires new information collection and reporting \nrequirements relating to benefits, access to specialty care, coverage \nof emergency services, advance directives, prior authorization rules, \nappeals and grievance procedures and a list of specific prescription \nmedications included in the formulary of each plan.\n  And, on the controversial issue of drug formularies, both physicians \nand pharmacists must participate in the development of a drug \nformulary, and a plan must have a process to allow physicians to \nprescribe drugs that are not listed on the formulary.\n  Finally, I want to commend my colleague, Senator Frist, for his \nprincipal role in developing the provisions for a comprehensive \nindependent study of patient access to clinical trails and for \ndeveloping the provisions to improve medical outcomes research.\n  Senator Frist is the only physician in the Senate and, quite frankly, \nI'd much rather have his advice and expertise in developing this \nlegislation than the input of attorneys who had helped shape the \nDemocrats' bill.\n  Mr. President, for anyone to describe S. 326 as ineffective and not \ndoing much to help patients, I would respectfully submit that they \nsimply have not read the bill.\n  S. 326 will help people. It will help those people who most need our \nhelp: those people who are enrolled in health plans that are not \nregulated by the states.\n\n  This legislation strikes an appropriate balance between ensuring \npatient protections without imposing excessive and costly new federal \nmandates on the private sector.\n  In that respect, let me also add one other point: I was not \nparticularly enamored with S. 326 when I first read it. It contains \nnumerous federal mandates which, historically, I have opposed.\n  I find it particularly troubling that the federal government will \nimpose these mandates on the private sector because this action will \ndrive-up the costs of health insurance which may ultimately lead to \nemployers dropping health insurance altogether.\n\n[[Page S8493]]\n\n  And I can assure you that comments from the business community about \ndropping health insurance altogether are not idle threats. The one \nissue I hear most often from employers, especially from small and \nmiddle size companies which comprise most of the businesses in Utah, is \nthe rapidly escalating costs associated with providing health insurance \nto employees.\n  Employers want to provide their employees with comprehensive health \ninsurance plans. In fact, in order for them to compete in today's \ncompetitive marketplace for talented and skilled help, they must offer \nemployees decent health insurance coverage.\n  I recently received a letter from one of my constituents who owns and \noperates a small company. Ms. Hydee Willis owns a small business called \n``Creative Expressions'' in Murray, Utah. She wrote to me and said:\n\n       I am a woman owned business person--fought through the \n     ranks over the last 18 years of being in business [and] of \n     fighting the entire stigma a woman in business [has] in this \n     country. I have struggled with the intense feelings of \n     inadequacy and helplessness as I lost employee after employee \n     to larger companies able to offer wonderful benefits.\n\n  She further states:\n\n       After weeks of research and many agents, we finally found a \n     plan that gave our employees at least part of what they \n     wanted. Yesterday, the final program papers were put on my \n     desk and a check was being requested by the insurance agent. \n     My heart sunk. To insure 13 people, basic health coverage \n     with $250 individual deductible, my costs are $3,700 per \n     month per employee or $44,400 per year.\n\n  Moreover, she writes that the employees' share of the premium was \nequally staggering with ``one manager with a family of five having a \nbill of $458 per month.''\n  Ms. Willis will ultimately pay the price for the federal mandates \nimposed under any legislation passed by the Senate. And so will her \nemployees.\n  Here is where the rubber meets the road. Here is where all of our \nplatitudes about quality collide with issues of access and \naffordability. Here is where reality should set in for my colleagues \nwho are advocating on behalf of the Clinton administration's proposal.\n  While I have admitted my concerns about the Republican bill, at \nleast, the increase in premiums will be .04 percent annually. Under the \nDemocrat plan, the increase in premiums will be 6.1 percent annually. \nThe former may be manageable; the latter will undoubtedly have serious \nrepercussions.\n  Mr. President, we simply cannot ignore the fact that whatever \nlegislation we pass here in the Senate this week will ultimately be \npaid for by employers and employees alike. The federal government is \ncertainly not going to pay for this; the American people--employers and \nemployees alike--will pay for it, and that is precisely the reason why \nI oppose the Democrats' bill.\n\n  Too many federal mandates will only mean no patient protection \nbecause no one will be able to afford health insurance. Who is left to \nprotect when employers drop health coverage altogether because they and \ntheir employees can no longer afford it?\n  In fact, we are already seeing an average premium increase this year \nof approximately 10 percent. With the 6.1 percent premium increase that \nthe Congressional Budget Office estimates as the cost of the Democrats' \nbill, you are conceivably looking at a 16 percent increase in health \ninsurance premiums--in just one year!\n  That is not the kind of legislating I believe the vast majority of my \nconstituents in Utah would support. Nor would most Americans.\n  Even the letters I've received from my constituents who support the \nDemocrats' bill are sensitive to the unintended financial consequences \nthat passage of a misdirected and overly broad bill will have on health \ninsurance affordability.\n  Another area where there is wide disagreement between the Republican \nplan and the Democrat plan is on the issue of expanded litigation.\n  The core of this debate is the critical issues associated with the \nexpansion of health plan liability for coverage decisions and to allow \ntort actions for wrongful death and personal injury under state \nmalpractice laws. Under the Republican plan, when patients are denied \nmedical treatment or benefits, they have the right to a second opinion \nfrom a trained medical professional.\n  Under the Democrat plan, when patients are denied medical treatment \nor benefits, they have the right to see a lawyer. Am I missing \nsomething here? If I have a medical condition, I want the services of a \nmedical professional. Why is it that the first thing the Clinton \nadministration thinks of is going to court?\n  However, as a former medical malpractice attorney myself, I fully \nunderstand and appreciate how trial lawyers will benefit from the \nexpanded litigation provisions in the Democrats' bill. It would be a \nbonanza for trial attorneys.\n  The expanded liability provisions in S. 1344 are, by far, the most \ncostly component of their bill. Expanded liability would increase costs \nby eroding the ability of a health plan to contain costs and provide \nquality care. It will also compel health plans to allow for coverage of \ndefensive medicine practices, or the inappropriate and even unnecessary \nmedical care to protect themselves from liability.\n  Earlier this year, the Health Care Liability Alliance sponsored a \nbriefing identifying the impact of the current health care liability \nsystem on health care costs and access issues. At that briefing, former \nAttorney General Dick Thornburgh provided an overview of the current \nstate of affairs in our nation's legal system with respect to health \ncare liability.\n  Mr. Thornburgh stated, ``We've got plaintiffs' lawyers raking in \nmillions in contingency fees while the clients they represent settle \nfor pennies on the dollar. This is increasingly becoming the case in \nclass action lawsuits.'' He further states, ``there are estimates that \nlawsuit abuse is costing the U.S. economy as much as $150 billion each \nyear! And, there is the social cost to society with the impulse to \nsettle every squabble with a subpoena.''\n\n  In addition Mr. Thornburgh says,\n\n       Few areas provide such ample evidence of a legal system run \n     amok than the area of medical liability. Compared to lawsuit \n     abuse in other sectors of the economy and society, the \n     litigation explosion in the health care area is, if anything, \n     more damaging precisely because health care means so much not \n     only to patients involved, but to all of us who--as potential \n     patients--count on a vital, vibrant health care system to \n     give us the best care that medical science can provide.\n\n  Under the Democrats' bill, ERISA would be amended to expand state \ntort liability to health plans--and to employers. Interestingly, with \nrespect to the practice of medicine, ERISA currently does not preempt \nstate law malpractice claims against medical professionals for \nproviding substandard care. A patient can sue an ERISA plan for medical \nmalpractice.\n  In addition, there has been a clear trend in recent years in federal \ncourt decisions that managed care organizations are held ``vicariously \nliable'' for the malpractice of health providers.\n  With respect to denied benefits, ERISA already provides for a ``full \nand fair review'' of disputed claims. If the result of the benefit \nplan's internal appeal process is not satisfactory to the patient, then \nERISA provides patients with a right to judicial review in either \nfederal or state court, and the court may award attorneys' fees, court \ncosts, the benefits denied, and ``other equitable relief'' as needed.\n  In lieu of expanding health care litigation, the Republican bill \nprovides specific internal and external appeals rights that would apply \nto all 124 million Americans covered by group health plans under ERISA.\n  It seems to me to make better sense to provide an appeals mechanism \nthat is timely and responsive to those individuals who seek a remedy on \nmatters involving benefit coverage or denial.\n  The Republican bill will achieve that objective.\n  I have heard from many Utahns who voice strong opposition to \nexpanding liability to both health plans and employers. Our objective \nis to ensure patients obtain the necessary treatment they need. I say \nto my colleagues on the other side, the ability to sue will not help \nthose who face life threatening diseases.\n  Malpractice claims take an average of 16 months to file and 25 months \nto resolve. And, as the record clearly shows, the contingent fee system \npromotes an aggressive trial bar that dramatically inflates medical \nmalpractice claims.\n  I would add that even the President's own Advisory Commission on \nConsumer Protection and Quality in the\n\n[[Page S8494]]\n\nHealth Care Industry did not recommend expanded liability for health \nplans as the commissioners agreed that such a recommendation would have \nserious consequences within the industry as well as for employees who \nwould likely see the costs of their premiums increase dramatically.\n  Furthermore, plaintiffs receive only 43 percent of their tort \nawards--the other 57 percent goes to the trial lawyers.\n  We need a workable system that establishes specific time frames to \nensure patients have an effective appeals process to address disputes.\n  The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 has served this \ncountry well over the last 24 years by enabling employers to provide \nhealth care coverage and other benefits that meet the needs of their \nemployees and families. Approximately 124 million Americans are \nenrolled in health care coverage through their employers under ERISA.\n\n  Health care coverage for these people will clearly be threatened by \nopening up the floodgates to expanded litigation and shifting millions \nof dollars away from the provision of health care to the pockets of \ntrial attorneys.\n  The Republican bill provides an expeditious remedy under which \npatients can appeal decisions. In my opinion, the appeals mechanism in \nour bill is far preferable than handing these matters over to the \ncourts and to trial lawyers. I might also speculate that resources not \nspent on lawsuits could be spent more productively on behalf of \npatients.\n  Mr. President, as I have listened to the debate on patients' \nprotection legislation, I am struck by the emotion and intensity that \nthis issue holds for many of my colleagues in the Senate. This is a \ndeeply personal issue for all of us because it literally affects the \nlives of people. At the end of the day, isn't that the reason why we \nare here? We are here to help our constituents and, indeed, to help all \nAmericans.\n  I had hoped this debate would have produced more consensus. I believe \nthere is probably more agreement on these issues than is apparent by \nthis week's debate. I support the Republican leadership bill because it \nprovides a balanced approach at addressing the complex and emotional \nissue of patient protection.\n  It's not a perfect bill and, for that matter, neither is the bill \noffered by the Democrats. But we have an obligation to the American \npeople to do what is reasonable and responsible.\n  I want the American people to know that we in the U.S. Senate are \ndedicated to providing access to the highest possible quality care at \nan affordable price to everyone across the country. For my part, I will \ncontinue to fight for increasing access to health care to the medically \nuninsured. It is troubling to me that 43 million Americans do not have \nhealth insurance coverage.\n  But, I am afraid that the Clinton administration proposal violates \nthe Hippocratic oath to do no harm. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues \nto support the Republican bill for the good of their constituents, and \nfor the good of the American people.\n  Thank you Mr. President.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, my colleagues have clearly spelled out \nthe intent and necessity of this amendment so I will not take much time \nto go through its benefits. I came to the floor simply to urge my \nRepublican colleagues to really think about how much more protection \nthis amendment provides their constituents than their bill does.\n  The so-called access to speciality care provisions in the Republican \nbill are nothing more than a statement on the importance of speciality \ncare. They do not guarantee the care; they simply reiterate current \ninsurance practices.\n  During committee consideration of this legislation, a similar \namendment was offered to ensure access to specialists and to ensure \nthat patients could designate a specialist as their ``care \ncoordinator.'' During that debate in committee, we heard a great deal \nabout training and experience. We were told how an oncologist was a \ntrained specialist in treating cancer regardless of the age or gender \nof the patient. We were told a neurologist was a trained specialist \nregardless of the age or gender of the patient. We were told the \ntraining was the same and practice experience was not important.\n  I find this hard to believe, I ask my colleagues again: is there a \ndifference between treating a child with cancer and treating an adult? \nAre the treatment regimes for a 3-year-old with a brain tumor the same \nas those for a 50-year-old? I doubt it. It seems likely to me that a \ncancer treatment regime for a 50-year-old could kill a 3-year-old. That \ntreatment could render the child disabled or seriously impair his or \nher developmental progress.\n  I urge my colleagues to talk to people at their children's hospitals, \nto their pediatricians, to their ob/gyns and to their cancer \nspecialists. I have. And what I heard was that patients need to see the \nspecialists most qualified and trained to deal with them and their \nspecific illnesses.\n  If your child had a brain tumor, would you want to be told there are \nno pediatric neurosurgeons or pediatric oncologists in your network, \nbut that on page 215 of your physician directory you will find a list \nof the oncologists approved by the plan? I certainly wouldn't. I would \nwant a specialist trained in pediatrics.\n  The Republican bill does not allow for access to speciality care. It \nis that simple. You can say it does and in fact some of my colleagues \nmay hope it does, but it does not. I can assure my colleagues that the \nlanguage in both the bill and the committee report will allow plans--\nnot your specialist--to make the final determination on access and \ntreatment.\n  Here is what the committee report says:\n\n       This section would NOT prevent a plan from requiring that \n     the specialists adhere to a treatment plan if it: (1) is \n     developed by the specialist in consultation with the patient \n     and the patient's primary care provider; (2) is approved by \n     the plan; and (3) meets the quality assurance and utilization \n     review standards of the plan.\n\n  What does this mean?\n  It means that if the patient is lucky enough to get a specialist, \nthat specialist--who is a trained and qualified doctor--could be \nrequired to meet the plan's treatment standards. So maybe you could see \na specialist, but you might not be allowed to be treated by one.\n  Yesterday we offered the Robb/Murray amendment to allow women direct \naccess to their ob/gyns. It was defeated.\n  Today we are offering a broader amendment in the hopes of giving all \ninsured Americans the hope that they can get the best care possible for \ntheir sick or injured child. If we do not adopt this amendment, once \nagain the patient loses and the insurance company wins.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and yield back my \ntime.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I want to talk about the \nimportance of patients being able to see medical specialists. I support \nthe Bingaman amendment to the HMO bill before us.\n  As co-chair of the Senate Cancer Coalition, I am keenly aware of the \nimportance of being able to see a doctor that has the expertise to \nproperly diagnose and treat illnesses, particularly a complex or \ndifficult-to-diagnose illness. There are hundreds of medical conditions \nthat probably require a specialist and sooner or later we all have to \nvisit with one--whether it be a dermatologist, a cardiologist, or an \noncologist, to name a few.\n  For cancer, here's how the American Cancer Society has expressed it:\n\n       Diagnosing and treating cancer is complex, multi-stage \n     process often involving many visits with an oncologist or \n     other specialist. Timely referrals are critical. However, \n     according to a poll [March 1997] by the Commonwealth Fund, 8 \n     of 10 physicians in managed care plans report ``somewhat or \n     very serious problems with being able to refer patients to \n     specialists of their choice.'' This same poll also found that \n     22 percent of physicians with more than half of their \n     patients in managed care plans say they have a direct \n     disincentive to refer.\n\n  The amendment before us would:\n  Require plans to refer patients, who have conditions requiring \ntreatment by a specialist, to specialists in a timely manner. If a \nqualified specialist is not available in the plan, it requires the plan \nto cover services provided by the outside specialist at no additional \ncost to the patient. If a qualified specialist is available in the \nplan, it requires the patient to pay any costs over what the plan would \npay;\n  Require plans to permit patients to designate specialists as their \nprimary\n\n[[Page S8495]]\n\ncare physician, when the patient has a life-threatening, degenerative, \nor disabling disease requiring specialized care over a prolonged period \nof time, such as cancer or heart disease. The specialist would \ncoordinate the patients' overall care; and\n  Require plans to give patients with a condition requiring ongoing \ncare, a standing referral to the specialist so that patients do not \nhave to obtain a separate referral for each visit.\n  We need to pass this amendment guaranteeing access to specialists \nbecause we have heard story after story about managed care plans \nrefusing to let sick people see a specialist and using financial \nincentives to, for example, punish doctors who refer to specialists. A \nstudy reported in the November 19 New England Journal of Medicine found \nthat 57 percent of physicians said they felt pressure from managed care \nplans to limit referrals.\n  Sick people need specialized care. This amendment addresses the \nconcerns of many doctors and patients who have shared their experiences \nwith me. Specialists, from neurologists to pediatric nephrologists, \nreport that plans regularly deny referrals for their specialized \nexpertise. Even more troubling, these specialists report that they \noften still find themselves called for advice in these complicated \ncases without the benefit of ever having seen or examined the patient.\n  Here are some examples:\n  Dr. Jack Thomas, of Long Beach, California, in a Los Angeles Times \narticle on May 13, 1999 said that one patient was ``in severe pain for \nseveral weeks while awaiting orthopedic consultation'' and that urgent \nconsultation with gynecology was not approved after a two-week wait for \nanother patient who continued ``to experience severe dysfunctional \nuterine bleeding.''\n  When the list of providers for the HMO did not have any physicians \nskilled in the treatment of brain tumors with which her daughter Sarah \nhad been born (and as had been recommended by a neurosurgeon), Brenda \nPederson, of San Mateo, California reports that her HMO told her \n``we're not giving you second best, we're giving you what's on the \nlist.'' Patients such as Sarah should not be limited to who is ``on the \nlist,'' but should be able to go the doctor her mother and her doctor \nbelieve has the expertise to treat the illness.\n  Dr. Jack Shohet, Director of Neurology, University of California, \nIrvine, has said, ``Delay of referral is very common in the area in \nwhich I practice.'' He gives the following example: A 48-year old woman \npresented to her primary care provider about 6 months before seeing Dr. \nShohet, with complaints of an ear ache. She was treated with multiple \ncourses of antibiotics over 5 months by her primary care physician. The \nprimary care physician noted a large mass in her auditory canal and \nbiopsied it. It was positive for squamous cell carcinoma. He then \nreferred to her Dr. Shohet (who is out of network) for therapy. By this \ntime, she had a fungating mass with metastasis and cancer and spread in \nher neck. She had to have an operation which necessitated sacrificing \nher hearing. He says, ``One wonders how extensive her disease would \nhave been 5 months earlier had she been referred early on to a \nqualified specialist.''\n  Denial of care is the biggest ethical concern to a majority of \nyounger physicians, according to the August 1998 California Physician.\n  Having a standing referral to a specialist for ongoing care is \nimportant too. Patients should not have to continually return to their \nprimary care provider for a referral when they have found a specialist \nwho can treat that illness. California has a state law allowing \nenrollees who require continuing care to have standing referrals to \nspecialists.\n  Writing to me in March of this year, a constituent who has battled \nchronic disease for twenty years requiring multiple surgeries noted, \n``I cannot underscore the incredible waste of time it is for patients \nwith Crohn's disease to have to see two doctors for every visit to the \ngastroenterologist!!'' This bill requires a standing referral to \nspecialists for persons who require ongoing care from specialists so \nthat patients can get the care they need in a timely manner.\n  Care by specialists benefits patients with chronic disease. Analyzing \ndata about asthma patients in a major California HMO (Health Net), a \nreport in the March 9, 1998 Archives on Internal Medicine concluded \n``asthma specialists provided more thorough care than did primary care \nphysicians.'' A 1997 study from the Mayo Clinic notes that ``outcomes, \ncoordination, and patient satisfaction are superior when specialists \nhave a central role'' in the management of chronic rheumatic and \nmusculoskeletal diseases.\n  Specialists' care is good business. Providing access to speciality \ncare makes good business sense. Citing its ``market-driven design'' \nincluding use of focus groups, Blue Shield of California has been \noffering direct access to speciality care since 1998. Its ``Access \nPlus'' plan allows patients to go directly to a specialist for a fixed, \n$30 copayment per visit. In the May/June 1999 issue of Health Affairs, \nBlue Shield senior managers Kathleen Richard and Ken Wood report that \nthe health plan is the fastest growing HMO in California. They also \nreport that patient satisfaction has increased by 50 percent.\n  And how much did this new program cost? Blue Shield found that the \nactual cost of the direct access program was much, much lower than even \nthey themselves had forecast--fully 75 to 90 per-cent less than what \nthey had anticipated.\n  Providing prompt, continued access to specialists can also result in \ncost savings in a managed care environment. Dr. Roland Blantz who heads \nthe Division of Nephrology at the University of San Diego noted in a \nvisit to our office a seven-year Kaiser study in the Los Angeles area \nwhich showed highly significant savings when patients were referred to \nkidney specialists for evaluation and treatment of elevated creatinine \nlevels.\n  Our California experience shows that access to specialists can \nimprove patients' health and increase plan satisfaction while keeping \ncosts down.\n  Delayed care hurts. The bill requires that plans provide timely \nreferrals to specialists who are available and accessible. A December \n1998 General Accounting Office report on specialty care found that \nheart attack survivors who were seen regularly by cardiologists have \nbetter compliance with medications, by a factor of almost 50 percent, \nover treatment by generalists. Having to wait weeks or even months to \nget an appointment with a specialists from an HMO is a frequent \ncomplaint.\n  Mary Schriever of Cypress, California tried to get a referral from \nher HMO for psychiatric care for her son Bill who had performed self-\nmutilation on his arms by burning and carving himself. After two \nrefusals over 18 months, they paid themselves for him to see a \ncounselor. But even as his behavior deteriorated more, their further \nattempts to obtain the help of a specialist continued to be rebuffed. \nIt was only in jail, after he was taken into custody by the police, \nthat he finally saw a physchiatrist. Before being released and after a \nfight, he died of a brain hemorrhage.\n  Some have said, HMOs are fine--until you get sick.\n  A recent survey by Franklin Health entitled ``Facing Serious Illness \nin America'' and published on May 17, 1999, found that ``fully 6 out of \n10 Americans believe that the current system is profoundly inadequate \nwhen it comes to dealing with medical catastrophes'' and that 93 per-\ncent of those surveyed believed that it is very important to have the \nright to choose one's own doctor regardless of plan.\n  Patients should not have to fight for their health care. This \namendment will ensure that when people are really sick and need to see \nexperts, they can. They will be able to use often what little energy \nthey have when ravaged by serious illness to obtain the specialized \ncare they need to make important decisions at such critical times.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in passing this amendment.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of this \namendment to ensure that managed care enrollees have access to \nspecialists.\n  Specialists are an integral part of our health care network. As a \nresult, access to quality specialty care can often be a matter of life \nand death. In a recent Harvard study, 56 percent of doctors cited the \nbureaucracy involved with referrals to specialists as one of\n\n[[Page S8496]]\n\ntheir top three problems with HMOs. In addition, 40 percent of doctors \nfelt limited by managed care companies from referring patients to \nappropriate specialists.\n  No managed care issue has raised more concern among consumers and \nproviders alike than access to specialty care; especially the issue of \nhaving specialty physicians acting as primary care providers. Mr. \nPresident, you can imagine what a challenge this is for individuals \nwith chronic or disabling conditions.\n  My own daughter has been in the position where she needed a \nspecialist to coordinate her care. She had triplets a few years ago, \nand her medical needs were not unlike many young mothers in similar \nsituations. I am convinced that my daughter's health would have been \nseriously compromised if she had been denied access to a multiple birth \nspecialist. Multiple birth pregnancies are often high risk, but because \nshe had the proper care, I can now gladly say that I am the proud \ngrandfather of three beautiful girls.\n  The language in this amendment would ensure that if an individual has \na condition or disease of sufficient severity and complexity to require \ntreatment by a specialist, and the benefit is provided under the plan, \nthen the plan shall make or provide for a referral to a specialist who \nis able to provide the treatment for such condition or disease.\n  The rigid restrictions by some HMOs on who can and cannot serve as a \nprimary care physician are another obstacle to access to specialty \ncare. In fact, several states (Indiana, Kentucky, New Mexico, \nPennsylvania, New Jersey, New York and Texas) allow an enrollee with \nchronic health problems to select a specialists, such as a neurologist, \na mental health provider, or a cancer specialist as their main health \ncare provider.\n  A recent Families USA report--``HMO Consumers at Risk--States to the \nRescue''--cites far too many cases where a patient's care was \ncompromised because their primary care physician lacked the expertise \nto deal effectively with their particular chronic condition.\n  I cite the case of Ms. N., a 51-year-old woman with multiple \nsclerosis (MS). Although her primary care physician agreed that she had \nMS, he would not refer her to a neurologist. He said that since MS \ncannot be cured, a specialist could do her no good.\n  In another situation, an eight-year-old boy was not allowed to visit \nhis cystic fibrosis (CF) care center for routine checkups even though \nregularly scheduled visits to a CF care center are essential to \ntreatment. His primary care physician did not believe that aggressive \ntreatment was appropriate, as patients with cystic fibrosis do not have \na ``good prognosis.''\n  Every Member of this body would demand the best care for their child. \nIf a specialist was best suited to provide that care, then every one of \nmy colleagues would insist that their child receive that care \nregardless of cost and coverage. Why not guarantee this same right to \nthe rest of the American people?\n  In addition, a recent survey by the National Coalition for Cancer \nSurvivorship stated that oncologists should be the primary managers of \ncare for individuals with cancer. To support their argument they cited \nfactors such as: the complexities of treating cancer; their specific \nknowledge of long-term and late effects, rehabilitative services, pain \nmanagement and hospice; and the importance of early detection and \ntreatment for survivors who have an increased risk for second \nmalignancies.\n  With regard to out-of-network specialists, the Republican bill lacks \nbasic protections to ensure that patients can see doctors qualified to \ntreat their condition. For example, a child with diabetes should be \nable to receive care from a pediatric endocrinologist. However, if \nthere is no pediatric endocrinologist available in the network to \nprovide care for the child with diabetes, the family should be able to \nseek care from an out-of-network physician at no addition cost.\n  We must ensure access to qualified specialists, outside of the \nnetwork if necessary, and without high out-of-pocket expenses for \nenrollees who are forced to go outside the plan to be treated by the \nneeded specialist.\n  The Republican bill also fails to hold a plan responsible for not \nhaving an adequate network of specialists. In fact, Sec. 725 in the \nRepublican bill states that ``such access may be provided through \ncontractual arrangement with specialized providers outside the network \nof the plan.''\n  Beneficiaries should not have to suffer because of their health \nplans' inadequacies. They should receive the care they need by the most \nappropriate health professional. The Republican bill's guarantee to \nspecialists is weak and does not even guarantee that children can see \npediatric specialists.\n  Finally, the legislation we are considering today only provides \naccess to specialists for only 48 million Americans with private \ninsurance. It leaves out the 113 million individuals who choose to \nenroll in managed care plans.\n  Plans should provide patients with an adequate network of physicians, \nand when they fail to do so, should allow the beneficiary to step out \nof the network at no extra charge. We must protect our frailest and \nsickest patients. Individuals with life-threatening and disabling \nconditions should be allowed the use specialists--the best source of \ninformation and care for specific and advanced diseases--to coordinate \ncare.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I appreciate the tremendous effort the Senator from \nUtah has made in this debate. I think he has hit upon the critical \nissue. We must remember, all of us, every time we do make changes which \nresult in increased costs, people become uninsured. That is the \nadvantage of the Republican package and why it is so much better than \nthe Democratic package.\n  If you want to keep score, as my friend from California wishes to do \non victories here, they will have 1.8 million victims from their cost \nincreases; we will have about 240,000. And who are those victims? They \nare the working poor. They are the ones those of us who are \ncompassionate always feel sorry for. We ought to be spending our time \nand ability to increase their capacity for health care, not throw them \noff the plans. That is the difference between the two bills in the \nfinal analysis when you come down to it; and that is, we will not make \nthe working poor suffer more and throw 1.8 million people off of the \nrolls of the insured. So keep that in mind when you think about which \nbill you want to vote for. Because, to me, that is the top concern.\n  In addition to that, we also create a standard, a higher standard for \nall Americans with respect to what they should get from health care and \nfrom the HMOs, et cetera; and that is, to get away from the old \nstandard where you did not have to worry about the changes in the \nmedical profession or what advantages would be accomplished. With all \nof the work we are doing now in the outcomes of research to determine \nwhat works and what does not work, that is going to be available to us. \nIt is available now, but as we move forward it is going to be more and \nmore available.\n  We demand that the doctors must give the best health care, not just \nsomething that happens to be generally practiced in the area.\n  So we have two huge advantages with the Republican bill. I hope \nMembers will keep that in mind as we move forward in the process.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield the Senator from Iowa 15 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized for 15 \nseconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we are considering an amendment by Senator \nBingaman to allow people with chronic illnesses, people with \ndisabilities, to go outside the plan and get the specialty care they \nneed; yet, again, not one Republican will get up and even talk about \nit. Not even one Republican will get up and talk about it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator \nfrom New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized for \n2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  As the Senator from Iowa noted, no one seems to be debating this \namendment. Everyone seems to be debating\n\n[[Page S8497]]\n\nother parts of the bill. There is a very simple reason why. Our bill \nsays, when your primary care physician says you need a certain \nspecialist, you will get one. Their bill says, when you need a certain \nspecialist, maybe you will get one if the HMO says you can.\n  Let me tell you a story about a young woman in my State, a nurse, in \nher prime of life, 24 years old, a good athlete. She had a health care \nplan from her father because he was a lineman for the phone company. \nShe developed a tumor on her femur. She went to her primary care \nphysician. He said: This is dangerous. You need an oncological \northopedic surgeon. Her HMO said: No, no, no. You can use an ordinary \northopedic surgeon. The primary care physician said: No. You need an \noncological orthopedic surgeon. This is a very difficult tumor.\n  But they were not a rich family. When the HMO said no, she went and \nhad the operation from the orthopedic surgeon. Guess what. The tumor \ngrew right back. She went back to the HMO. She said: I did what you \nsaid. I went through a painful operation. Now let me go to the \nspecialist my primary care physician says I need. They said no again. \nShe went on her own, paid $36,000 out of her pocket. It cured the \ntumor, but now she can hardly walk.\n  When she went to the HMO and said, please, pay for this, they said, \nno, no, no. Under the Democratic bill, Debra Bothe would not have had \nto go through this. She would have had the specialist she needed. She \nwould be walking today. Her family would not be totally out of money \ntoday. Under the Republican bill, nothing would have changed.\n  That can be repeated in story after story, in anecdote after \nanecdote, on factual basis after factual basis. If you need a \nspecialist, if you are deathly ill--I ask the Senator if I could have \n30 seconds?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield the Senator 30 seconds.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. If you are deathly ill, and your physician says you need \na certain specialist, do you want the Democratic bill that says you get \none or the Republican bill that says maybe you will get one, if your \nHMO allows you to?\n  I say to my friend, the Senator from Vermont, that is what working \nfamilies want and need--this kind of bill, this kind of proposal, not a \nproposal that is toothless and sides with the insurance companies time \nafter time after time.\n\n  I thank the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might use.\n  We are coming into the final moments before we will vote on this \namendment. I will take at least these final moments to point out where \nwe are.\n  Primarily, what we are talking about are the protections that have \nbeen included in our Patients' Bill of Rights. No matter how many times \nour Republican friends say they are shocked, shocked to discover the \ndeficiencies in their amendments and promise to do better, their new \nproduct is just the same old, tired, flawed proposal in fancy dress. \nThe problem is a simple one: Insurance companies don't want real \nprotections, so Republicans won't produce them.\n  We have two different proposals on emergency care, two different \nproposals on OB/GYN care, and another proposal in terms of specialty \ncare this evening--all changes, alterations, in terms of their original \nproposal. No matter how many times they alter or change, they still do \nnot meet the basic standard and test of providing that the medical \nprofessions make the judgment of what is in the interest of that \npatient, not the insurance company.\n  Access to the needed specialty care is one of the most critical \ningredients in quality health care. Timely access to a qualified \nspecialist can often determine whether a patient lives or dies. For \nthose living with chronic illnesses or with a physical or mental \ndisability, access to specialty care can improve the quality of life, \nprevent deterioration, or cure or ameliorate the disease.\n  Nowhere is the contrast between the Republican plan and our proposal \nclearer than on the issue of access to needed specialty care. Our \namendment, offered by Senators Bingaman, Harkin, Reed, and others, \nguarantees it. The Republican plan is a sham proposal that carries the \nlabel of access to specialty care but does nothing meaningful to help \npatients.\n  Our amendment has key protections that guarantee appropriate \nspecialty care. Health plans are required to provide care by a \nqualified specialist or center of excellence when needed. If sufficient \nexpertise does not exist inside the HMO network, it must allow patients \nto go to a specialist or a center of excellence outside the network, \nwithout any additional financial burden beyond what would be involved \nin seeing a network specialist.\n  For chronic or ongoing conditions, HMOs must allow standing referrals \nto a specialist or, where appropriate, allow the specialist to be a \ncare coordinator--in effect, the primary care gatekeeper for treatment \nrelated to the condition.\n  These provisions are especially critical for anyone suffering from a \nchronic disease or disability and for disabled children with their \ncomplex needs. If there is a disagreement between a plan and a \nphysician or patient about the need for specialty care or out-of-\nnetwork care, the dispute will be resolved by a speedy independent \nreview. It is guaranteed. It is written into the law.\n  The Republican plan includes none of these critical guarantees, not a \nsingle one. More than two-thirds of all patients are excluded even from \nthe minimal protections it does provide. Access to qualified \nspecialists is essential to quality care, particularly for those who \nneed care the most: those with a disabling or life-threatening illness. \nIf our proposal is adopted, every family can be confident that if \nserious illness strikes, their health plan will not deny them the care \nthat is essential for recovery--no ifs, ands, or buts; the guarantee is \nthere.\n  Once again, the issue is clear: Will the Senate protect the patients \nor will it protect the insurance industry profits? That is what is \nbefore the Senate in this amendment. That was basically the protections \nthat were included in our legislation. This amendment will guarantee \nthat any measure that comes out of this body will have those \nprotections, and that is why this amendment is so important to be \naccepted.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, may I ask for time to ask for unanimous \nconsent?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Of course.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I referred in my earlier comments to a \ncircumstance that was described to us this morning. Beth Gross talked \nabout her 4-year-old named Matthew and the difficulties the family had \nin obtaining access to specialty care. I have been given a copy of a \nstatement she made describing that in more detail. I ask unanimous \nconsent that that statement be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       My name is Beth Gross, and I am here today on behalf of \n     patients everywhere who are crying out for a real patients' \n     bill of rights. We need protection, and can no longer afford \n     to be at the mercy of health maintenance organizations.\n       While other interests say that the industry can regulate \n     itself, my 4-year-old son can barely say anything at all \n     because of an HMO policy. I am here today to tell you that my \n     son was denied access to necessary, specialized medical \n     treatment.\n       Matthew has a significant speech delay that has been \n     directly linked to his repeated ear infections. For the first \n     two years of his life, Matthew suffered 14 ear infections. In \n     most cases, this is a normal childhood illness treatable with \n     antibiotics. But the fluid in Matthew's ears remained behind \n     the eardrum for a long period of time--causing repeated \n     infection and delayed speech. To a young child like Matthew, \n     when this fluid remains behind the inner ear, it distorts \n     sound and sometimes impairs hearing completely.\n       The doctor who treated Matthew repeatedly used antibiotics \n     instead of granting my request for a referral to an Ear, \n     Nose, and Throat Specialist. As a nurse, I knew the risks of \n     this chronic condition, and grew frustrated to know that a \n     simple surgical procedure called an ear tube placement could \n     immediately correct Matthew's problem. But I was left at the \n     mercy of a doctor who kept treating Matthew with \n     antibiotics--antibiotics that were never going to be able to \n     correct the structural problems within his little ears.\n       I made the decision at that point to change my primary care \n     physician, and called the\n\n[[Page S8498]]\n\n     insurance company. When I explained our dilemma, I was \n     outraged at their response. We could not get a referral for \n     Matthew because it was their policy, to impose and I quote, \n     ``monetary sanctions'' on the physician for giving a referral \n     for something that he is able to treat.'' I felt shocked and \n     helpless. I could not believe that I lived in a country that \n     allowed an insurance company to be so ruthless with a child.\n       I fought for more than a year to get the referral Matthew \n     needed. By that time, Matthew was 18-months-old and was still \n     not speaking. Although we changed doctors, we could not \n     change insurance companies. When he finally saw the Ear, \n     Nose, and Throat Specialist, Matthew's test results were \n     heartbreaking. His impairment left him only to hear distorted \n     sounds of human speech, which is one of a child's most \n     important tools for developing language.\n       Thankfully, Matthew finally received the ear tube surgery \n     that he desperately needed. On the morning we brought him \n     home from the hospital, you should have seen the joy and \n     excitement in his face as he first heard birds chirping--a \n     sound so many of us take for granted. Two and a half years \n     have passed since our ordeal and Matthew has never had \n     another ear infection. The ear tubes immediately corrected \n     his hearing. He also had his adenoids removed, which were so \n     large that they were blocking the natural structure of the \n     inner ear that allows fluid to normally drain. These enlarged \n     adenoids could only have been found by an Ear, Nose, and \n     Throat Specialist.\n       If only Matthew had been treated earlier. Now our family \n     must work to correct his speech problem. Our insurance \n     company has changed since then, but it's been another fight \n     with another HMO to cover speech therapy. They denied \n     coverage for that service, until The National Patient \n     Advocate Foundation stepped in and won that battle for \n     Matthew.\n       I look back on our situation and wonder what our lives \n     would be like today if there had been a law preventing that \n     insurance company from financially penalizing our physician \n     for giving a referral. Matthew would have had normal hearing \n     during the critical developmental phase of his life. Instead, \n     now Matthew is unable to make the correct sound for 90 \n     percent of the alphabet. If Matthew received a timely \n     specialist referral, my son wouldn't be self-conscious and \n     hesitant to speak because he fears people not being above to \n     understand him.\n       Matthew was caught in the crossfire of an insurance company \n     being able to tell a doctor how to practice medicine. This is \n     just plain wrong. Cost effective health care has cost my \n     family, especially an innocent child, too much. I urge you to \n     pass meaningful patients bill of rights for me and Matthew.\n       Thank you.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to my colleague, the \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor 4 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we have the best specialists, the best \ndelivery system in the world. We have people who come here from all \nover the world to share in the remarkable expertise and capacities of \nour specialists in this country. Yet the fact is, under the Republican \nplan millions of our own citizens would be denied the right of access \nto specialists.\n  The stories of individuals are remarkable. I know every single one of \nus has received letters from anguished parents who run into the most \nextraordinary barriers of resistance from an HMO that is simply \nconcerned with its bottom line and not concerned with the proper \ndelivery of health to the individual they represent.\n  I will speak for just a few minutes today about one of the issues I \nbelieve cuts to the heart of this debate over managed care reform in \nthe Senate today, and that is the broader question of what kind of \naccess we are going to guarantee to specialists. Mr. President, in the \nUnited States, we are fortunate to have world-renowned health care \nfacilities and some of the best doctors and researchers in the world. \nEach year thousands of people from around the world travel to this \ncountry because we have the best specialists in the world. But at the \nsame time, every year, thousands of letters pour into my office from \nconstituents in managed care plans who can't see the specialists their \nown doctors know have the expertise to meet their medical needs--\nbecause their HMOs won't permit it. Mr. President, there's something \ndisturbing in the dichotomy we are facing: all the world knows our \ndoctors are the best trained, our specialists the best educated and the \nmost highly skilled--but our citizens aren't permitted to see them when \nthey need them most. What can we say about that system which defies the \nlimits of common sense and every notion of human compassion? I believe \nwe should all be able to say that it demands reform--today.\n  When the American people say they support managed care reform, they \nare rejecting the one-size-fits all brand of health care practiced by \nmany HMOs. Let me assure you, as well, that one of the most critical \nelements of any Patients' Bill of Rights must be access to quality \nspeciality care--literally, the difference between life and death for \nthousands upon thousands of Americans each year.\n  Too many of the tragic cases that we hear about in the United States \nare the result of delay and denial of access to cardiologists, \noncologists, surgeons, pediatric specialists and the doctors who have \nthe specialized knowledge absolutely critical in so many cases today. I \nwill never forget the story of Morgan smith--four years old, diagnosed \nwith brain cancer, facing a life-threatening tumor. Imagine the horror \nof her parents, hearing that grim diagnosis. And you can understand her \nparents' reaction when pediatric oncologists at Hasbro Children's \nHospital in Providence told them that Morgan needed to go to New \nEngland Regional Medical Center in Boston for a special chemotherapy \ntreatment--her mother said ``I need to do whatever it's going to take \nto save my daughter's life, and I'm going to listen to our doctor.''\n\n  But can you imagine how Morgan's mother felt when she got a letter in \nthe mail from her HMO denying payment for a specialist--demanding that \nshe get a second opinion? Meanwhile, Mrs. Smith took Morgan to Boston \nfor her treatments, unsure about how she would pay for it, but knowing \nthat she couldn't afford to risk Morgan's health while she fought the \ninsurance company. Despite a second opinion that Morgan needed the \nexpertise of specialists in Boston, the HMO still refused to pay for \nthe treatment. Mrs. Smith had to wage her own battle against the HMO by \nstarting a letter-writing campaign, along with Morgan's doctors.\n  Fortunately, Morgan's story, unlike too many others, has a happy \nending. Close to a month after Morgan had started her treatment, the \ninsurance company finally agreed to cover the procedure that all the \nmedical professionals agreed was necessary. But I would remind you that \nhad Morgan's parents followed the HMO's mandate, their daughter may not \nhave received the treatment that saved her life and it was at the very \nleast, delayed. Morgan's parents have since changed insurance \ncompanies, but their health plan contract will be rewritten in August \nand the family is very nervous about possible changes that may affect \nMorgan's health care. Morgan will be six years old this November and \nshe is attending kindergarten. We need to take the right steps today to \nguarantee that Morgan and children like her never face another HMO \nnightmare like the one that could have cost her and her family her \nlife. We need to take the necessary steps to prevent the kind of \nbureaucratic nightmare that almost killed Sarah Pederson. Sarah \nPederson's parents lives were changed overnight when their healthy, \nbeautiful seven month old baby was diagnosed with an inoperable brain \ntumor--a condition which had to be monitored carefully by a specialist. \nBut the Pedersons' HMO--in spite of the recommendation of their \npediatrician--would not allow Sara to see a pediatric neuro-oncologist. \nA seven month old baby with a brain tumor, a brain tumor so complicated \nthat the Pedersons' pediatrician knew only of a few pediatric neuro-\noncologists capable of treating it, and the HMO said ``no''--they \ninsisted that this child be sent to an adult neuro-oncologist. Why? No \nexplanation was given other than ``this is our policy.'' And it goes on \nand on. The HMO refused to approve the chemo-therapy regimen prescribed \nby their specialist--until it was approved by another one of their \nspecialists. And what happened during that month of delay? The tumor \ngrew. And in the end, what saved Sarah Pederson? Did the HMO relent and \nallow the doctors and the family to make decisions in the best \ninterests of this child? No. The Pedersons only found relief when they \nleft their HMO--and mortgaged their home to join a fee for service \nprogram. I challenge any one to look the Pedersons in the eye and tell \nthem we don't need managed care reform to guarantee appropriate access \nto specialists.\n\n[[Page S8499]]\n\n  Mr. President, I can tell you that--thanks to parents who didn't give \nup, who put their own financial security on the line, who fought and \nfought the red tape--Morgan Smith and Sarah Pederson survived. They \nsurvived in spite of their HMO's. Jack Jennings wasn't so lucky. Jack \nwas from Andover, Massachusetts. He was diagnosed with mild emphysema, \nand later on with a pneumothorax, which can lead to a collapsed lung. \nHis doctor believed a lung reduction procedure could not just improve \nhis quality of life, but actually save his life--but this primary care \ndoctor knew it would take a specialist to perform that operation. Jack \nwas referred to see Dr. Sugarbaker, a top physician in Boston. The HMO \nrejected the referral. Jack's doctor wrote a lengthy appeal. The HMO \nrejected it. Months went by. Jack appealed again and again--literally \ntaking a break from his oxygen machine to speak on the phone with the \nHMO claims adjuster. Finally, a letter arrived at the Jennings \nhousehold, the referral for a specialist approved, a date for surgery \nset. But here's the tragedy: Jack Jennings had died before the letter \nreached his house, before the surgery was approved. And the letter from \nthe HMO was right there in a pile of mail, surrounded by condolence \ncards. Mr. President, how can we say with a straight face that HMO's \naren't running roughshod over patients in dire need of specialty care. \nHow can we say that this isn't a gross abuse of fundamental patients' \nrights?\n  Our access to specialists amendment helps to ensure that patients \nwill be able to secure the health care they need, no matter what the \ncircumstance. All patients with special conditions absolutely must have \naccess to providers who have the expertise to treat their problems.\n  Our amendment delivers on these common sense propositions: ensuring \naccess to specialists by allowing patients in an HMO network of \nphysicians to find specialty care outside that network at no extra cost \nif there is no qualified specialist available in the network and \nallowing patients who are seriously ill or require continued care to \nhave their specialists coordinate their care without being required to \nask permission again and again from a primary care provider. The \nRepublican bill does not ensure access to speciality care; it lacks \nbasic protections to ensure that patients can see doctors qualified to \ntreat their condition. For example, if a child with cancer needed \naccess to a pediatric oncologist, there is no guarantee in the \nRepublican bill that she will have access to that specialist.\n\n  Not only that, but the Republican bill does not allow patients with \ndiseases or disabilities requiring continuing care by a specialist to \ndesignate their specialist as their primary care doctor who can \ncoordinate their care. Under the Republican bill, patients could be \ncharged more for out-of-network specialty care--even if the plan is at \nfault for not having access to appropriate specialists. The Republican \nbill would not allow patients to appeal a denial of access to \nappropriate specialists. If the Republicans pass the legislation that \nthey want to pass, children and adults with diseases such as cancer or \nsevere arthritis will continue to face insurance company red tape when \nthey go for routine visits to the oncologist or rheumatologist.\n  Mr. President, our opponents will say their bill includes access to \nspecialty care but the fact is that their bill leaves out the key \nelements needed to ensure access to specialty care. Their bill may have \nthe title Patients' Bill of Rights, but it sure doesn't have the \nsubstance. At a time when millions upon millions of Americans are \nfeeling the squeeze from their HMO's, when millions of Americans are \nsuffering needlessly because decisions are being made by bureaucrats \nrather than doctors, the style without the substance won't do a single \nthing to make health care better--it won't save Morgan Smith's family \nfrom another battle with an HMO when her family's energy should be \ndedicated to a fight against cancer, it won't do a single thing to \nprevent the all-too-real suffering that has become standard practice in \nthe maze of red tape that is managed care health care in the United \nState today. Mr. President, we can do better than the Republican \npropsoal--we can actually guarantee access to a specialist. And that is \na responsibility every one of us ought to work towards fulfilling.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 4 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, it is clear that every American has the \nright to have a specialist, and we need to pass this amendment in \nappreciation of that fundamental need and right of our citizens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the issue of access to specialty care is \nvery important. Many of us represent, as I do, hospitals that are very \nintensive tertiary care facilities with lots of specialists. Those of \nus who have had young children have had experience at children's \nhospitals and have dealt with specialists and recognized the need for \nthat.\n  I can tell you as a father of four young children and a child who is \ndue in September, I am not going to stand here and say we are not going \nto provide access to the kind of specialty care for children, or \nanybody else, that is needed. I am confident that the bill before us \ndoes exactly that. It does exactly that. It provides access to \nspecialty care when it is necessary to save or help improve the life of \na young child or anybody else.\n  As an example, if you have a baby who is born with a rare heart \ndisease and the pediatrician recommends that a pediatric cardiologist \ntreat the baby, the claim is made and it is denied initially, and it \ngoes through the internal review process. Specialty care is covered \nunder the contract. Remember, we are dealing with covered benefits, so \nobviously if it is not a covered benefit, that is a different issue. \nBut if it is covered--and, of course, most HMOs cover some sort of \nspecialty care--it is covered.\n  But in this case, say the network doesn't have a pediatric \ncardiologist. So you have, in a sense, what is laid out by the other \nside, the worst case scenario. The network doesn't have a specialist, \nand therefore they just won't give this specialist treatment because \nthere isn't a pediatric cardiologist available to treat this. So a \nregular pediatrician would have to do so.\n  Well, that is not the case in our bill. Our bill says that this \nparticular denial is eligible for review by an independent external \nreviewer. The dispute is about who should provide the specialty care. \nThat is an element of medical judgment. Therefore, if it is an element \nof medical judgment, it is eligible for review. If it is an independent \nreview and the reviewer says yes----\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If I can get through this first. It is eligible for a \nreview. An independent reviewer, under our bill, will look at all of \nthe facts in the case and determine whether, in fact, the pediatric \ncardiologist is necessary in medical judgment to, in fact, perform this \nprocedure. They make an independent medical determination based on all \nof the information that is reviewed, including the recommendation of \nthe doctor, the original pediatrician, including the recommendation by \nthe internal reviewer. They look at all of the information, they get \nall of the relevant facts, and they put this together--as has been \nlisted many times here--a laundry list of factors to consider, and they \nmake an independent judgment as to whether a pediatric cardiologist is \nnecessary. If it is necessary, the denial is overturned. The specialist \noutside of the network is selected to provide the care for this child \nwithin the HMO.\n  That is in our bill. That is covered under our bill. So all of this \ntalk about we are not going to have this kind of access is not \ncarefully reading this bill. I give a lot of credit to Senator Frist \nand Senator Jeffords and those on the health committee. They have done \nan excellent job of looking through and making sure all of these kinds \nof situations where you have limitations--and in many cases you do have \nlimitations, and the networks don't have a lot of specialists. But you \ncan go outside the network if an independent reviewer determines that \nis what is medically necessary in that case.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n\n[[Page S8500]]\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Yes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. As I understand the bill you are referring to, you say \nit provides this access. There is no requirement that access to the \nspecialist be provided at the regular amount that is being paid. \nWhatever the HMO determines the additional cost should be to go to the \noutside specialist would be charged, is that correct? That is my \nunderstanding. I have read the bill fairly carefully, and that is a \nmajor difference between the amendment I have offered and the amendment \nthat you are referring to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time allotted to the Senator from \nPennsylvania has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield to the Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Stephen \nDowns, a health care policy fellow, be given privileges of the floor \nduring consideration of S. 1344.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, yesterday, I talked to a 56-year-old \nwoman I have known for a long time in West Virginia. She has a rare \nheart disease. She has been struggling with it. She has now discovered \nthat the operation she is potentially going to need is not available \nfor her in West Virginia. She is going to have to go to another State \nfar south in order to get that operation. The problem is that her \ninsurance company said they will not pay for her operation. They said \nshe will either get her operation in West Virginia, where this kind of \noperation is not readily available because it is rather rare or she \nwon't get it at all, or she has to pay for it herself. She is not a \ncorporate giant. She runs a small business and has six people working \nfor her.\n\n  This kind of thing should never happen. The Democratic bill would \nprevent that from happening. She would be able to go to that southern \nState where they do this kind of operation constantly and get that \noperation. That should happen in the United States of America.\n  Secondly, I talked with the physician of an 8-year-old girl 4 days \nago. She has growth problems, seizure problems, and development \nproblems, and she is under the care of a pediatric specialist in \nendocrinology and neurology at Western University. If you have a \npediatric endocrinologist and somebody says you have to use an adult \nendocrinologist because that is in our plan, well, then people say, \nwell, an endocrinologist is an endocrinologist. Not true. She will be \ndenied care, and that is wrong.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the proponents has expired.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Under the Democratic bill, she would get pediatric \ncare, and she should.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I wanted to respond to the Senator from \nNew Mexico. My time had run out. My understanding is that the provision \nin the bill says the network has to provide access to specialty care. \nWe define in the report language clearly what access means as far as \ncost sharing is concerned:\n\n       When the plan covers a benefit or service that is \n     appropriately provided by a particular type of specialist not \n     in the network, the benefit will be provided using the in-\n     network cost-sharing schedule.\n\n  In other words, no additional costs. Only in cases where it is a \npreference to go outside the network for a specialist, other than \nsomebody in the network, where it has not been referred by the plan or \ndetermined by a reviewer, is that additional cost borne. As long as an \nindependent reviewer or the plan refers out of network, the cost \nsharing is the same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield the remaining time to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized for 9 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I wanted to come over today and try to end \nthis debate by making a point this debate has cried out for all day.\n  What we have heard all day long is our Democrat colleagues stand up \nand attack HMOs. Every horror story they could imagine, every outrage \nthat the human mind could conceive, they have talked about and laid at \nthe doorstep of HMOs. I think someone watching this debate who just got \noff a turnip truck or who just emerged from a 10-year trip to outer \nspace would believe that our Democrat colleagues hate HMOs and that \nthey are the enemies of HMOs.\n  But let me remind those who may have just gotten off a turnip truck, \nor those who may have forgotten what has occurred in America in the \nlast 20 years that you have been listening all day to the fathers and \nmothers of HMOs. They brought HMOs into Federal statutes. They exempted \nthem from health planning.\n  They liked HMOs so much that in 1994 they sent this bill to the \nCongress.\n  For those who have forgotten it, this is the Clinton health care \nbill. The Clinton health care bill, which our colleagues who spoke \ntoday all supported and uniformly loved, forced every American to go \ninto an HMO that was set up as a local health care cooperative. It was \nan HMO run by the Government with all the compassion of the IRS and \nwith all of the efficiency of the post office.\n  They loved HMOs so much and they were so confident in them that they \nsaid: If you refuse to join your local health cooperative, HMO, \nGovernment-run health care system, we are going to fine you $5,000.\n  That was their position in 1994.\n  Now they have taken a poll. They have done a focus group. They do not \nlove HMOs anymore. But in 1994 they loved them so much that they were \ngoing to fine every American $5,000 for refusing to join their \nGovernment-run HMO.\n  By the way, they banned suing the HMO when it was their HMO, when it \nwas the Government HMO. They thought we ought not to do it.\n  Today they are worried about doctors providing care, and that for a \ndoctor under an HMO, they can't do it. But when they were writing their \nhealth care bill, they fined a doctor $50,000 if he provided health \ncare that their Government-run health care cooperative, HMO, did not \nallow.\n  So under this bill, when you had a health care collective run by the \nGovernment--one great big HMO, and if a doctor prescribed a medicine \nthat they didn't allow, or prescribed a treatment, or provided a \ntreatment that they didn't think was medically necessary, that is Dr. \nClinton or Dr. Kennedy didn't think was necessary, a doctor could be \nfined $50,000 under this bill.\n  If your baby was really sick and they banned the treatment, and if I \nwent to Dr. Frist and I said, Dr. Frist, I want my child to have this \nsurgery, I know you can do it, I know that our Government collective \nHMO bans it, but I am willing to pay you for it, if Dr. Frist had taken \nthat payment, he would have gone to prison for 15 years under the \nClinton health care bill.\n  These are the people who invented the HMO. They are the people who \nlove HMOs. They are the people who wanted to put us under an HMO and \nfine us $5,000 for not giving it our money, and it put a doctor in \nprison for 15 years for violating their statute on what they thought \nwas good medicine.\n  Today it has been a horror show about HMOs.\n  I want to conclude. I know people want to go home.\n  How do they fix this problem? They fix the problem with what they \ncall a Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  There are two rights that they guarantee.\n  No. 1, you can look in the blue pages of the phonebook, and you can \ncall up a Government bureaucrat, and you can complain. You can get an \nappointment. You can go see them next Tuesday at 8 o'clock. You can get \na bureaucrat to join you in the examining room. That, to them, is a \nhealth care bill of rights.\n  The second right they guarantee is, you can call up an attorney. You \ncan open up the Yellow Pages. Here is one that says, ``No fees unless \nwe get you money.'' Anyway, whoever you find in here--criminal law, \nfamily law, personal injury specialist--you can pick any lawyer you \nwant under their health care bill of rights, and you can call him, and \nyou can sue.\n\n[[Page S8501]]\n\n  But what you cannot do under their so-called bill of rights that you \ncan do under our bill of rights is, under our bill of rights you can \nfire your HMO. You can set up a medical savings account and then you \ncan look in the Yellow Pages under ``Physician.'' You can call any \nphysician you want to call, and you can say to them, do you take a \ncheck? If they do, with the medical savings account that you can have \nunder our bill with your employer, you can say ``no'' to your HMO. You \ndon't call up the Government, because you don't like how they are \ntreating you, or, go hire a lawyer. You fire your HMO and hire your \ndoctor.\n\n  You can see what real freedom is. You can say to the HMO, you haven't \ndone me right, you haven't treated my children right, and you are \nfired.\n  Our bill does that. Their bill does not do that.\n  I cannot end the day without pointing out two things.\n  One, all day long you have heard from people who invented HMOs and \nwho love them so much that they wanted to put the whole country under \nHMOs in a mandated Government-run program. And they still do.\n  Second, their remedy for all of these concerns is, call the \nGovernment, or call a lawyer.\n  Our remedy is to first deal with the real concerns in HMOs with a \nreview process that really works.\n  But we have one more freedom they don't have. Under our bill, you can \nfire your HMO. That is what I call real freedom. That is what we \nprovide.\n  If you have listened all day to these horror stories, please \nremember, this is a monster that they helped create and that they loved \nso much, they wanted to mandate that everybody be in it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am a good friend of the Senator from Texas. I will \ntell you, Mr. President, the Senator is as wrong in his explanation \nabout the debate here on the floor of the Senate and as wrong about \nPresident Clinton's bill on health care as he was about President \nClinton's proposal about economic recovery in 1993 when he predicted \nthe end of the free market system, that inflation was going up through \nthe roof, with unemployment lines around the Capitol of the United \nStates. He predicted that deficits were going to grow and it was going \nto be the end of the American free enterprise system. He was wrong \nthen, and he is wrong tonight.\n  Mr. President, I yield the last minute to the Senator from South \nDakota,\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will take a minute off the bill.\n  I do not know how you top that. I was simply going to say that if you \nbelieve anything the Senator from Texas just said, you are going to buy \na turnip truck from him, too.\n  But I hope everybody can remember what this is all about. This is \nsimply about whether or not patients have the right to a specialist, \nwhether or not the HMO under any circumstances can tell a patient and \nhis or her doctor that, no, you cannot go to a specialist, because in \nmillions of cases around the country today, tomorrow, and for the past \nseveral years, that is exactly what has happened.\n  Do we have access to specialists or not? The Democrats are saying \nyes, we need access to the specialist. That is the essence of health \ncare in America today. But people are being denied that access. We want \nto change that. This amendment will do it. It deserves our support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican side controls 1 minute 30 \nseconds on the amendment.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I will take a very short amount of time.\n  If I am so wrong about the Clinton health care bill, I hope tomorrow \nto offer it as an amendment, and we will give everybody a chance to \nvote on it. We debated it for 2 years. It was like a great big \noverinflated balloon. When somebody pricked it with a little pin, all \nof the air ran out of it. We never got around to voting on it. We have \nit here. We can send it up tomorrow and give everybody a chance to vote \non it.\n  If Senator Kennedy thinks it is so right--I know he does in his heart \nbecause he is a very sincere person--then he can vote for the Clinton \nhealth care bill, and fine these people, and put doctors in prison for \n15 years for providing ``unauthorized'' care. Then we will know where \nwe all stand on these issues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of our time and ask \nfor the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, this \nwill be the last vote tonight. The Senate will go into morning business \nat 9:30 and be back on the bill at 10 o'clock tomorrow. We expect the \nfirst vote to be at approximately noon tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The question is on agreeing to \namendment No. 1245.\n  On this question, the yeas and nays have been ordered and the clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \nwho desire to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 47, nays 53, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 205 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--47\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Byrd\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Specter\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--53\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n  The amendment (No. 1245) was rejected.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, health care in America is the envy of the \nworld. We have the finest doctors, nurses, and medical care personnel \navailable anywhere. We have the best research facilities and the most \nadvanced--state-of-the-art--technology. We are the world's leader in \nproviding new and effective treatments and therapies. And it doesn't \nseem that a day goes by without news of some exciting breakthrough in \nmedicine and health.\n  While this is the good news, there's no question that our health care \ndelivery system also faces some serious challenges. No one argues that \nthere isn't cause for concern when it comes to making high quality \nhealth care more affordable, and therefore more accessible, to millions \nof Americans who currently have no coverage, and for those who may even \nhave coverage, but who are receiving substandard and even poor care.\n  For the last fifteen years, Congress has been concerned about the \nskyrocketing costs associated with health care. I remember the dire \npredictions we listened to in the 1980s and early 1990s. I recall the \ntestimony of OMB Director Dick Darman in 1992, when he warned that \ngiven its current rate of increase, total public and private health \nspending was quickly taking over the Gross National Product. Unless \nsomething was done, he said, expenditures--which were less than six \npercent of GNP three decades earlier--would reach the unmaintainable \nlevel of 26 percent of GNP by the year 2030.\n\n[[Page S8502]]\n\n  One of the innovative answers to curb this dangerous increase was the \nadvent of managed care and the creation of Health Maintenance \nOrganizations. Through this system, millions of Americans found access \nto health care that was affordable. Small businesses were better able \nto provide insurance for their employees. And competition between HMOs \nand other health care providers in the miraculous free market system \nworked to reduce the exploding costs of coverage. At the same time, it \nallowed those incentives to work that were continuing to promote new \nresearch and development, new therapies and technology, and the daily \nbreakthroughs I mentioned earlier.\n  Was everything perfect? No. Questions and concerns--very relevant \nquestions and concerns--soon surfaced regarding the quality of care \ndelivered by some of the providers participating in the managed care \nsystem. But just as valid as these concerns was the fact that through \nmanaged care, millions of satisfied Americans were receiving high \nquality services that may have, otherwise, been unavailable to them. \nAnd because of the influence that managed care was having on the \ndelivery of health care in America, free market principles were \ncontinuing to reward innovation and quality, while at the same time \ncreating a new dimension of competition to help control costs.\n\n  With this background, we see more clearly the dynamics involved in \nthe issue before us today. As we look to address the need of \nestablishing a patients' bill of rights--and, again, the need is very \nreal--we see clearly how the improvements we incorporate in such a bill \nof rights must protect Americans and improve the quality of the health \ncare they are receiving while, at the same time, not undermine the \nstrengths of the current system.\n  This is a delicate balance--one that was of primary importance to the \ntask force that I served on with several of my colleagues. Together, we \nlistened to dozens of experts and consumer representatives. We \ncollected and reviewed reams of information. We reviewed countless \nareas that might be addressed and looked at countless possibilities for \nlegislative action. There was no question that managed care could be \nimproved. In fact, many providers from within managed care \norganizations agreed that there were improvements to be made, and it \nbecame clear by the evidence we reviewed that a bill of rights is \nwarranted.\n  Our goal was simple: increase standards and the quality of health \ncare delivered by providers, without excessively escalating costs that \nwould make health care coverage less available to Americans who need it \nmost. There is no question that any time costs go up, those who are \nmost adversely affected are those who are least able to afford the \nincreases. This not only includes the millions of American families \nthat might not have access to health care without competitive managed \ncare providers, but it also includes millions of Medicare beneficiaries \nwho--to receive extra coverage and benefits--are participating in \nmanaged care programs.\n  If attempts to improve the system go to the extreme--opening up, and \neven encouraging, litigation, or increasing government intervention and \nregulation, or holding small businesses that provide health care \ncoverage liable for the judgments made by physicians--costs are going \nto explode; countless individuals and families are going to suffer the \nadverse consequences.\n  On the other hand, if improvements focus on protecting the patient \nwhile strengthening the current system, then coverage can be expanded, \nquality can be assured, and even the most vulnerable will be protected. \nThis, Mr. President, is our objective; it's what we intend to do with \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights Act--a well-studied and common sense \napproach to protecting Americans, while at the same time improving our \nhealth care delivery system. The legislation we introduce today not \nonly targets specific problems in the current system, but it will make \nhealth care more affordable, more accessible, and give consumers \ngreater choice concerning their own care.\n  This is accomplished in several ways.\n  First, this legislation will guarantee patients a more thorough due \nprocess than they currently receive when they are denied a benefit by \ntheir health plan. This includes an external review by an independent \nmedical expert to determine if a health plan has unfairly denied a \nbenefit. In urgent cases, this review must be completed within 72 \nhours. This provision is so important because it will ensure that \npatients get the benefits they are entitled to, when they need those \nbenefits most.\n  If, for some reason, the safety net of an independent external review \nprocess fails, our plan preserves an individual's right to sue his or \nher health plan in Federal court for all benefit denials. The \nindividual can also sue in State court for malpractice claims.\n  Beyond this, our legislation increases the choices that are made \navailable to patients by requiring health plans that contract with \nbusinesses of 51 or more employees to offer participants the \nopportunity to receive health care service from out-of-network \nproviders. In this way, consumers will be able to choose providers that \nbest suit their needs.\n  Outside of encouraging greater choice, our plan effectively increases \naccess to health insurance by making coverage for self-employed \nAmericans 100 percent tax deductible, starting next January. This is a \nprovision that is long overdue. Self-employed individuals have unfairly \nbeen limited in the amount of money they can deduct from their taxes \nfor health care coverage, while business and corporations have been \nable to deduct all the health care benefits they provided their \nemployees. This provision will not only help restore equity, but it \nwill benefit 25 million Americans who are in families headed by a self-\ninsured individual--five million of whom are currently uninsured.\n  The legislation will require patients to be fully informed concerning \ntheir coverage, including cost-sharing requirements, supplemental \nbenefits, out-of-area coverage, options for selecting primary health \ncare providers, access to emergency care, and preventative services. In \nother words, no more surprises. And this legislation also gives \npatients the right to request and be given information concerning their \nplan's administrative details. For example, providers will be required \nto answer their customers' queries into the licensure and \nqualifications of the professionals who participate in the providers' \nplans. They will be required to provide relevant information concerning \nparticipating health care facilities and reimbursement methods between \nthe plan and its participating professions, as well as the status of \nthe plan with accrediting organizations. Likewise, consumers can \nrequest information about medications that are included in the plan and \nprocedures to obtain medications that may not be a part of the program.\n  All of these provisions are fundamentally important to the rights \nthat patients should have when dealing with their health care \nproviders. But as you can see, Mr. President, they are constructed and \nincluded in this legislation in a way that the benefits are received \nwithout adversely influencing accessibility and affordability. In fact, \nas I have shown, accessibility and affordability will actually increase \nwith this Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act.\n  But the benefits of this plan do not stop there. The Patients' Bill \nof Rights Plus Act includes important prohibitions against gag rules \nthat some health plans use to limit communication between doctors and \npatients. This legislation will prohibit health plans from restricting \ntheir doctors from sharing information and discussing treatment options \nwith their patients.\n  This legislation will also patients to have direct access to \nobstetricians, gynecologists, and pediatricians for routine care \nwithout referrals.\n  And it includes important measure to protect sensitive patient \ninformation. It prohibits the use of genetic information to deny health \ncare coverage or to set premium rates. And it enhances the role of the \nAgency for Health Care Quality Research to continue the important \neffort of improving the system for long-term.\n  These, too, are important, but perhaps the provisions in this \nlegislation with which I am most pleased are those that will advance \nresearch, prevention and treatment for women with cancer and \ncardiovascular disease. These provisions will expand basic and clinical \nresearch, specifically for women, on the underlying causes and \nprevention of these diseases. Beyond this, the Patients' Bill of Rights \nPlus Act will fund\n\n[[Page S8503]]\n\nextended research related to osteoporosis and women's geriatric \nconcerns. And it will support continued data collection through the \nNational Center for Health Statistics and the National Program of \nCancer Registries--two leading women's health data centers.\n  Mr. President, I don't think there's anyone who can argue with the \nimportant measures contained in this bill. It is, indeed, \ncomprehensive. At the same time, it's balanced and constructive. It's \nthe kind of effective leadership Americans expect from Congress--making \naccess to health care easier, not harder, for individuals and small \nbusinesses.\n  It allows the incentives that make our health care system the envy of \nthe world to continue, while it includes new incentives for providers \nto offer better quality, greater efficiency, and to be more responsive \nto their customers. While addressing the short-comings of the current \nsystem, this legislation builds on what is good--what is working--in \nthe current system. It expands the real rights of patients and provides \nfor continued research and development in areas that are vitally \nimportant to America's changing demographics.\n  For these important reasons, I encourage all of my colleagues to join \nus in supporting this Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act. It is not only \ncomprehensive and very workable, it is constructive and necessary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for S. \n6, the Patients Bill of Rights. After 2 years of partisan struggles, I \nam pleased that we finally have the opportunity to consider this \nimportant bill, which could benefit all 161 million Americans in \nmanaged health care plans.\n  For many years, managed care has helped to rein in the rapidly \ngrowing costs of health care. That benefits all patients across the \nnation and helps to keep health care costs in check.\n  However, there is a real difference between making quality health \ncare affordable and cutting corners on patient care. In Wisconsin, we \nare lucky that most health plans do a good job in keeping costs low and \nproviding quality care. But too often across this nation, HMOs put too \nmany obstacles between doctors and patients. In the name of saving a \nfew bucks, too many patients must hurdle bureaucratic obstacles to get \nbasic care. Even worse, too many patients are being denied essential \ntreatment based on the bottom line rather than on what is best for \nthem.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights will ensure that patients come first--\nnot HMO profits or health plan bureaucrats. It makes sure that doctors, \nin consultation with patients, are the ones who decide which treatments \nare medically necessary. It gives patients access to information about \nall available treatments and not just the cheapest. Whether to seek \nemergency care, pursue treatment by a specialist, or try an innovative \nnew treatment--these are hard questions that should be answered by \ncaring physicians and concerned families--not by a calculator. S. 6 \nputs these decisions back in human hands where they belong.\n  This legislation will also make sure that health plans are held \naccountable for the decisions they make. First, all health plans must \nhave an external appeals process in place, so that patients who \nchallenge HMO decisions may take their case to an independent panel of \nmedical experts. And second, if a health plan's decision to deny or \ndelay care results in death or injury to the patient, this bill ensures \nthat the health plan can be held accountable for its actions.\n  Most importantly, this bill gives all of these protections to all \nAmericans in managed health care plans, not just a few. All 161 million \nAmericans in managed health plans deserve the same protections--no \nmatter what State they live in.\n  I am shocked by the refusal of some of my colleagues to endorse this \ncommonsense legislation. If you or a member of your family got sick, \nwho would you trust to make decisions about their care? Who would you \ntrust to decide what kind of specialist was necessary? Who would you \ntrust to tell you about all available treatments and not just the \ncheapest? Wouldn't you insist on having access to the best possible \nmedical care? Most of us would. Why should the 161 million Americans in \nmanaged health care deserve less than what we would insist upon?\n  The answer is, simply, that all Americans deserve access to the best \nquality health care available. As someone who comes from a business \nbackground, I understand the concerns of employers. Some of my \ncolleagues on the other side have claimed that our bill will increase \nhealth care costs by as much as $72 billion, making it impossible for \nemployers and families to afford coverage. But the Congressional Budget \nOffice reported that the patient protections in our bill will only \nincrease premiums by 4.8 percent over 5 years. This translates into \nonly $2 per month for the average employee. An independent Coopers & \nLybrand study found that our provision to hold health plans \naccountable--the provision the other side opposes the most--would only \ncost 3 to 13 cents per person per month. This is a small price to pay \nto make sure that health plans cover the health care services we all \ndeserve.\n  I am willing to look at possible improvements to the bill. But there \nis no reason whatsoever to continue to allow health plans to skimp on \nquality in the name of saving profits. Patients have been in the \nwaiting room long enough. It is time for the Senate to act and make \nsure they receive the health care they need, deserve, and pay for.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I wish to talk about health care. I am very \nproud that this great country of ours provides the best quality of \nhealth care in the world. With this comes the question of how to manage \nthe constantly growing costs associated with this and how to guarantee \nthat as many Americans as possible can be provided affordable health \ncare.\n  Currently, 43 million Americans are uninsured and many more live with \nthe anxiety that they will lose their employer-sponsored health plans \nif premiums go up. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that \nSenator Kennedy's bill, S. 6, will increase private health insurance \npremiums 6.1 percent above inflation. Data from the Barents Group, an \neconomic consulting firm, reveal an increase of this magnitude will \nimpose hundreds of dollars in hidden taxes on families, eliminate jobs, \nand cancel the health coverage of millions.\n  In Montana, farmers, ranchers, and small businesses pull the wagon \nand are the main source of income in our great state. You can only \nimagine what would happen if Senator Kennedy's Patients' Bill of Rights \nbill passes. Hundreds of Montanans will lose their insurance for their \nfamilies and quite possibly many could lose their jobs. With the \ncurrent agriculture prices as low as they this would only make things \nmuch worse for Montanans.\n  The Republican Patients' Bill of Rights bill provides new rights to \nAmerican patients. This bill will guarantee access to emergency room \ncare, access to the doctor of your choice, access to ob-gyn care \nwithout prior authorization and access to a pediatrician without prior \nauthorization. The Republican bill also improves continuity of care if \na doctor leaves a health plan and improved access to medication. These \nare just a few of the things that our Patients' Bill of Rights bill \nguarantees patients.\n  I will not vote for a bill that squeezes patients into a one-size-\nfits-all health plan. We do not want a Washington-knows-best solution. \nAs a former county commissioner I have always believed in local \ncontrol.\n  The Republican bill provides tax-free medical savings accounts for \npatients and allows for 100 percent deductibility of health care costs \nfor the self-employed. Medical savings accounts are similar to \nindividual retirement accounts, except they are used to pay for health \ncare needs instead of retirement. They permit individuals to set aside \nmoney, tax-free, to pay for medical expenses.\n  The Democrats want to pass a bill that would regulate the structure \nand operation of all health insurance products at the federal level; \nimpose mandates on consumers, health insurers and employers; enable new \nlawsuits against employers and insurers for unlimited compensatory and \npunitive damages; and increase the number of uninsured Americans by an \nestimated 1.9 million.\n  In contrast the Republican bill guarantees to make health insurance \nmore\n\n[[Page S8504]]\n\naffordable for the self-employed by letting them deduct 100 percent of \ntheir health premiums in 2000--three years ahead of schedule. The \nCongressional Budget Office estimates that the Democrats bill, S. 6, \nwould increase health insurance premiums an average 6.1 percent which \nwould force 1.8 million to 1.9 million Americans to lose their health \ncoverage. This bill will also lower household wages an average of $207 \nannually, and would eliminate 194,000 jobs by 2003.\n  I am firmly behind a bill in the United States that will provide \nconsumer protections and enhanced health care quality, while keeping \ninsurance affordable and actually expanding access to insurance for \nmillions of Americans.\n  Under the Republican bill, the patients have the right to talk freely \nand openly with their doctors about all treatment options and the right \nto see the doctor of their choice. Even more important, they have the \nright to a quick and cost-free appeals process if a health plan refuses \nto cover treatment.\n  The Republican bill does all these things, and also expands \nopportunity for millions of uninsured Americans to come into the health \ncare system. We offer tax-free medical savings accounts to all, and \nextend tax equity to self-employed individuals.\n  Mr. President, the Republican Patients' Bill of Rights Plus makes \nsure all Americans have the access and protections they need and want. \nAmericans deserve access to the best doctors and specialists available; \nreliable information about their doctors and their health plans, and \naffordable, quality care at every stage of life. This week, I will work \nto make sure Congress addresses these important issues with a plan that \nputs you, not a bureaucrat, in control of your health care.\n  I thank the chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/14/senate-section/article/S8504-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             MILITARY CONSTRUCTION APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2000\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

A bill to establish a commission to study the airline \nindustry and to recommend policies to ensure consumer information and \nchoice; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n[[Page S8506]]\n\n                        travel agent commissions\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that will \nestablish a commission to study the future of the travel agent industry \nand determine the consumer impact of airline interaction with travel \nagents.\n  Since the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 was enacted, major \nairlines have controlled pricing and distribution policies of our \nnation's domestic air transportation system. Over the past four years, \nthe airlines have reduced airline commissions to travel agents in an \ncompetitive effort to reduce costs.\n  I am concerned the impact of today's business interaction between \nairlines and travel agents may be a driving force that will force many \ntravel agents out of business. Combined with the competitive emergence \nof Internet services, these practices may be harming an industry that \nemploys over 250,000 Americans.\n  This bill will explore these concerns through the establishment of a \ncommission to objectively review the emerging trends in the airline \nticket distribution system. Among airline consumers there is a growing \nconcern that the airlines may be using their market power to unfairly \nlimit how airline tickets are distributed.\n  Mr. President, if we lose our travel agents, we lose a competitive \ncomponent to affordable air fare. Travel agents provide a much needed \nservice and without, the consumer is the loser.\n  The current use of independent travel agencies as the predominate \nmethod to distribute tickets ensures an efficient and unbiased source \nof information for air travel. Before deregulation, travel agents \nhandled only about 40 percent of the airline ticket distribution \nsystem. Since deregulation, the complexity of the ticket pricing system \ncreated the need for travel agents resulting in travel agents handling \nnearly 90 percent of transactions.\n  Therefore, the travel agent system has proven to be a key factor to \nthe success of airline deregulation. I'm afraid, however, that the \ndemise of the independent travel agent would be a factor of \nderegulation's failure if the major airlines succeed in dominating the \nticket distribution system.\n  Travel agents and other independent distributors comprise a \nconsiderable portion of the small business sector in the United States. \nThere are 33,000 travel agencies employing over 250,000 people. Women \nor minorities own over 50 percent of travel agencies.\n  The assault on travel agents has been fierce. Since 1995, commissions \nhave been reduced by 30 percent, 14 percent for domestic travel alone \nin 1998. Since 1995, travel agent commissions have been reduced from an \naverage of 10.8 percent to 6.9 percent in 1998. Travel agencies are \nfailing in record numbers.\n  Mr. President, I think it is important to study this issue as well as \nthe related issues of the current state of ticket distribution \nchannels, the importance of an independent system on small, regional, \nstart-up carriers, and the role of the Internet.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 1363. A bill for the relief of Valdas Adamkus, President of the \nRepublic of Lithuania; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n    private relief legislation for his excellency valdas adamkus of \n                               lithuania\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today on \nbehalf of the current President of Lithuania, His Excellency Valdas \nAdamkus. President Adamkus is a Lithuanian native and a former U.S. \ncitizen with more than a quarter century of distinguished service to \nour nation. His election last year to the Lithuanian presidency made \nnecessary his renunciation of his U.S. citizenship. My legislation \nprovides an exemption for President Adamkus from several consequences \nassociated with his renunciation. More specifically, my bill exempts \nPresident Adamkus from any expatriate taxes, restores President \nAdamkus' Social Security benefits, ensures his right to his federal \npension, and grants President Adamkus the right to travel freely \nthroughout the United States.\n  Valdas Adamkus was born on November 3, 1928 in Kaunas, Lithuania. \nBefore immigrating to the United States in 1949, he was involved with \nLithuanian resistance efforts against both Nazi Germany and Soviet \nRussian invaders. Settling in Chicago, President Adamkus remained \nactive in Lithuanian Emigre organizations and helped raise public \nawareness of Lithuania's occupation by the Soviet Union. Following the \nreturn of independence to the Baltics, President Adamkus served as a \nCoordinator for the United States Aid to the Baltic States, \nspecializing in environmental issues and academic coordination.\n  President Adamkus is a graduate of the Illinois Institute of \nTechnology, where he earned a B.S. in civil engineering before spending \nten years as a consulting engineer. In 1970, President Adamkus joined \nthe newly-created United States Environmental Protection Agency where \nhe initially served as the Deputy Regional Administrator of the fifth \nregion--which includes Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota and Ohio. \nIn 1981, President Adamkus was promoted to Regional Administrator for \nthe fifth region, a position he held until his retirement in 1997.\n  In a distinguished EPA career which stretched 27 years, President \nAdamkus held a number of leadership positions, including Chairman of \nthe Great Lakes Water Quality Board and Chairman of the United States \ngroup that worked with the Soviet Union on water pollution issues. In \n1975, he was appointed Advisor to the UN World Health Organization and \nrepresented the EPA on environmental issues in the Soviet Union, \nEastern Europe, Japan, and China.\n  In 1985, President Reagan personally presented President Adamkus with \nthe Executive Presidential Rank Award--the highest honor for a civil \nservant. Other honors he earned include the EPA's highest award, the \ngold medal for exceptional service, and the EPA's first Fitzhugh Green \nAward in 1988 for outstanding contributions to environmental protection \ninternationally.\n  To President Adamkus, the collapse of the Soviet Union in the late \n1980s and subsequent liberation of the Baltics marked the successful \nculmination of his lifelong commitment to Lithuania's freedom. As \nLithuania began the long and painful transition from a communist \ntotalitarian system to a free-market economy, Mr. Adamkus emerged as an \nideal candidate for the Lithuanian presidency, not only because of his \npast work for Lithuanian freedom, but also because of the experience he \ngained through his career as a U.S. civil servant.\n  Mr. Adamkus was elected President of the Republic of Lithuania on \nJanuary 4 of last year and took office on February 25. Before assuming \nthe Lithuanian presidency, Mr. Adamkus was required to renounce his \nU.S. citizenship. As I mentioned at the beginning of my statement, the \nbill I am offering today provides a limited exemption for President \nAdamkus from some of the negative consequences associated with \nrenunciation. More specifically, my bill:\n  (1) Exempts President Adamkus from the expatriate tax. As an \nexpatriate, President Adamkus is subject to sections 877 and 2107 of \nthe Internal Revenue Code, provided it is determined that his \nrenunciation had ``for one of its principal purposes the avoidance of \ntaxes.'' My bill exempts President Adamkus from sections 877 and 2107 \nby stating that his renunciation shall not ``be treated as having as \none of its purposes the avoidance of any Federal tax.''\n  (2) Restores President Adamkus' Social Security benefits and ensures \nhis right to his federal pension. Title 42 Section 402(t) of the US \ncode denies Social Security benefits to non-citizens residing outside \nthe United States. While Section 433 of that title allows our President \nto enter agreements with foreign countries which allow non-resident \nnon-citizens to receive pension benefits based on periods of coverage \nin the United States, the U.S. currently has no such agreement with \nLithuania. As a result, President Adamkus is not entitled to the Social \nSecurity benefits he earned from 37 years of work in the United States. \nMy bill restores these benefits. My bill also ensures that Mr. Adamkus \nretains the federal pension he earned as an employee of the EPA.\n  (3) Restores President Adamkus' right to travel in the United States. \nAs a non-resident alien, Mr. Adamkus no longer has the right to travel \nfreely in the U.S. My bill restores this privilege.\n  Mr. President, with this bill, I do not suggest that we trivialize \nthe act of renouncing one's U.S. citizenship. Renunciation of U.S. \ncitizenship is an act of\n\n[[Page S8507]]\n\nthe highest gravity that should not be undertaken without fully \nconsidering its consequences. I believe it appropriate, however, that \nwe provide President Adamkus with special treatment in light of his \nlong and distinguished service to our nation, his lifelong commitment \nto freedom and democracy in Lithuania, and his reason for renunciation. \nIndeed, it is in the interest of the United States that developing \ncountries--particularly the former Soviet Republics--succeed in \nestablishing free-market democratic societies. Hence, even in \nrenouncing his citizenship, President Adamkus continues to serve our \nnation admirably. I thank my colleagues for their consideration and \nurge them to join me in supporting this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1363\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That, \n     notwithstanding any other provision of law, the renunciation \n     of United States citizenship by Valdas Adamkus on February \n     25, 1998, in order to become the President of the Republic of \n     Lithuania shall not--\n       (1) be treated under any Federal law as having as one of \n     its purposes the avoidance of any Federal tax,\n       (2) result in the denial of any benefit under title II or \n     XVIII of the Social Security Act, or under title 5, United \n     States Code, or\n       (3) result in any restriction on the right of Valdas \n     Adamkus to travel or be admitted to the United States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAYH (for himself, Mr. Domenici, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. \n        Lieberman, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Graham, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Voinovich, \n        Mr. Robb, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Edwards, and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 1364. A bill to amend title IV of the Social Security Act to \nincrease public awareness regarding the benefits of lasting and stable \nmarriages and community involvement in the promotion of marriage and \nfatherhood issues, to provide greater flexibility in the Welfare-to-\nWork grant program for long-term welfare recipients and low income \ncustodial and noncustodial parents, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                   responsible fatherhood act of 1999\n\n MR. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with my good friend \nSenator Domenici to introduce the Responsible Fatherhood Act of 1999.\n  The irony in our nation's unprecedented economic prosperity is that \nmany Americans still feel the country is on the wrong track--that there \nis a deterioration of values in our society. There seems to be a \nfraying of the social fabric and many indicators point to the increase \nin absentee fathers as the culprit.\n  America's moms are true heroes in the lives of their children. While \nmost fathers are heroic in their own right, many are not involved \nenough--too many are completely absent. Fathers can teach kids about \nrespect, honor, duty and the values that make our communities strong. \nBut there has been a troubling decline in the involvement of fathers in \nthe lives of their children over the last 40 years--a decline that \nshould worry us all.\n  The number of kids living in households without fathers has tripled \nover the last forty years, from just over 5 million in 1960 to more \nthan 17 million today. The United States leads the world in fatherless \nfamilies and too many kids spend their lives without any contact with \ntheir fathers. The consequences of this dramatic decrease in the \ninvolvement of fathers in the lives of their children are severe. When \nfathers are absent from their lives, children are: five times more \nlikely to live in poverty, twice as likely to commit crime, more likely \nto bring weapons and drugs into the classroom, twice as likely to drop \nout of school, twice as likely to be abused, more likely to commit \nsuicide, over twice as likely to abuse alcohol or drugs, and more \nlikely to become pregnant as teenagers.\n  Community efforts have sprung up around the country to stem the \nrising tide of fatherless families and encourage responsible parenting. \nToday I am introducing the Responsible Fatherhood Act of 1999 with \nSenators Domenici, Lincoln, Lieberman, Landrieu, Graham, Lugar, \nVoinovich, Robb, Breaux, Edwards, and Bingaman. This bill is a fiscally \nresponsible approach that will provide support to states and \ncommunities to promote responsible fatherhood.\n  Specifically, our bill would do three things. First it would raise \nawareness about the importance of responsible fatherhood by authorizing \na public awareness campaign, designed by states and communities, to \nhelp change attitudes, particularly among young men, about the \nresponsibilities that go with fathering a child. Second, our \nlegislation creates a block grant program expanding responsible \nfatherhood promotion programs at the state and local level. The grants \nwould be supplemented by funds and involvement from state and local \ngovernment, civic, charitable, non-profit and faith-based \norganizations. Finally, the bill changes existing federal law to \nencourage a stronger connection between fathers and their children \nthrough increased child support to families and more available training \nthrough the Welfare-to-Work program for low-income fathers.\n  Congress alone cannot solve this problem. However, I believe this \nbill represents an important first step toward reversing the rising \ntide of fatherlessness in this country. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis important initiative.\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I \nrise today with Senator Bayh to introduce the Responsible Fatherhood \nAct of 1999.\n  Even on its best day the government can never be a replacement for a \nloving two parent family. As the father of eight I cherish the moments \nI have spent and will spend with my children because they are my best \nfriends.\n  But sadly, there is a growing trend among American children, they are \ngrowing up without the love and guidance of their fathers and in many \ncases these children are going years without seeing their fathers.\n  This trend has taken a terrible toll on not only our children and \nfamilies, but our nation as a whole. For instance in my home state of \nNew Mexico over 24 percent of families do not have fathers present in \nthe home.\n  Nationally, the numbers are not any better; nearly 25 million \nchildren or 36 percent of all kids live without their biological father \nand since 1960 the number of children living without their father has \njumped from 5 million to 17 million. Additionally, about 40 percent of \nthese children have not seen their father in the last year.\n  I cannot think of two more important issues facing our nation than \nthe dual goal of promoting marriage and responsible fatherhood. I \nbelieve you could describe the role parents play in the lives of their \nchildren in the following way: providing love, guidance, and \ndiscipline; while at the same time teaching about respect, honor, duty \nand the values that make our nation so great.\n  And while we all acknowledge the positive benefits of a two parent \nfamily these are more and more families where fathers simply are not \npresent in the lives of their children. I would submit this is a \ntragedy because a child growing up without a father or a mother simply \nmisses out on something very special.\n  I recently came across a quotation that I think is appropriate: ``it \nis a wise father that knows his own child.'' However, the exact \nopposite is now occurring with a growing trend towards absentee \nfathers.\n  The bill we are introducing today seeks to reverse this trend by \nproviding states and communities with support for the dual goal of \npromoting marriage and responsible fatherhood.\n  Specifically, the bill: authorizes a public awareness campaign to \npromote responsible fatherhood and the formation and maintenance of \nmarried two parent families.\n  Additionally, our bill creates a responsible parenting block program \nto provide support for state and local governments, nonprofit, \ncharitable and religious organizations' efforts to promote responsible \nfatherhood and the formation and maintenance of married two parent \nfamilies at the state and local level.\n  The final component of the bill changes existing Federal law to \nencourage a stronger connection between fathers and children through \nincreased child support to families and more available training through \nthe Welfare-\n\n[[Page S8508]]\n\nto-Work program for low-income non-custodial fathers. There is one \nprovision within this component I would like to specifically focus on \nand that is the State option to disregard child support collected for \npurposes of determining eligibility for, or amount of, TANF assistance.\n  While it is the intent of this section to allow States to disregard \ncertain child support collected that amount is also limited only to \ncases where states have chosen to pass-through up to $75 of child \nsupport payments per month directly to the family and then only that \n$75 may be disregarded by states.\n  In closing, I want to encourage my colleagues to lend their support \nto this important issue and Senator Bayh, I very much look forward to \nworking with you on this exciting piece of legislation.\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, our society is suffering from \nthe deterioration of the married, two-parent family. According to a \nrecent report by the National Marriage Project at Rutgers, ``The State \nof Our Unions: The Social Health of Marriage in America,'' marriage \nrates are at a 40-year low and there are fewer social forces holding \nthem together. As the number of marriages has declined, unwed births \nhave dramatically grown. Unfortunately, the result is more and more \nchildren are being born into fragile families.\n  As the report states, ``Marriage is a fundamental social institution \n. . . It is the `social glue' that reliably attaches fathers to \nchildren.'' Nearly 25 million children, more than 1 out of 3, live \nabsent their biological father, and 17 million kids live without a \nfather of any kind. Even more troubling, about 40 percent of the \nchildren living in fatherless households have not seen their fathers in \nat least a year, and 50 percent of children who do not live with their \nfathers have never stepped foot in their father's home.\n  This growing problem of father absence is taking a terrible toll on \nthose children, who are being denied the love, guidance, discipline, \nemotional nourishment and financial support that fathers usually \nprovide.\n  Parents act as a nurturing and stable foundation for children. They \nare a guiding force to which children readily open their arms. In a \nrecent poll conducted by Nickelodeon and Time magazine, three-quarters \nof the children, ages six to 14, polled stated that they wished they \ncould spend more time with their parents. In addition, kids \nconsistently ranked parents at the very top of the list when asked to \nname the people they look up to.\n  More than friends or teachers, parents shape their children's value \nsystems. As dads disappear, the American family is becoming \nsignificantly weaker, as are the values we depend on families to \ntransmit. In turn, the risks to the health and well-being of children \nare becoming significantly higher. Social science research repeatedly \nshows that children growing up without fathers are far more likely to \nlive in poverty, to fail in school, experience behavioral and emotional \nproblems, develop drug and alcohol problems, commit suicide, and \nexperience physical abuse and neglect.\n  We have seen the devastating results of this breakdown in our culture \nas the number of violent incidences among young males, in particular, \nrises. Statistics reveal that violent criminals are overwhelmingly \nmales who grew up without fathers.\n  Concerned citizens and grass-roots groups are paying attention to the \nstatistics, and they are actively seeking solutions neighborhood by \nneighborhood across the nation. A shining example of this united effort \nis the National Fatherhood Initiative (NFI) which was formed to help \nraise awareness of the problem of father absence and its consequences \nand to mobilize a national response to it. To date, the NFI has made \ntremendous progress, working in communities across the country to set \nup educational programs and promote responsible fatherhood.\n  There are limits to what we in government and here in Congress can do \nto change society's attitudes toward marriage and out-of-wedlock \nbirths, but we are not powerless. I am proud to sign on to the proposal \nintroduced by my colleagues Senators Evan Bayh and Pete Domenici, ``The \nResppnsible Fatherhood Act of 1999,'' that will help strengthen fragile \nfamilies and promote responsible fatherhood, as well as promote the \nformation and maintenance of married, two-parent families.\n  I would like to highlight a few key provisions that will \nsignificantly increase efforts at the state and local level to \nreconnect fathers and families, thereby ensuring a brighter, more \nsecure future for our youth.\n  Unfortunately, few television shows and movies produced today \nhighlight the value of marriage. Cohabitation and out-of-wedlock sex \nare handled so casually that young people see little incentive for \nmarriage. This bipartisan legislation authorizes a challenge grant to \nencourage states and local communities to initiate media campaigns that \npromote responsible fatherhood and the importance of a married, two-\nparent family in a child's life. Rather than the typical barrage of \nnegative images, young people need to see positive messages on \nfatherhood and marriage.\n  States, localities and community organizations are already helping \nlead the fight at the local level for responsible fatherhood. Their \nefforts must be bolstered, not hindered. This proposal authorizes a \nResponsible Parenting Block Grant to provide support for state and \nlocal government, nonprofit, charitable and religious organizations' \nefforts.\n  No one solution exists that will reconnect fathers and families, but \na combined effort can make a difference. That is why a national \nclearinghouse would be established to facilitate the exchange of ideas \nand sharing of success stories. Such a clearinghouse also would produce \nand distribute resources to aid those leading the charge at the \ncommunity level. The National Fatherhood Initiative has been \nhighlighted as an exemplary group to house such a clearinghouse.\n  Although many fathers desire to make a financial contribution to \ntheir family, they are unable to because they lack the necessary skills \nto obtain jobs. In 1997, Congress passed Welfare to Work legislation to \nhelp the hardest-to-employ welfare recipients and low-income, non-\ncustodial parents move into jobs. Unfortunately, many states have not \nbeen able to use their full funding because of restrictive federal \nguidelines. The Responsible Fatherhood Act will provide states and \ncities the flexibility they need to serve a broader group of low-\nincome, non-custodial fathers, and provide services to increase the \nemployment and parenting skills of eligible fathers.\n  Under the current system, fathers with children on welfare are \ndiscouraged from paying child support as payments are instead typically \nshifted to state agencies to offset welfare benefits. Research \ndemonstrates that fathers are more connected with their children and \nmore likely to pay child support when they believe their payment is \ngoing directly to their family, and not the government. Children on \nwelfare are precisely the children who have been identified as group \nmost in need of father involvement, and we should eliminate any \nbarriers that prevent this critical bond from taking place. Therefore, \nthis legislation would establish the federal government as a partner to \nstates that want to exercise an option to pass-through up to $75 of \nchild support payments per month directly to the family without \nimpacting welfare eligibility.\n  Implementing new innovative fatherhood initiatives should not be a \nrigorous, burdensome process. States should have the flexibility to use \nchild-support funds on programs that support and promote fatherhood \ninstead of paying funds back to TANF. Getting fathers back to work and \nreconnected to their families will do more to move families off of \nwelfare permanently.\n  The Responsible Fatherhood Act of 1999, I believe, marks a major \nturning point in the politics of the family as is evidenced by the \nsolid bipartisan consensus coalescing behind this proposal. Promoting \nresponsible fatherhood does not take away from the efforts of single \nmothers, but helps ensure that children receive the benefits provided \nby two caring parents. Addressing the critical role fathers play in the \nlives of their children is no longer a politically taboo topic. The \nresearch is convincing and, unfortunately, mounting every year--\nchildren need the support and involvement of both parents to lead \nhappy, healthy, productive lives.\n  I thank Senators Bayh and Domenici for leading this effort. I am \nproud to join them as a cosponsor.\n\n[[Page S8509]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (by request):\n  S. 1365.

Also enclosed is a section-by-section \n     analysis of the bill. We recommend that the bill be \n     introduced, referred to the appropriate committee for \n     consideration, and enacted.\n       The enclosed bill would amend the Historic Preservation Act \n     of 1966 to extend the authorization of $150,000,000 for the \n     Historic Preservation Fund through the year 2005. The fund is \n     currently authorized at $150,000,000 per year through 1997. \n     In addition, the enclosed bill would amend the 1966 Act to \n     extend the current authorization of $4,000,000 for the \n     Advisory Council on Historic Preservation through 2005. The \n     Counsel's authorization expires at the end of fiscal year \n     2000.\n       The Historic Preservation Act of 1966 provides for the \n     protection of significant historic properties across the \n     country. It encourages and supports America's effort to \n     preserve the tangible evidence of our past for the benefit \n     and enjoyment of future generations. As part of the National \n     Historic Preservation Act, Congress established the Historic \n     Preservation Fund to carry out the provisions of the bill.\n       The purpose of this measure is to continue this successful \n     program of protecting historic structures and sites. For over \n     30 years, since the passage of the National Historic \n     Preservation Act, private citizens, industry, Federal, state, \n     local and tribal governments have worked together to create a \n     cost-effective, successful program. These unique partnerships \n     have resulted in the preservation of historic places, which \n     are the tangible embodiment of American history.\n       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there \n     is no objection to the enactment of the enclosed draft \n     legislation from the standpoint of the Administration's \n     program.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                          Stephen C.

The majority of this \n     acreage is the historical zone of the historic site and \n     therefore unavailable for the development of visitor service \n     facilities, parking, administrative offices and facilities, \n     or new exhibition space. The enlarged boundary would allow \n     for the development of such facilities. The current natural \n     areas that are part of the site would be protected with the \n     addition of adjacent property and the viewshed from the \n     historic area would also be protected.\n       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there \n     is no objection to the enactment of the enclosed draft \n     legislation from the standpoint of the Administration's \n     program.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Donald J.

A bill to amend the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources \nPlanning Act of 1974 and related laws to strengthen the protection of \nnative biodiversity and ban clearcutting on Federal land, and to \ndesignate certain Federal land as ancient forests, roadless areas, \nwatershed protection areas, special areas, and Federal boundary areas \nwhere logging and other intrusive activities are prohibited; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                   the act to save america's forests\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, today, Senator Kerry and I are \nintroducing the Act to Save America's Forests. When this country was \nfounded over two hundred years ago, there were hundreds of millions of \nacres of virgin forest land across what is now the United States. \nToday, 95 percent of those original virgin forests have been cut down.\n  Our Federal forests are unique and precious public assets. Large, \nunbroken forest watersheds provide high-quality water supplies for \ndrinking, agriculture, industry, as well as habitat for recreational \nand commercial fisheries and other wildlife. The large scale \ndestruction of natural forests threatens other industries such as \ntourism and fishing with job loss. As a legacy for the enjoyment, \nknowledge, and well-being of future generations, provisions must be \nmade for the protection and perpetuation of America's forests.\n  Clearcutting, even aged logging practices, and timber road \nconstruction have been the preferred management practices used on our \nFederal forests in recent years. These practices have caused widespread \nforest ecosystem fragmentation and degradation. The result is species \nextinction, soil erosion, flooding, declining water quality, \ndiminishing commercial and sport fisheries, including salmon, and \nmudslides. Mudslides in Western forest regions during recent winter \nflooding have caused millions of dollars of environmental and property \ndamage, and resulted in several deaths.\n  An environmentally sustainable alternative to these practices is \nselection management: the selection system involves the removal of \ntrees of different ages either singly or in small groups in order to \npreserve the biodiversity of the forest.\n  Destructive forestry practices such as clearcutting on Federal lands \nwas legalized by the passage of the National Forest Management Act of \n1976. From 1984 to 1991, an average of 243,000 acres were clearcut \nannually on Federal lands. During the same time period an average of \nonly 33,000 acres were harvested using the protective selection \nmanagement practices. Pro-clearcutting interpretations of forestry laws \nhave also been used by Federal managers to promote even age logging and \nroad construction. In addition, the laws are not effective in \npreserving our forests because in many cases judges do not allow \ncitizens standing in court to ensure that the Forest Service or other \nagencies follow the environmental protections of the law.\n  I am introducing this legislation to halt and reverse the effects of \ndeforestation on Federal lands by ending the practice of clearcutting, \nwhile promoting environmentally compatible and economically sustainable \nselection management logging. It is important to note this legislation \nwould only apply to Federal forests which are currently supplying less \nthan 6 percent of America's timber consumption. According to a recent \nCongressional Research Service report we can reduce timber supply from \nthe national forests and still meet our nation's timber needs. The vast \nmajority of the 490 million acres of harvestable timber are privately \nowned and unaffected by the bill.\n  This legislation puts forward positive alternatives that will achieve \ntwo principal policies for our Federal forests. First, the Act would \nban logging and road-building in remaining core areas of biodiversity \nthroughout the Federal forest system including roadless areas, \nspecially designated areas and 13 million acres of Northwest Ancient \nForests. Second, in non-core areas it would abolish environmentally \ndestructive forms of logging such as clearcutting and even aged \nlogging.\n  The Act requires selection management logging practices to be used. \nTherefore, timber companies would only be allowed to log a certain \npercentage of the forests over specified periods of time. Further it \ntakes extra\n\n[[Page S8511]]\n\nsteps to protect watersheds and fisheries by prohibiting logging in \nbuffer areas along streams, lakes, and wetlands. The Act would also \ncall for an independent panel of scientists to develop a plan to \nrestore and rejuvenate those forests and their ecosystems that are \ndamaged from decades of these logging practices. And finally, the \nlegislation would empower citizen involvement in insuring compliance \nwith environmental protections of forest management laws by making \ncertain that all citizens have standing to pursue actions in \ncourt.\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to speak for a few minutes \ntoday in support of the Act to Save America's Forests. Over the past \n200 years, 95 percent of America's forests have been logged. The Act to \nSave America's Forests is an effort to save the remaining 5 percent of \nthese original forests.\n  The legislation is based on our best science and recognizes that we \ncan preserve our national forests for future generations and still \nharvest the renewable resource of timber. It is supported by over 600 \nscientists, who wrote to Congress that the act will ``give our nation's \nprecious forest ecosystems the best chance for survival and recovery \ninto the 21st century and beyond.''\n  The truth is, this bill represents a prudent approach. It has been \ncriticized by those who want to ban all logging on national lands and \nby those who feel that our current forest policy is too restrictive. I \nam optimistic that it will bring opposing sides together around common \nprogress.\n  The Act to Save America's Forests will protect some of the most \ntreasured wild lands in America. Millions of Americans visit our \nnational forests every year, generating more than $100 billion for \nlocal economies. In our forests, families hike, fish, boat, mountain \nclimb, bird watch ad even dog sled. And, they act as watersheds and are \nhome to rare species.\n  In Oregon, our national forests have trees over 1,000 years old. The \nSequoia National Forest in California is home to the world's oldest \ntrees. These are true natural--and national--treasures.\n  In New England, we have the Green Mountain and White Mountain \nNational Forests. Only 100 miles from Boston, they are home to Mt. \nWashington, the Old Main of the Mountain and the Appalachian Trail. \nThese are favorite spots for our citizens to back-pack, ski, canoe, \nkayak and witness the fall foliage.\n  The remaining unbroken forests in the Green Mountain draw wildlife \nfrom great distances, such as migratory song birds from central and \nSouth America. The Lamb Brook, Glastenbury and Robert Frost Mountain \nforests, which are threatened with clearcut logging, are critical \nhabitat for New England's black bear population, who needs these remote \nareas of solitude to breed and forage. The Act to Save America's \nForests would permanently protect these forests and their biodiversity \nfrom logging or roadbuilding.\n  Today, there are 490 million acres of harvestable timberlands in the \nUnited States. Only approximately 20 percent of this harvestable \ntimberland, some 98 million acres, are owned by the Federal Government \nand would be impacted by the Act to Save America's Forests. The \nremaining 80 percent of the harvestable timberland is on private land, \nand would not be regulated by the Act to Save America's Forests.\n  The major provisions of the Act to Save America's Forests will ban \nlogging and road building of any kind in 13 million acres of ``core'' \nnational forest. Core forests include ancient forest and biologically \nsignificant and roadless areas. Only environmentally compatible, \nsustainable logging would be permitted outside of the protected core \nforest areas. Clearcutting and even age logging would be banned on all \nfederal lands. The Act will protect watersheds and fisheries by \nprohibiting logging within 300-foot buffer areas along streams and \nlakes. It directs the Federal agencies to protect and restore native \nbiological diversity. Finally, it establishes a panel of scientists to \nprovide guidance on Federal forest management.\n  I want to thank Senator Torricelli for introducing this legislation \nand Representative Anna Eshoo for offering similar legislation in the \nHouse of Representatives. I strongly support this effort to balance our \nneed to preserve and restore our national forests while allowing for \nthe harvest of the renewable resource these forests provide.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. \n        Schumer, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Dodd, and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 1369. A bill to enhance the benefits of the national electric \nsystem by encouraging and supporting State programs for renewable \nenergy sources, universal electric service, affordable electric \nservice, and energy conservation and efficiency, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                        Clean Energy Act of 1999\n\n  Mr. Jeffords. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Clean \nEnergy Act of 1999, for myself and Senators Lieberman, Moynihan, \nSchumer, Kerry, Lautenberg, Dodd, and Kennedy.\n  Air pollution from dirty power plants threatens the health of lakes, \nforests, and people across our Nation. Today, we call for an end to \ncode red air pollution alerts, smog filled afternoons and chemical \ninduced haze. Today, we will introduce legislation to protect our \nenvironment from the damaging effects of air pollution and move our \nNation closer to a sensible energy future.\n  Why should we live with smog, acid rain and code red summer \nafternoons when the technology is here to capture the sun and wind in \nour backyard? It is time for our Nation to transition from smokestacks, \ncoal power and smog to a future with windmills, solar power and blue \nskies. Like the wall in Berlin, we hope to watch the dirty power plants \ndismantled brick, by brick, knowing that once again we can breath \nfreely.\n  As the U.S. PIRG report indicates, air pollution produced from dirty \npower plants has skyrocketed. With recent wholesale deregulation, coal \nfired power plants increased their output almost 16%. This has got to \nend.\n  Electric utility deregulation has the potential to save consumers \nmillions of dollars in energy costs. At the same time, deregulation can \nmove us away from reliance on dirty fossil fuels. A study by the Union \nof Concerned Scientists showed that we can decrease electricity prices \nby 13% while still achieving great public and environmental benefits.\n  Electricity prices in the Northeast are double those in the Midwest. \nUnder current law, old, dirty coal fired power plants in the Midwest \nare exempt from the same air quality standards that our plants meet. \nTheir emissions settle into our streams, forests, eyes, and lungs. They \nget the benefit, we get the cost.\n  Not anymore. Our bill will level the playing field for clean \nNortheast utility companies. It will knock dirty upwind coal burners \nout of the competitive arena. It will give our utilities the ability to \ncompete successfully in deregulated markets.\n  Our proposal will cap emissions from generation facilities, forcing \nold coal plants to meet tighter air quality standards or shut down. We \nattack pollutants that lead to smog, acid rain, mercury contamination \nand ground-level ozone.\n  Our bill will put in place a nation-wide wires charge to create an \nelectric benefit fund to develop renewable energy sources and promote \nenergy efficiency and universal access. It will mandate that generation \nfacilities purchase increasing percentages of renewable power each \nyear. We begin at 2.5% in 2000 and increase to 20% renewables by 2020. \nEither buy renewables, or don't play in the market place.\n  Our legislation will make it cheaper and easier for consumers to \ninstall renewable energy sources in their homes, farms, and small \nbusinesses by simplifying the metering process. And finally, our bill \nhas a comprehensive disclosure provision, giving consumers honest and \nverifiable information regarding their energy choices.\n  Our Nation's future depends on clean, reliable energy. We can end \ndirty air from tall utility smokestacks. We can capture the global \nmarket for renewable energy. We can stop acid rain from killing our \nforests and we can keep our summer days from being ozone days. We can \nincrease our energy security. And we can do all this while saving \nconsumers millions of dollars on their utility bills.\n\n[[Page S8512]]\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join with my \ndistinguished colleague from Vermont to introduce the Clean Energy Act \nof 1999. This landmark legislation provides a comprehensive, long-term \nblueprint for fulfilling the promise of fishable rivers, swimable \nstreams, and clean, breathable air as envisioned by the ground-breaking \nClean Water and Clean Air Acts.\n  As Senator Jeffords has explained, the Clean Energy Act would reduce \nemissions of the full range of pollutants that damage human health and \nthe global environment. The public health standards embodied in this \nbill are ambitious. But they reflect the significant strides \nNortheastern utilities have made in recent years to reduce pollution \nfrom electric power plants. They also reflect the reality that goals \ncan, and must, be achieved regionally and nationally if we are to \nensure clean air and clean water for every community.\n  As utilities invest in control technologies to help them meet \nexisting and future clean air requirements, they face difficult \nchoices. Some technologies control for one pollutant, while \nexacerbating emissions of another and often utilities make large \ncapital investments without knowing what pollutant reductions may be \nrequired of them in the future. The Clean Energy Act will bring order \nto the equation by providing a comprehensive but flexible guide for \ncontrolling the full range of pollutants associated with electricity \ngeneration, including nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide, mercury, and \ncarbon.\n  The Clean Energy Act will help reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides \nthat lead to smog that makes it difficult for children, asthmatics, and \nthe elderly to breathe. It will help reduce acid rain by reducing the \namount of sulphur that our smokestacks pump into the air.\n  The bill will accelerate efforts to make the fish in rivers safe to \neat by lowering the amount of mercury introduced into the food chain. \nAnd it will help reduce the U.S. contribution to the problem of climate \nchange by recognizing carbon dioxide as a pollutant of the global \natmosphere.\n  Last year, I introduced a bill designed to close a loophole in the \nClean Air Act that exempts older power plants from rigorous \nenvironmental standards. We know that to ensure fairness in an era of \nincreasing competitiveness, we must strengthen pollution controls so \nthat dirty power plants don't gain an unfair share of the market while \npolluting at higher rates than cleaner, more efficient utilities. The \nClean Energy Act builds on the effort begun last year, by requiring all \nplants, no matter what their vintage, to meet the same standards.\n  Electricity deregulation carries the promise of enormous benefits for \nthe consumer--mainly in reduced electric bills--which I strongly \nsupport. But electricity deregulation can also cause adverse \nenvironmental and public health consequences if we don't do it right.\n  The principles behind the Clean Energy Act--comprehensive control of \npollutants and equitable across-the-board standards, enhanced by \nemissions trading--provide a vision for how the electricity industry \nand our economy can grow even as we improve the quality of our air and \nwater for generations to come.\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to make a few remarks \nin support of the Clean Energy Act of 1999.\n  There is a strong consensus in Congress, and throughout the nation, \nthat it is time to restructure our electric utility industry. The \ndriving force behind this consensus is the potential to save working \nfamilies and businesses billions of dollars in their electricity bills \nas competition replaces regulated markets and drives down costs.\n  The Clinton Administration has estimated that the nation may save as \nmuch as $20 billion through restructuring, and other estimates are even \nhigher. Some twenty states, including Massachusetts, have already acted \nto bring competition to their state industry and capture these savings.\n  In addition to saving billions of dollars, electric utility \nrestructuring also presents us with the opportunity to enhance \nenvironmental protections. The Clean Energy Act of 1999 advances \nenvironmental goals that I believe should be considered as part of the \nfinal electric utility restructuring proposal passed by the Senate--and \nthat is why I am an original cosponsor.\n  I know that some in Congress have argued that we should not include \nenvironmental protections in a utility restructuring proposal. I think \nthat would be a grave mistake, because some--by no means all--power \nplants are the source of too much pollution to be ignored.\n  In Massachusetts, for example, five power plants release more than 90 \npercent of the pollution from power plants in the state. If each of \nthese plants met modern standards, it would reduce as much pollution as \ntaking more than 750,000 cars off the road. And, while Massachusetts \nstruggles with some of these dirty plants, many more can be found in \nthe Midwest and other parts of the nation.\n  The consequences of this pollution are significant. In the Northeast \nwe experience frequent and widespread violations of national health \nstandards for ozone. Long-term exposure to ozone may increase the \nincidence of respiratory disease and premature aging of the lungs. Acid \ndeposition, whose source may be plants far outside of the Northeast, \ndegrades public health and damages aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. \nMercury, which is highly poisonous, accumulates in aquatic species. \nFinally, carbon dioxide pollution continues to accumulate in the \natmosphere and increase the potential for destructive and irreversible \nclimate change.\n  The Clean Energy Act of 1999 would put in place important public \nhealth and environmental policies. Most importantly, it would level the \nplaying field by requiring old, heavily-polluting power plants that are \nnow exempt from health and environmental standards, to clean up. This \nis important for New England, because while many of these plants are \nlocated in the Midwest, their pollution is carried through weather \npatterns to our air, forests, lakes, streams and lungs.\n  We should close this loophole. Many energy companies have achieved \nenvironmental improvements, and those achievements should not be \nminimized, but the fact remains that electricity generation from old, \nheavily-polluting power plants increased 15.8 percent from 1992 to \n1998, nationwide.\n  I want to add that I have heard from the citizens of Massachusetts \nwho live around old coal and oil plants that pollute far more than \nnewer plants. They feel strongly that all plants should comply with \nenvironmental standards and employ the best environmental technology, \nand that no family should be forced to live in the shadows of a plant \nthat may cause environmental harm.\n  In addition to having tougher standards and closing loopholes in \ncurrent law, the Act would require the Environmental Protection Agency \nto review any plant that emits excessive pollution through pollution \npermit trading to determine whether it is causing adverse local \nenvironmental and health impacts. As a result, the bill allows for \nrobust trading so that we can capture all of its economic and broader \nenvironmental benefits, but only when it does not harm local \ncommunities.\n  Finally, other provisions of the Act will benefit the environment and \nmake the U.S. a leader in clean energy technologies. For example, it \nwould require that a percentage of the Nation's power is generated by \nsolar, wind and other renewable sources. For years we have given \nheavily-polluting plants a free ride. Now it is time to reverse course \nand create a market force to bolster our renewable energy technologies \nso that we will have a growing clean power industry as we start the \n21st Century.\n  I thank Senator Jeffords for introducing the Clean Energy Act of \n1999, and I am pleased to join Senators Lieberman, Moynihan, Schumer, \nKennedy, Dodd, and Lautenberg as an original cosponsor. I hope this \nlegislation will help shape the Senate debate over utility \nrestructuring and ensure that provisions to protect the environment and \nthe public health will be part of the final legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SHELBY:\n  S. 1370. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nthe time for payment of the estate tax on certain timber stands; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n[[Page S8513]]\n\n           TIMBERLAND CONSERVATION AND TAX RELIEF ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I recently introduced legislation that \nwould amend our estate taxation laws to correct a highly unjust \nsituation that regularly occurs throughout our country. The problem I \nam referring to is the difficult situation persons who inherit valuable \ntimberland often find themselves. Because the timberland is usually the \nmajor estate asset, the estate frequently lacks the liquidity to pay \nthe hefty tax burden. Therefore, many times persons are forced to \nharvest the timber or even worse, to sell portions of the land, just to \nbe able to meet this large tax liability.\n  Besides essentially invalidating many testamentary gifts, such a tax \npolicy creates numerous economic and ecological problems. As estate \ntaxes are due nine months after a decedent's death, the current law \nstrongly encourages persons to harvest the timber regardless of it's \nmaturity, prevailing price or demand. Encouraging such behavior not \nonly leads to economic waste, but also discourages responsible use of a \nvalued natural resource. The decision of if and when to harvest \ntimberlands should be made by the individual landowner after he has \nconsidered the current market, tree maturity and other relevant \nfactors. It certainly should not be based on an uncompromising tax code \nthat completely disregards these critical factors.\n  Mr. President, the decision to sell the land is in no way a viable \nalternative to premature harvesting. Selling portions of a contiguous \ntract leads to fragmentation of the land, which in turn can lead to \nlegal disputes and other inefficiencies. Furthermore, wildlife and \nforestry conservation efforts by earlier landowners are often ignored \nby new owners who look to exploit the land in order to turn a quick \nprofit. But most importantly, our tax code should never place someone \nin a position where they must sell a testamentary gift just to be able \nto pay the taxes on the transfer. Besides being inherently unfair, such \na tax tramples upon the property rights of American landowners.\n  Mr. President, we must not allow the tax code to perpetuate these \ninjustices. My bill, the Timberland Conservation and Tax Relief Act of \n1999 eliminates these problems by removing mechanical and unthinking \ntax laws from the decision of when it appropriate to harvest American \ntimberlands. It introduces a flexible deferred payment provision into \nthe estate taxation scheme that will allow timberland owners to \nexercise their own good judgment in deciding what the most efficient \nuse of their land would be. Furthermore, the Timberland Conservation \nand Tax Relief Act promotes the responsible use of our environment by \nno longer placing persons in a position where they must harvest \nimmature or unneeded timber. For these reasons, I strongly urge my \ncolleagues in the Senate to join me in support of this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1370\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

TRANSMISSION OF ENROLLED RESOLUTION.\n\n       The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit an enrolled copy \n     of this resolution to the United States women's soccer team.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I submit a resolution in honor of \nthe Women's World Cup Soccer Champions, the U.S. Women's Soccer Team.\n  From the first game of the Women's World Cup in New Jersey, which was \nplayed before a sold-out crowd, to the final game at the Rose Bowl \nfilled with 90,185 screaming fans, setting the women's sports record \nfor attendance, this U.S. Women's Soccer Team has inspired us all. The \nU.S. Women's Soccer Team had an outstanding run during the 1999 Women's \nWorld Cup which culminated in an amazing victory against the Chinese in \nthe final game.\n  After 120 minutes of exciting soccer, the game came down to a shoot-\nout where the U.S. Women's Team prevailed 5 to 4 to become the \nchampions. From Briana Scurry's game winning save to the nail-biting \nseconds before Brandi Chastain made the winning goal, they had us all \nsitting on the edge of our chairs.\n  As a former Olympic athlete, I know the dedication and determination \nthat these women must have in order to achieve this tremendous \naccomplishment. I want to point out that every member of this team \neither has a college degree or is pursuing one. I can't think of better \nrole models for today's youth than this World Cup Team.\n  I want to congratulate and recognize each and every member of this \nteam and I ask unanimous consent that their names and the resolution be \nprinted in the Record. I would also like to thank my good friend and \nformer Olympian Donna de Varona, the Chairwoman of the Women's World \nCup, for her hard work and dedication to ensure that women's soccer is \nfinally given the recognition it deserves. I urge my colleagues to join \nin strong support of passage of this resolution.\n  There being no objection, the names were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                        U.S. Women's Soccer Team\n\n       Michelle Akers, Brandi Chastain, Tracy Ducar, Lorrie Fair, \n     Joy Fawcett, Danielle Fotopoulos, Julie Foudy, Mia Hamm, \n     Kristine Lilly, Shannon MacMillan, Tiffeny Milbrett, Carla \n     Overbeck, Cindy Parlow, Christie Pearce, Tiffany Roberts, \n     Briana Scurry, Kate Sobrero, Tisha Venturini, Saskia Webber, \n     Sara Whalen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/14/senate-section/article/S8516-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8516-S8521]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS ACT OF 1999\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 SNOWE (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 1241\n\n  Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Crapo, Ms. \nCollins, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Murkowski, and Mr. DeWine) proposed an \namendment to amendment No. 1239 proposed by Mr. Dodd to the bill (S. \n1344) to amend the Public Health Service Act, the Employee Retirement \nIncome Security Act of 1974, and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nprotect consumers in managed care plans and other health coverage; as \nfollows:\n\n       Strike section 152 of the bill, and insert the following:\n\n     WOMEN'S HEALTH AND CANCER RIGHTS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1999''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the offering and operation of health plans affect \n     commerce among the States;\n       (2) health care providers located in a State serve patients \n     who reside in the State and patients who reside in other \n     States; and\n       (3) in order to provide for uniform treatment of health \n     care providers and patients among the States, it is necessary \n     to cover health plans operating in 1 State as well as health \n     plans operating among the several States.\n       (c) Amendments to ERISA.--\n       (1) In general.--Subpart B of part 7 of subtitle B of title \n     I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as \n     amended by section 301, is further amended by adding at the \n     end the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 715.

Mr. President, I am offering an amendment which \nwould help one of our most vulnerable populations, our children, by \naddressing the growing problem of HMOs denying insurance coverage of \nreconstructive surgery for kids suffering from physical defects and \ndeformities. This amendment would require medical plans to cover the \nmedical procedures to reconstruct a child's appearance if they are born \nwith abnormal structures of the body, including a cleft lip or palate.\n  Today, approximately seven percent of American children are born with \npediatric deformities and congenital defects such as cleft lip, cleft \npalate, missing external limbs, such as ears, and other facial \ndeformities. Unfortunately, it has become commonplace for insurance \ncompanies to label these medical procedures as cosmetic surgery and \ndeny coverage to help these children eradicate or reduce deformities \nand acquire a normal appearance.\n  In fact, a recent survey of the American Society of Plastic and \nReconstructive Surgeons indicated that over half of the plastic \nsurgeons questioned have had a pediatric patient in the last two years \nwho has been denied, or experienced tremendous difficulty in obtaining, \ninsurance coverage for there surgical procedures.\n  I find it disgraceful that many insurance companies claim that \nreconstructive procedures are not medically necessary and are therefor \ncosmetic. These companies claim that medical services restoring some \nsemblance of a normal appearance are superfluous and performed merely \nfor vanity or cosmetic purposes. Many of my colleagues may be wondering \nhow such a ludicrous and cruel practice can occur when it seems obvious \nthat these procedures are clearly reconstructive and not cosmetic in \nnature. While an insurance plan may attempt to claim that helping a \nchild born without ears or with a cleft so severe it extends to her \nhairline is superfluous surgery, I adamantly disagree and am committed \nto stopping the abhorrent practice.\n  The medical and developmental complications which arise from many of \nthese conditions are tremendous. Speech impediments, hearing \ndifficulties and dental problems are a few of\n\n[[Page S8526]]\n\nthe physical side effects which may result from a child's physical \ndeformity. In addition, the effect a child's deformities may have on \ntheir personal development, confidence, self-esteem and their future \naspirations and achievements are often very far reaching.\n  A healthy self image is vitally important to develop self esteem and \nconfidence. How a person sees themselves, and how others see them, \ndetermines how the person feels about himself and defines whether he \nhas the strength to resist unfortunate obstacles, including the \ntaunting of peer and disengagement from school activities. As parents, \nwe want our children to be armed with a healthy sense of self esteem \nand confidence. The best way to guarantee that happens is to help them \ndevelop a strong and health self image. While this is critical, we must \nbe pragmatic and recognize that we live in a society which places a \nhigh value on physical beauty and often unfairly uses it as a \nmeasurement of a person's worth, ability or potential in society. While \nthis is wrong and we must work together to instill self-worth in our \nchildren, it is unrealistic to not recognize the importance which is \nplace on physical appearances in our world and the unfair obstacles \nwhich children born with deformities face if they are not provided \naccess medical services which help them attain a normal physical \nappearance.\n  Some of my colleagues may know that my daughter Bridget, whom Cindy \nand I adopted from Mother Theresa's orphanage in Bangladesh, was born \nwith a severe cleft. We are fortunate to have had the means and \nopportunities to provide the expert medical care necessary to help \nBridget physically and emotionally. However, we, too, encountered \nnumerous obstacles and denials by our insurance providers who did not \nbelieve that Bridget's medical treatment was necessary. Fortunately, \nCindy and I were able to provide Bridget access to the reconstructive \nservices she needs, despite denials by our health plan. Unfortunately, \nmost hard working American families are not so fortunate. This is not \nright and it is why I am offering this important amendment to assist \nall American children.\n  I want to stress that this is not a new mandate which could cause \nhealth care premiums to escalate. What I am proposing simply prohibits \nplans from frivolously ruling that substantial, medically needed \nreconstructive surgery for children to obtain a relatively normal \nappearance is cosmetic, or denying reconstructive coverage which \nAmerican families have purchases. I urge each of my colleagues to work \nwith me on behalf of our children and ensure that they are afforded an \nopportunity to realize their full potential.\n\n                           Amendment No. 1248\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

Mr. President, I rise to congratulate a courageous \nWorld War I veteran from my home state of Maine who on Friday will be \nawarded the most prestigious honor that France bestows, the National \nOrder of the Legion of Honor.\n  Everett McKenney who has lived in Augusta and Waterville will receive \nthis distinguished honor for the tremendous sacrifices he made to \nsafeguard freedom and democracy while serving in France during the \nfirst World War.\n  In 1998, the French Government announced Project 1918-1998. The \npurpose of Project 1918-1998 is to honor the 80th anniversary of the \narmistice of World War I, and as part of this undertaking, France \nannounced that it would award the Legion of Honor designation to \nsurviving American veterans who, like Mr. McKenney, served in France \nbetween 1914 and 1918. This step is taken in recognition of the \ndecisive support Americans gave to French soldiers as they fought to \ndefend French soil.\n  Up to 1,000 American veterans who served in France during World War I \nmay still be alive today, and there is a search underway to locate as \nmany of these men and women as possible.\n  Private Everett McKenney, who is 104 and a longtime resident of \nWaterville and Augusta, has two daughters, five grandchildren, four \ngreat grandchildren, and one great, great grandchild. He was the \nyoungest of four children and was born in Freedom, Maine in 1895. He \nenlisted in July 1918 at 23, in Waterville. He was stationed in Fort \nDevens, Massachusetts and received special training in New Jersey. He \nwas assigned to the 41st Rainbow Division and later was assigned to the \n101st Field Artillery unit. In New Jersey, he was notified to pack his \ngear and prepare for an overseas assignment. During a 12-day Atlantic \ncrossing, a flu epidemic broke out and many of his comrades were buried \nat sea. This would be the first of many trials he would face.\n  I have nothing but the utmost respect for those who have served with \ncourage, honor and distinction when their country--and the world--\nneeded them so desperately. Indeed, I am truly honored to represent \nthese men and women as Maine's senior Senator.\n  On November 11, 1918, almost 81 years ago, at the eleventh hour, the \nArmistice was signed in France that silenced the guns and ended the \ncarnage of World War I. From the War for Independence, to World War I, \nthrough the Persian Gulf War and the Balkans more than two hundred \nyears later, Americans like Everett have answered the call to duty--not \nfor the glory or conquest or empire, but to ensure that the flame of \nliberty burns ever brightly.\n  The debt of gratitude owed to our veterans can never be fully repaid. \nWhat we can and must do for those who, like Mr. McKenney, answered the \ncall to duty is keep alive the values of freedom and democracy they \nhave defended, and honor them as the guardians of those ideals.\n  Elmer Runyon once wrote that: ``We will remain the home of the free \nonly as long as we are also the home of the brave.'' Today, America and \nthe world is basking in the shine of freedom because of yesterday's and \ntoday's service men and women--who offer nobly to sacrifice in war so \nthat others may live in peace. These are America's true heroes.\n  This occasion reminds us that winning freedom is not the same as \nkeeping it. The cost of safeguarding freedom is high. It requires \nvigilance and sacrifice. Time and again when freedom has been \nthreatened, men like Everett McKenney emerged as heroes. America's \nveterans have served our country and the world ably in times of need, \nand know well the personal sacrifices which the defense of freedom \ndemands. It is a true honor to congratulate Mr. McKenney on a well-\ndeserved recognition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/14/senate-section/article/S8528-2", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8528-S8529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                RAE LIU\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today I rise to thank Rae Liu, a \nbrilliant young intern from Columbia University where she is a National \nMerit Scholar and a debater. Rae came to my office this May. When an \nopening appeared on my personal staff in June, Rae was our unanimous \nchoice to fill it until we could hire someone permanently. At 18, she \ntook on the task of being a full-fledged member of my staff.\n  From the outset, Rae displayed judgment, maturity, initiative, and a \nwork ethic way beyond her years. She worked tirelessly overhauling and \ndrafting legislation, attending policy reviews, and meeting with \nconstituents. She quickly made herself indispensable to my foreign \npolicy, intelligence, and defense legislative assistant, and \ndistinguished herself with her quick mind, sharp wit and devastating \ncompetence. It is rare to see so much ability and professionalism in \none so young.\n\n[[Page S8529]]\n\n  Rae is exactly the sort of young person we need to attract to public \nservice. This is not going to be easy as we compete with the best law \nand business schools for talented young Americans who can earn much \nmore than taking the Queen's shilling. We must try, however, for if we \ndo not, we risk losing a new generation of bright ideas and insights. \nThis would be not only tragic but shortsighted.\n  I wish this young lady from Texas godspeed in her studies and thank \nher again for her contributions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/14/senate-section/article/S8529-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DOCTOR EUGENE OLIVERI\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the newly \nelected President of the American Osteopathic Association, Dr. Eugene \nOliveri.\n  Dr. Oliveri is a prominent leader in the practice of osteopathic \nmedicine. Throughout his career, he has maintained the strongest of \ncommitments to the highest level of medical standards. From his early \ndays as an undergraduate at Brooklyn College in new York, Dr. Oliveri \nhas distinguished himself for his extensive knowledge and tireless \nsupport of osteopathy. Dedicated to helping others, Dr. Oliveri took \ntwo years off from his personal studies to work in the U.S. Army \nMedical Corps. Perhaps most importantly, Dr. Oliveri has raised three \nwonderful children: Gregory, Lisa, and Michelle.\n  Dr. Oliveri serves on numerous professional boards, and is currently \npracticing at Botsford General Hospital in Farmington Hills, Michigan, \nas the senior member of the Department of Internal Medicine. He also \nserves as a director of a fellowship program and chairman of a section \nof Gastroenterology at Botsford Hospital. Most recently, he has also \nserved as a Vice-Chairman for the American Osteopathic Association. Dr. \nOliveri's experience and renowned leadership capabilities make him well \nsuited for this exciting new challenge.\n  Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to congratulate Dr. Oliveri \non this tremendous honor. I am confident that the American Osteopathic \nAssociation will be well served during his tenure as President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/14/senate-section/article/S8529-2", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JOHN McLAUGHLIN\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to \nhonor John McLaughlin, Chairman of McLaughlin Transportation Systems, \nInc. for being named the 1999 Greater Nashua Chamber of Commerce \nCitizen of the Year.\n  The Citizen of the Year Award is an effort to recognize a local \nindividual for their contributions to the betterment of life in the \nGreater Nashua Area. The award recipient has sustained a lifelong \ncommitment to the best interests of Nashua and the state of New \nHampshire. John has definitely exceeded these requirements.\n  A longtime resident of Nashua, New Hampshire, John started with his \nfather's business as a teenager sweeping floors. After graduating from \nhigh school and serving in the armed forces, he went to work for the \ncompany upon his father's death in 1949. From the company's initial \nsize of 3-4 trucks and a hand full of employees, McLaughlin \nTransportation has grown into a company that includes approximately 120 \ntrucks, five facilities, and approximately 150 employees. The company's \ncore focus is the moving and storing business, however, they have now \nexpanded to include a limousine service and fuel-oil delivery business.\n  Although he has been extremely successful in business, John is \nequally recognized for his community stewardship. He has been involved \nwith the Nashua Chamber for over 50 years, served for two decades as \nthe Nashua fire commissioner and served four terms as the District 13 \nState Senator. In addition, he has held many leadership positions \nwithin the community, including the Nashua Parks and Recreation \nCommission, Rivier College Advisory Board, N.H. Council on Aging, and \nmany more.\n  As a former small business owner, I admire John for his hard work, \ndetermination and dedication to the community. He is a role model for \nus all and I commend him for his efforts. It is an honor to represent \nhim in the United States Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/14/senate-section/article/S8529-3", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        A TRIBUTE TO FRED GYLFE, LEGION OF HONOR AWARD RECIPIENT\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute a \nveteran from Maine who this week will have bestowed upon him high \nhonors from the French Government for the sacrifices he made during \nWorld War I.\n  Fred Gylfe will receive the most prestigious honor that France \nbestows, the award of the National Order of the Legion of Honor, in \ngratitude for the valor he displayed serving in France during the First \nWorld War.\n  Last year, the French Government announced Project 1918-1998, which \nhonors the 80th anniversary of the armistice of World War I. As part of \nthis undertaking, France is awarding the Legion of Honor Award to \nsurviving American veterans who served in France between 1914 and \n1918--in recognition for the crucial support American veterans lent to \nFrench soldiers fighting to defend French soil.\n  It is estimated that as many as 1,000 American veterans who served in \nFrance during World War I may still be living, and there is a search \nunderway to locate as many of these men and women as possible.\n  Fred Gylfe was born in Worcester, Massachusetts on August 14, 1897. \nHis parents emigrated from Sweden, and he was their first child born in \nthe U.S. He entered the U.S. National Guard in 1916 and departed for \nFrance on May 16, 1918. He fought in Ypres/Lys and Saint Quentin Tunnel \nin the French province of Somme. He was a Sergeant in Headquarters \nCompany for the 108th Infantry 27th division of the New York National \nGuard. He is the father of two children, and three grandchildren.\n  I have nothing but the utmost respect for those who have served with \ncourage, honor and distinction, answering the call to duty when their \ncountry--and the world no less--needed them so desperately. Indeed, it \nis no small challenge to put into words the enormous pride I feel for \nthe opportunity to represent men like Fred Gylfe as Maine's senior \nSenator.\n  On November 11, 1918, almost 81 years ago, at the eleventh hour, the \nArmistice was signed in France that silenced the guns and ended the \ncarnage of World War I.

Katzmann, of New York, to be United States \n     Circuit Judge for the Second Circuit.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n[[Page S8530]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will my friend yield for a moment at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Wyoming wish to yield to \nthe Senator from Vermont?\n  Mr. ENZI. Certainly.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank my friend from Wyoming.\n  Mr. President, I know there are going to be more statements made \nafterward. We have just confirmed Robert Katzmann, of New York, to be \nUnited States Circuit Judge for the Second Circuit. This is to replace \nthe very distinguished and former chief justice of the Second Circuit, \nJon Newman, who has retired, or has taken senior status. I cannot say \nhe is retired. I know how hard Judge Newman continues to work. I get \nreports from his former law clerk, Bruce Cohen, who is the chief \ncounsel for the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee.\n  I note Judge Katzmann now for two reasons. First, of course, Vermont \nis in that circuit. But far more important, this is a man who was \nbrought here at the strong urging and behest of the senior Senator from \nNew York, my dear friend and one of the most distinguished Members of \nthis body, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, really the intellectual \ngiant of the Senate.\n  I first met now Judge Katzmann when Senator Moynihan brought him to \nmy office, and I was immediately impressed with him. This is the first \ncircuit court judge to be confirmed this year.\n  Historians can determine what helped the most: the brilliance of \npersuasion of the distinguished Senator from New York or the brilliance \nof Judge Katzmann. I say that it was a symbiotic relationship that made \nthe confirmation possible. I applaud my dear friend from across that \ngreat and beautiful Lake Champlain, my dear friend from New York, but I \nalso commend Robert Katzmann. I thank my dear friend from Wyoming for \nallowing me to say this.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Will the Senator from Wyoming yield for a very brief \nremark?\n  Mr. ENZI. Certainly.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, first, I thank my friend and \ndistinguished ranking member on the Judiciary Committee for his remarks \nabout Judge Katzmann, as I believe he now is. I am very much indebted \nto Senator Hatch, the chairman of the committee. I thank the acting \nmajority leader, the Senator from Wyoming.\n  On a brief personal note, this is a very special moment for the \nSenator from New York. Judge Katzmann was a graduate student of mine. I \nwas a member of the orals examining committee when he received his \nPh.D. He has been a remarkable student, a professor of law at \nGeorgetown University at this point, and an author of important \narticles and books on the relationship between the Congress and the \njudiciary, a subject little attended and important. It attracted the \nattention of Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy.\n  I thank the Senator for his indulgence. I thank the Senate for its \ngreat good judgment in this important confirmation which I do believe \nhistory will one day record.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank our colleagues for their kind words \nabout our new judge. I will mention, any other statements relating to \nthe nomination will be printed in the Record. I am certain that since \nhe has had such distinguished tutoring, there will be more comments. I \nam pleased to know that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/14/senate-section/article/S8530-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
