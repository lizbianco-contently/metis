Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have my full 5 \nminutes as previously reserved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Hatch-Leahy amendment is a good one. I \nhope everybody will support it. I have talked for years about \nempowering users of the Internet to control and limit access to \nmaterial they did not want to see and that could be found on line. This \ncould be any type of material. Parents may not want their children \nbuying things. There may be obscene material. It could be types of \nsites parents are against.\n  We also know there is a lot of amazing and wonderful material on the \nInternet. While I oppose efforts in Congress to regulate content of the \nInternet, I do want to make sure children can be protected, that \nparents have the ability to do that, and this gives them a chance to do \nit.\n  I have always believed the power to control what people see belongs \nto the\n\n[[Page S5194]]\n\nusers and the parents, not the Government. The amendment the chairman \nand I offer requires large on-line service providers to offer their \nsubscribers filtering software and systems to stop objectionable \nmaterials from reaching their computer screens. I am supportive of \nvoluntary industry efforts to come together and provide Internet users \nwith one-click-away information resources on how to protect children \nwhen they go on line. Senator Campbell and I joined Vice President Gore \nat the White House last week to hear about this one-click-away \namendment. Our amendment helps promote the use of filtering \ntechnologies. It is better than Government censorship. It is a fall-\nback provision, if the companies do not do it themselves.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/13/senate-section/article/S5194-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5194]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NOTE FROM SENATOR SASSER\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

I ask unanimous consent for 1 minute to read a \nnote that I just received from our former colleague, Senator Sasser.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, many of us served here with Jim Sasser, the \nvery distinguished former chairman of the Budget Committee, now our \nAmbassador to China at a very difficult time.\n  We have seen the photographs of Ambassador Sasser under siege in the \nChinese Embassy. I faxed him a note the other day, saying how proud I \nwas, and I mentioned the comments of many Senators saying how proud \nthey were, of his grace under fire and the fact that he would not leave \nthe American Embassy that is under siege. When there were Embassy staff \nthere, in the true and best tradition of the State Department and the \nSenate and the Marine Corps and everything else, he said he would stay \nuntil it was safe. So I faxed him this note.\n  This morning I got back this note from him, and I will read it for my \ncolleagues. It is handwritten. It says:\n\n       Dear Pat: My sincere thanks for your wonderful note. Please \n     tell all my former colleagues that Mary and I are well and \n     safe. Things have stabilized after a turbulent few days. Last \n     night I got a good night's sleep in a real bed.

Mr. President, I strongly urge my colleagues to support \nthis Hatch-Leahy amendment, which is aimed at limiting the negative \nimpact violence and indecent material on the Internet have on children.\n  As I noted last evening, this amendment does not regulate the \ncontent. Instead, it encourages the larger Internet service providers, \nthe ISPs, if you will, to provide, either for free or at a fee not \nexceeding the cost to the service providers, filtering technologies \nthat will empower parents to limit or block the access of minors to \nunsuitable materials on the Internet. We simply cannot ignore the fact \nthat the Internet has the ability to expose children to violent, \nsexually explicit, and other inappropriate materials with no limits.\n  A recent Time/CNN poll found that 75 percent of teenagers from 13 to \n17 believe the Internet is partly responsible for the crimes that \noccurred in Littleton, CO, at Columbine High School. The amendment \nrespects the first amendment of the Constitution by not regulating \ncontent but ensures that parents will have the adequate technological \ntools to control access of their children to unsuitable material on the \nInternet.\n  I honestly believe that the Internet service providers that do not \nalready provide filtering software to their subscribers will do so \nvoluntarily. They will know it is in their best interests, and I \nbelieve the market will demand it.\n  A recent survey reported in the New York Times yesterday found that \nalmost a third of on-line American households with children use \nblocking software.\n  In a study by the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of \nPennsylvania, 60 percent of parents said they disagreed with the \nstatement that the Internet was a safe place for their children. \nAccording to yesterday's New York Times, after the shootings in \nColorado, the demand for filtering technologies has dramatically \nincreased. This indicates that parents are taking an active role in \nsafeguarding their children on the Internet. That is what this \namendment is all about--using technology to empower parents.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I yield the floor \nand hope we can go to a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, next Sunday and Monday, NBC is scheduled to \nair a miniseries entitled ``Atomic Train.'' The plot of this movie \nincludes a runaway train carrying nuclear weapons and high-level \nnuclear waste causing a massive accident and catastrophe in Denver.\n  The movie is obviously fiction. Let me just tell you how the network \ninitially described the scenario:\n\n       A runaway train carrying armed nuclear weapons and deadly \n     nuclear waste suddenly careens out of control down the Rocky \n     Mountains.\n\n  All of this made the nuclear power industry very nervous, because \nalthough the scenario is fictional, much of what is depicted, in part, \nis a scenario that is entirely possible, given the proposed legislation \nI will describe that this Congress is considering.\n  Earlier this week, just days before this was to air, all of a sudden \nNBC changes the story line of the television miniseries, and now we \nhave:\n\n       A runaway train carrying a Russian atomic weapon and \n     hazardous materials, suddenly careening out of control.\n\n  All reference to high-level nuclear waste is dropped. The Nuclear \nEnergy Institute, which is the lobbying arm of the atomic energy lobby, \nwas forced to go into high gear. They sent out what they called an \n``Info Wire.'' They were very concerned. They say, in effect:\n\n\n[[Page S5195]]\n\n\n       NEI, in consultation with industry communicators and \n     representatives of the U.S. Department of Energy and the \n     American Association of Railroads, has adopted a containment \n     strategy for the upcoming movie. We do not want to do \n     anything to provide additional publicity for this movie prior \n     to the airing. The containment strategy is not a passive \n     one, in that it envisions an aggressive effort prior to \n     the broadcast.\n\n  It is the belief of this Senator that indeed it was a very aggressive \neffort, and the Nuclear Energy Institute put pressure on the network to \ndrop all references to dangerous high-level nuclear waste. The last \nthing this industry wants the American people to understand is that \nlegislation which has been supported in previous Congresses, and in \nthis Congress, would result in the shipment of 77,000 metric tons of \nhigh-level nuclear waste within a mile or less of a total population of \n50 million residing in 43 States.\n  The blue lines depict rails, and indeed there is a transportation \ncorridor going through the State of Colorado, as well as others.\n  So why did NBC do an ``el foldo''? NBC is owned by General Electric \nand, surprise, General Electric has a nuclear division, and one of its \nsenior officers is a member of the board of directors of NEI.\n  I acknowledge it is a fictional scenario. But what is very real is \nthat in point of fact the proposal is to transport high-level nuclear \nwaste through all these rail corridors that are depicted on this map. \nThat is not fictional. That is real.\n  It is, in fact, real that high-level nuclear waste is deadly, as NBC \nfirst described it. In fact, it is deadly for tens of thousands of \nyears. In point of fact, as we know, every year there are thousands of \ntrain accidents in America. A runaway train is not a fictional \nscenario. That is something that occurs, sadly, from time to time. It \nis not a fictional scenario for a train and an automobile or a truck to \ncollide at an at-grade crossing. That occurred tragically earlier this \nyear in Illinois. It is not fictional for trains to be derailed.\n  The last thing this industry wants the American people to know and to \nunderstand is that, indeed, the shipment of high-level nuclear waste, \nproposed to be sent to a temporary--allegedly temporary--storage area \nin my own State, at the Nevada Test Site, is a scenario that would \ninvolve the transshipment of 77,000 metric tons of high-level nuclear \nwaste, with all of the risks that are inherent therein.\n  What is even more outrageous is that it is totally unnecessary. The \nNuclear Waste Technical Review Board tells us it is unnecessary. The \nDepartment of Energy has indicated it is unnecessary. The President has \nindicated he would veto such legislation. All the risks depicted in \nthis scenario with high-level nuclear wastes could be a reality if \nthere was a tragic train accident and, indeed, the canisters were \ncompromised and high-level nuclear waste was scattered along the route.\n  I think this is a very dangerous proposal. I think the fact the \nnetwork would cave in is equally dangerous, because the American people \nhave a right to know what is being proposed. In Nevada, we understand \nthe risk. Sadly, there are hundreds of millions of Americans in this \ncountry who are not familiar with the nuclear industry's proposal to \nmake their backyards the corridor by which high-level nuclear waste is \nto pass.\n  I must say, with tongue in cheek, if this is to be the standard, one \nmight contemplate that the cruise line industry might have put pressure \nupon the producers of ``Titanic'': Please do not make any reference to \nthe fact that the ship is sinking. This may be bad for business. Or the \nproducers of ``Planet Of The Apes'' might have been subjected to \npressure from PETA, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, \nsaying: Look, we object to the way in which these apes are being \ntreated in the film; please make changes. Or if some of the advocates \nof my own State approached the producers of ``Casino'' and said: Look, \nwe don't want you to make any references to ``Casino'' in this story \nline; please delete that.\n\n  In my judgment, the circumstantial evidence is powerful here. The \ndescription I have given, namely of deadly nuclear waste, was the \nnetwork's own description just days ago. The NEI goes into a full court \npress, what they call a containment strategy--what we all know is \ndamage control--and, miraculously, days before this miniseries is \nscheduled to air, the story line is changed and all references to \ndeadly nuclear waste are deleted.\n  I hope the American people will not be misled, that they will \nunderstand the risks that affect them and their neighborhoods. Mr. \nPresident, 43 different States are affected in this scenario. This map \nI have here depicts essentially the States. Because, by their nature, \nhighway corridors and rail corridors connect the major metropolitan \ncommunities of our country, this high-level nuclear waste would in fact \ngo through major cities in America. That fact is largely unknown.\n  Last year, I had occasion to travel with my senior colleague to the \ntwo communities of Denver and St. Louis, and to share with those \ncommunities the risks that are involved. Most people in the community \ndid not have any understanding that this scenario is not fictional and \nfar-fetched but, indeed, it is contemplated that those shipments will \noccur.\n  I regret NBC felt it was necessary to respond to the pressure of the \nnuclear power industry. Having been involved in this battle for the \nlast 17 years, I am not unmindful of what a powerful force they are, \nnot only in Washington but around the country. They have every right to \nadvocate their point of view. As to their concern that somehow their \nindustry would be exposed for what it is, a high-risk industry that \nthreatens the health and safety of many Americans with this ill-\nconceived and unnecessary plan to ship nuclear waste to a temporary \nnuclear waste facility in my own State, at least this movie would have \nmade the public aware that high-level nuclear waste is dangerous, to \nuse the description NBC initially gave; that it was indeed going to \npass through major cities such as Denver; and that indeed the health \nand safety of citizens of those communities and many others across the \ncountry could be compromised.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and the remainder of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/13/senate-section/article/S5195-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5195-S5214]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nVIOLENT AND REPEAT JUVENILE OFFENDER ACCOUNTABILITY AND REHABILITATION \n                              ACT OF 1999\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 328\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the distinguished Chair.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is nothing more than reinstituting the \nfamily hour or the family viewing period. We had it during the \nseventies, but we set it aside, just like the distinguished Senator \nfrom Nevada was talking about with respect to censoring and making sure \nthese producers and broadcasters don't interfere with the creative \nimpulses of a writer or a producer in Hollywood. But when it comes to \nthe bottom line, they change that around. That is what we have, and it \nis very, very difficult to make an overwhelming case.\n  We are again facing the same stonewalling that we viewed Sunday on \n``Meet the Press,'' when the representative of the Motion Picture \nAssociation, who has been doing this for 30-some years, said he did not \nknow the effect of TV violence on children and asked for another study. \nWe pointed out, of course, that is the way we started with Senator \nPastore, back in 1969, 30 years ago, and that is when we had the \nSurgeon General's study. It has become worse and worse and worse over \nthe years.\n  Again this morning, in the Washington Post, an article says: ``Movie \nMogul Defends Hollywood.''

Was the Colorado tragedy a \n     legacy of our technoculture: Doom, ``Natural Born Killers,'' \n     hate-amplifying Web sites and pipe-bomb plans from the Net? \n     Or simply two teenage killers' ability to collect enough \n     ordnance to sustain a small army?

After the massacre, there were calls to cancel two \n     upcoming Denver events: a Marilyn Manson concert and the \n     NRA's annual convention. Guilt has to be spread pretty widely \n     to make bedfellows of the androgynous Goth crooner and \n     Charlton Heston.\n       Still, we've got to look for answers to prevent further \n     massacres, if not to clear up the mystery in Littleton. The \n     Internet has been getting heat not only as a host for some of \n     the sick enthusiasms of the Trenchcoat Mafia, but as a \n     potential source of explosive information. Defenders of the \n     New rightfully note that criticizing the reach of the \n     increasingly pervasive Web is like blaming paper for bad \n     poetry. Still, it's undeniable that cyberspace offers \n     unlimited opportunity to network with otherwise unreachable \n     creepy people. What's worse is how the Net makes it easy to \n     succumb to the temptation to post anything--even Ubermensch \n     song lyrics or murderous threats--without the sure sanctions \n     that would come if you tried that in your geographical \n     community. The Internet credo is empowerment, and \n     unfortunately that also applies to troubled teens sticking \n     their toes into the foul water of hatemongering. As parents \n     are learning, the Net's easy accessibility to the \n     netherworlds is a challenge that calls, at the least, for a \n     measure of vigilance.\n       Hollywood is also a fat target. From Oliver Stone's lyric \n     depiction of random murder (rabidly viewed by the Columbine \n     killers) to stylish slaughter in ``The Matrix,'' violence is \n     the main cource on our entertainment menu. We are a nation \n     that comfortably embraces Tony Soprano, a basic-values type \n     of guy who not only orders hits but himself performs the \n     occasional whacking. The industry's defense is summarized by \n     Doug Richardson, who's scripted ``Die Hard II'' and ``Money \n     Train.'' ``If I were to accept the premise that the media \n     culture is responsible,'' he says, ``then I would be \n     surprised that the thousands of violent images we see don't \n     inspire more acts of violence.'' In other words, the sheer \n     volume of carnage is proof of its harmlessness.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. It says:\n\n       Hollywood is also a fat target. Oliver Stone's lyric \n     depiction of random murder (rabidly viewed by the Columbine \n     killers) to stylish slaughter in ``The Matrix,'' violence is \n     the main course on our entertainment menu.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that a Time magazine article, again this \nmonth, entitled ``Bang, You're Dead,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Bang, You're Dead\n\n\n  revenge fantasies are proliferating in movies and on tv. but should \n                     they be blamed for littleton?\n\n                          (By Richard Corliss)\n\n       The young and the older always eye one another across a \n     gaping chasm. Gray heads shake in perplexity, even in a week \n     of mourning, even over the mildest expressions of teen taste. \n     Fashion, for example. Here are these nice kids from suburban \n     Denver, heroically documenting the tragedy for TV, and they \n     all seem to belong to the Church of Wearing Your Cap \n     Backward. A day later, as the teens grieve en masse, oldsters \n     ask, ``when we were kids, would we have worn sweats and jeans \n     to a memorial service for our friends?'' And of course the \n     trench-coat killers had their own distinctive clothing: \n     Johnny Cash by way of Quentin Tarantino. Should we blame the \n     Columbine massacre on haberdashery?\n       No, but many Americans want to pin the blame for this and \n     other agonizing splatter fests on pop culture. Adults look at \n     the revenge fantasies their kids see in the `plexes, listen \n     (finally) to the more extreme music, glance over their kids' \n     shoulders at Druid websites and think, ``Seems repulsive to \n     me. Maybe pop culture pulled the trigger.''\n       Who wouldn't want to blame self-proclaimed Antichrist \n     superstar Marilyn Mason? Listen to Lunchbox, and get the \n     creeps: ``The big bully try to stick his finger in my chest/ \n     Try to tell me, tell me he's the best/ But I don't really \n     give a good goddamn cause/ I got my lunchbox and I'm armed \n     real well / Next motherf***** gonna get my metal/ . . . Pow \n     pow pow.'' Not quite Stardust.\n       Sift through teen movies of the past 10 years, and you \n     could create a hindsight game plan for Littleton. Peruse \n     Heathers (1989), in which a charming sociopath engineers the \n     death of jocks and princesses. Study carefully, as one of the \n     Columbine murderers reportedly did, Natural Born Killers \n     (1994), in which two crazy kids cut a carnage swath through \n     the Southwest as the media ferociously dog their trail. \n     Sample The Basketball Diaries (1995), in which druggy high \n     schooler Leonardo DiCaprio daydreams of strutting into his \n     homeroom in a long black coat and gunning down his hated \n     teacher and half the kids. The Rage: Carrie 2 (now in \n     theaters) has jocks viciously taunting outsiders until one \n     girl kills herself by jumping off the high school roof and \n     another wreaks righteous revenge by using her telekinetic \n     powers to pulverize a couple dozen kids.\n       Grownups can act out revenge fantasies too. In Payback, Mel \n     Gibson dishes it out (pulls a ring out of a punk's nose, \n     shoots his rival's face off through a pillow) and takes it \n     (gets punched, switch-bladed, shot and, ick, toe-hammered). \n     The Matrix, the first 1999 film to hit $100 million at the \n     box office, has more kung fu than gun fu but still brandishes \n     an arsenal of firepower in its tale of outsiders against the \n     Internet droids.\n       In Littleton's wake, the culture industry has gone \n     cautious. CBS pulled an episode of Promised Land because of a \n     plot about a shooting in front of a Denver school. The WB has \n     postponed a Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode with a \n     schoolyard-massacre motif. Movie-studio honchos, who \n     furiously resist labeling some serious adult films FOR ADULTS \n     ONLY, went mum last week when asked to comment on any \n     connection between violent movies and violent teen behavior. \n     That leaves us to explain things.\n       Revenge dramas are as old as Medea (she tore her sons to \n     pieces), as hallowed as Hamlet (seven murders), as familiar \n     as The Godfather. High drama is about the conflict between \n     shades of good and evil, often within the same person. But \n     it's easier to dream up a scenario of slavering evil and \n     imperishable good. This is the moral and commercial equation \n     of melodrama: the greater the outrage suffered, the greater \n     the justification for revenge. You grind me down at first; I \n     grind you up at last. This time it's personal.\n       Fifty years ago, movies were homogenous, meant to appeal to \n     the whole family. Now pop culture has been Balkanized; it is \n     full of niches, with different groups watching and playing \n     their own things. And big movies, the ones that grab $20 \n     million on their first weekend, are guy stuff. Young males \n     consume violent movies, in part, for the same reason they \n     groove to outlaw music: because their parents can't \n     understand it--or stand it. To kids, an R rating for violence \n     is like the Parental Advisory on CDs: a Good Housebreaking \n     Seal of Approval.\n       The cultural gap, though, is not just between old and \n     young. It is between the haves and the self-perceived have-\n     nots of teen America. Recent teen films, whether romance or \n     horror, are really about class warfare. In each movie, the \n     cafeteria is like a tiny former Yugoslavia, with each clique \n     its own faction: the Serbian jocks, Bosnian bikers, Kosovar \n     rebels, etc. And the horror movies are a microcosm of ethnic \n     cleansing.\n       Movies may glamorize mayhem while serving as a fantasy \n     safety valve. A steady diet of megaviolence may coarsen the \n     young psyche--but some films may instruct it. Heathers and \n     Natural Born Killers are crystal-clear satires on \n     psychopathy, and The Basketball Diaries is a mordant portrait \n     of drug addiction. Payback is a grimly synoptic parody of all \n     gangster films. In three weeks, 15 million people have seen \n     The Matrix and not gone berserk. And Carrie 2 is a crappy \n     remake of a 1976 hit that led to no murders.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Reading one sentence:\n\n       Sift through teen movies of the past 10 years, and you \n     could create a hindsight game plan for Littleton.\n\n  Another interesting article, ``Gunning for Hollywood,'' appeared in \nU.S. News & World Report on May 10. I ask unanimous consent that the \ncolumn by John Leo be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         Gunning for Hollywood\n\n                             (By John Leo)\n\n       Every time a disaster like the Colorado massacre occurs, \n     Democrats want to focus on guns and Republicans want to talk \n     about popular culture. Much of this comes from actual \n     conviction, but economic interest often disguises itself as \n     principle. The Republicans can't say much about the gun \n     lobby, because they accept too much of its money. The \n     Democrats can't talk about Hollywood and the rest of the \n     entertainment industry, because that's where so much of their \n     funding comes from.\n       The gun and entertainment executives tend to patrol the \n     same familiar borders. Charlton Heston, head of the National \n     Rifle Association, offered some dubious arguments: An armed \n     guard at Columbine High School would have saved lives; \n     legalizing concealed weapons tends to lower crime rates. \n     Gerald Levin, the equally adamant head of Time Warner, said \n     he feared ``a new season of political opportunism and moral \n     arrogance intended to scapegoat the media.'' He raised the \n     specter of censorship, noting that Oliver Cromwell, ``the \n     spiritual forebear of Rev. Falwell,'' shut down the theaters \n     of 17th-century England on moral grounds.\n       Surely we can do better than this. We can talk about the \n     importance of gun control,\n\n[[Page S5197]]\n\n     and we can talk about the impact on behavior of violence \n     portrayed in the media without suggesting that censorship is \n     any kind of solution.\n       This time around, a center of sorts seems to be forming. \n     Bill Bennett and Sen. Joseph Lieberman, familiar social \n     conservative voices on this issue, have been joined by Sens. \n     John McCain and Sam Brownback and, it seems, by the Clintons \n     and the Gores. Tipper Gore said that the entertainment media \n     bear some responsibility for the killings in Colorado. In a \n     radio address, President Clinton urged parents to ``refuse to \n     buy products'' which glorify violence.''\n       If more Republicans will talk about guns, maybe more \n     Democrats will ask their favorite media moguls to start \n     thinking harder about the social impact of the many awful \n     products they dump on the market.\n       ``We want to appeal to their sense of responsibility and \n     citizenship and ask them to look beyond the bottom \n     line,''said Lieberman. There is talk of some sort of ``summit \n     meeting'' on violence. McCain plans a hearing this week on \n     how violence is marketed to children. For the long term, we \n     need a campaign appealing to pride and accountability among \n     media executives. Shame, too, says Lieberman.\n       Pointless violence is an obvious topic. In the dreadful Mel \n     Gibson movie Payback, a nose ring is yanked off, bringing \n     some of the nose with it. A penis is pulled off in the new \n     alleged comedy Idle Hands. Worse are the apparent connections \n     between screen and real-world violence. Michael Carneal's \n     shooting rampage in a Kentucky school was similar to one in a \n     movie he saw, The Basketball Diaries. In the film, the main \n     character dreams of breaking down a classroom door and \n     shooting six classmates and a teacher while other students \n     cheer. In Manhattan in 1997, one of the men who stomped a \n     parade watcher to death on St. Patrick's Day finished with a \n     line almost exactly like the one uttered by a killer in the \n     movie A Bronx Tale: ``Look at me--I'm the one who did this to \n     you.''\n       A damaging kind of movie violence is currently on display \n     in a very good new movie, The Matrix. Keanu Reeves's \n     slaughter of his enemies is filmed as a beautiful ballet. \n     Thousands of shells fall like snow from his helicopter and \n     bounce in romantic slo-mo off walls and across marble floors. \n     The whole scene makes gunning people down seem like a \n     wonderfully satisfying hobby, as if a brilliant ad agency had \n     just landed the violence account. What you glorify you tend \n     to get more of. Somebody at the studio should have asked, \n     ``Do we really need more romance attached to the act of \n     blowing people away?''\n       Sadism for the masses. A generation or two ago, movie \n     violence was routinely depicted as a last resort. There were \n     exceptions, of course. But violence was typically something a \n     hero was forced to do, not something he enjoyed. He had no \n     choice. Now, as the critic Mark Crispin Miller once wrote, \n     screen violence ``is used primarily to invite the viewer to \n     enjoy the feel of killing, beating, mutilating.''\n       We are inside the mind and emotions of the shooter, \n     experiencing the excitement. This is violence not as a last \n     resort but as deeply satisfying lifestyle. And those who use \n     films purely to exploit and promote the lifestyle ought to be \n     called on it.\n       Some years ago, Cardinal Roger Mahony, Roman Catholic \n     archbishop of Los Angeles, was thought to be preparing a \n     speech calling for a tough new film-rating code. Hollywood \n     prepared itself to be appalled. But instead of calling for a \n     code, the cardinal issued a pastoral letter defending \n     artistic freedom and appealed to moviemakers to think more \n     about how to handle screen violence. When violence is \n     portrayed, he wrote, ``Do we feel the pain and dehumanization \n     it causes to the person on the receiving end, and to the \n     person who engages in it? . . . Does the film cater to the \n     aggressive and violent impulses that lie hidden in every \n     human heart? Is there danger its viewers will be desensitized \n     to the horror of violence by seeing it?''\n       Good questions. Think about it, Hollywood.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, Mr. Leo's column cites that TV violence \nhas a definite effect on children.\n  Turning to the New Republic of May 17, Gregg Easterbrook in the New \nRepublic wrote another relevant article entitled, ``Watch and Learn.'' \nI ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n Copyright 1999 The New Republic, Inc., The New Republic; May 17, 1999\n\n       Section: Pg. 22.\n       Length: 3724 words.\n       Headline: Watch and Learn.\n       Byline: Gregg Easterbrook.\n       Highlight: Yes, the media do make us more violent.\n       Body: Millions of teens have seen the 1996 move Scream, a \n     box-office and home-rental hit. Critics adored the film. The \n     Washington Post declared that it ``deftly mixes irony, self-\n     reference, and social wry commentary.'' The Los Angeles Times \n     hailed it as ``a bravura, provocative send-up.'' Scream opens \n     with a scene in which a teenage girl is forced to watch her \n     jock boyfriend tortured and then disemboweled by two fellow \n     students who, it will eventually be learned, want revenge on \n     anyone from high school who crossed them. After jock boy's \n     stomach is shown cut open and he dies screaming, the killers \n     stab and torture the girl, then cut her throat and hang her \n     body from a tree so that Mom can discover it when she drives \n     up. A dozen students and teachers are graphically butchered \n     in the film, while the characters make running jokes about \n     murder. At one point, a boy tells a big-breasted friend she'd \n     better be careful because the stacked girls always get it in \n     horror films; in the next scene, she's grabbed, stabbed \n     through the breasts, and murdered. Some provocative send-up, \n     huh? The move builds to a finale in which one of the killers \n     announces that he and his accomplice started off by murdering \n     strangers but then realized it was a lot of more fun to kill \n     their friends.\n       Now that two Colorado high schoolers have murdered twelve \n     classmates and a teacher--often, it appears, first taunting \n     their pleading victims, just like celebrity stars do in the \n     movies--some commentators have dismissed the role of violence \n     in the images shown to the young, pointing out that horrific \n     acts by children existed before celluloid or the phosphor \n     screen. That is true--the Leopold-Loeb murder of 1924, for \n     example. But mass murders by the young, once phenomenally \n     rare, are suddenly on the increase. Can it be coincidence \n     that this increase is happening at the same time that \n     Hollywood has begun to market the notion that mass murder is \n     fun?\n       For, in cinema's never-ending quest to up the ante on \n     violence, murder as sport is the latest frontier. Slasher \n     flicks began this trend; most portray carnage from the \n     killer's point of view, showing the victim cowering, \n     begging, screaming as the blade goes in, treating each \n     death as a moment of festivity for the killer. (Many \n     killers seek feelings of power over their victims, \n     criminology finds; by revealing in the pleas of victims, \n     slasher movies promote this base emotion.) The 1994 movie \n     Natural Born Killers depicted slaying the helpless not \n     only as a way to have a grand time but also as a way to \n     become a celebrity; several dozen onscreen murders are \n     shown in that film, along with a discussion of how great \n     it makes you feel to just pick people out at random and \n     kill them. The 1994 movie Pulp Fiction presented hit men \n     as glamour figures having loads of interesting fun; the \n     actors were mainstream stars like John Travolta. The 1995 \n     movie Seven, starring Brad Pitt, portrayed a sort of \n     contest to murder in unusually grotesque ways. \n     (Screenwriters now actually discuss, and critics comment \n     on, which film's killings are most amusing.) The 1995 \n     movie The Basketball Diaries contains an extended dream \n     sequence in which the title character, played by teen \n     heartthrob Leonardo DiCaprio, methodically guns down \n     whimpering, pleading classmates at his high school. A rock \n     soundtrack pulses, and the character smiles as he kills.\n       The new hollywood tack of portraying random murder as a \n     form of recreation does not come from schlock-houses. \n     Disney's Miramax division, the same mainstream studio that \n     produced Shakespeare in Love, is responsible for Scream and \n     Pulp Fiction. Time-Warner is to blame for Natural Born \n     Killers and actually ran television ads promoting this film \n     as ``delirious, daredevil fun.'' (After it was criticized for \n     calling murder ``fun,'' Time-Warner tried to justify Killers \n     as social commentary; if you believe that, you believe \n     Godzilla was really about biodiversity protection.) Praise \n     and publicity for gratuitously violent movies come from the \n     big media conglomerates, including the newspapers and \n     networks that profit from advertising for films that glorify \n     murder. Disney, now one of the leading promoters of violent \n     images in American culture, even feels that what little kids \n     need is more violence. Its Christmas 1998 children's movie \n     Mighty Joe Young begins with an eight-year-old girl watching \n     her mother being murdered. By the movie's end, it is 20 years \n     later, and the killer has returned to stalk the grown \n     daughter, pointing a gun in her face and announcing, ``Now \n     join your mother in hell.'' A Disney movie.\n       One reason Hollywood keeps reaching for ever-more-obscene \n     levels of killing is that it must compete with television, \n     which today routinely airs the kind of violence once \n     considered shocking in theaters. According to studies \n     conducted at Temple University, prime-time network (non-news) \n     shows now average up to five violent acts per hour. In \n     February, NBC ran in prime time the movie Eraser, not editing \n     out an extremely graphic scene in which a killer pulls a gun \n     on a bystander and blasts away. The latest TV movie based on \n     The Rockford Files, which aired on CBS the night of the \n     Colorado murders, opened with a scene of an eleven-year-old \n     girl in short-shorts being stalked by a man in a black hood, \n     grabbed, and dragged off, screaming. The Rockford Files is a \n     comedy. Combining television and movies, the typical American \n     boy or girl, studies find, will observe a stunning 40,000 \n     dramatizations of killing by age 18.\n       In the days after the Colorado slaughter, discussion of \n     violent images in American culture was dominated by the \n     canned positions of the anti-Hollywood right and the mammon-\n     is-our-God film lobby. The debate missed three vital points: \n     the distinction between what adults should be allowed to see \n     (anything) and what the inchoate minds of children and \n     adolescents should see; the way in which important liberal \n     battles to win free expression in art and literature have \n     been perverted into an excuse for antisocial\n\n[[Page S5198]]\n\n     video brutality produced by cynical capitalists; and the \n     difference between censorship and voluntary acts of \n     responsibility.\n       The day after the Colorado shooting, Mike De Luca, an \n     executive of New Line Cinema, maker of The Basketball \n     Diaries, told USA Today that, when kids kill, ``bad home \n     life, bad parenting, having guns in the home'' are ``more of \n     a factor than what we put out there for entertainment.'' \n     Setting aside the disclosure that Hollywood now categorizes \n     scenes of movies stars gunning down the innocent as \n     ``entertainment,'' De Luca is correct: studies do show that \n     upbringing is more determinant of violent behavior than any \n     other factor. But research also clearly shows that the \n     viewing of violence can cause aggression and crime. So the \n     question is, in a society already plagued by poor parenting \n     and unlimited gun sales, why does the entertainment industry \n     feel privileged to make violence even more prevalent?\n       Even when researchers factor out other influences such as \n     parental attention, many peer-reviewed studies having found \n     causal links between viewing phony violence and engaging in \n     actual violence. A 1971 surgeon general's report asserted a \n     broad relationship between the two. Studies by Brandon \n     Centerwall, an epidemiologist at the University of Wisconsin, \n     have shown that the postwar murder rise in the United \n     States began roughly a decade after TV viewing became \n     common. Centerwall also found that, in South Africa, where \n     television was not generally available until 1975, \n     national murder rates started rising about a decade later. \n     Violent computer games have not existed long enough to be \n     the subject of many controlled studies, but experts expect \n     it will be shown that playing such games in youth also \n     correlates with destructive behavior. There's an eerie \n     likelihood that violent movies and violent games amplify \n     one another, the film and television images placing \n     thoughts of carnage into the psyche while the games \n     condition the trigger finger to act on those impulses.\n       Leonard Eron, a psychologist at the University of Michigan, \n     has been tracking video violence and actual violence for \n     almost four decades. His initial studies, in 1960, found that \n     even the occasional violence depicted in 1950s television--to \n     which every parent would gladly return today--caused \n     increased aggression among eight-year-olds. By the adult \n     years, Erons' studies find, those who watched the most TV and \n     movies in childhood were much more likely to have been \n     arrested for, or convicted of, violent felonies. Eron \n     believes that ten percent of U.S. violent crime is caused by \n     exposure to images of violence, meaning that 90 percent is \n     not but that a ten percent national reduction in violence \n     might be achieved merely by moderating the content of \n     television and movies. ``Kids learn by observation,'' Eron \n     says. ``If what they observe is violent, that's what they \n     learn.'' To cite a minor but telling example, the \n     introduction of vulgar language into American public \n     discourse traces, Eron thinks, largely to the point at which \n     stars like Clark Gable began to swear onscreen, and kids then \n     imitated swearing as normative.\n       Defenders of bloodshed in film, television, and writing \n     often argue that depictions of killing don't incite real \n     violence because no one is really affected by what they see \n     or read; it's all just water off a duck's back. At heart, \n     this is an argument against free expression. The whole reason \n     to have a First Amendment is that people are influenced by \n     what they see and hear: words and images do change minds, so \n     there must be free competition among them. If what we say, \n     write, or show has no consequences, why bother to have free \n     speech?\n       Defenders of Hollywood bloodshed also employ the argument \n     that, since millions of people watch screen mayhem and shrug, \n     feigned violence has no causal relation to actual violence. \n     After a horrific 1992 case in which a British gang acted out \n     a scene from the slasher movie Child's Play 3, torturing a \n     girl to death as the movie had shown, the novelist Martin \n     Amis wrote dismissively in The New Yorker that he had rented \n     Child's Play 3 and watched the film, and it hadn't made him \n     want to kill anyone, so what was the problem? But Amis isn't \n     homicidal or unbalanced. For those on the psychological \n     borderline, the calculus is different. There have, for \n     example, been at least two instances of real-world shootings \n     in which the guilty imitated scenes in Natural Born Killers.\n       Most telling, Amis wasn't affected by watching a slasher \n     movie because Amis is not young. Except for the unbalanced, \n     exposure to violence in video ``is not so important for \n     adults; adults can watch anything they want,'' Eron says. \n     Younger minds are a different story. Children who don't yet \n     understand the difference between illusion and reality may be \n     highly affected by video violence. Between the ages of two \n     and eight, hours of viewing violent TV programs and movies \n     correlates closely to felonies later in life; the child comes \n     to see hitting, stabbing, and shooting as normative acts. The \n     link between watching violence and engaging in violence \n     continues up to about the age of 19, Eron finds, after which \n     most people's characters have been formed, and video mayhem \n     no longer correlates to destructive behavior.\n       Trends in gun availability do not appear to explain the \n     murder rise that has coincided with television and violent \n     films. Research by John Lott Jr., of the University of \n     Chicago Law School, shows that the percentage of homes with \n     guns has changed little throughout the postwar era. What \n     appears to have changed is the willingness of people to fire \n     their guns at one another. Are adolescents now willing to use \n     guns because violent images make killing seem acceptable or \n     even cool? Following the Colorado slaughter, The New York \n     Times ran a recounting of other postwar mass murders staged \n     by the young, such as the 1966 Texas tower killings, and \n     noted that they all happened before the advent of the \n     Internet or shock rock, which seemed to the Times to absolve \n     the modern media. But all the mass killings by the young \n     occurred after 1950--after it became common to watch violence \n     on television.\n       When horrific murders occur, the film and television \n     industries routinely attempt to transfer criticism to the \n     weapons used. Just after the Colorado shootings, for \n     instance, TV talk-show host Rosie O'Donnell called for a \n     constitutional amendment banning all firearms. How strange \n     that O'Donnell didn't call instead for a boycott of Sony \n     or its production company, Columbia Tristar--a film studio \n     from which she has received generous paychecks and whose \n     current offerings include 8MM, which glamorizes the sexual \n     murder of young women, and The Replacement Killers, whose \n     hero is a hit man and which depicts dozens of gun murders. \n     Handguns should be licensed, but that hardly excuses the \n     convenient sanctimony of blaming the crime on the weapon, \n     rather than on what resides in the human mind.\n       And, when it comes to promoting adoration of guns, \n     Hollywood might as well be the NRA's marketing arm. An ever-\n     increasing share of film and television depicts the firearm \n     as something the virile must have and use, if not an outright \n     sexual aid. Check the theater section of any newspaper, and \n     you will find an ever-higher percentage of movie ads in which \n     the stars are prominently holding guns. Keanu Reeves, Uma \n     Thurman, Laurence Fishburne, Geena Davis, Woody Harrelson, \n     and Mark Wahlberg are just a few of the hip stars who have \n     posed with guns for movie advertising. Hollywood endlessly \n     congratulates itself for reducing the depiction of cigarettes \n     in movies and movie ads. Cigarettes had to go, the film \n     industry admitted, because glamorizing them gives the wrong \n     idea to kids. But the glamorization of firearms, which is far \n     more dangerous, continues. Today, even female stars who \n     otherwise consider themselves politically aware will model in \n     sexualized poses with guns. Ads for the new movie Goodbye \n     Lover show star Patricia Arquette nearly nude, with very \n     little between her and the viewer but her handgun.\n       But doesn't video violence merely depict a stark reality \n     against which the young need be warned? American society is \n     far too violent, yet the forms of brutality highlighted in \n     the movies and on television--prominently ``thrill'' killings \n     and serial murders--are pure distortion. Nearly 99 percent of \n     real murders result from robberies, drug deals, and domestic \n     disputes; figures from research affiliated with the FBI's \n     behavioral sciences division show an average of only about 30 \n     serial or ``thrill'' murders nationally per year. Thirty is \n     plenty horrifying enough, but, at this point, each of the \n     major networks and movie studios alone depicts more \n     ``thrill'' and serial murders annually than that. By \n     endlessly exploiting the notion of the ``thrill'' murder, \n     Hollywood and television present to the young an entirely \n     imaginary image of a society in which killing for pleasure is \n     a common event. The publishing industry, including some TNR \n     advertisers, also distorts for profit the frequency of \n     ``thrill'' murders.\n       The profitability of violent cinema is broadly dependent on \n     the ``down-rating'' of films--movies containing extreme \n     violence being rated only R instead of NC-17 (the new name \n     for X)--and the lax enforcement of age restrictions regarding \n     movies. Teens are the best market segment for Hollywood; when \n     moviemakers claim their violent movies are not meant to \n     appeal to teens, they are simply lying. The millionaire \n     status of actors, directors, and studio heads--and the \n     returns of the mutual funds that invest in movie companies--\n     depends on not restricting teen access to theaters or film \n     rentals. Studios in effect control the movie ratings board \n     and endlessly lobby it not to label extreme violence with an \n     NC-17, the only form of rating that is actually enforced. \n     Natural Born Killers, for example, received an R following \n     Time-Warner lobbying, despite its repeated close-up murders \n     and one charming scene in which the stars kidnap a high \n     school girl and argue about whether it would be more fun to \n     kill her before or after raping her. Since its inception, the \n     movie ratings board has put its most restrictive rating on \n     any realistic representation of lovemaking, while sanctioning \n     ever-more-graphic depictions of murder and torture. In \n     economic terms, the board's pro-violence bias gives studios \n     an incentive to present more death and mayhem, confident that \n     ratings officials will smile with approval.\n       When r-and-x battles were first fought, intellectual \n     sentiment regarded the ratings system as a way of blocking \n     the young from seeing films with political content, such as \n     Easy Rider, or discouraging depictions of sexuality; ratings \n     were perceived as the rubes' counterattack against cinematic \n     sophistication. But, in the 1960s, murder after murder after \n     murder was not standard cinema fare. The most controversial \n     violent film of that era, A Clockwork Orange, depicted a \n     total of one killing, which was heard but not on-camera. \n     (Clockwork Orange also had genuine political content, unlike \n     most of\n\n[[Page S5199]]\n\n     today's big studio movies.) In an era of runaway screen \n     violence, the '60s ideal that the young should be allowed to \n     see what they want has been corrupted. In this, trends in \n     video mirror the misuse of liberal ideals generally.\n       Anti-censorship battles of this century were fought on firm \n     ground, advocating the right of films to tackle social and \n     sexual issues (the 1930s Hays office forbid among other \n     things cinematic mention of cohabitation) and free access to \n     works of literature such as Ulysses, Story of O, and the \n     original version of Norman Mailer's The Naked and the \n     Dead. Struggles against censors established that \n     suppression of film or writing is wrong.\n       But to say that nothing should be censored is very \n     different from saying that everything should be shown. Today, \n     Hollywood and television have twisted the First Amendment \n     concept that occasional repulsive or worthless expression \n     must be protected, so as to guarantee freedom for works of \n     genuine political content or artistic merit, into a new \n     standard in which constitutional freedoms are employed mainly \n     to safeguard works that make no pretense of merit. In the new \n     standard, the bulk of what's being protected is repulsive or \n     worthless, with the meritorious work the rare exception.\n       Not only is there profit for the performers, producers, \n     management, and shareholders of firms that glorify violence, \n     so, too, is there profit for politicians. Many conservative \n     or Republican politicians who denounce Hollywood eagerly \n     accept its lucre. Bob Dole's 1995 anti-Hollywood speech was \n     not followed up by anti-Hollywood legislation or campaign-\n     funds strategy. After the Colorado murders, President Clinton \n     declared, ``Parents should take this moment to ask what else \n     they can do to shield children from violent images and \n     experiences that warp young perceptions.'' But Clinton was \n     careful to avoid criticizing Hollywood, one of the top \n     sources of public backing and campaign contributions for him \n     and his would-be successor, Vice President Al Gore. The \n     president has nothing specific to propose on film violence--\n     only that parents should try to figure out what to do.\n       When television producers say it is the parents' obligation \n     to keep children away from the tube, they reach the self-\n     satire point of warning that their own product is unsuitable \n     for consumption. The situation will improve somewhat \n     beginning in 2000, by which time all new TVs must be sold \n     with the ``V chips''--supported by Clinton and Gore--which \n     will allow parents to block violent shows. But it will be at \n     least a decade before the majority of the nation's sets \n     include the chip, and who knows how adept young minds will \n     prove at defeating it? Rather than relying on a technical fix \n     that will take many years to achieve an effect, TV producers \n     could simply stop churning out the gratuitous violence. \n     Television could dramatically reduce its output of scenes of \n     killing and still depict violence in news broadcasts, \n     documentaries, and the occasional show in which the horrible \n     is genuinely relevant. Reduction in violence is not \n     censorship; it is placing social responsibility before \n     profit.\n       The movie industry could practice the same kind of \n     restraint without sacrificing profitability. In this regard, \n     the big Hollywood studios, including Disney, look craven and \n     exploitative compared to, of all things, the porn-video \n     industry. Repulsive material occurs in underground porn, but, \n     in the products sold by the mainstream triple-X distributors \n     such as Vivid Video (the MGM of the erotica business), \n     violence is never, ever, ever depicted--because that would be \n     irresponsible. Women and men perform every conceivable \n     explicit act in today's mainstream porn, but what is shown is \n     always consensual and almost sunnily friendly. Scenes of rape \n     or sexual menace never occur, and scenes of sexual murder are \n     an absolute taboo.\n       It is beyond irony that today Sony and Time-Warner eagerly \n     market explicit depictions of women being raped, sexually \n     assaulted, and sexually murdered, while the mainstream porn \n     industry would never dream of doing so. But, if money is all \n     that matters, the point here is that mainstream porn is \n     violence-free and yet risque and highly profitable. Surely \n     this shows that Hollywood could voluntarily step back from \n     the abyss of glorifying violence and still retain its edge \n     and its income.\n       Following the Colorado massacre, Republican presidential \n     candidate Gary Bauer declared to a campaign audience, ``In \n     the America I want, all of these producers and directors, \n     they would not be able to show their faces in pubic'' because \n     fingers ``would be pointing at them and saying, `Shame, \n     shame.' '' The statement sent chills through anyone fearing \n     right-wing though-control. But Bauer's final clause is \n     correct--Hollywood and television do need to hear the words \n     ``shame, shame.'' The cause of the shame should be removed \n     voluntarily, not to stave off censorship, but because it is \n     the responsible thing to do.\n       Put it this way. The day after a teenager guns down the \n     sons and daughters of studio executives in a high school in \n     Bel Air or Westwood, Disney and Time-Warner will stop \n     glamorizing murder. Do we have to wait until that day?\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, we include by reference--not printed in \nthe Record of course--the hearings of 1993, 1995, and 1997 which are \nrelevant today. In fact, they have been exacerbated by the events we \nhave not only seen in Colorado, but in Kentucky and Arkansas in the \nvarious schools, but more particular, it has supported our case about \nthe industry, the broadcasters, the producers--by Hollywood.\n  Let's understand first the putoff we had and the stonewalling back in \n1990 when Senator Paul Simon said: What we have to do really--let's not \nrush into this.\n  We have been rushing in since 1969. But in 1989 and 1990, we could \nnot rush in, and we had to have a code of conduct. The reason they \ncould not get it was because of the antitrust laws. So we put in an \nestoppel to the antitrust laws applying to this particular endeavor. We \nhad the standards for depiction of violence and television programs \nissued by ABC, CBS, and NBC in 1992.\n  Mr. President, this is what the programmers themselves said:\n\n       However, all depictions of violence should be relevant and \n     necessary to the development of character or to the \n     advancement of theme or plot.\n\n  Going further:\n\n       Gratuitous or excessive depictions of violence are not \n     acceptable.\n\n  Mr. President, that is word for word our amendment. What we try to \nbar is excessive, gratuitous violence during the family hour. It works \nin the United Kingdom. It works in Belgium and in Europe. It works down \nin Australia. It is tried and true and passes constitutional muster.\n  We had this problem develop with respect to indecency. Finally, the \nCongress acted and we installed in law the authority and responsibility \nfor the Federal Communications Commission to determine the time period \nof family hour, which has been determined from 6 in the morning to 10 \nin the evening, and they barred showing of indecency on television in \nAmerica. That has worked. It was taken to the courts. The lawyers \nimmediately went to work, but the lower court decision has been upheld \nby the Supreme Court.\n  The Attorney General of the United States appeared at our hearing \nbefore the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee and said she \nthought it definitely would pass constitutional muster. We also had a \nplethora of constitutional professors come in. The record is replete. \nIt is not haphazard.\n  Let me quote entertainment industry executives and apologists saying \njust exactly what we say in our law:\n\n       Programs should not depict violence as glamourous--\n\n  I quote that from their own particular code of conduct--\n\n       Realistic depictions of violence should also portray the \n     consequences of that violence to its victims and its \n     perpetrators.\n\n  That was 1992. Let's find out what they did with the code of conduct.\n  In 1998, there was a study sponsored by the National Cable Television \nAssociation. This is one of the most recent authoritative documents on \nthe entire subject. It includes not only the National Parent-Teachers \nAssociation, Virginia Markel, the American Bar Association, Michael \nMcCann, the National Education Association, Darlene Chavez, but--listen \nto this--Belva Davis, American Federation of Television and Radio \nArtists; Charles B. Fitzsimmons, Producers Guild of America; Carl \nGotlieb, Writers Guild of America West; Ann Marcus, Caucus for \nProducers, Writers and Directors; Gene Reynolds, Directors Guild of \nAmerica.\n  What do they say? I cannot print the entire document in the Record, \nin deference to economy in Government. I read from the findings on page \n29:\n\n       Much of TV violence is still glamorized.\n\n  This was their code in 1992. There is no ``glamorized.'' Six years \nlater, they themselves--the producers, the writers, Hollywood itself--\nsay:\n\n       Much of TV violence is still glamorized. Good characters \n     are frequently the perpetrators of violence and rarely do \n     they show remorse. Viewers of all ages are more likely to \n     emulate and learn from characters who are perceived as \n     attractive. Across the 3 years of this study, nearly 40 \n     percent of the violent incidents on television are initiated \n     by characters who possess qualities that make them \n     attractive.\n\n  Heavens above. They prove our case for the amendment.\n  Again reading from the study:\n\n       Another aspect of glamorization is that physical aggression \n     on television is often condoned. For example, more than one-\n     third of violent programs feature bad characters who are \n     never punished. Therefore, violence that goes unpunished in \n     the shortrun poses serious risk to children.\n\n\n[[Page S5200]]\n\n\n  Edgar Bronfman in the morning news said this is not something with \nthe entertainment industry. But it is producers, it is writers, it is \nguilds, managers in Hollywood. I know if he had been in the liquor \nbusiness, he would tell him to go on out there and find out what is \ngoing on.\n  Reading further from their report:\n\n       Violent behavior on television is quite serious in nature. \n     Across the 3-year study, more than half of the violent \n     incidents feature physical aggression that would be lethal or \n     incapacitating if it were to occur in real life. In spite of \n     very serious forms of aggression, much of this violence is \n     undermined by humor. At least 40 percent of the violent \n     scenes on television include humor.\n\n  And on and on, from this particular report. It is really noteworthy \nthat they prove our case. And to come up at this time saying that it \ndoes not have any effect, like they said on ``Meet the Press'' on \nSunday, they would like to join in another study--and I understand the \ndistinguished manager, the chairman, is going to ask for another study \nby the Surgeon General; and my distinguished chairman, the Senator from \nArizona, he has joined in with the Senator from Connecticut to get \nanother study.\n  Whereas the broadcasters, they know the history of broadcasting. We \nought to send them all this three-volume set. I quote from page 23. \nWriters receive numerous plot instructions. This is back in 1953, 46 \nyears ago. I quote:\n\n       It has been found that we retain audience interest best \n     when our story is concerned with murder. Therefore, although \n     other crimes may be introduced, somebody must be murdered, \n     preferably early, with the threat of more violence to come.\n\n  That is how you make money. They can put out all the language just \nlike we do. I guess we are emulating them because we all talk about a \nsurplus, a surplus, a surplus, when we have a deficit. They talk again \nand again and again how they are against this violence, and yet they \ncontinue, under their own study, to spew it out and have a definite \neffect out there in Colorado.\n  Mr. President, I call my colleagues' attention to Senate Commerce \nCommittee Report on ``Children's Protection From Violent Programming \nAct,'' S. 363, Report No. 105-89 and the report on the ``Children's \nProtection From Violent Programming Act of 1995,'' S. 470, Report No. \n104-117.\n  Mr. President, let me agree, though, with Mr. Bronfman on this. And I \nquote Mr. Bronfman from this morning's Washington Post.\n\n       ``It's unfortunate that the American people, who really \n     look to their government for leadership, instead get finger-\n     pointing and chest-pounding,'' he said.\n\n  I will read that again, because I agree with him. ``It's unfortunate \nthat the American people, who really look to their government for \nleadership, instead get finger-pointing and chest-pounding.''\n  There it is. We are experts at it when we call the $100 billion more \nwe are spending this year on a deficit a surplus. When we say it is a \nlegitimate gun dealer, and you have to have a background check, a \nwaiting period, it has sidelined 60,000 felons. It is working. But \nyesterday, due to the stonewalling and influence of the NRA, we said \nno, you can go to a gun show and there is no background check.\n  Can you imagine the Congress that has no shame whatever? I wish I \nwere a lawyer outside practicing. I would take that case immediately up \non the 14th amendment and the equal protection clause for the gun \ndealers and say that is an unconstitutional provision when you do not \nrequire it at the gun shows. I would easily win that case. So we are \ngoing to set that aside or hope it is brought immediately so we will do \naway with that. Maybe then they will sober up and we will get enough \nvotes.\n  Here today we are going to be faced again with the same stonewalling. \nThey go down again and again and again, and they will say: There is no \nproblem. We ought to have further studies.\n  There is one other result I want to mention to my distinguished \ncolleagues here in the Senate. I have already put in the 1972 report. \nBut I ask unanimous consent the American Medical Association article \n``Television and Violence'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n [From the Journal of the American Medical Association, June 10, 1992]\n\nTelevision and Violence: The Scale of the Problem and Where To Go From \n                                  Here\n\n                  (By Brandon S. Centerwall, MD, MPH)\n\n       In 1975 Rothenberg's Special Communication in JAMA, \n     ``Effect of Television Violence on Children and Youth,'' \n     first alerted the medical community to the deforming effects \n     the viewing of television violence has on normal child \n     development, increasing levels of physical aggressiveness and \n     violence.\\1\\ In response to physicians' concerns sparked by \n     Rothenberg's communication, the 1976 American Medical \n     Association (AMA) House of Delegates passed Resolution 38: \n     ``The House declares TV violence threatens the health and \n     welfare of young Americans, commits itself to remedial \n     actions with interested parties, and encourages opposition to \n     TV programs containing violence and to their sponsors.'' \\2\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n      *See footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Other professional organizations have since come to a \n     similar conclusion, including the American Academy of \n     Pediatrics and the American Psychological Association.\\3\\ In \n     light of recent research findings, in 1990 the American \n     Academy of Pediatrics issued a policy statement: \n     ``Pediatricians should advise parents to limit their \n     children's television viewing to 1 to 2 hours per day.'' \\4\\\n       Rothenberg's communication was largely based on the \n     findings of the 1968 National Commission on the Causes and \n     Prevention of Violence \\5\\ and the 1972 Surgeon General's \n     report, Television and Growing Up: The Impact of Televised \n     Violence.\\6\\ Those findings were updated and reinforced by \n     the 1982 report of the National Institute of Mental Health, \n     Television and Behavior: Ten Years of Scientific Progress and \n     Implications for the Eighties, again documenting a broad \n     consensus in the scientific literature that exposure to \n     television violence increases children's physical \n     aggressiveness.\\7\\ Each of these governmental inquiries \n     necessarily left open the question of whether this increase \n     in children's physical aggressiveness would later lead to \n     increased rates of violence. Although there had been dozens \n     of laboratory investigations and short-term field studies (3 \n     months or less), few long-term field studies (2 years or \n     more) had been completed and reported. Since the 1982 \n     National Institute of Mental Health report, long-term field \n     studies have come into their own, some 20 having now been \n     published.\\8\\\n       In my commentary, I discuss television's effects within the \n     context of normal child development; give an overview of \n     natural exposure to television as a cause of aggression and \n     violence; summarize my own research findings on television as \n     a cause of violence; and suggest a course of action.\n\n\n         TELEVISION IN THE CONTEXT OF NORMAL CHILD DEVELOPMENT\n\n       The impact of television on children is best understood \n     within the context of normal child development. Neonates are \n     born with an instinctive capacity and desire to imitate adult \n     human behavior. That infants can, and do, imitate an array of \n     adult facial expressions has been demonstrated in neonates as \n     young as a few hours old, ie, before they are even old enough \n     to know cognitively that they themselves have facial features \n     that correspond with those they are observing.\\9\\, \n     \\10\\ It is a most useful instinct, for the developing child \n     must learn and master a vast repertoire of behavior in short \n     order.\n       Whereas infants have an instinctive desire to imitate \n     observed human behavior, they do not possess an instinct for \n     gauging a priori whether a behavior ought to be imitated. \n     They will imitate anything,\\11\\ including behaviors that most \n     adults would regard as destructive and antisocial. It may \n     give pause for thought, then, to learn that infants as young \n     as 14 months of age demonstrably observe and incorporate \n     behaviors seen on television\\12\\, \\13\\ (Looking \n     ahead, in two surveys of young male felons imprisoned for \n     committing violent crimes, eg, homicide, rape, and assault, \n     22% to 34% reported having consciously imitated crime \n     techniques learned from television programs, usually \n     successfully.\\14\\)\n       As of 1990, the average American child aged 2 to 5 years \n     was watching over 27 hours of television per week.\\15\\ This \n     might not be bad, if young children understood what they are \n     watching. However, up through ages 3 and 4 years, many \n     children are unable to distinguish fact from fantasy in \n     television programs and remain unable to do so despite adult \n     coaching.\\16\\ In the minds of such young children, television \n     is a source of entirely factual information regarding how the \n     world works. Naturally, as they get older, they come to know \n     better, but the earliest and deepest impressions were laid \n     down when the child saw television as a factual source of \n     information about a world outside their homes where violence \n     is a daily commonplace and the commission of violence is \n     generally powerful, exciting, charismatic, and efficacious. \n     Serious violence is most likely to erupt at moments of severe \n     stress--and it is precisely at such moments that adolescents \n     and adults are most likely to revert to their earliest, most \n     visceral sense of what violence is and what its role is in \n     society. Much of this sense will have come from \n     television.\n       Not all laboratory experiments and short-term field studies \n     demonstrate an effect of media violence on children's \n     behavior, but most do.17,18 In a recent meta-\n     analysis of randomized, case-control, short-term studies,\n\n[[Page S5201]]\n\n     exposure to media violence caused, on the average, a \n     significant increase in children's aggressiveness as measured \n     by observation of their spontaneous, natural behavior \n     following exposure (P\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/13/senate-section/article/S5214-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5214-S5259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE CRISIS IN KOSOVO\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have spoken a number of times on the \nfloor of the Senate about the crisis in Kosovo. I think it is \nimportant, under the circumstances, that I do so again in order to pose \nsome critical questions that have emerged recently about United States \nand NATO policy there.\n  I saw a window of opportunity for diplomacy. I was really optimistic \ngiven the direction of the G-8 countries. I thought we were then going \nto be going to the United Nations, and we had an opportunity perhaps \nthrough diplomacy to bring this conflict to an end.\n  I think that given what has happened over the weekend, and given the \nvery delicate discussions now underway involving NATO, the U.N. \nSecretary General, Russia, China, and other key players, it is time to \nreconsider a proposal that I made 10 days ago: a brief, conditional \npause in the airstrike campaign to allow for a de-escalation of this \nmilitary conflict.\n  Let me be clear. I continue to support the basic military, political \nand humanitarian goals that NATO has outlined: the safe return of \nrefugees to their homes; the withdrawal of Serb security forces; the \npresence of robustly armed international forces capable of protecting \nrefugees and monitoring Serb compliance; full access to Kosovo for \nnongovernmental organizations aiding the refugees; and Serb willingness \nto participate in meaningful negotiations on Kosovo's status.\n  These goals must be met. But in the wake of the Chinese Embassy \naccident, NATO needs to be even more focused on diplomacy, and I think \nwe have to be very careful to not appear to be belligerent in our \npublic statements--to be strong in terms of the goals that have to be \nmet but be creative in our diplomacy.\n  I don't really know what there is to the withdrawal of some of the \nSerb military. Secretary Cohen has raised some very important \nquestions. But on the floor of the Senate, I do want to point out that \ncontrary to some published reports of United States and public \nstatements that suggest that we intend to continue the airstrikes even \nagainst Serb forces who may actually be beginning to withdraw, I \nbelieve we and NATO should reiterate what we have been saying earlier--\nthat NATO will not strike at Serbian troops who are actively pulling \nout of Kosovo.\n  How can we expect even the Serbs to withdraw their troops if we have \nmade it clear that we will bomb them on the way out unless they have \nagreed to full withdrawal and outlined a timetable for it? Is this \nseeming new emphasis on continuing the airstrikes even if the\n\n[[Page S5215]]\n\ntroops are withdrawing a change in emphasis, or tone, or is it a \nsubstantive change? What precisely would the NATO rules of engagement \nbe if substantial numbers of Serb troops begin to actually withdraw \nfrom Kosovo? What did Milosevic's statement on a return to ``peacetime \ntroop levels'' mean? If he means a return to prewar levels, that is a \nnonstarter. What small token Serb forces, if any, would NATO allow to \nstay, as long as an armed international presence was allowed?\n  While I understand NATO's decision to remain silent, or to leave some \nambiguity on some of these questions, it has created an unnecessarily \nconfusing, and sometimes conflicting, set of policy prescriptions from \nNATO.\n  Mr. President, while I think a diplomatic solution is the best way to \nresolve this crisis, I want to make clear that I have no illusions \nabout Milosevic and what he has done. My disgust with his actions was \nonly increased yesterday when I read some of the information in the new \nState Department report entitled ``Erasing History: Ethnic Cleansing in \nKosovo.''\n  The report catalogs the horrific events that continue to unfold in \nKosovo. Interviews with thousands of refugees have revealed brutalities \nwhich boggle the mind and sicken the soul. I shudder to think what else \nwe will learn in the months and years to come after looking at forensic \nevidence within Kosovo. It is clear that even while the bombing \ncampaign has raged Kosovo has been emptied, and it has been burned.\n  Mr. President, let me just make it clear that I know why we have been \ninvolved, and I think we have launched our military actions with the \nbest intentions and with what I truly believe was sound moral \nauthority. But I am troubled now by some actions by NATO, including the \nso-called ``collateral'' damage we have wrought, and the embassy \nbombing, which I believe may undermine that sense of moral legitimacy.\n  The embassy incident is only the latest of targeted errors which have \ncaused civilian casualties. We have seen errant strikes on a refugee \nconvoy, a civilian train, a bus and other incidents. While I understand \nclearly the difference between the brutal, deliberate and systematic \nattacks of Serb forces, which have resulted in the deaths of thousands \nand displacement of over a million more, and the accidental death of \ncivilians caused by our wayward missiles, any serious moral reflection \nrequires us to consider the impact of our actions on innocent \ncivilians. Taken together, I fear these incidents are beginning to \nerode the moral authority of our efforts in Kosovo.\n  I do not mean to suggest in any way a moral equivalence between the \ntwo. But as the number of civilian casualties mounts, it will become \nincreasingly difficult to justify as we try to balance these \nregrettable losses against whatever progress we are making toward our \ngoal.\n  One way to put an end to Milosevic's atrocities and to the recurring \ncycle of collateral damage and NATO apologies may be to pursue a more \ncreative coupling of our military, political and diplomatic goals.\n  Last week, I called for a brief, conditional and reciprocal pause in \nour military action. I wish we had done so. On NATO's part, this would \nentail a bombing pause of perhaps 48 hours. Such a pause--if it can be \nworked out in a way which would protect NATO troops and would not risk \nSerb resupply of their war machine--could help to reinvigorate--and I \nthink we need to now--diplomatic efforts and halt the steady movement \ntoward bombing that we have now seen which could lead to a deeper \ninvolvement and a wider war. Mr. President, we need to reinvigorate our \ndiplomatic efforts, and we need to halt the steady movement in the \nbombing. We need to figure out a way that we can involve critical \nparties and countries in a diplomatic effort.\n  While my proposal is not the proposal that comes from the Chinese and \nRussians, it is more qualified. And it would require a more immediate \nreciprocal response from Milosevic.\n  I believe we need to take this step. I am not naive about whether we \ncan trust Milosevic. We have seen him break his word too many times \nwith that. We may even be seeing that again now in what NATO leaders \nhave called a ``feint'' of a partial withdrawal. I am not proposing an \nopen-ended halt in our efforts, but I am talking about a temporary \npause of 48 hours or so offered on condition that Milosevic not be \nallowed to use the period to resupply his troops, or to repair his air \ndefenses, and that he immediately order his forces in Kosovo to halt \ntheir attacks and to begin to actually withdraw. It would not \nrequire his formal prior assent to each of these conditions. But if our \nintelligence and other means of verification concludes that he is \ntaking military advantage of such a pause by doing any of these things, \nwe should resume the bombing.\n\n  I believe, however, that we need to take this first step, a gesture, \nin order to move diplomacy forward and bring these horrors to an end.\n  Let me conclude by saying that as a Senator I have been so impressed \nby the heroic efforts of nongovernmental organizations to bring \nhumanitarian supplies by convoy to hundreds of thousands of homeless \nand starving misplaced refugees still wandering in the mountains of \nKosovo. I believe a pause might very well serve their interests. It \nmight enable these aid organizations and other neutrals in the conflict \nto more easily airlift or truck in and then distribute relief supplies \nto them without the threat of their humanitarian mission being halted \nby the Serbian military. A Serb guarantee of their safe conduct would \nbe an important reciprocal gesture on the part of Milosevic. These \npeople must be rescued. My hope is that a temporary bombing pause might \nhelp to enable aid organizations to get there.\n  Mr. President, I intend to press these questions that I have raised \nwith the administration officials later today. I think we have an \nopportunity still for diplomacy. We must not allow this window of \nopportunity provided by the Russians and others to close.\n  I thank my colleagues for their graciousness.\n  I urge the President and his foreign policy advisers to consider \nsteps to deescalate this military conflict, and to work with our \nallies, with the U.N. Secretary General, with the Russians and others \nto take advantage of whatever opportunities present themselves to forge \na just and lasting peace which restores the Kosovar Albanians to their \nhome, provides for their protection and for their secure futures, \nallows aid groups access to them, and provides for negotiation on their \npolitical status.\n  We must move forward now. I wish that we could have had this pause \nthat I called for 10 days ago. I am extremely worried about the \nrepercussions of the bombing of the embassy in China. I am worried \nabout the events in Russia. I am worried about a window of opportunity \nfor diplomacy closing and more escalation in this military conflict.\n  I think it is important that we take this step under the conditions \nthat I have outlined.\n  I am going to continue to press forward with this proposal. I hope \nthat in the Senate next week we will again have a discussion and debate \nabout the events in Kosovo, about our military involvement, about where \nwe are, about where NATO is, and what we need to do to achieve our \nobjective.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act and the amendments made by this Act shall take \n     effect 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, all of us are concerned and deeply so \nabout what we think is a changing landscape in American culture. We are \nconcerned about the fact that young people whom we once felt were the \nrepository for the innocence of the culture are no longer that \nrepository. We find ourselves being outraged and stunned when we find \nactivity in juvenile quarters which are really threatening to all of \nus. That is why the whole juvenile justice topic is before us. We are \namazingly aware, painfully aware, of the fact that we need to take \nsteps to improve the way we deal with young people and to curtail the \namount of criminal activity and behavior among those who are the young \npeople of our culture.\n  It is important that we debate this issue in the Senate. It is \nimportant that we offer legislative responses to this serious challenge \nto the public safety and security of people and their families. But we \nshouldn't try to telegraph or to communicate the fact that we are \naddressing this, that we think that we can do everything that is \nnecessary for a safer and saner approach to life by all of our citizens \nincluding young people.\n  There is much that simply can't be done by government. The resources \nof the State are inadequate to shape the culture totally and completely \nand to bring the kind of result that we want.\n  The fact that we are here to talk about things that we can do doesn't\n\n[[Page S5217]]\n\nmean we believe that what we can do will totally accommodate or \notherwise remediate the problem. We should do what we can do. I believe \nit is important to look around and ask how can we improve the situation \nand the legal framework.\n  One of the aspects of juvenile justice that we are discussing today \nis the access that juveniles have to firearms. In my hometown of \nSpringfield, MO, and towns and cities across Missouri and across the \nUnited States, parents have long played an active and crucial role in \nteaching children the safe and responsible use of firearms.\n  However, Federal law already recognizes that certain firearms involve \na higher level of responsibility than others. Handguns, for instance, \nhave long been recognized as requiring greater restrictions than other \nfirearms. Of course, any restriction must respect the second amendment \nrights of American citizens, one of the fundamental rights enjoyed \nunder the Bill of Rights under the U.S. Constitution.\n  The amendment I propose today does exactly that. It simply extends \nthe recognition of the need for increased responsibility to certain \nmilitary-style semiautomatic assault weapons such as AK-47s and Uzis. \nIn part, this mirrors a bill which I introduced recently in the Senate, \nSenate bill 994. The amendment which I have sent to the desk restricts \nthe acquisition and possession of semiautomatic assault rifles and \nhigh-capacity ammunition-feeding devices--those holding over 10 rounds \nof ammunition--by juveniles.\n  Let me say again what this amendment does. This amendment restricts \njuveniles from acquiring semiautomatic assault weapon rifles and high-\ncapacity ammunition-feeding devices--meaning those feeding devices \nwhich hold over 10 rounds of ammunition. It says juveniles do not have \nthe authority to acquire, to purchase, or to possess those rifles \ngenerally.\n\n  Let me be clear about what this amendment does not do. This amendment \ndoes not affect the lawful ownership or possession of semiautomatic \nhunting or target rifles or semiautomatic shotguns, the kind of \nfirearms that are routinely used responsibly by young people and \nAmerican citizens across our country in hunting. It does restrict the \npossession and purchase of semiautomatic assault weapons and the high-\ncapacity ammunition-feeding devices associated with them.\n  Current Federal gun law can be awfully complicated, but this \namendment is not complicated. It is a straightforward commonsense \namendment. Let me refer to a chart which shows the existing law. \nAlready, the law requires elevated levels of responsibility in terms of \nhandguns so that a juvenile individual is prohibited from purchasing a \nhandgun from a federally licensed dealer, prohibited from purchasing a \nhandgun in a private transaction or sale, and must have the permission \nof a parent in order to possess or use the handgun. I repeat, cannot \nbuy from a licensed dealer, cannot buy in a private sale, and must have \npermission to use or possess.\n  Current Federal law in regard to semiautomatic assault rifles \nprohibits the sale by a federally licensed dealer to a juvenile, but \npermits juveniles to purchase semiautomatic assault rifles from \nindividuals in private sales, and does not require a juvenile to have \nparental permission in order to possess or use such a firearm.\n  We have a disparity. Handguns have been prohibited for sale both \nprivately and through licensed dealers and require parental permission; \nsemiautomatic assault rifles, or AKs or Uzis, although prohibited for \nsale by a licensed dealer, juveniles are permitted to purchase at \nprivate sales; and juveniles require no parental permission. What we \nare proposing takes care of this disparity.\n  It says we will treat semiautomatic assault weapons as we treat \nhandguns, that we will prohibit the acquisition of these weapons and \nfirearms by juveniles from private sales just as they have been \nprohibited from federally licensed dealers, and we would require any \npossession by a juvenile of such a firearm to be an acknowledged and \npermitted possession of that firearm by the adult or the guardian \nparent of the juvenile.\n  It is pretty clear that what we have done here is to simplify the law \nby saying the same basic rules that apply to juveniles on handguns will \napply to juveniles in semiautomatic assault weapons or assault rifles.\n  The law currently says in regard to a handgun you can teach your \nchild to shoot a handgun but he can't shoot it without your permission. \nBasically, this would harmonize semiautomatic assault rifles with the \nlaw regarding handguns.\n  Now, there are under existing law some permitted uses of handguns by \njuveniles. If a juvenile is in the military service or if a juvenile is \nin lawful defense of himself against an intruder into his house, he is \nallowed to use a handgun--eminently reasonable. Those basic exceptions \nought to be transferred or ought to exist for other firearms, as well.\n  Transfer of title to a firearm like this to a juvenile is permitted \nby inheritance, though the juvenile may not take possession until age \n18, absent the kind of permission which would be required not only for \nthis but for handguns.\n  My amendment simply treats semiautomatic assault weapons such as the \nAK-47s and the Uzis, street-sweeper shotguns, and high-capacity \nammunition-feeding devices the same way for juveniles that we treat \nhandguns. Private parties can no longer sell them to juveniles, and the \njuvenile needs parental permission to possess one unless he is in the \nmilitary or uses it for self-defense.\n  What kind of weapons are we talking about that have been permitted to \nbe sold to juveniles but would be prohibited under this amendment? The \nlist includes: the AK-47, the Uzis, the Galil, Beretta AR 70, Colt AR-\n15, Fabrique Nationale FN or FAL, SWD M 10, M-11, M-11 1/9, the Steyr \nAug, the TEC-9, street-sweeper shotgun, Striker-12 shotgun, and other \nsemiautomatic rifles and shotguns with at least two military features, \nsuch as folding stocks, pistol grips, bayonet gloves, and grenade \nlaunchers.\n  These are serious firearms. Because they are serious, they create \nsome new serious penalties. This amendment creates a new penalty of up \nto 20 years' incarceration for possession of handgun ammunition or \nsemiautomatic assault weapon or high-capacity ammunition-feeding device \nwith the intent to possess, carry, or use it in a crime of violence in \na school zone. It raises the penalty for transferring a firearm to a \njuvenile, knowing that it will be used in a crime of violence or drug \ncrime, to 20 years.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, as chairman of the Youth Violence \nSubcommittee, I very much appreciate Senator Ashcroft's leadership on \nthis particular issue. But not just this one, on the entire package of \nlegislation we have put together today. He has conducted hearings in \nMissouri, which I was pleased to be able to attend. We heard from \nvictims of crime. We heard from police officers. We heard from young \npeople. We went out and met with law enforcement officers who were \nbreaking up drug labs. In the course of that, one of the things we \ndealt with was adult criminals using young people to commit crimes for \nthem. Senator Ashcroft has prepared that part of our bill in \nparticular, which I think is invaluable, because young people do get \ntreated less severely, and older adults are using them to commit \ncrimes.\n  Zeroing in on some weapons that young people do not need to be able \nto receive in any fashion is good legislation. As chairman of that \nsubcommittee, I appreciate Senator Ashcroft, former attorney general of \nthe State of Missouri, former Governor of the State, for his leadership \nthroughout this process. I have enjoyed working with him and look \nforward to continuing to do so as we move this bill through to success.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Senator. I appreciate his work, coming to \nMissouri to participate in the hearing.\n  It became clear to us that adults using children to commit crimes--\nhoping the children would be excused because of their youth and they \nwould all escape penalty--brings children into a criminal environment. \nIt starts them down a path of crime. That is very dangerous, and this \nproposal which we are considering today obviously would elevate the \npenalties for that about threefold. I am delighted.\n\n[[Page S5218]]\n\n  Again, let me refer to this amendment that really harmonizes the law \nso the same kinds of prohibitions apply to semiautomatic assault \nweapons as apply to handguns. There are a few clarifying changes in the \nexisting law. It makes it clear that parental permission allows \npossession, either with parental supervision or with prior written \npermission of a parent. Even with this parental permission, juveniles \ncan only possess these weapons for three narrow purposes: For target \nshooting; for gun safety courses; or if required for their employment \nin ranching, farming, or lawful hunting. Such a firearm being \ntransported by a juvenile must be unloaded and in a locked case, under \nthis amendment. So for a juvenile, even if he was transporting for one \nof these lawful purposes--that also relates to handguns, I might add--\nthe law requires the weapon be unloaded and in a locked case.\n  Likewise, this amendment allows prior written permission to be \nretained by a parent instead of carried by the juvenile in the case of \njuvenile possession incident to employment, ranching, or farming \nactivities. In other words, if on a ranch a youngster is carrying a \npistol, obviously the written permission can exist in the ranch house \nwhile the youngster is doing chores or away from the house with the \npistol.\n  Finally, the amendment clarifies the self-defense provision of the \nlaw by permitting possession in lawful defense of self or others in a \nresidence against any threat to the life of the individuals there. I \nthink it is only reasonable to conclude it should not be illegal for a \nyoung person to pick up a handgun to defend himself and his family in \nthe event he is in his home and is the victim of a threat to his own \nlife.\n  If parents want to teach children to use firearms responsibly, the \nlaw should not stand in the way. This law encourages parents to play an \nactive role in the lives of their children and respects the judgment of \nparents. It does not suggest we in Washington know best and are better \nequipped than parents to make decisions. But it does say, as it relates \nto semiautomatic assault rifles and weapons, the provisions that relate \nto handguns ought to be the provisions that relate to semiautomatic \nrifles. That means this amendment would prohibit the private sale of a \nsemiautomatic assault rifle to a juvenile and the possession of any \nassault rifle or similar weapon by a juvenile, absent the specific \npermission of a parent.\n  With that in mind, I think we take another step forward. We do not \ncure all the problems attendant to our society related to law-abiding \nresponsibilities of young people. But we do take a step forward to \nbring the law to a place of rationality and to prohibit possession of \nsemiautomatic assault rifles where pistols or handguns would be \nprohibited, and to prohibit such possession without the permission of a \nparent in a similar way to the way in which it has been prohibited for \nhandguns.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to comment on the amendment the \nSenator has just submitted before the body. I believe directly \nfollowing this amendment, I will be introducing an amendment. Last \nweek, I announced I would be introducing an amendment which had \nessentially all the parts that Senator Ashcroft has just introduced, \nplus one additional part. Let me comment on how his amendment differs \nfrom mine in the sense of the parts he has just talked about.\n  He has added exceptions relating to employment, ranching, farming, \nhunting, inheritance, target practice, and training. The exceptions in \nmy amendment are military and law enforcement.\n  He also creates a new penalty of up to 20 years for a juvenile who \nuses these weapons with the intent to commit a violent felony. I think \nthat is a very positive addition.\n  He does not make any transfer a felony, so the penalty would still be \nonly up to 1 year. That is, if you transfer an assault weapon to a \njuvenile, the penalty is only up to 1 year. That is part of the \nproblem. The penalty is so low, it is difficult to sustain or even make \nprosecutions. But I am very pleased he has seen fit to offer this \namendment.\n  I want for a moment to talk about what is missing from the amendment, \nwhich I will talk about more deeply on my own time. What is missing \nfrom the amendment is plugging a major loophole in the assault weapons \nlegislation which I presented to this body in 1993 as an amendment to \nthe crime bill and which is now law.\n  When the amendment came before the body and we were standing down in \nthe well, another Senator approached me and said: Would you mind if \nthere were an amendment which would permit the continued grandfathering \nof big clips into this country, particularly for those that have bills \nof lading on them already and are in transit? I said no. The amendment \nwent in and got broadened in the course of what turned out to be a \nrather cantankerous debate on the subject, back and forth between the \ntwo Houses.\n  This is significant because the failsafe in the assault weapons \nlegislation has to do with clips, in that the domestic manufacture of \nclips, drums, or strips of more than 10 bullets is prohibited in the \nUnited States subsequent to enactment of the assault weapons \nlegislation. That is now the law. The loophole is that these clips are \ncoming in from all around the world.\n  Let me give a few examples. Between March of 1998 and July of 1998, \nBATF approved permits for over 8 million of these clips. They came in \nfrom countries all over--from Austria to Zimbabwe.\n  Let me tell you some of the things that come in from Great Britain: \n826,000 clips, drums or strips, 250-round magazines, 177-round \nmagazines, 71-round magazines, 50-round magazines; from Germany, \n426,300; from Italy, 5,900,000, and on and on.\n  What is the significance of this? What gives an assault weapon the \nfirepower is, first, you can hold it at your hip with two hands and \nspray fire; secondly, most of them are capable of having a very light \ntrigger which you can pull very rapidly, and being semiautomatic, each \ntime you pull it, it dispenses a bullet; and the clips are very big. \nThe bigger the clip, the less the opportunity somebody has to disarm \nyou.\n  Hence, they have become the weapon of choice of grievance killers, of \ndrive-by shooters, of gangs, and of drug dealers. None of these big \nclips are necessary for hunting.\n  It always puzzles me why there is an exception. As a matter of fact, \noverwhelmingly, the great bulk of States prohibit more than seven \nbullets in a clip for hunting. Therefore, why you need to make an \nexception for hunting--I used to use a bow and arrow. I was pretty good \nat it. At least there was some sport in it. If you come along with a \nspray-fire assault weapon and you are hunting some poor deer, my \ngoodness, I am rooting for the deer, that's for sure.\n  I really question why we cannot plug this loophole. I tried last \nyear. We received 44 votes. I was told some people did not like the \ntiming of it and, therefore, I am trying at a time now when the \njuvenile justice bill is before this body.\n  Unless we close this loophole, we will continue to build a nation \nthat is awash with the kind of equipment that wreaks the devastation \nthat is occurring all over this country.\n  What the Senator has done is commendable. He has put forward \ncertainly some improvements. I have done the same thing with not as \nmany exceptions and added one other item.\n  I will probably vote for that amendment. I will also, though, press \nmy amendment because, as one who has lived this assault weapons issue \nnow for the past 6 years, unless we close some of these loopholes, the \npoint of the legislation, which is to dry up the huge supply of assault \nweapons as well as these big clips, essentially will not happen. This \nis an important loophole to be closed. That is essentially the \ndifference between our two amendments.\n  How much time remains on our side, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fourteen minutes, 52 seconds.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I want to take this time, if I may, to \ndo something I have never done before, certainly on the floor of the \nSenate, and share with you my personal experience with guns and why I \nfeel as strongly as I do with what is happening in this Nation with \nrespect to them.\n  In 1976, I was president of the board of supervisors in San \nFrancisco. There was a terrorist group by the name of\n\n[[Page S5219]]\n\nthe New World Liberation Front that was operating in the far west. They \nhad blown up power stations throughout the West. They targeted me and \nplaced a bomb in a flower box outside my house. The bomb had a \nconstruction-grade explosive which does not detonate below freezing. It \nnever drops below freezing in San Francisco. It was set to detonate at \n1:30 in the morning.\n  It did detonate, but the explosive washed up the side of the building \nand it did not explode. The timer went out in the street, and the next \nmorning, we found the explosive on the side of the house. It was a very \nsobering thing because it was right below my daughter's window. Then \nthis same group shot out about 15 windows in a beach house my husband \nand I owned.\n\n  I went to the police department and asked for protection, and I asked \nif I could learn to carry a weapon. So I received, in 1976, a concealed \nweapon permit to carry a weapon. I was trained at the police range. The \nweapon I carried was a chief's special 38, five shots. I practiced \nregularly.\n  My husband was going through cancer surgery at this time, and I \nremember walking back and forth to the hospital feeling safer because I \nhad this small gun in my purse. A year later, arrests were made, and I \nreturned the gun and, as a matter of fact, it was melted down with \nabout eight others into a cross which I was able to present to the Holy \nFather in Rome in the early 1980s.\n  Subsequent to that time, a direct contradictory incident changed my \nlife dramatically, when a colleague of mine on the board of supervisors \nsmuggled a gun in, a former police officer, and shot and killed the \nmayor and shot and killed a colleague.\n  I spoke about this very briefly on the floor once before, but I was \nthe one who found my colleague's body and put a finger through a bullet \nhole trying to get a pulse. I became mayor as a product of \nassassination in a most difficult time in my city's history.\n  Between those two incidents, I have seen the reassurance, albeit \nfalse, that a weapon can give someone under siege. With a terrorist \ngroup, one does not know when they will strike. I was very frightened. \nI decided I would try to fight back, if I could, and did the legal \nthings to be able to do it. So I understand that reassurance.\n  On the other hand, I have seen the criminal use of weapons. Then I \nbegan to see very clearly, between the late seventies and today, the \nevolution of the gun on the streets of America and seeing these very \nhigh-powered weapons striking hard and killing innocent people. I \nactually walked a block in Los Angeles where, in 6 months, 30 people \nwere mowed down by drive-by shooters carrying these weapons.\n  I went to 101 California Street and saw the devastation that an \naggrieved man brought about when he walked in with assault weapons and \nmowed down innocent people.\n  Let me tell you a couple of the characteristics of some of these \nweapons. I will begin with the weapon that was used in Littleton.\n  The Intratech TEC-9, TEC-DC9, TEC-22 is a favorite weapon of drug \ndealers, according to BATF gun data. One out of every five assault \nweapons traced from a crime is a TEC-9, according to BATF. It comes \nstandard with a 30- to 36-round ammunition magazine capable of being \nfired as fast as the operator can pull the trigger. It is one of the \nmost inexpensive semiautomatic assault weapons available. The original \npistol version, called KG-9, was so easily converted to fully automatic \nit was reclassified by the BATF in 1982 as a machine gun.\n  The TEC-22 is very similar to the TEC-9 and TEC-DC9 and fires .22 \ncaliber ammunition, manufactured in the United States.\n  The other one widely used is the AK-47. It is the most widely used \nassault weapon in the world, now manufactured in many countries. An \nestimated 20 to 50 million have been produced. It comes standard with a \n30-round ammunition magazine capable of being fired as fast as the \noperator can pull the trigger. Some models are available with \ncollapsible stock to facilitate accountability, developed in 1947 in \nthe Soviet Union.\n  These are two of the weapons most used--banned by the assault weapons \nlegislation.\n  What is the problem? The problem is the gun manufacturers are so \ncraven that whatever you write, they find a way to get around it, to \nproduce a thumb-hole stock or some other device, but to continue the \nbasics of the weapon--that it can be held in two hands, that it can be \nspray fired. And what enables it to be so lethal and used in grievance \nkillings and used by drive-by shooters and used by gangs is the big \nclips. No one can get to you to disarm you if you have a 70-round clip, \na 90-round clip, or two 30-round clips strapped together.\n  So the purpose of the assault weapons legislation was to dry up that \nsupply, not to take one away from anybody but over time dry up the \nsupply. Today, no one in this country can manufacture a clip, drum, or \nstrip of more than 10 bullets. No one can sell it legally. No one can \npossess it legally if it is made postban. The loophole is that they are \npouring in from 20 different nations.\n  I went to the President, and I said: Can you use your executive \nauthority to stop it? Just as he did with the foreign importation of \nassault weapons. What I was told by Justice was, no, we need \nlegislation to close the loophole.\n  So I say to the Senator, where my legislation differs from yours is \nin exceptions and plugging this loophole. I very much hope we can plug \nthe loophole. I very much hope the intent of your legislation isn't to \nsubmarine my legislation, isn't to prevent the closure of this \nloophole, which, as submitted to me right down there--I will never \nforget where it happened--was simply a grandfather clause to permit \nthose weapons that had bills of lading on them in transport coming into \nthis country. And I believe it should be closed. I believe the supply \nshould be dried up.\n  Let me talk about the school killings and how these clips come into \nit for a moment.\n  I sent my staff to buy some of these clips. Let's see if it is easy; \nlet's see if it is hard.\n  On the Internet, no questions asked. It is $8, $10 for a clip; no \nquestions asked. Give your mother's credit card and you get it in the \nmail within a couple of days. We bought a 75-round magazine for an AK-\n47. And we bought several 30-round clips for $7.99, $8. And then if it \nslips into the weapon, you have a gun that can kill 30 people before \nyou can be disarmed. That is why I so desperately want to plug this \nloophole.\n  As I believe the time is up, I yield the floor and will continue this \non my own time. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am happy to yield such time to the Senator from Idaho \nas he might consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Missouri for \nyielding.\n  I stand in support of what I think is a very needed piece of \nlegislation. While I stand always in defense of the constitutional \nright of law-abiding citizens to own guns, I also recognize the \ntremendously valuable linkage between rights and responsibilities and \nthe ability of people to understand what those responsibilities are and \nto perform them in law-abiding ways.\n\n  The Senator from Missouri has recognized that in the laws we \ncurrently have, there is the potential, if not the reality, where we \nsay to juveniles they cannot own handguns, up to a certain age, and \nthat in fact we have seen there is a possibility, by definition of \n``semiauto,'' that they could own one.\n  Certainly, in the case of Littleton, CO, the acts were illegal. That \ndoes not make the point. The point is, the law needs to be specific. \nThat is what the Senator from Missouri is doing at this moment. He is \nmaking it very clear, as it relates to semiauto assault weaponry and \nthe loading devices, that they be appropriately prescribed under the \nlaw as it relates to juveniles and that which we prohibit juveniles \nfrom possessing.\n  So I stand certainly in support of this. I encourage my colleagues to \nvote for it. I think it is the refinement of the laws of our country \nrelating to gun ownership that clearly is deserving and appropriate in \nthis legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n\n[[Page S5220]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I inquire how much time remains.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri has 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California for \nher kind remarks about the intent that is expressed in making sure we \nprovide the same kind of restrictions for semiautomatic assault weapons \nthat we provide for handguns.\n  I just say this is an important amendment. This is the subject of \nlegislation I have previously filed in the Senate. I think this is \nappropriate because this addresses the subject matter of this bill, \nwhich is the juvenile justice framework. This is not, obviously, a \ncomprehensive approach to such weapons but it is very clear and \nspecific in terms of its reference to juveniles and their possession of \nnot only the weapons but the kind of expanded or substantial clips or \nmagazines, and it simply says juveniles are ineligible to possess those \nkinds of expanded clips or magazines.\n  So I believe this measure is appropriate and it will harmonize the \nlaw to say that juveniles do not have greater authority to possess \nsemiautomatic assault rifles than they do to possess handguns. This \nharmonizes the law and brings it into a place of reasonability.\n  I am grateful for the opportunity to present this amendment. I \nappreciate, and will appreciate, the support of colleagues who intend \nto vote on behalf of this amendment.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. How much time remains on both sides, please?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute 29 seconds for Senator \nAshcroft; and 4 minutes 27 seconds in opposition.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment to be offered by \nthe Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein.\n  Let me tell you two things that happened yesterday on Capitol Hill \nwhich most people across America would find nothing short of \nincredible. We had a chance on the floor of the Senate to say that if \nyou went to a gun show and bought a gun, you would be subject to the \nsame law as anyone who walked into a gun dealer. In other words, we \nwould check your background. Are you a felon; do you have a criminal \nrecord; do you have a history of violent mental illness?\n  Before we sell a gun at a gun show, we wanted to make sure there was \nless likelihood that people would walk in with those problems and walk \nout with a gun. We were defeated. The National Rifle Association \ndefeated that amendment. Despite the best efforts of Senator Frank \nLautenberg of New Jersey and many of us, we were defeated.\n  Instead, this Senate passed an amendment by the Senator from Idaho \nwhich went in the opposite direction and made it easier for people to \nbuy guns without background checks. In fact, the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from Idaho, adopted by this Senate, said you could walk \ninto a pawn shop and buy your gun back without any background check.\n  What is wrong with that? Five times as many criminal felons put their \nguns in pawn shops as regular citizens. So what the National Rifle \nAssociation did with this amendment by the Senator from Idaho was make \nit easier for those who use guns in crime to get those guns without a \nbackground check.\n  America has to be standing back and saying: Did the Senate learn \nanything from what happened in Littleton, CO? Can we do anything to \ndeal with gun violence?\n  Then, last night, I went to a conference committee on the emergency \nsupplemental bill, and I said to the gathered members of the House and \nSenate, please, we are considering a bill worth billions of dollars. \nCan we put some money in to help our schools--$265 million so we can \nhire more counselors in schools to help troubled children; $100 million \nfor more afterschool programs so that kids can be in a constructive, \npositive, safe environment. They said no, not a penny. In this \nemergency supplemental bill, not one penny for America's schools, but \n$6 billion more for military spending than President Clinton asked for, \nbillions of dollars to be spent around the world for problems which the \nUnited States is involved in, but not a penny to be spent on safety in \nschools.\n  What a message. What a message coming out of Capitol Hill yesterday. \nIf these are truly representative bodies in the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives, to whom have they been listening? They haven't been \nlistening to the families across America who want us to stand up and do \nsomething about gun violence. They have been listening to the National \nRifle Association. They haven't been listening to the kids that we met \nwith this morning from all across the United States, who came in and \ntalked about their worries and their concerns about safety in schools. \nAnd they sure haven't been listening to the parents, worried to death \nabout another school year and more violence.\n  If this Senate is going to be truly representative of the people who \nsent us here, if we are going to do something to show leadership \ninstead of powerlessness to groups like the National Rifle Association, \nwe should pass the amendment of Senator Dianne Feinstein.\n  Stop these ammunition clips. Who on God's green Earth needs an \nammunition clip with 250 bullets in it? If you need that kind of \nammunition to go out and shoot a deer, you ought to stick to fishing.\n  The bottom line is, this amendment is sensible. She is trying to stop \nthose who are buying ammunition clips that are designed to do one \nthing--kill human beings. Yet, the National Rifle Association says it \nis our constitutional right to buy these. Ridiculous.\n  Ask the families across America whether the Dianne Feinstein \namendment makes sense and they will say yes. Ask them whether Senator \nFrank Lautenberg's amendment, to make sure that we check the \nbackgrounds of people before they buy these guns at gun shows, is the \nsort of thing we want to make certain it is safe for all Americans. \nThey will say yes; that makes sense.\n  Time and again, we are going to give our colleagues, Democrats and \nRepublicans, on the Senate floor a chance to stand up and decide \nwhether they are going to be for the families across America who want \nsafety in schools or whether they are going to shrink away in cowardice \nbecause of the National Rifle Association. Let us do the right thing. \nLet us adopt Senator Feinstein's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time in opposition has expired. The \nSenator from Missouri has a minute and a half.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, this is a simple amendment. It simply \nsays that what we ought to do in regard to semiautomatic assault \nweapons in our schools, for young people, is to require them to have \nthe same kind of rules we have for handguns. Most people think that a \nsemiautomatic assault weapon is much more dangerous than a handgun. \nYet, under current law, you are permitted to buy one as a juvenile. You \ndon't have to have your parents' permission like you do with a handgun, \nwhere you are prohibited and you do have to have your parents' \npermission.\n  So what we are talking about in this law is, for semiautomatic \nweapons, you are prohibited from buying them as a juvenile. And you \ncannot even possess one unless you have a clear indication of your \nparents' permission.\n  We have also dealt with juveniles in these clips that are being \nspoken of and simply said that they are not eligible to possess these \nclips, that this kind of automatic ammunition-feeding device is not \nappropriate for and, therefore, is prohibited, in terms of selling to, \nin the same way that we would prohibit the sales to young people of \nsemiautomatic assault weapons. It does not include traditional hunting \nweapons, and we are not talking about these kind of things that are \nmentioned as spray-firing weapons. As a matter of fact, semiautomatic \nis not spray firing. Spray firing is a machine gun.\n  We are simply making the rules for semiautomatic assault weapons the \nsame as they are for handguns. It a change that ought to be made. I \nurge my colleagues to vote in favor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The Senator from California is recognized to offer an amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 343\n\n       (Purpose: Relating to assault weapons)\n\n\n[[Page S5221]]\n\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair. I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of myself and Senators Chafee, Kennedy, Schumer, Torricelli, \nDurbin, Levin, Landrieu, Murray, and Inouye.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n  The Senator from California (Mrs. Feinstein), for herself, Mr. \nChafee, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Levin, Mr. \nDurbin, Ms. Landrieu, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. Inouye, proposes an \namendment numbered 343.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is designed to close several loopholes \nin laws that allow juveniles to obtain big guns. The amendment will ban \njuvenile possession of semiautomatic assault weapons. It will ban \njuvenile possession of large-capacity ammunition magazines. It will ban \nfuture importation of large-capacity ammunition magazines, and it makes \nthe transfer of a handgun, semiautomatic assault weapon or high-\ncapacity clip to a juvenile a felony, punishable by up to 5 years in \nprison.\n  It increases the maximum penalty for transferring a handgun to a \njuvenile, with knowledge that it will be used to commit a crime, from \n10 to 20 years. It does that same thing for transfer of a semiautomatic \nassault weapon to a juvenile.\n  I think we have had a good discussion on the first part of the \namendment with Senator Ashcroft's legislation; that is, the amendment \nbanning juvenile possession of a semiautomatic assault weapon. Current \nlaw already prohibits any person under the age of 18 from owning or \npossessing a handgun, with certain very limited exceptions. Yet, the \nlaw does nothing to prevent a juvenile from possessing the deadliest of \nassault weapons, those banned by our legislation of 1994. This would \nclose that loophole.\n  Secondly, the amendment bans juvenile possession of large-capacity \nammunition-feeding devices.\n  Now, what is a large-capacity ammunition-feeding device? It is \nsomething like this, where 30 rounds go into this clip. The clip goes \nup into the weapon, and you can use the weapon and spray fire, having a \nlarge number of bullets. Most assault weapons come standard with 20- or \n30-round clips. These big drums or clips are the tools that allow a \nperson to rapidly fire shot after shot after shot with no opportunity \nto be disarmed.\n  As I said earlier, they have no sporting purpose. Anybody who sees \nsomebody deer hunting with one of these, root for the deer because you \ndon't have much of a hunter if it takes 30 bullets in an assault weapon \nto take down a deer.\n  For both of these two provisions, the ban on juvenile possession of \nassault weapons and high-capacity clips, there are two exceptions. A \njuvenile may still use or possess a handgun, assault weapon, or high-\ncapacity ammunition magazine if he or she is a member of the Armed \nForces or the National Guard, and the use of such items is in the line \nof duty. Secondly, a juvenile may still use or possess a handgun, \nassault weapon, or high-capacity ammunition if these items are \ntemporarily being used to defend a home. So, in other words, if there \nis one in the home and the home is invaded by a number of masked \ngunmen, the youth can certainly legally pick up that weapon to defend \nhimself or herself. Throughout my amendment, a juvenile is defined as a \nperson under the age of 18.\n  The third provision I have offered would finally stop the importation \nof large-capacity ammunition-feeding devices, and that is what the \nother side of the aisle wants to permit to continue to happen. As I \nmentioned earlier when we passed the legislation in 1994, a grandfather \nclause was in it to permit those shipments that have bills of lading on \nthem to come into the country. What a mistake I made at that time. I \nshould have fought it tooth and nail. It was then expanded, and you \nhave the loophole that exists today. It has now been more than 4 years, \nand I believe anybody who has made pre-1994 assault weapons and clips \nhas had an opportunity to import them into this Nation. My goodness, \nBATF, in 6 months, approves permits for 8.6 million of them. Now, look \nat the number of years that have gone by already. If you multiply every \n6 months by 8.6 million, you will get a sense of the number that are \ncoming in.\n  Let me say, once again, it is illegal to manufacture them \ndomestically, sell them domestically, and possess them domestically, if \nthey were made after the ban. The problem is, BATF has no way of \nknowing whether the clip, once it is in, was made before or after the \nban because BATF can't go to Austria, or Great Britain, or Italy, or \nZimbabwe, or Czechoslovakia, or East Germany, or any of these other \nplaces where these big clips are made and brought into this country.\n  Last year, the President stopped the importation of most copycat \nassault weapons into this country with an executive order. The Justice \nDepartment has advised that the President doesn't have the authority to \nban the big clips and close the loophole. That is why the legislation \nis before us today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a document entitled \n``Firearms and Explosives Import Branch, High-Capacity Magazine Import \nTotals,

Once again, this describes the countries--Austria, \nBelgium, Chile, Costa Rica, Czech Republic, Denmark, England, Germany, \nGreece, Hungary, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Nicaragua, South Africa, \nSwitzerland, Taiwan, and Zimbabwe--where during this 6-month period \nthese big clips received permits.\n  The final provision in this amendment will increase penalties on any \nperson who sells or transfers a handgun, assault weapon, or high-\ncapacity ammunition magazine to a juvenile. Any transfer of a handgun, \nassault weapon, or one of these clips to a juvenile, under my \nlegislation, would become a felony punishable by up to 5 years in \nprison. And any person who transfers to a juvenile, knowing that it is \ngoing to be used to commit a crime, is subject to a maximum penalty of \n20 years. As I said earlier, the legislation applies the handgun \nprohibition to assault weapons as well.\n  Now, let me just speak for a moment about what we have seen happen in \nthe last 3 years. Since I became, I might say, gun-sensitive in 1976, I \nhave watched incidents develop in the United States. It is not hard for \nany of us to see that what has happened is a combination of things. In \nthe first place, there are parents that, apparently, don't teach their \nyoungsters values; schools that are too big; counselors that are too \nrare; the burgeoning group of youngsters who feel aggrieved or not \naccepted or not ``one of them,'' or is jealous, is going to essentially \nhave the last laugh by going in and really taking out a large number of \nstudents. We saw it in Moses Lake, WA; Bethel, AK; Pearl, MS; West \nPaducah, KY; Jonesboro, AR, which involved 2 killers, one of them just \n11 years old; Edinboro, PA; Fayetteville, TN; Springfield, OR; and now \nLittleton, CO. All of these took place not in Los Angeles, New York, \nDetroit, Chicago, Cleveland, or San Francisco, but in small suburban \ncommunities, many of them deeply religious, most of them middle to \nupper-class socioeconomically.\n  So what has happened? I believe that what happened is we have seen \nthe fomenting of a culture of violence surrounding youngsters. I have \nused this before and I will use it again. I would like to read directly \nfrom the Washington Post article dated Monday, May 11:\n\n       Angry 5-year-old Took Gun to School. Memphis. Five-year-old \n     kindergartner was arrested after bringing a loaded pistol to \n     school because he wanted to kill his teacher for punishing \n     him with a ``time out,'' according to police records. The .25 \n     caliber semiautomatic pistol in the child's backpack was \n     confiscated by teacher Maggie Foster on Friday after another \n     pupil brought her a bullet. ``He said he wanted to shoot and \n     kill several pupils as well as a teacher,'' the arrest ticket \n     said. He stated he was going to shoot Ms. Foster for putting \n     him in ``time out,'' a form of discipline for young children.\n       The boy was charged with carrying a weapon. It was unclear \n     if he would be prosecuted. ``A five-year-old is not capable \n     of forming criminal intent,'' juvenile court Judge Kenneth \n     Turner said. ``The boy got the gun from atop his \n     grandfather's bedroom dresser,'' said Jerry Manassass, \n     juvenile director of court services. The boy and his mother \n     live with the grandfather. ``The State's Department of \n     Children Services will investigate the boy's home \n     situation,'' officials said.\n\n  And that's that.\n  Doesn't that frighten you? Doesn't it make you think that this Nation \nis so awash with guns that it has even trickled down to a five-year-old \nwho knows enough to pick up a gun and take it to school? It frightens \nme, and I believe it concerns the dominant majority of American people. \nWe have a chance to do something about it.\n  We can't entirely change the culture. We can pass, as we have, \ncertain pieces of legislation. We can use the bully pulpit. We can talk \nabout parents keeping their guns safe. We can use trigger locks. We can \nmake parents responsible--all of which I think we should do. But the \none thing we can and we must do is keep large firepower out of the \nhands of juveniles. The more you proliferate these weapons and make it \neasy for youngsters to obtain the ammunition feeding devices, just by \nusing their computer, just by punching in their family's credit card, \nwe create the situation where more lives can be taken.\n  Almost 1 in 12 high school students report having carried a gun in \nthe last 30 days. This is despite Senator Dorgan and my gun-free \nschools bill. In 1996, 2,866 children and teenagers were murdered with \nguns, 1,309 committed suicide with guns, and 468 died in unintentional \nshootings. Gunshot wounds are now the second leading cause of death \namong people aged 10 to 34. What a commentary on this Nation. The \nfirearm epidemic in this country is now 10 times larger than the polio \nepidemic of earlier this century.\n  In the 1996-1997 school year alone, more than 6,000 students across \nthis Nation were caught with firearms in school. Is there a Member of \nthis body who saw guns in their classrooms as they were growing up? I \ndon't think so. I sure didn't. But I will tell you this: I addressed \nthe fourth grade class in Hollywood and I said: What is your greatest \nfear? And that fourth grade said being shot. I said: How many of you \nhave heard shots? And every single hand in the class went up in \nHollywood, CA, as having heard shots. What kind of a nation are we \nbecoming when\n\n[[Page S5223]]\n\nour youngsters have to be reared in this kind of environment?\n  I notice the distinguished Senator, my cosponsor of this amendment, \nSenator Chafee of Rhode Island, is on the floor. If I might, I would \nlike to yield time to him, as much time as he requires.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I thank the distinguished Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor Senator Feinstein's \namendment, which is designed to keep assault weapons and large capacity \nammunition feeding devices out of the hands of children. Also, I am \ngrateful to Chairman Hatch for the opportunity to discuss this \nimportant matter.\n  For years, Senator feinstein has been an ardent proponent of banning \nassault weapons and large capacity ammunition clips. In 1994, Congress \nwisely enacted legislation to prohibit domestic production of assault \nweapons and large capacity ammunition feeding devices. Regrettably, it \ntook a terrible tragedy to give us that wisdom.\n  In January 1989, our nation was stunned when Patrick Purdy murdered 5 \nchildren and injured 30 others in a schoolyard in Stockton, CA. With \nthe horror of that slaughter fresh in our minds and hearts, Congress \nenacted the assault weapons ban as part of the Violent Crime Control \nand Law Enforcement Act of 1994.\n  That legislation, principally proposed and fought for by the \ndistinguished Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, prohibits the \nmanufacture, possession, and transfer of semiautomatic weapons and \nlarge-capacity ammunition clips that were not lawfully owned prior to \nenactment of the 1994 act. Regrettably, there are gaping loopholes in \nthat law.\n  The amendment Senator Feinstein and I have offered today is designed \nto close the loophole in the law that enables children to gain access \nto assault weapons and large capacity ammunition clips. It is intended \nto close the loophole that allows large capacity ammunition clips, \nwhich are manufactured abroad, to flood the United States. And it is \ndesigned to increase penalties on adults who provide children with \nhandguns, deadly assault weapons, and large capacity clips.\n  This amendment is a matter of common sense. Common sense led us to \nprohibit possession of handguns by children. Nevertheless, we permit \nchildren to possess assault weapons and large clips. These are not \nweapons intended for hunting or recreational purposes. These are lethal \nweapons designed to make it easy to kill. Yet, the law says it's just \nfine for children to possess them.\n  There is a lot of discussion on the floor of this Chamber about the \nculture of violence.\n  We are asked to blame the ``culture of violence'' for the rash \nshootings that have rocked our nation and our schools. Children watch \ntoo much TV, therefore they are violent. Children go to violent movies, \ntherefore they act out what they see. Children play video and computer \ngames with violent themes, therefore they become killers. Perhaps there \nis truth in these conclusions, but there is a much simpler truth. It is \nfoolhardy and irresponsible to allow children to possess assault \nweapons.\n  In America, a 15-year-old child can't drive a car, but he can own an \nassault weapon. An 18-year-old can't buy a beer, but he can own an \nassault weapon. There are age requirements for buying cigarettes or \nattending certain movies, but there are no age limits when it comes to \nassault weapons. The age requirements for certain activities are meant \nto keep children out of harm's way. That's what this amendment is meant \nto do, too.\n  We have an opportunity today to say enough is enough. We have an \nopportunity to use our common sense and take assault weapons and large \ncapacity clips away from children. We have an opportunity to learn from \nthe horror that all of American has witnessed in our nation's schools.\n  Assault weapons and large capacity magazines were used in two of the \nhorrific shootings we all watched on the evening news. At Thurston High \nSchool in Springfield, OR, a 15-year-old, who was suspended for \nbringing a gun to school, returned the next day and opened fire in a \ncrowded cafeteria. He killed two students and wounded 22 others, using \na large capacity ammunition clip. Most recently, two boys in Littleton, \nCO, devastated their community by storming their school, murdering 12 \nschoolmates and a teacher, and finally killing themselves. One of the \nweapons the boys used was a Tec-9 assault pistol.\n  It's time to end the madness. It's time to take common sense steps to \nkeep guns, particularly assault weapons and large capacity clips, out \nof the hands of children. We teach our children not to play with \nmatches; to look both ways before crossing the street; we tell them not \nto talk to strangers. We teach them lessons to keep them safe, but we \nallow them access to the deadliest of weapons. It doesn't make sense. \nIt is unjustifiable.\n  We have a chance today to close the loophole in the assault weapons \nban that permits what our common sense tells us is insane.\n  Mr. President, clearly, it will be argued on the floor of this Senate \nthat we have a host of laws on the books--I think somebody said 40,000 \nlaws. I don't know whether that is accurate or not. But if it is, there \nis a mass of laws on the books, and all we have to do is enforce these \nlaws and we wouldn't have these troubles.\n  There is no law dealing with assault weapons in the hands of \nchildren--certainly no Federal law. There ought to be one along with \npassage of these laws on the floor of this Chamber. Certainly, there \nshould be greater enforcement than there is.\n  But, first of all, let's have the law making it illegal, not only to \nown one of these weapons--for a minor to or for a child to--but also \nthe clip that goes with it.\n  It should not be lawful for children to possess assault weapons and \nlarge capacity ammunition clips. It should not be possible for foreign \nmanufacturers to flood the United States with a product domestic \nmanufacturers are forbidden to produce. Adults who provide these deadly \nweapons to children should be punished.\n  That is part of the legislation for which the distinguished Senator \nfrom California has pushed. Senator Feinstein's amendment is about \nchildren and safety.\n  I urge my colleagues to rely on their common sense and vote to take \nassault weapons away from children.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank the distinguished proponent of this \namendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I think the distinguished Senator from \nRhode Island knows I hold him in very high regard, but I want him to \nknow that my fondness for him has just increased exponentially.\n  Thank you very much for that very compelling statement.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I am delighted to be associated with her. I want to say, \nregrettably, we haven't passed much gun control legislation on the \nfloor of this Senate, but because the Senator from California was so \ndogged and determined in, I believe, 1994, some 5 years ago, we were \nable to take a big step forward. Now she has come up with legislation \nto eliminate some of the loopholes in that bill.\n  I thank the Chair and I thank the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my good friend from California, and I commend her \nand the Senator from Rhode Island and others who are actively pursuing \nthis very important amendment.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the tragedy in Littleton, Colorado \nstruck a chord with every American. Three weeks ago, we watched in \ndisbelief as children turned violent against other children, and we \nasked ourselves why. There is no single answer to that question. The \nviolence in movies, on television, and in video games alarms us all. \nOur culture is surely far too violent. But, in these school shootings, \nwe see one crucial common denominator: guns.\n  Guns kill some 35,000 people in the United States each year. We've \ngrown so accustomed to the carnage that guns cause that only the most \nhorrific acts of violence are capable of shaking us from our slumber. \nWe paused in the Senate to observe a moment of silence to pay tribute \nto those who died at Columbine High School and to express our\n\n[[Page S5224]]\n\nsympathy for their loved ones. But now with this latest tribute for the \nvictims in Littleton behind us, we need to be anything but silent.\n  There is no one cause of youth violence, the causes are many. But \namong them there is one that cannot be ignored or denied: the easy \naccess our young people have to deadly weapons.\n  Violence in television shows, video games and movies horrifies us as \nparents and grandparents. But these same programs and those same games \nare the predominant entertainment in many other countries, as well, \nwhich have a small fraction of our gun murder rate. Look at our border \nwith Canada. In 1997, the U.S. death rate involving firearms was about \n14 per 100,000 people. The rate for Canada was less than one-third of \nthat, about 4. Canadian towns on our border watch exactly the same T.V. \nand movies we do. Their kids play the same video games as ours. In \n1997, there were 354 firearm homicides in Detroit; across the river in \nWindsor, Ontario, one fifth its population, there were only 4. The \ncrucial difference is the easy availability of firearms in the U.S. If \nwe equate the populations, that would mean that on an apples and apples \nbasis, Windsor would have had 20 firearm homicides. They watch the same \ntelevision, they watch the same movies, and they play the same video \ngames. We had 354 firearm homicides in Detroit; Windsor has 20 on a \ncomparable basis.\n\n  The crucial difference isn't, then, the atmosphere of violence which \npervades too much of our environment; the critical, crucial difference \nis the easy availability of firearms in the United States.\n  No matter how severe this plague of gun violence is for society as a \nwhole, for the young it is far worse. For young males, the firearm \ndeath rate is nearly twice that of all diseases combined. One hundred \nand thirty-five thousand guns are brought into U.S. schools every day, \naccording to an estimate by the National School Board Association--\n135,000 guns every day brought into our schools. Guns are not the cause \nof violent emotion, but guns are the predominant cause of violent \nkillings and murders when such violent emotions are acted out.\n  There are numerous loopholes in the Federal gun laws which I think \nwould surprise most Americans. The Feinstein amendment before the \nSenate addresses loopholes which allow youth access to, for instance, \nthe assault weapons which have been discussed. Most of these are \ncommonsense proposals.\n  Ten years ago, maybe now a little longer than that, former Senator \nBarry Goldwater first heard that a madman walked into a schoolyard in \nStockton, CA, with a rapid-firing AK-47 and shot off 100 rounds in 2 \nminutes, killing 5 children and wounding 30. Senator Goldwater said, \n``I'm completely opposed to selling automatic rifles, and I have been a \nmember of the NRA. I collect, make, and shoot guns. I've never used an \nautomatic or semiautomatic for hunting. There is no need to. They have \nno place in anybody's arsenal.''\n  Senator Goldwater was right when he said that assault weapons have no \nsporting purpose. How many more tragedies will it take before, at a \nbare minimum, we take assault weapons and large ammunition clips out of \nthe hands of children?\n  This amendment does that. I hope this Senate will give its support. I \ncommend the Senators from California and Rhode Island.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMichigan. A while back, a former Vice President said he is one of the \ngreat minds of the Senate. I certainly agree with that. I think you \nknow that.\n  Thank you very much.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from New Jersey on the floor. I yield \n5 minutes of my time to Senator Torricelli.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank the Senator from California for yielding.\n  Mr. President, all of us, after Littleton, grieved together. I \nbelieve all of those prayers and condolences were sincere. But we also \npledged to finally take the issue of gun violence and young people in \nAmerica seriously. Those pledges may not have been as sincere.\n  It was my hope in this debate that we would deal with some very \nfundamental issues--restricting the ability to buy handguns to one a \nmonth; stopping the wholesale transfer of these guns into our cities \nand small towns in States like my own of New Jersey.\n  I hoped we would extend the Brady period to give a cooling off period \nto people who buy these weapons. I hoped to regulate firearms like any \nother consumer product.\n  We decided not to do these things because we wanted to meet our \nopponents, those who are advocates for the gun lobby, halfway. So we \nrestricted ourselves to the most reasonable, the least controversial. \nIt might have been a mistake, because even those commonsense \ninitiatives, which I think most Americans would subscribe to, are not \nsucceeding.\n  Yesterday, this Senate failed in an effort to restrict sales at gun \nshows without background checks--4,000 gun shows that operate outside \nof the current checks for mental illness and previous legal \nconvictions. Now we return again with another provision that should be \nequally noncontroversial. Most people in America wouldn't believe this \nprovision is necessary. I would have a hard time convincing most people \nin New Jersey that this amendment is required, because most people \nwould believe it was already law: That an 18- or 19-year-old can buy an \nassault rifle; that any child can buy a rifle or shotgun, including \nassault rifles such as the infamous street-sweeper; that any youth 18 \nto 21 can privately buy an assault pistol such as the TEC-9 used in \nLittleton.\n  Our country has recognized that there is an age of maturity to drive \nan automobile. We recognize there is an appropriate age of maturity to \nconsume alcohol, to exercise the right to vote--the basic sovereignty \nof our people. Yet, with the power to take a human life by the exercise \nof the extraordinary power in these weapons, young people like those in \nLittleton who consumed so many lives operate without restrictions.\n  I believe those who responded to the massacre in Littleton were \nsincere in wanting to deal with this problem. But it requires more than \nwords. It requires the one area of political life that I most admire \nand is in the shortest supply in our country--courage--the courage to \ngo to those few advocates who believe they are so right and their \nprivileges are so important that the larger good of the public must be \ncompromised. I suggest to them they must compromise for the sake of the \nNation.\n  That is the moment in which we now find ourselves. Senator Feinstein \nhas offered an amendment that would interfere with the rights of no \nparents who want to teach their child to use a firearm responsibly or \nwant to have a firearm in their home. It deals only with that class of \nweapons for which there is no hunting purpose, no legitimate function \nfor which any teenager in any school of America should want to own an \nassault rifle or a multibullet clip. That is all we deal with. \nInexplicably, I do not know if we will succeed.\n  Last year, we lost over 3,500 young people to gunfire; 3,500 deaths. \nThis is no perfect answer. It will not eliminate all of those deaths. \nIt may not eliminate a majority of those deaths. But no one on this \nSenate floor can credibly argue that with the adoption of the Feinstein \namendment some lives will not be saved; that the chances of a Littleton \nare not measurably reduced.\n  The Senate has a choice. Senator Ashcroft has also offered an \namendment and it would also restrict to minors access to some of these \nweapons.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has spoken for 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I yield the Senator an additional \nminute.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank the Senator for yielding an additional \nminute.\n  But only the Feinstein amendment offers not only restricting this \nclass of weapon to young people, but also closes the loophole that \nallows these multibullet clips that allow the rage of a child who would \ntake a single life to destroy a school, an entire group of people--to \ncommit a mass murder.\n  I do not argue this alone will stop these tragedies. No one here can \nargue that any one formula, any one idea will eliminate this problem. \nBut I will tell you this, Senator Feinstein has the one proposal that \ncan address the rage, the inexplicable rage that must be dealt with--by \nfamilies and schools and churches and synagogues, exploding on\n\n[[Page S5225]]\n\nsuch a level--by taking both these weapons of mass destruction and \nthese multibullet clips out of circulation.\n  I congratulate her for her amendment. I ask the Senate, with all the \nrage you felt after Littleton, with all the conviction you felt to \nsolve this problem, and all the compassion you felt for those children, \nhave that strength, that courage and that conviction now. For once, at \nlong last, let's take a stand and cast a vote so, as the years pass, we \nwill have real pride that we made some contribution. Just as we ask \nthose parents, those schools, those churches, those synagogues to play \ntheir role and be part of this solution, let the Senate be part of this \nsolution, too.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nNew Jersey for his thinking. I very much appreciate it. It seems to me, \nthose of us who have big cities in our States really understand what a \nlot of this is about. I think it is very important. When we get back \nhere I think we forget what it is like out there, the ease with which \nyoungsters can obtain these high-powered implements which are capable \nof killing so many people at one time. So I thank the Senator very much \nfor his support in this.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes 50 seconds.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, let me once again state what is the \nfundamental difference between the amendment proposed by the \ndistinguished Senator from Missouri and my amendment. My amendment has \none thing that his does not. It closes the loophole in the 1994 assault \nweapons legislation.\n  Today, it is illegal for anyone, domestically, to manufacture these \nbig clips. It is illegal for them to sell them. It is illegal for \npeople to possess them. But it is not illegal to bring them in from \nabroad. So why wouldn't we straighten this out? Why would we \ndisadvantage our domestic manufacturers and allow all of this stuff, \nthese big clips, up to 250 rounds, to come in from abroad? It makes no \nsense. What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. In a simple \nequity argument, we have closed the supply off domestically. Why permit \nthese clips to come in from foreign countries?\n  Mr. President, I believe as soon as Senator Schumer comes he would \nlike some time on this amendment as well. But I think we have an \nopportunity today for both parties to come together and do something \nimportant for our Nation. I deeply believe this legislation is \nsupported by 80 percent to 90 percent of the American people. Why would \nwe not enact it? Both of us want the same thing. We want to keep these \nweapons out of the hands of juveniles and we want to keep these big \nclips out of the hands of juveniles.\n  Does it make sense, then, to continue to increase the supply? I do \nnot believe it does.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask that the Senator from New York \nbe recognized for the remainder of my time.\n  Also, I ask unanimous consent the junior Senator from Rhode Island, \nMr. Jack Reed, be added as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senator from \nCalifornia, not only for the time but, far more important, for her \nleadership on this issue.\n  We were the coauthors of the assault weapons ban of 1994. She carried \nit bravely in the Senate, and then I followed in the House.\n  We still have unfinished work to do. That is what this amendment is \nall about. The Senator from California has well documented the need for \nthis legislation. But let me say that this is such a simple, carefully \ndrawn, and modest measure that to take half a loaf or a quarter of a \nloaf is not good enough, particularly in light of the tragedy in \nLittleton and the tragedies which have occurred throughout America.\n  The Senator from Missouri has tried to deal with a part of the \nFeinstein amendment, but it still leaves a giant exception for young \npeople to get these clips for hunting, for employment, for a group of \nother exceptions.\n  I say, if we believe these clips are unnecessary--unnecessary for \nhunting, unnecessary for self-defense--because they kill far too many \npeople, then why are we making such an exception? So I ask my \ncolleagues, if you really believe in rational laws on guns, if you \nreally believe that young people should not have the kinds of clips--\n30-round--from all across the world sent to this country for no other \npurpose than to harm and maim--no legitimate purpose--then how can you \nbelieve it is OK half of the time or a quarter of the time or three-\nquarters of the time?\n  So I urge my colleagues to pass this amendment, not to shy away from \nit with a modification that does not really do the job, but to take \nthis well-thought-out and modest step.\n  Let me say something else about the climate around here as it relates \nto this amendment and all of the amendments that are here.\n  What a bitter disappointment it is that the response to Littleton is \nthat a loophole which allows criminals to get guns just gets wider. The \nAmerican people are scratching their collective heads and saying, What \nis going on in this Senate of the United States? There is the blood of \nyoung children on our schoolhouse floors, and not only do we fail to \ntake the modest step of closing the gun show loophole, we actually make \nit wider. I don't get it. I am new in the Senate, but I just don't get \nit.\n  As the entire Nation turns its eyes towards the Senate to do \nsomething to keep guns out of the hands of criminals, we give criminals \na new special pawnshop exemption, one that did not exist even in the \nmonths before Littleton. Shame on us.\n  On the amendment of the Senator from Idaho, there was some discussion \nbetween him and me about it yesterday, but now it seems that all of the \nprovisions I mentioned that were in that amendment seem to be true. \nAnd, frankly, the Senator from Idaho was gracious enough to admit that \nto me in the well of this Chamber this morning.\n  Let me tell you what we passed into law yesterday.\n  A violent felon gets out of jail and has little cash, so he pawns \nsome of his guns. At this point, he is not even allowed to own a gun by \nlaw. Later, he raises money--maybe through a job, maybe through a \ncrime; who knows--and he goes to redeem his gun. And now there will be \nno background check because of the amendment of the Senator from Idaho.\n  In 1994, of the 5,405 people who redeemed their own gun at a \npawnshop, 294 were caught in the Brady net. When America begged the \nSenate to do something about guns, they were not asking us to bring \nback the pawnshop loophole. Why are we back-peddling? And other places, \ntoo.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah controls 45 minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent for 20 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator from California yield for a question?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Of course.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator from California ask unanimous consent \nthat I be recognized for an additional minute, just to finish my point?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent the Senator from New York be \nrecognized for an additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we yield a minute to each, if it is all \nright. Do you want more?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator for his generosity.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. You finish, and then I will go.\n\n[[Page S5226]]\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator from California.\n  There were two other exceptions in the Craig amendment, two other \nloopholes that, again, made it easier for people--children, criminals--\nto get guns. One is an exemption from liability for certain gun \ndealers; another would allow gun dealers to actually set up shop out of \nState, something unheard of since 1968. I would caution my colleagues \nin the Senate, evidently the Craig amendment had other loopholes as \nwell, which we will talk more about later.\n  So please, let us, everyone, if we are afraid to take a step \nforward--and I pray that we are not--not take three steps backwards, \nwhich up to now the Senate has done.\n  I yield back.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 343, As Modified\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to submit a \nsmall technical correction to my amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 343), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 276, below the matter following line 3, add the \n     following:\n                        TITLE V--ASSAULT WEAPONS\n\n     SEC. 501.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act and the amendments made by this Act except \n     sections 502 and 505 shall take effect 180 days after the \n     date of enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might consume \nin opposition to the Feinstein amendment.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from California and I over our years \ntogether here in the Senate have remained good friends even though we \nfind ourselves on occasion in disagreement. This is one of those \noccasions.\n  I wish I could join with the Senator from California and the Senator \nfrom Michigan and those who have spoken on the floor, in the most \nsincere of ways, in creating a magic wand that would take violence out \nof our schools and violence off our streets, and proclaim that our \nNation is a violence-free nation. If we could do that together, then we \nwould not be here debating this and our Nation would react differently \nthan it is at this moment.\n  All of us have mourned the loss of those marvelous young people in \nLittleton, CO. But it would be unfair for anybody to stand on this \nfloor and portray that passage of the Feinstein amendment will solve \nthat problem. It will not. It will not solve the problem of violence in \nour youth today or the feeling of disillusionment or the frustration \nwhich has produced these episodes of extreme violence in juveniles that \nthis society has never seen in its history.\n  I stand in opposition to the Feinstein amendment today because it \nwould undo a provision of the law that was created in an interest of \nfairness, because in July of last year, when the Senator brought this \nto the floor, we argued it and 55 Senators said we ought not change \nthis provision of the law. That is because, in 1994, Congress debated \nbanning the future importation and manufacturing of high-capacity clips \nwith more than 10 rounds of ammunition. Frankly, I was one of those who \nopposed banning this ammunition because I felt it had nothing \nwhatsoever to do with controlling crime.\n  Enforcement controls crime: Cops on the street with the ability to \nmake sure, when they arrest somebody who uses a gun in the commission \nof a crime, that some attorney will not plea bargain them back to the \nstreet. Adult crime is going down today because we are locking people \nup, in part. And yet we are going to have a bill on the floor in the \nnext few minutes which is going to make it even tougher for Federal \nprosecutors to walk away from their responsibility under the law; and \nthat is to put people away who use guns in the commission of a crime. \nThat is how you make the streets safer.\n  Well, at least that is how you make the streets safer in relation to \nalso protecting a private citizen's right to own and to collect.\n  I think, however, even the sponsor has acknowledged it would be \nunfair to outlaw existing clips or some clips. She did in 1994. In all \nfairness to her, she has honestly said on the floor she made a mistake. \nI do not think she made a mistake at that time. I supported her in \nthat, and we voted on it, and it became the law of the land. The ATF \nproceeded to do everything in its power to frustrate the law we had \ncreated. Specifically, it held up imports of legal clips for years, \nclaiming that Congress only intended to grandfather domestic \nclips. This reading of the statute was obviously so wrong that even the \nJustice Department went to ATF and said: Sorry, it is unenforceable. So \nATF had to give in; they couldn't jawbone their way outside the law.\n\n  As a result of that, that importation was allowed as the law had \ndesigned. Consequently, the legal magazines finally were allowed to be \nimported years after the ban went into effect.\n  Today, those who wrote the law are now trying to undo it. Of course, \nthat is the right of Congress--I do not dispute that--to change the law \nif they wish. But I hope they would have good grounds to do so.\n  I think the first provision of the Senator's law is the right thing \nto do. It is what the Senator from Missouri is doing, to tighten up on \njuvenile ownership and therefore force a greater level of juvenile \nresponsibility. But hers is much broader than that, and I simply have \nto oppose it.\n  History is not the only reason that this amendment is unfair, \nhowever. It also is unfair because it would overnight make certain \nlegal, lawfully owned firearms obsolete. These magazines are still \nbeing imported because there is a market for them, yes. She has spoken \nto that market. I think that is fair and responsible because of\n\n[[Page S5227]]\n\nthe character in which we have tried to shape this particular market.\n  It was unfair in 1994 to ban these magazines, I believe. It is unfair \ntoday. Again, I hope the Senator and I can find that magic wand. \nCongress is struggling mightily at this moment, and this Senate is, \nwith the juvenile crime bill, to change the definition of how we treat \njuveniles in our society and to change the law, to treat them more like \nadults, to look at other dimensions that we believe are causing these \nlevels of frustration and violent outbursts, from movies to videos.\n  I wish we could even take our magic wand, if we found it, and make \nthe parents of our society more responsible, but that won't happen \neither. We will try. In the end, I hope we can succeed.\n  It is my judgment, I believe a fair judgment, to suggest that the \nFeinstein amendment will not make the Littletons go away, or any other \nact of violence in this country, unless we bring a whole combination of \nthings and change the way our culture thinks and reacts, as it relates \nto its children and its future.\n  I hope my colleagues will join with me this afternoon in opposing the \nFeinstein amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as I understand it, for the benefit of our \ncolleagues, these next two votes will begin at about 3:45. We \nanticipate having a vote at 3:45, but that may be delayed in order to \naccommodate our Appropriations Committee conference. We will know \nwithin the next 10 minutes. If we don't begin voting at 3:45, then, if \nwe can get the time yielded back from the distinguished Senator from \nIdaho and the distinguished Senator from California, we would then move \nto the Hatch-Craig amendment with the debate to continue for an hour \nevenly divided.\n  I ask unanimous consent that----\n  Mr. KOHL. Reserving the right to object----\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. As I understand it, all time has been yielded back on the \npart of the minority. Can we get the majority, Senator Craig----\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 344\n\n   (Purpose: To make an amendment with respect to effective gun law \nenforcement, enhanced penalties, and facilitation of background checks \n                             at gun shows)\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having been yielded back, the clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch], for himself, Mr. Craig \n     and Mr. McCain, proposes an amendment numbered 344.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, for the benefit of our colleagues, it \nappears as though we don't know whether there will be a vote at 3:45 or \nnot. It doesn't look like there will be, in my opinion. Those votes may \nbe deferred for approximately an hour and 15 or 20 minutes. We will \nannounce if we do have votes beginning at that time.\n  We are going to move ahead, keep moving on these amendments. This is \nthe Hatch-Craig amendment. We would like to limit debate to an hour, \nbut the minority needs to examine the amendment. We will certainly wait \nuntil they do before we ask for a limited period of time.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the previously scheduled \nvotes now occur at 5:00 p.m. under the same conditions as stated \nearlier.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I also ask that no second-degree amendments be in order \nprior to the scheduled votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator McCain \nbe placed as a cosponsor of the Hatch-Craig amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, in discussing several proposals with my \ncolleagues over the last 2 days and nights, I am offering a package of \namendments that will increase the effectiveness of S. 254 by sharpening \nthe bill's focus on punishing criminals who use guns illegally, while \nprotecting law-abiding people who use guns lawfully for traditional \nsporting and self-defense purposes. We want to punish the criminal \nwithout burdening law-abiding people.\n  Our amendment package has four parts: one, more aggressive \nprosecution; two, enhanced targeted penalties; three, expanded \nprotection for children; and, four, enhanced background checks.\n  First, we propose an improved version of a program for the aggressive \nprosecution of the criminal use of firearms by felons or a program that \nis commonly known as CUFF, C-U-F-F. It is one thing to talk about \nputting criminals behind bars, and it is another thing to actually do \nit. We in the Senate must recognize that all the gun laws we could ever \npass mean absolutely nothing if the Attorney General does not enforce \nthem.\n  The Clinton administration talked about the Brady bill and stopping \ncriminals from obtaining and using guns. The Attorney General talked \nabout being tough on criminals, but the record shows otherwise. The \nchart that we are going to show to you shows that in the last 3 years \nthe Democratic Department of Justice has had a dismal record in \nprotecting the very crimes that the Democratic administration and \nDemocrats in Congress said were an essential part of their program.\n  This chart shows the prosecutions of Federal firearms laws, cases \nreported, Executive Office, U.S. Attorney, requested firearms sections, \ncounts charged, calendar years 1996-1998.\n  Now, for example, between 1992 and 1997, gun prosecutions under \nOperation Triggerlock--a proven gun crime prosecution program, started \nunder President Bush--dropped nearly 50 percent, from 7,045 to 3,765. \nNow, these are prosecutions of defendants who use a firearm in the \ncommission of a felony. They had been cut by 50 percent between the \nyears 1992 and 1997. The Executive Office of the U.S. Attorney reports \nthat between 1996 and 1998 the Clinton Justice Department prosecuted a \ngrand total of one criminal who illegally attempted to purchase a \nhandgun, but was stopped by the instant check system.\n  It is a Federal crime to possess a firearm on school grounds. \nHowever, the Clinton Justice Department prosecuted only eight cases \nunder this law in 1998, even though they admit that more than 6,000 \nstudents illegally brought guns to school last year.\n  The Clinton administration had prosecuted only five such cases in \n1997. Many believe that the actual number of kids who bring guns to \nschool is much higher than the 6,000, but I think it is pretty pathetic \nwhen you stop and think that, in 1998, there were only eight cases \nprosecuted and in 1997 only five.\n  It is a Federal crime to transfer a firearm to a juvenile. However, \nthe Clinton Justice Department prosecuted only six cases under this law \nin 1998, and only five in 1997. Think about it. It is illegal--\nillegal--to transfer a firearm to a juvenile yet only six cases were \nprosecuted in 1998 and only five in 1997.\n  Now, it is a Federal crime to transfer or possess a semiautomatic \nassault weapon. However, the Clinton Justice Department prosecuted only \nfour cases under this law in 1998 and only four in 1997. Think about \nit.\n  In addition, the Clinton administration has requested only $5 million \nto prosecute gun crimes. We have a lot of rhetoric from this \nadministration about gun crimes and how effective the Brady law has \nbeen. They claim hundreds of thousands of people are stopped from \npurchasing guns, many of whom they believed were felons. Please note \nthat it costs $1.5 million to fund an effective project in the city of \nPhiladelphia alone--just one city, $1.5\n\n[[Page S5228]]\n\nmillion--and they only requested $5 million for prosecuting gun crimes. \nThus, not only has the Clinton administration failed to prosecute gun \ncrimes in the past; it apparently has no plan to do better in the \nfuture.\n  This chart lists the prosecuted cases reported by the Executive \nOffice of the U.S. Attorney.\n  Providing firearm to a prohibited person, unspecified category: 17 in \n1996, 20 in 1997, and 10 in 1998.\n  Providing a firearm to a felon: 20 in 1996, 13 in 1997, and 24 in \n1998.\n  Possession of a firearm by a fugitive: 30 in 1996, 30 in 1997, and 23 \nin 1998. That is an important category.\n  Possession of a firearm by a drug addict or illegal drug user: 46 in \n1996, 69 in 1997, 129 in 1998.\n  Possession of a firearm by a person committed to a mental \ninstitution, or an adjudicated mental incompetent: 1 in 1996, 4 in \n1997, 5 in 1998.\n  Possession of a firearm by an illegal alien, and we have millions of \nthem coming into this country: 72 in 1996, 96 in 1997, and 107 in 1998.\n  Possession of a firearm by a person dishonorably discharged from the \nArmed Forces: 0 in 1996, 0 in 1997, 2 in 1998.\n  Possession of a firearm by a person under a certain kind of \nrestraining order provision: 3 in 1996, 18 in 1997, 22 in 1998. Even \nthough this administration has been complaining about domestic violence \nand the use of handguns and guns in domestic violence. Just think about \nit. This is the whole country. This is all the Justice Department has \ndone. OK.\n  Possession of a firearm by a person convicted of a domestic violence \nmisdemeanor: 0 in 1996, 21 in 1997, 56 in 1998.\n  Look at this.\n  Possession or discharge of a firearm in a school zone: 4.\n  Look at that. We have 6,000 kids that they admit came into schools \nwith firearms in this country, and we know it is many more thousands \nthan that; they know it, too. But there were only 4 in 1996, 5 in 1997, \nand 8 in 1998.\n  Now, we have heard a lot of mouthing off about the Brady bill and \n100,000 cops in the streets. Let's talk about the Brady bill. According \nto them, hundreds of thousands of people have been prohibited from \ngetting guns because of the Brady Act. Really, it is the check system \nthat we insisted on that is causing these people to be caught.\n  Look at this: All violations under the Brady Act, first phase: 0 in \n1996, 0 in 1996, and 1 in 1998.\n  Think about that, OK.\n  All violations under the Brady Act, instant check phase: 0 in 1996, 0 \nin 1997, 0 in 1998.\n  How about the hundreds of thousands of people they claim violated the \nlaw that they have caught:\n  Theft of a firearm from a Federal firearms licensee: 52 in 1996, 51 \nin 1997, and 25 in 1998.\n  Manufacturing, transferring, or possessing a nongrandfathered assault \nweapon: 16 in 1996, 4 in 1997, and 4 in 1998.\n\n  Transfer of a handgun, or handgun ammunition to a juvenile. We have \nthousands of cases like this: 9 in 1996, 5 in 1997, 6 in 1998.\n  Possession of a handgun, or handgun ammunition, by a juvenile: 27 in \n1996, 3 in 97, and only 8 in 1998. Think about that.\n  Unspecified violations: 46 in 1996, 26 in 1997, and 21 in 1998.\n  Enhanced penalty use of a firearm or destructive device during a \ncrime of violence or drug-related crime prosecutable in Federal Court: \n1,987 in 1996, 1,885 in 1997, and 1,763 in 1998. Those are very small \nnumbers compared to the number of people who they claim are misusing \nfirearms.\n  Possession of a firearm by a prohibited person, unspecified category: \n683 in 1996, 752 in 1997, 603 in 1998.\n  Possession of a firearm by a felon. Think about all these complaints \nabout firearms causing everything in our society. They prosecuted 1,213 \nin 1996, 1,366 in 1997, 1,550 in 1998.\n  Who is kidding whom here? The fact of the matter is, this \nadministration hasn't been serious about prosecuting gun cases, and now \nthey want a lot more gun laws. Well, we are going to give them some on \nthis bill, and we are going to give them some that some gun owners \ndon't particularly care for. We are going to see if they do a better \njob in the future. We have to turn this around.\n  The CUFF amendment would fund--and we offer it in this amendment--an \naggressive firearms prosecution program modeled after Operation \nTriggerlock, which was so successful during the Bush administration. It \nfocuses on prosecuting gun criminals and obtaining tough sentences on \nthe use of firearms in the commission of crimes of violence.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the distinguished Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The distinguished Senator said the Republican package will \noffer some things gun owners won't like. Anything that I have seen in \nthe Republican package, including a whole lot of things that were in \nlegislation I had introduced, have been supported by virtually all gun \nowners. What were the ones the gun owners aren't going to like?\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me get to that.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I just didn't see any.\n  Mr. HATCH. The CUFF amendment, of course, they would like. Anybody \nwho wants to do anything about crime would like that. In contrast to \nthe $5 million requested by the Clinton administration to fund gun \ncrimes, our plan provides $50 million to hire additional Federal \nprosecutors to prosecute gun crimes. This is just in the area of \njuvenile justice.\n  Our program expands to other cities a successful Richmond, Virginia \nprogram in which federal prosecutors prosecute as many local gun-\nrelated crimes as possible in federal court. Homicides have fallen 50 \npercent in Richmond since the program was implemented. This program \nworks.\n  In addition to encouraging aggressive prosecution, our plan requires \nthe Attorney General to report to Congress on the number of possible \ngun crimes and, if the crimes are not prosecuted, to explain why. I \ninitially hesitated to support such a statute. However, after years of \nlittle enforcement of existing laws and after years of holding hearings \nat which the Attorney General consistently provides no satisfactory \nexplanation, we have no choice.\n  If Congress passes a law to make an act a crime, it is the duty of \nthe Attorney General to enforce that law. This reporting provision is a \nnecessary step to ensure that the Clinton Justice Department does its \nduty and prosecutes the illegal use of guns by criminals.\n  Second, this package of amendments includes several penalty \nenhancements that I, Senator Ashcroft, Senator McCain, and Senator \nCampbell have worked on. These enhancements target the illegal use of \nguns by criminals.\n  This proposal would impose the following mandatory minimum sentences:\n  Five years for the transfer of a firearm to another who the \ntransferor knows will use the firearm in the commission of a crime of \nviolence or a drug trafficking offense.\n  Ten years for criminals, including straw purchasers, that illegally \ntransfer a firearm to a juvenile who they have reasonable cause to know \nwill use the firearm to commit a violent felony.\n  Twelve years for discharging a firearm during the commission of a \ncrime of violence or a drug trafficking crime.\n  Fifteen years for injuring a person in the commission of a crime of \nviolence or a drug trafficking crime.\n  The proposal would also increase the mandatory minimums for \ndistributing drugs to minors and for selling drugs in or near a school \nto 3 years for the first offense and 5 years for repeat offenders.\n  Our proposal would also increase the maximum penalty for knowingly \ntransporting or transacting in stolen firearms, stealing a firearm from \na dealer, and stealing a firearm that has moved in interstate commerce \nto 15 years.\n  This is strong medicine for the worst criminals that illegally use \nguns and drugs to harm elderly people, women, and children.\n  Third, our proposal would protect our children.\n  After reviewing Senator Leahy's proposal, I must give the good \nSenator from Vermont and his colleagues on the Democratic side of the \naisle credit. His proposal to expand the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction \nInitiative is a proposal that we can agree on.\n  This proposal would facilitate the identification and prosecution of \ngun traffickers that illegally peddle guns to our children.\n  The proposal would also facilitate the sharing of information between \nfederal and State law enforcement authorities to stop gun trafficking.\n\n[[Page S5229]]\n\n  The proposal would also provide grants to State and local governments \nto assist them in tracing firearms and hiring personnel to stop illegal \ngun trafficking.\n  I am glad that on this provision, we can reach a bipartisan agreement \nto protect our youth from illegal gun trafficking.\n  This proposal would also prohibit possession of firearms by violent \njuvenile offenders. This is the juvenile Brady provision, another \nprovision they weren't particularly happy of in the eyes of some people \nin our society. But it is in this bill, and in this amendment.\n  It extends the current ban on firearm ownership by certain felons to \ncertain juvenile offenders.\n  Under this proposal, juveniles who are adjudicated delinquent for \nserious crimes will not be able to own a firearm--ever.\n  When they reach maturity, they will not be able to own a firearm.\n  To ensure that this law will be enforceable, however, we make it \neffective only after records of such offenses are made available on the \nInstant Check System.\n  Finally, this proposal would aid in the overall enhancement of the \nInstant Check System. Senator DeWine has played an instrumental role in \ndrafting this provision that will help bring the Instant Check System \ninto the 21st century, something that all on our side have been for \nfrom the beginning, and it is the only thing that really is working.\n  This amendment will fund a feasibility study on the development of a \nsingle-fingerprint computer system and database for identifying \nconvicted felons who attempt to purchase handguns.\n  Under this system, a person will be able to voluntarily put his thumb \nor index finger onto a scanner at a gun store and a computer would \ninstantly compare his finger print to a national digital database of \nfinger prints for convicted felons. This would provide a truly accurate \nand truly instant check of a potential purchaser. This would prevent \ncriminals with false identification credentials from purchasing a \nhandgun.\n  The amendment would also close a loophole in current law. It would \nrequire the Attorney General to establish procedures to provide the \nInstant Check system with access to records not currently on the \ndatabase. This would include records of domestic violence restraining \norders. This will help protect vulnerable women from abusive spouses.\n  After the shooting at the library in Utah by a mentally disturbed \nperson, I have been in contact with the representatives of mental \nhealth organizations to discuss this important problem. My constituents \nin Utah are very concerned about this issue and so am I, and everybody \nelse is as well who reflects on this matter.\n  This proposal takes a small but important step on this issue. It \ndirects the Attorney General to establish procedures for including \npublic records of adjudications of mental incompetence and involuntary \ncommitments to mental institution in the Instant Check database. This \nprovision would protect the public, but would also respect the \nlegitimate privacy interests and treatment needs of those with mental \nhealth problems.\n  Mr. President, this package of amendments will increase the \nprosecution of firearm crimes, increase penalties on criminals that \nillegally use guns and drugs, protect our children from gun \ntrafficking, and expand the availability of background checks to stop \nconvicted felons from illegally purchasing guns. The package \naccomplishes this without overburdening the lawful and traditional use \nof firearms by law abiding citizens for sporting purposes and by our \nmost vulnerable citizens for self-defense purposes. Mr. President, I \nstrongly support this package of amendments as an excellent addition to \nS. 254.\n  In addition, Mr. President, this amendment would also punish the \nsolicitation of the violation of federal gun laws over the Internet. It \nwould not require advertisers who do not actually sell a firearm over \nthe Internet to become federally licensed firearms dealers.\n  The amendment provides that if a person knows or has reason to know \nthat his Internet advertisement offering to transfer a firearm or \nexplosives in violation of existing federal criminal statutes, he will \nbe punished severely.\n  The amendment imposes fines and prison sentences that escalate for \nrepeat offenders.\n  The amendment also provides an affirmative defense. If the advertiser \nis a licensed dealer, he can avoid the penalty imposed by this statute \nby posting a notice stating that sales of the firearm will be in \naccordance with federal law and will be made through a licensed dealer.\n  If the advertiser is a non-licensed individual, he can avoid the \npenalty imposed by this statute by:\n  (1) Sending a notice to the solicited party stating that the sale \nwill be made in accordance with federal law; and\n  (2) Providing that as a term of the sale, the sale will be \nconsummated through a licensed federal firearms dealer. Thus, there \nwill be a background check before the firearm is transferred.\n  Mr. President, this amendment solves the problem of a non-licensee \nsoliciting an illegal transfer of a firearm over the Internet. It \npunishes the knowing solicitation of a criminal transaction, and it \nallows an affirmative defense if the ultimate transaction includes an \nagreement to transfer the firearm through a licensed firearms dealer. \nUnder current law, a licensed firearms dealer is required to run the \nbuyer's name through the Instant Check system before transferring the \nfirearm. This is a far superior alternative to requiring advertisers \nwho do not sell firearms to become federally licensed firearms dealers \nand to act as middlement in the sale of firearms.\n  This amendment would punish those who solicit violations of federal \nlaw, but would not over burden law abiding citizens who lawfully \nadvertise legal products.\n  Yesterday the Senate did two things related to background checks at \ngun shows. First, it rejected, on a bipartisan basis, the Lautenberg \namendment. This proposal was unacceptable to many Members because of \nthe incredible regulatory burden it would have imposed and because of \nthe privacy implications for lawful citizens. Specifically, members \nwere concerned with:\n  (1) excessive costs of the proposed background check system;\n  (2) centralized record keeping of lawful gun transactions; and\n  (3) a new bureaucracy for regulating gun shows designed to do far \nmore than perform background checks.\n  Second, the Senate passed, on a bipartisan basis, the Craig amendment \nwhich represents a great step forward for gun safety while protecting \nthe rights of lawful gun owners: It gave access for the first time to \nthe instant check system, the NICS system, to nonlicensed individuals \nwho want to sell their firearms; ensured there will be no unlawful \nrecordkeeping by the FBI; established means for people to become \nlicensed dealers of firearms if they want to sell them at a gun show; \nand provided liability protection when the instant check system tells a \nseller that a perspective purchaser is eligible to purchase.\n\n  Today, we include in our omnibus gun prosecution control package \nimprovements to the Hatch amendment which will ensure that all gun \nsales at gun shows pass the muster of an instant check background \ncheck. This is due to the efforts of the distinguished Senator from \nOregon, Mr. Smith; the distinguished Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain; \nSenator Craig, and myself.\n  We want all gun sellers to have the peace of mind that they are \nselling their firearm to a lawful purchaser. We want gun shows to be a \nplace for legitimate business transactions and for collectors to enjoy \ntheir hobby, but never at the expense of public safety.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Smith of Oregon be added as an \noriginal cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield to my colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nUtah, Mr. Hatch, for his stewardship and his incredible efforts today \non this issue. This package and this amendment that I intend to address \nbriefly would not\n\n[[Page S5230]]\n\nhave been possible without his effort. I thank also Senator Craig and \nmy colleagues, Senators Smith, Collins, Snowe, Abraham and many others \nwho have taken an active role in this legislation today that would \nestablish background checks in a manner which is fair and workable.\n  To start with, I want to point out that this amendment closes a \nloophole, and it requires instant background checks at all events at \nwhich at least 10 exhibitors are selling firearms, or at least 20 \npercent of the exhibitors are selling guns. This prevents any sale of a \ngun or a weapon at one of these shows without an instant background \ncheck. That is the effect of this amendment.\n  Specific language says a person not licensed under this section \ndesiring to transfer a firearm at a gun show in his State of residence \nto another person who is a resident of the same State and not licensed \nunder this section:\n\n       Shall only make such a transfer through a licensee who can \n     conduct an instant background check at the gun show or \n     directly to the perspective transferee if an instant \n     background check is first conducted by a special registrant \n     at the gun show on a perspective transferee.\n\n  These background checks must be completed within 24 hours. This is \nnot an overly burdensome requirement in the face of the Columbine High \nSchool tragedy; rather, it is a responsible means of lessening the \nlikelihood of unlawful gun purchases. I believe this is something every \nMember of the Senate should be able to support.\n\n  It is my understanding this amendment has been cleared by every \nMember on this side of the aisle. I hope it will be cleared by Members \non the other side. If they desire a rollcall vote on this, that would \nbe fine. I think it should receive the unanimous support that it \ndeserves.\n  I repeat one more time: This now provides for instant background \nchecks at gun shows, and it effectively closes a loophole that was \ncreated. I am very appreciative of the Senator from Idaho for his \ncooperation in closing this loophole. It is a very strongly held belief \non his part. I think he showed great statesmanship today.\n  I thank so many of my colleagues under the leadership of Senator \nHatch, Senator Collins, Senator Snowe, and especially my friend from \nOregon, Senator Gordon Smith.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I join in thanking those who have \nsubmitted this amendment today. I especially thank Senator Hatch for \nhis indulgence and his leadership; Senator Craig, for allowing this to \ngo forward; Senator McCain, for his doggedness and determination to \nhelp a number of Members to make sure that what we began yesterday to \nclose this loophole, we, in fact, closed today.\n  I am proud to stand on the floor of the Senate and proclaim myself a \ndefender of the second amendment. I say that and also qualify it only \nin this respect: I defend the second amendment for law-abiding citizens \nto bear arms--not for nuts and crooks. I think it is possible to defend \nthis constitutional right and also defend kids in the school cafeteria. \nBut to do that, we need to make this technical amendment today.\n  I am proud to stand with my colleagues. I hope the other side will \nallow this to clear. This is something our country needs. It is \nsomething I am proud to be a part of.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the Hatch-Craig amendment package is a very \nbroad-based package bringing greater enforcement, aggressive \nprosecution that this administration has been very reluctant in \npursuing. It enhances penalties across a broad cross section of illegal \nactivities to assure that the criminal simply is not going to fall \nthrough the cracks.\n  As my colleagues from Arizona and Oregon indicated, once we were able \nto defeat the Lautenberg amendment and establish some very clear \nparameters for creating the permanency of the national instant check \nsystem and the funding of that check system and assuring that we were \nnot creating extraordinary liability for private citizens who wish to \ninvolve themselves in sales, then I thought it was right and \nappropriate that we begin to move to clarify and define gun shows and \nhow guns are sold at those gun shows.\n  That is exactly what we have done this afternoon. I think it is a \nmajor step on an issue that has brought a great expression of concern \nacross our country.\n  What is important to understand is that there is no placebo. Many \nwould rush to the floor hoping we can pass a myriad of laws. As I said \nwith the Senator from California a few moments ago, the world would \nbecome instantly and dramatically safer. We hope what we do today will \nchange the thinking in America. Law-abiding citizens have and will \nalways have constitutional rights to own and bear arms for a variety of \nreasons. What we don't want to do is create a huge Federal bureaucracy \nthat has so many tentacles in its webs that private law-abiding \ncitizens get caught up in them.\n  That is what would have happened in the Lautenberg amendment. Along \nwith that was the fear that a promoter could be almost anyone who said \nthey were in support of a gun show. They would have to become a \nlicensed Federal firearms dealer. That is not the case nor should it be \nthe case.\n  Like many people know, when you go to the local drug store today and \nyou want to charge it, you bring out your Visa card, they pass it \nthrough the machine and tell you nearly instantly if your credit is \ngood, if you can charge against the card.\n  What we want to be able to do to free up law-abiding citizens and to \ncatch the criminal in the web, is to make sure that this instant \nbackground check is embodied in the law, and that the Justice \nDepartment and the politics of any Justice Department--be it Janet Reno \nor someone else, cannot manipulate the law. That is to assure an \ninstant computerized check system which assures that felons are on it \nand adjudicated others are on it, those who find themselves defined by \nthe law as being not sufficiently responsible for the ownership of \nguns. That is what it is all about. That is what we are about here \ntoday--in the area of gun shows, that this be done.\n\n  Somehow, gun shows have been cast as some bazaar in which illegal \ncriminal activity goes on. That is not true and everybody but a few \npoliticians knows it is not true. Less than 2 percent of the guns sold \nthrough gun shows find themselves in criminal activity. We would argue \nthat is too much. We are now asking law-abiding citizens to become \ninvolved with us in making sure that guns at gun shows, now that law-\nabiding citizen is protected, will not be sold to a criminal or to a \njuvenile. So we do that and I think we strengthen the provisions by \ndoing so.\n  We also deal with another area my colleague from New York will be \ndealing with, potentially, later, and that is Internet sales. We are \nsuggesting Internet transactions that are known to be legal activities \nor that could be legal activities are against the law. What we are not \nsaying is you cannot advertise on the Internet. That is a first \namendment right and I do not think the Senator from New York would want \nto infringe on the right of commerce, to speak out.\n  Let me correct for the Record a dialog that the Senator from New \nYork, who is now on the floor, and I had yesterday. He felt, reading my \namendment that was agreed to yesterday, there was a problem. That \nproblem dealt with the potential of interstate transactions, that are \nnow prohibited, being opened up. In all fairness--I said he was wrong. \nAs he read my bill, he was reasonably accurate, because the bill had \nbeen mishandled in its typing. What we were trying to define was the \ntemporary situation of a gun show, because when we do tracking and when \nwe do background checks and records, we are dealing with addresses, \npermanent locations--permanent locations of a business, a dealer of \nguns. A gun show is not permanent, it is temporary. It is at the \nconvention hall or the fairgrounds. In doing the typing, legislative \ncounsel misqueued the wrong paragraph.\n  I must say, in all fairness, the Senator from New York was right. He \nfound it. I agreed with him. We corrected it. We are now clearly back \nto Federal law being absolutely as it is. Interstate sales of guns are \nbanned. Only under certain conditions of the Federal law can that \nhappen. So we have corrected that also in this omnibus amendment, the \nHatch-Craig amendment, that we think is right and responsible to do.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n\n[[Page S5231]]\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will be happy to yield for a brief explanation by the \nSenator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator from Idaho for yielding.\n  First, I thank him for his graciousness in correcting the Record of \nyesterday, which I very much appreciate.\n  Second, I say to the Senator, we have received this new amendment \nabout 45 minutes ago. My copy is a little warm, but I think that is \nbecause of our Xerox machine, not because of his. We are in the process \nof analyzing it and hope to very shortly be able to either agree or \ndisagree. But given what happened yesterday, we want to make sure we \nknow what is in the bill and that it is the same thing the Senator from \nIdaho thinks is in the bill. I appreciate his indulgence.\n  But I do appreciate his words. They are meaningful to me, and I am \nglad we can conduct this debate, where we disagree so strongly, in a \ncivil and fine tone.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank my colleague from New York.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will not yield for a moment. Let me correct another area \nthe Senator from New York and I had a disagreement on, but that is a \ngentlemanly disagreement. We still disagree. That deals with pawnshops.\n  In the Brady environment--that was the period of time in which we \nwere building the national background check--a 3-day period was \ninstituted, not to keep the gun from a person, but to check a person's \nbackground for the purpose of finding out whether it was legal for that \nperson to own a firearm, whether the person was a felon or not. If, \nduring that period of time, you pawned your gun at a pawnshop and then \nyou went back to retrieve it, the pawnshop owner gave it back to you, \nno questions asked. It was your gun, your name was on it, you had the \npawnshop ticket; as long as you could show ID, you got your gun back.\n  ATF and this administration are now interpreting this differently \nthrough instant check. They are saying you have to go through a \nbackground check again, and there are lawsuits out there in the \nmarketplace today because of that.\n  It is very important for the Record to show what happens. If I am the \nperson who takes a gun to a pawnshop and I pawn my gun, if I have my \npawn ticket, within 24 hours the pawnshop owner must not only report \nthe pawning of that gun to the local law enforcement authority with the \nserial numbers of the gun and my name--that is what goes on today in \nthe law. So there is a background check, per se, because if my name \nhappens to come up the name of a felon, I will never get that gun back; \nthe law enforcement can go and collect it.\n  But what is happening now is that I go in 3 months later to get my \ngun. I have my money and my ticket and my record is clear. The ATF, and \nthis administration, are saying: Foul. You have to go through a \nbackground check.\n  We are saying that is wrong. We are reinstating the Brady environment \nduring the period of the 3-day waiting period.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am happy to yield to my colleague from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Again, I want to go over the language. I agree with much \nof what the Senator said on the factual situation, but I would make one \ncorrection. The pawnshop exception was not part of Brady; it was added \nin. I remember this because I fought with then Chairman Brooks of the \nJudiciary Committee about it. It was added in the 1994 crime bill. \nBrady would have required the background check as is required today. \nThe Brooks amendment exempted pawnshops from that check. And now, with \nthe Craig amendment, we would go back to where the Brooks amendment \nwas. Am I correct in that?\n  Mr. CRAIG. To the Brooks amendment, yes. I was not in the House at \nthat time. Of course, I knew Jack Brooks was a strong defender of \nsecond amendment rights. That sounds like a pretty reasonable \nrendition.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Just one point on the pawnshop exception. The reason it \nwas put in Brady, no exception, the closing of the exception--the \nreason the administration went ahead and said that instant check \nrequired it was that, without the recheck, many people who were felons \nwould get guns.\n\n  Of the 5,000-some-odd people who went to pawnshops in this period \nbetween the Brooks amendment and the ATF's regulation, over 300 were \nfound to be felons. In other words, they were missed in the first check \nand the second check found them.\n  So I say to the Senator--and on this one we do not have to wait for \nthe language because the Senator from Idaho has said the pawnshop \nexception in the language of yesterday will stay in the bill. I think \nthat is a serious mistake. It will take us, in my judgment at least, a \nstep back because many, many, many--in this case, close to 300; 294 \npeople who were missed in the first check--were stopped in the second \ncheck. These are felons. These are not people whom the Senator from \nIdaho or I generally bend over backwards to help get guns.\n  So what is wrong with the second check when it is working? I urge the \nSenator from Idaho to reconsider and take the pawnshop exception out of \nthis amendment.\n  I yield my time. I appreciate the Senator's courtesy.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator for his discourse on this. We believe \npawnshops are now effectively regulated and their gun pawning activity \nis fully reported on a 24-hour basis to local law enforcement officers \nand that check goes forward. We think that is adequate and appropriate \nand right. That is the way it ought to be. I am not saying people who \npawn guns ought not be checked, because they currently are.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will yield to the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, yesterday I questioned the Senator from \nIdaho on his exclusion, which at that time was to ``determine qualified \ncivil liability actions should not include an action--'' and then there \nwas nothing further until we got down to ``immunity.''\n  Now he has added a couple of other sections in there which were not \nin the bill yesterday.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEAHY. If I might complete my question, I suggested yesterday, \nthe way it was written we were giving immunity against suits. In fact, \nthe court-stripping part further on would actually include suits \nagainst gun manufacturers.\n  The Senator from Idaho suggested I was wrong in that, but I notice \nnow it has been changed. Is that because I was right?\n  Mr. CRAIG. No, it is not because you were right. It is because there \nwas a section misqueued that was not included that was intended to be \nincluded.\n  If I can go forward, because you deserve this explanation and you \ndeserve this clarification because you raised the question in all \nfairness and honesty, all the immunity and exceptions within this \nsection are tied to gun show transactions. It is very important to \nunderstand that. We are not talking about an environment outside gun \nshows; we are talking about an environment inside gun shows.\n  The pending exceptions that the Senator from Vermont raised in \nquestion is a unique situation at a gun show. You and I go to a gun \nshow. You are from Vermont, and I am from Idaho. We wish to transact \nthe sale of a gun, but the gun is not there. It is at home in Vermont. \nYou are selling it to me. You and I cannot do that under the law, \nbecause we cannot transact business interstate. So we go to a dealer at \nthe gun show, and we agree that the dealer will handle the transaction. \nThat dealer will do a background check on me, the purchaser, because \nyou are selling it. You send the gun to the dealer, and the dealer \nsends it to me.\n  That is the way it is currently being done in a voluntary way so that \nyou and I do not find ourselves astraddle the Federal law on interstate \ntransactions. That is what this section deals with.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am aware of that. I have purchased both handguns and \nlong guns that way. I have had them shipped from out of State to a gun \ndealer in my own State.\n  What I am concerned about--and the question I raised yesterday and \nthe\n\n[[Page S5232]]\n\nSenator from Idaho, apparently by this redrafting, feels I raised a \nvalid question yesterday--at the end of this, you say:\n\n       A qualified civil liability action that is pending on the \n     date of enactment of this subsection shall be dismissed \n     immediately by the court.\n\n  Does this contemplate some cases that are now pending?\n  Mr. CRAIG. It is possible at the time we get the law enacted that \nthere could be pending litigation within this section of operation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Is the Senator aware of litigation now pending?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am not.\n  Mr. LEAHY. But if there is some in any Federal or State court, \nwhether it is Idaho or Vermont or Ohio or anywhere else, does not the \nSenator's legislation take out, not just Federal court, but even if \nthere is a State court where there is a case pending, it would simply \ndismiss it?\n  Mr. CRAIG. In these categories where people have found themselves \nimmune if they do the following things--background check, through the \nregistrant, under the conditions--it is important, do not think beyond \nthe box. Think of the box of a gun show and gun show activities and the \ndefinitions therein of a special registrant and a new licensee. I am \nsuggesting that we are trying to encourage people to become active in \nbackground checks and become increasingly legal by that.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I understand this, and I find sometimes I am frustrated, \nbut I accept that any time I purchase a weapon in Vermont, even though \nI am probably as well known as anybody in Vermont, they have to go \nthrough the usual record check. That is fine. I accept that.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. They better.\n  Mr. LEAHY. They do, I can assure you, just as I accept easily the \nfact that I have to go through metal detectors and x ray machines when \nI get on an airplane. I am for that. I think it makes a great deal of \nsense.\n  What concerns me, I tell my friend from Idaho, is that what this is \nsaying, in this court-stripping part, this says my State of Vermont is \nbeing told, even if they have a case, a qualified civil liability \naction pending, it will be dismissed by this. We do not even know \nwhether there are such cases pending around the country, but we are \ntelling the 50 States of this country and their legislatures: If you \nhave a case pending, tough, the Senate has just decided it for you.\n  I am wondering, for example, whether this is covering current city \nlawsuits that are based, in part, on gun show sales. Some cities have \nbrought some lawsuits based on gun show sales. Are we throwing their \nsuits out?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Let me reclaim my time to discuss that briefly, and then I \nwill yield the floor because others wish to debate.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Does the Senator understand my question? I think it is a \nvalid question.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Here is what we are saying. We are saying in this law that \nthe people who abide by the law have done nothing wrong. If they go \nthrough the background check and do all the legal things, they have \ndone nothing wrong; they are within the law. If the gun happens to fall \ninto the hands of a criminal and is used in a crime and somebody wants \nto trace it back to them and make them liable, we are saying, no, no; \nyou were a law-abiding citizen. You cannot say that they were wrong \nbecause their gun at sometime in the future fell into the hands of a \ncriminal and was used. The Senator knows today those kinds of lawsuits \nare going on out there.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Do we also dismiss the lawsuit against the manufacturers?\n  Mr. CRAIG. No.\n  Mr. LEAHY. It is hard to read it otherwise.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I read it that way because of the transaction within the \ngun show. Think inside the box. Everybody likes to find the bogeyman \noutside the gun show. We are talking about a unique class of operatives \ninside a gun show. We are encouraging them to become increasingly more \nlegal by using background checks. Legal in this sense: Law abiding \ncitizens like you and me who might own a gun----\n  Mr. LEAHY. I own a lot of guns.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Want to make darn sure it does not fall into the hands of \ncriminals. If we go through the background check as we sell it and the \nguy or gal is pure, we are OK. What if down the road the gun falls into \nthe hands of a criminal and here comes your city or a city that says: \nYou are liable because you are the seller we can trace to because of \nyour record. I can say to you under this: Because you did it in a legal \nway, you are not liable. That encourages you to pursue legal \nactivities. It does not deal with manufacturer liability. That is \nanother issue for another day, not addressed anywhere in these \namendments.\n  Mr. President, that is as thorough as I can get with the Senator from \nVermont. Let me conclude, because there are others who wish to debate.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRAIG. No, I will not. I will let the Senator seek the floor to \ndebate on his time.\n  I suggest that the Hatch-Craig amendments are a major step toward the \nenforcement of gun laws in this Nation, of stopping criminals who use a \ngun in the commission of a crime, to make sure that the transaction \ndoes not result in guns falling into the hands of criminals, and still \nrecognizing that the Internet is a fair and first amendment-protected \nexpression as long as those expressions are not found to be illegal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I see the following people on the floor who \nwant to speak and want to be factored into this.\n  On our side is Senator Collins, Senator DeWine, and Senator Sessions. \nCan I ask how much time they want.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Five minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Five minutes for Senator Collins; 10 minutes for Senator \nSessions; 10 minutes for Senator DeWine.\n  We have Senator Durbin, Senator Schumer, and Senator Lautenberg on \nthe other side.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If I might, I say to the distinguished chairman, if he \nwill yield to me----\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Some of these amendments, at this point particularly, that \nhave just arrived--I think the Senator from New York described it as \nbeing still warm from the copying machine. We have several Senators in \nthe Cloakroom who are just looking at it, who have just received it. We \nare getting calls. My beeper is going off here. I am reading: Somebody \nwants to check this one, wants to check this one. Let's let the debate \ncontinue here for a bit while we try to do it.\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes. But I want to figure out how we do it. I think we \nshould go back and forth.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I agree with that.\n  Mr. HATCH. Can I ask the Senators on this side, how much time would \nyou like, at least initially?\n  Mr. LEAHY. We do not know.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. Sure. I yield to know how much time.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. In response to his question, I say to the Senator that \nprobably, when at least my staff's analysis of the proposal is \nfinished, I would like to speak for maybe 10 minutes on it, maybe a \nlittle more. But I say to the Senator that I could not agree to any \nkind of time limit until we analyze the bill.\n  The Senator from Idaho came over to me early this morning and said \nthat I had been right in some of my complaints, I guess, about his \nproposal. I said, fine. Get me language and I will analyze it and I \nwill not delay in any way.\n  Mr. HATCH. We understand.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. We got the language at 3:30, or maybe a little before \nthat. It takes a little while to analyze. I do not think any of us want \nto go through the same problems we went through yesterday where we did \nnot understand what was in the bill.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me put you down temporarily for 10 minutes, or more if \nyou need it. I want an idea of the time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I really have questions that get down to the basics of \nwhether or not the Craig amendment replaces yesterday's amendment or is \nadded to yesterday's amendment. That is it. He left the floor, I am \nsorry, because it was a question I had.\n\n[[Page S5233]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I will try to answer those questions if I can. And Senator \nLautenberg has indicated to me that he will need some extensive time \nhere.\n  Would you have any objection to allowing Senator Collins to go first \nfor her 5 minutes?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Is it a gun-related issue?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am afraid it is.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. It is.\n  Mr. HATCH. It is on this amendment. She just wants to speak to this \namendment for debate only.\n  Ms. COLLINS. For 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is there any objection to that?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I would be happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. HATCH. We can get some of these shorter remarks over, and then \nyou could have adequate time. Could I then go to Senator Sessions for \n10 minutes?\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I do think we need some time on this side to respond, \nbut I do not want to close down the debate, very honestly, because we \nhave patiently, or impatiently, listened to a fairly extensive debate.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, let's go back and forth from each side, as \nthe Senator from Utah suggested, without locking down the time. One of \nthe reasons why we have a concern, I say to my friend from Utah, is \nthat yesterday we were trying to rush some of these votes forward. I \nraised the problem with the distinguished Senator from Idaho. I said: I \nthought there was a whole part of the bill missing. Basically, my \nargument was dismissed.\n  Let's go on with the vote.\n  This afternoon, they say: Oh, by the way, this part you said was \nmissing, yes, it was. Now we have added it back in.\n  I did not raise it nonchalantly. I thought it was serious. So I think \nthat we ought to at least, if we have just gotten a hot piece of \nlegislation still warm from the Xerox machine, get a chance to see it. \nIt would be a lot easier to take a few minutes longer and make sure it \nis done correctly and we know what we are voting on than we go through \nas we did yesterday when the concerns that Senator Schumer and I raised \nwere sort of dismissed, and now we find, yes, we were right, and we are \nback into the thing.\n  Let's make sure everybody understands where we are going.\n  I say to the Senator from Utah, maybe during the votes at 5 o'clock \nhe and I might meet with interested parties to see if we can work times \nout.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me make this suggestion. I hope it will be found \nacceptable to colleagues on the other side. Since they are studying \nthis amendment--and have had it for over an hour --since they are \nstudying this amendment and need to finish their studies, I ask \nunanimous consent that Senator Collins be permitted to proceed for 5 \nminutes and that Senator Sessions be permitted to proceed for 10 \nminutes, and if Senator DeWine is here, let him get his until 5 \no'clock.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Can anybody on this side speak?\n  Mr. HATCH. Sure. If they need more time to study it--\n  Mr. LEAHY. Couldn't we go side to side as we normally do?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is fine. We would start with Senator Collins on our \nside for 5 minutes, and then on your side, and then back on our side.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Just to be sure.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let the Senator go, and then Senator Sessions.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. If the distinguished manager would yield, we are \ntalking about a sequence including the Senator from Maine for 5 \nminutes, then over here?\n  Mr. HATCH. Sure.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Then back to the other side? I have no problem with \nthat as long as the time that we get over here is a reasonable slot of \ntime.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that the time between now and 5 \no'clock, when the votes start, be divided equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Between the two leaders?\n  Mr. HATCH. Between the two leaders.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. HATCH. There will be more time afterwards.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. If you eat crow, you have to do it when it is warm.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield to you.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Thank you. Because what happened is we had an \nextensive delivery by the distinguished Senator from Idaho. And if we \nare now going to divide up the time, it is a little out of balance. So \nI say this to the Senator from Utah, that if we agree to give up 10 \nminutes now, and reserve, perhaps, 15 for our side, just to get a \nlittle bit of balance in here, and we are going to continue the \ndebate----\n  Mr. HATCH. That is fine.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Let's divide it equally.\n  Mr. HATCH. OK. And I ask unanimous consent that the first speaker be \nSenator Collins.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to dividing the time \nequally?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Between now and 5?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Between now and 5.\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. HATCH. Our first speaker is the Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the distinguished chairman for his patience in \nworking this out. And I also thank the Senators from Vermont and New \nJersey for agreeing to this arrangement.\n  Mr. President, I rise to support the provisions in the Hatch-Craig \namendment requiring background checks at gun shows. I believe we have \nvery carefully crafted provisions that strike the right balance. I \nsupport the requirement that sales of firearms at gun shows pass the \nmuster of an instant background check. Gun shows are a popular \nmechanism for buying and selling guns, and these legitimate business \ntransactions should be made with the knowledge that the sellers are \nselling their firearms to lawful purchasers.\n  What I opposed yesterday is something I will always oppose--and that \nis the creation of a Federal centralized recordkeeping system of gun \nowners. That would be a heavy regulatory burden that would seriously \ninfringe on the privacy rights of millions of law-abiding American \ncitizens who own guns. That is why I voted against the amendment \noffered by the Senator from New Jersey.\n  I would like to make one brief comment regarding gun shows. I am very \nconcerned that the publicity surrounding this issue has created the \nfalse impression that gun shows are somehow gathering places for \ncriminals, anarchists, and mercenaries. Nothing could be further from \nthe truth. In reality, thousands of Americans go to gun shows every \nweekend in this country. People who attend these shows live in every \nState in the Union. They come from all walks of life. They share a \ncommon interest in a part-time hobby that is deeply ingrained in our \nAmerican culture. Many are sportsmen or target shooters; many others \nare collectors who enjoy showing, buying and selling their antique \nfirearms.\n  These are people who enjoy the tradition of responsible gun ownership \nin this country. This is a tradition--and a right--that we need to \npreserve.\n  Our gun laws should be directed at the illegal misuse of firearms, \nnot the lawful ownership of guns by law-abiding citizens. The first \nstep we should take is to address the concerns the Senator from Alabama \nwill speak on shortly that gun laws are not being strictly enforced. \nThe Senator from Alabama has documented an appalling drop in \nprosecutions of gun-related offenses, gun control laws under this \nadministration.\n  That should be our first step.\n  Second, the Republican package puts together reasonable restrictions \nthat will ensure that guns do not fall into the hands of criminals \nthrough the mechanism of a gun show.\n  I know the people who attend gun shows across America want to make \nsure they are selling to people who will use firearms in a responsible \nway that is the American tradition.\n  This legislation before us strikes the right balance, and I urge \nsupport of the amendment. I commend those who have worked on this to \nrespond to the concerns we raised yesterday.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time to the chairman of the \ncommittee.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Hatch-Craig\n\n[[Page S5234]]\n\namendment to S. 254, the Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender \nAccountability and Rehabilitation Act. This amendment provides four \nimportant components in the efforts of combating juvenile violence and \ncrime.\n  I also want to thank the Majority Leader, Senator Lott, Senators \nHatch, Craig and McCain for listening to my concerns and working with \nme to ensure the National Instant Check System applies to all sales \nmade at gun shows.\n  This amendment provides for more aggressive prosecution of criminals \nwho use guns to commit crime, enhances penalties on criminals who use \nguns, increases protection of children from gun violence. Most \nimportantly, this amendment mandates that individuals purchasing \nweapons at gun shows must undergo a background check through the \nNational Instant Check System. This is the same requirement currently \nin place for purchases made at gun shows, when buying a weapon from a \nlicenced gun dealer.\n  Mr. President, gun shows are community events, usually held over a \nweekend at State Fairgrounds, convention centers, or exhibit halls. \nThese shows have been going on for years and attract a wide cross \nsection of gun owners. At the shows, people not only buy, sell, or \ntrade firearms, they also exchange tips on hunting, gunsmithing, and \nfirearm history.\n  By implementing an instant check system at gun shows, law abiding gun \nbuyers can receive their background check within minutes and be able to \nobtain the firearm they wish to add to their collection. On the other \nhand, criminals and other people who are not allowed to possess \nfirearms can be identified and arrested for trying to purchase a \nweapon, in violation of the law.\n  Mr. President, this amendment, of which I am a co-sponsor, provides a \ngood balance between allowing law-abiding citizens to purchase weapons \nat gun shows without burdensome regulations and preventing criminals \nfrom obtaining weapons from individuals at gun shows.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: What time is the \nvote scheduled for?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five.\n  Mr. LEAHY. How much time is there for the Senator from Vermont?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 12 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from Vermont, and I thank the \nChair.\n  If the audience here or out there is mystified, I wouldn't be \nsurprised, because I think we, too, are mystified. We are buried under \na volume of language and words, and we are not addressing the point.\n  The point is whether or not we are willing to say, if guns are sold, \nthere has to be a measure of identification of the buyer. That is the \nquestion. Ask the parents in Littleton, CO, what they think. Should we \nhave identified everybody who walks into a gun show? Describe the gun \nshow as you will, we will talk about that in a minute. Should everybody \nwho buys a gun at a gun show be identified? I think yes.\n  The shallow arguments about, we have 40,000 laws on the books and \ntherefore why do we need one more--well, you tell me what happened when \nTerry Nichols and Timothy McVeigh were out at a gun show selling guns \nto raise money for their terrorist operation. What is the point?\n  Obviously, the laws that we have do not cover all of the situations. \nI say this. I just heard the distinguished Senator from Maine say it, I \nhave heard the Senator from Idaho say it and others. There is no \nblanket accusation here that says everybody who goes to a gun show is a \nfelon, an anarchist, a crook, a thug--not at all. But we want to \nprotect those families who do go to gun shows with an earnest interest \nin seeing what is around and maybe buying a hunting rifle or what have \nyou. Why should they be ashamed? Why should anybody be ashamed or \nunwilling to leave their name behind when they take this lethal weapon \nand stick it in their pocket? That is the problem. No matter how much \nlanguage is thrown out here, we ought to try to cut through it and see \nwhat the mission is.\n\n  The mission is to try to protect the NRA, not to protect the people \nof our country, the innocents who send their kids to school every day \nof the week and now pray that the children come back not only learned \nbut safe and sound. That is the message we are trying to get across \nhere.\n  We hear this obfuscational language: Well, if they had this and they \nhad that and they didn't have measles and they had some other \ncondition, then it is all right.\n  Stop with the loopholes. I offered an amendment yesterday which was \nclear and concise, which said that everybody who buys a gun ought to be \nidentified and that those dealers who are unlicensed dealers, call them \nwhat you will, who can sell guns out of the trunk of their car in any \nquantity they want, to anybody they want, without getting so much as a \nname, except the cash on the barrelhead, walk away, someone buys 10 \nguns, there is not an ounce of suspicion raised about that.\n  We heard the Senator from Idaho yesterday say, well, a measly 2 \npercent, that is all, 2 percent of the guns sold in these gun shows, \nonly 2 percent, are unlicensed. Then he was gentleman enough and \nsincere enough to say, I made a mistake; it wasn't 2 percent; it is 40 \npercent. Forty percent. Two percent. That is a significant difference.\n  So he said he realized only too late that 40 percent of the people \nwho bought guns at gun shows bought them from unlicensed dealers--or 40 \npercent of the guns sold, forgive me, were from unlicensed dealers.\n  Well, that is pretty significant. That is a lot of guns floating out \nthere that nobody has any record of, unless someone volunteers to leave \ntheir name. I do not see a lot of volunteers coming up throwing their \nphoto ID on the counter and saying, hey, give me a dozen guns, will \nyou. You don't see that happening.\n  We ought to clear the air, clear the language here, tell the American \npeople, as they were told yesterday--I want everybody within earshot to \nremember this--yesterday there were 47 of us who voted to close a \nloophole. There were 51 people who voted to leave it open, to make sure \nthat those who want to buy a gun without identifying themselves could \nstill have the liberty to do so.\n  We hear all kinds of specious arguments--another bureaucratic \nimposition on free citizens in this country. We have laws in this \ncountry. We are a country of laws. It says so in our Constitution. If \nyou have laws, you have to have a structure. You have to have an \norderly process by which those laws are developed and enforced. Our job \nhere is to develop them.\n  So what is wrong with having people enforce laws that we think \notherwise might bring harm and injury to innocent people? I do not want \nmy grandchildren going to school with other kids who might be able to \nget their hands on a gun because a father or a relative left the gun \nunattended. I think it is terrible. I think they ought to be \nresponsible for the actions that that child who takes the gun brings \nupon his or her classmates or friends.\n  So we ought to clean up the language here so the American people know \nwhat we are talking about. Some of us are for closing the loophole and \nsome of us are for leaving it open.\n  The vote yesterday was quite a revelation. It should have been for \nthe American public. Yesterday 51 percent of the people in this room \nsaid: Do not close the loophole. Do not take away the rights of someone \nwho wants to be unidentified, anonymous, buying guns out there. Permit \nthem to do it, because otherwise it is an infraction of their rights. \nIf a neighbor wants to sell a gun to a neighbor, why shouldn't he be \nable to do it without having to go through the trouble of identifying \nhim?\n\n  Try to give your neighbor your car and not take note of the transfer. \nIf that neighbor has that car and it still has your name on it, you are \nresponsible for it, whatever it is that happens.\n  We see immediately now in the presentation today some apologies. The \napology is not for the American people. The apology is to those who \nmight be inconvenienced because they have to identify themselves when \nthey buy a\n\n[[Page S5235]]\n\ngun. We ought not to be apologizing to them. We ought to apologize to \nevery parent, to every family, to everyone who might be injured by a \ngun that is bought, 40 percent of those guns that come out of gun shows \nwithout any identification. That is what we are talking about. We are \nclearly divided on the issue.\n  Now what has happened, there is kind of a fail-safe that has \ndeveloped, because yesterday not only brought the picture into focus, \nbut it also said to the American people, who are enraged by what is \nhappening in these schools, enraged, pained--87 percent of the people \nin this country said close the loophole. But in this Senate, 51 percent \nsaid: No, don't close the loophole; we want to protect the rights of \nthose who would buy guns as if it was in the dark of night.\n  So today we see an attempt at a legislative redress for the error \nthat was made yesterday that was caught by the newspapers. It was \ncaught by television. It was caught by the public at large, who are \nindignant. We hear it couched in flowery phrases--I didn't know there \nwas that exception, or I didn't know there was this exception--when \nthey heard from their constituents and the constituents were angry and \nmortified by the fact that their representative voted to keep open the \nloophole.\n  So now we are trying to figure out what it is exactly that is being \nproposed. If we are cynical and suspicious, we should be, because \nyesterday the vote was one way and today it suddenly dawns on them that \nmaybe people who buy guns ought to really leave their name behind, \nregardless of whether the dealer is a federally licensed dealer or just \nsomeone who throws up a table and pays a $10 fee at a gun show. We are \ntalking about the definition of ``gun show'' and the definition of \n``dealer.'' Nonsense. We ought to talk about the lives that we can \nsave, about the children that we can protect. I hope that the debate is \ngoing to get into that area before this discussion is over.\n  I hope that we look carefully at what is being proposed and study it \nbecause it came up all of a sudden--suddenly, to have an agreement \nthat, OK, some people ought to have their names identified with their \npurchase but not for others.\n  Mr. President, I yield back my time with the understanding that we \nare going to be discussing this after the votes we are going to take.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield such time as remains to the Senator \nfrom Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, all of us agree we need to do a better job \nof keeping track of guns that might fall into vulnerable young hands. \nThat is why I support the amendment offered by the distinguished \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, which contains \nseveral measures that I have developed that would help to achieve these \ngoals.\n  Mr. President, the most effective method to assure that gun sellers \nand dealers are selling their products to law-abiding citizens is the \nbackground check. In 1993, Congress passed the Brady bill, which is \ndesigned, in part at least, to move us toward the National Instant \nCheck System for gun sales. Due to this initiative, we have expanded \nand made more accessible the National Instant Criminal Background Check \nSystem, also known as NICS. Now, could this system be improved? The \nanswer is, yes, it could be. For example, today, handgun checks are \n``name only'' checks, which frequently come back inconclusive because a \npotential purchaser may have a similar name as a convicted offender, or \nthat potential purchaser could be using a false name, or an alias. When \nthis happens, a manual check has to be performed.\n\n  Mr. President, one way we can improve the instant check system is \nthrough technology that is now available, which can check a purchaser's \nfingerprint against a single print database. The time has come for this \nidea; it is an idea worth exploring. Our amendment would direct the \nAttorney General of the United States to study the feasibility of \ncreating a single print instant check system and database to enable a \nvoluntary, rapid, and accurate search of potential gun purchasers. \nCurrently, there are 40 million fingerprint cards in the master \ncriminal fingerprint file from which convicted offender prints could be \nplaced online for an instant search. With a single print database, \nfirearm dealers could facilitate the completion of a gun sale. A single \nprint system could reduce the potential for felons to obtain firearms \nthrough the use of false identification. It would close a major \nloophole.\n  Mr. President, we can also improve the system by ensuring that our \nrecords are accurate and up to date. I have often said that type of \ninformation is absolutely critical and vital to good police work. \nInformation can and does save lives. Mr. President, our background \ncheck system is only as good as the information that is in it. The \nunfortunate fact is that serious record backlogs exist in many States. \nMany of our State databases are simply incomplete, and many are very \ninaccurate. We have improved it over the years but we have a long way \nto go. Since the instant check system became effective last November, \nover 900 individuals who have been convicted for class one felonies--\nmurder, rape, serious assaults--were able to buy guns because the \nappropriate records were simply not available.\n  Mr. President, States desperately need financial help to eliminate \nthis dangerous records gap and to plug this loophole. Our amendment \nwould provide $25 million to central repository directors to facilitate \nlogging in, dispositions, including assistance to courts to automate \ntheir current records systems.\n  Everybody will benefit from this more-thorough criminal history--law \nenforcement and the public, in general. We can improve our background \ncheck system by expanding it to include records of those who have not \nbroken the law, but who are still prohibited under current law from \npossessing firearms. These people include involuntary commitments to \nmental health institutions and those subject to domestic restraining \norders. Those are the people who, many times, are also falling through \nthe cracks of our current system.\n  This amendment would direct the Attorney General of the United States \nto develop procedures by which nonconviction and other data can be \navailable for the instant check system, stopping people who are \ncurrently prohibited from possessing a firearm, but who the current \nsystem is not watching. This amendment would fully fund the National \nInstant Check System to pay for the operation costs of background \nchecks. The FBI would be provided operations costs of performing \ninstant checks, and also States serving as point of contact States will \nbe reimbursed by up to $7 per background check.\n  Finally, we need to better provide information not just on the \nlawbreakers, but on the guns they use to commit crimes. To accomplish \nthis goal requires a strong investment in the national integrated \nballistic identification network. This system combines the ballistic \nand forensic capabilities of the FBI and ATF to create one enhanced \nballistic system for State and local law enforcement agencies. This \namendment before us would provide funds, much-needed funds, to expedite \nthis process.\n  Mr. President, a greater investment of innovative thinking and \nresources is urgently needed to improve the National Instant Check \nSystem. This amendment would provide that investment. It would make the \nsystem more responsive, more accurate and, yes, more thorough. Most \nimportant, it would make our efforts to keep guns out of hands of \nchildren and criminals more effective. Mr. President, this amendment \nwill save lives.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The remaining time is 1 minute 46 seconds \ncontrolled by the Senator from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, may I inquire of the state of time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 15 seconds remaining before the 5 \no'clock time for voting, and there will be 5 minutes equally divided \nbetween the two sides. At this point, the Senator controls 2\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n\n[[Page S5236]]\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. It is my understanding that I am eligible to spend the \n2\\1/2\\ minutes in favor of the Ashcroft amendment at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The Ashcroft amendment is a very simple amendment. It recognizes that \nin addition to handguns, which require some special responsibility and, \ntherefore, are prohibited for sale to minors, and are even prohibited \nin private sales to minors, and for them to be in the possession of a \nminor requiring the permission of parents, that the same kind of rules \nought to apply to semiautomatic assault rifles as apply to handguns as \nit relates to minors.\n  Right now, where handgun sales to minors are prohibited, \nsemiautomatic assault rifle sales to minors are permitted. Where a \nminor, in order to have a handgun, has to have parental permission, a \nminor can own an assault rifle, a semiautomatic assault rifle without \nparental permission.\n  The Ashcroft amendment simply wants to remove this disparity, because \nit expresses a belief that a semiautomatic assault rifle, assault \nweapon, ought to have the same level of responsibility attendant to it \nas a handgun.\n  The Ashcroft amendment would prohibit private sales of semiautomatic \nassault rifles to minors, and it would require that they have parental \npermission in order for one even to be in the possession of a minor.\n  This really makes the rules about handguns and semiautomatic assault \nweapons identical for all basic intents and purposes. There are some \nexceptions in the law for purposes of the possession of handguns that \nrelate to employment. There are some minors, for instance, who are \nrequired in their employment to be involved with a handgun. Those \nexceptions would be the same basically as well.\n  The thrust of this amendment is to say that this situation where \nsemiautomatic assault weapons were not required to have the level of \nresponsibility that we had assigned to handguns for juveniles, that \nshould be changed so that assault rifles and the semiautomatic assault \nweapons have the same kind of responsibility requirements that had \npreviously been applied to handguns resulting in the requirement that \nthere be parental permission before there can even be possession, and \nthat there would not be a potential for purchase in private sales.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this reasonable and simple \nchange in the law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator's time has \nexpired. Who yields time in opposition to the amendment?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will take this side's time.\n  I have listened to the debate and read the amendment. It is deja vu. \nIt is very similar to the Leahy law enforcement amendment that the \nRepublican majority voted down yesterday. The Leahy amendment, which \nwas the Democratic consensus position on gun control, included the \nenhanced parental penalties for the transfer of handguns, assault \nweapons, and high-capacity ammunition clips to juveniles and the ban on \nthe juvenile possession of handguns, assault weapons and high-capacity \nammunition clips. This amendment has a couple of changes. It increases \nthe exceptions for such transfers.\n  But if imitation is the highest form of flattery, then I guess I \nshould be flattered where all the Democrats signed onto the \none amendment that was voted down by the Republicans yesterday. Of \ncourse, I am going to support this amendment, because it is so similar \nto the form of what we had yesterday.\n\n  I just wish it had adopted a couple of other consensus positions. I \nwish it included our gun ban for life for dangerous juvenile offenders. \nFor the life of me, I cannot understand why the other side opposes my \nproposal, the Democrat proposal, that if you have a juvenile who is \nconvicted of assault with a deadly weapon, is convicted of murder, or \nattempted murder, why that person should not be banned for life from \nowning a gun.\n  I wish it had the money that we put into mine that was dedicated just \nto Federal prosecution of the firearms violations. I wish it had the \nresources for firearm tracing that we put under the youth crime \ninterdiction initiative. But perhaps when they look at the rest of my \namendment that will be in the next Republican package. I hope it is.\n  To the extent that this primarily includes a number of the things \nthat I had in my amendment yesterday, of course, I will be consistent \nenough to vote for it again this time.\n  Ralph Waldo Emerson once said: ``A foolish consistency is the \nhobgoblin of little minds.'' There are no hobgoblins on the other side. \nThey don't mind being inconsistent in voting for it today when they \nvoted for it yesterday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent Ms. Collins be added as cosponsor \nof the Hatch-Craig-McCain-DeWine-Smith amendment that is pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask for the yeas and nays on both amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n342. On this question, the yeas and nays have been ordered, and the \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye) and \nthe Senator from New York (Mr. Moynihan), are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from New \nYork (Mr. Moynihan), would vote ``aye.''\n  The result was announced--yeas 96, nays 2, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 115 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--96\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bryan\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--2\n\n     Enzi\n     Smith (NH)\n       \n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Inouye\n     Moynihan\n       \n  The amendment (No. 342) was agreed to.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I know all the Senators are interested in what the \nschedule might be. It is that time of the week when we begin to have to \nmake some decisions. I would like for us to finish this bill tonight. \nThere have been a dozen or more amendments that have been considered \nand others I am sure have been accepted. We still have a large number \nof amendments, though, that are pending.\n  I hope Senators will consider either not offering their amendments or \nagreeing to put them in a package of amendments. We are encouraging \nSenators on this side of the aisle to do that, and we have at least one \nthat has been done that way.\n  If we finish the bill tonight, then we will not have any votes \ntomorrow. If we do not finish it tomorrow, then it is essential we stay \nin tomorrow. This is important legislation. A lot of amendments have \nbeen offered. Others will be offered that are critical amendments and \nvery important to Members on both sides. I have discussed this with\n\n[[Page S5237]]\n\nSenator Daschle, and I know Senators on both sides and the managers are \ntrying to work through a list of amendments that probably is still in \nthe range of 40 or 50. We have to work very fast and hard to get \nthrough those.\n  With that in mind, I say, again, that we will go as late as we can \ntonight. I know we have a delegation of eight or so Senators that is \nsupposed to leave for Kosovo at 6:30 in the morning. We will have to \nask them to delay that. We can keep going tomorrow and we can keep \ngoing, if it is the desire of the Senate, even into Saturday. I have to \ncheck with Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy. They are committed to \ngetting this bill done.\n  The reason we have to complete it this week is that next week we have \nto deal with supplemental appropriations, which I hope will be ready \nthen. We hope to have something we can vote on concerning Y2K next \nweek. We have the bankruptcy bill. We also have State Department \nauthorization, defense authorization and defense appropriations and a \nsatellite bill, all of which we would like to consider and get done \nbefore the Memorial Day recess.\n  It is not a question of not wanting to complete this bill. It is just \nwe do not have time next week. So we will either have to work through \nthese amendments quickly or we will have to keep going tonight and over \ninto tomorrow. Please work with the managers. They are trying to do the \njob and they need your cooperation. I say to those of you who are \nlooking to leave tonight or tomorrow morning, right now it looks as if \nwe will not be able to finish tonight and we will have to be in session \ntomorrow. We cannot even give you assurances that we will finish by \nnoon. We will just have to keep going until we get it done.\n  If we really cooperate with these managers, which happens quite \noften, I believe we can finish tonight. I looked down the list, and I \nthink there are maybe four to six amendments that we really need to \nhave discussion and votes on. I think we can find a way to complete \nthat tonight or early in the morning.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 343, As Further Modified\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, it is my \nunderstanding that I have 2\\1/2\\ minutes to wrap up the amendment.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, in light of the action the Senate just \ntook in adopting the ban on juvenile possession of assault weapons and \nlarge clips, I ask unanimous consent to modify my amendment by striking \nsections 503 and 504 which will do essentially the same thing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Can the Senator from California clarify for us--we have \nall studied her original amendment, but what are you changing in your \namendment that would be subject to a vote?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I will be very happy to answer that question. \nEssentially, a part of my amendment was also Senator Ashcroft's \namendment, with some technical changes, particularly in the exemptions. \nWhat we are doing by this is accepting Senator Ashcroft's amendment and \nseparating out the part of my amendment which would close the loophole \nin the assault weapons legislation and ban the importation of the big \nclips, just as these clips are now prohibited from domestic manufacture \nin this country.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield for an additional question?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. CRAIG. In the original amendment, the Senator bans a class of \nfirearm that is used in schools and colleges for professional target \nshooting and target practice. Has she taken that particular provision \nout?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. CRAIG. All right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as further modified, is as follows:\n       On page 276, below the matter following line 3, add the \n     following:\n\n                        TITLE V--ASSAULT WEAPONS\n\n     SEC. 501. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Juvenile Assault Weapon \n     Loophole Closure Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 502. BAN ON IMPORTING LARGE CAPACITY AMMUNITION FEEDING \n                   DEVICES.\n\n       Section 922(w) of title 18, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (1), by striking ``(1) Except as provided \n     in paragraph (2)'' and inserting ``(1)(A) Except as provided \n     in subparagraph (B)'';\n       (2) in paragraph (2), by striking ``(2) Paragraph (1)'' and \n     inserting ``(B) Subparagraph (A)'';\n       (3) by inserting before paragraph (3) the following new \n     paragraph (2):\n       ``(2) It shall be unlawful for any person to import a large \n     capacity ammunition feeding device.''; and\n       (4) in paragraph (4)--\n       (A) by striking ``(1)'' each place it appears and inserting \n     ``(1)(A)''; and\n       (B) by striking ``(2)'' and inserting ``(1)(B)''.\n\n     SEC. 505. DEFINITION OF LARGE CAPACITY AMMUNITION FEEDING \n                   DEVICE.\n\n       Section 921(a)(31) of title 18, United States Code, is \n     amended by striking ``manufactured after the date of \n     enactment of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement \n     Act of 1994''.\n\n     SEC. 506. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act and the amendments made by this Act except Secs. \n     502 and 505 shall take effect 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, if I may then discuss what is in the \ndivision of the question. When we passed the assault weapons \nlegislation in 1994, there was a grandfather clause which permitted the \ncontinued importation of shipments of clips, drums and strips of large \nsize, large size being defined here by more than 10 bullets.\n  In the legislation passed in 1994, the domestic manufacture of these \nsame clips and the sale of these same clips and the possession of these \nsame clips was made illegal. The loophole is permitting the importation \nof foreign clips while we close off the manufacture of them \ndomestically, the sale of the domestic clip. These new clips, \nmanufactured after the ban, the fact of the matter is, are coming in.\n  I submitted for the record BATF statistics that in 6 months 8.6 \nmillion clips are approved for entry from 20 different countries, many \nof them as big as 250 rounds, 90 rounds, 70 rounds, 50 rounds, by the \nhundreds of thousands. We are trying to cut off that loophole.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will be very brief.\n  I do stand in opposition. Last year, we had the same vote on the \nfloor, and it was to overturn the 1994 law that creates some \nexceptions. It is the exception that the Senator disagrees with now as \nit relates to the importation of a form of automatic loading device, \nbetter known as a clip.\n  The vote last year was 54 to 44 in opposition to that amendment on a \ntabling motion. I hope we can continue to maintain that position. I \nthink it is consistent with the law that we passed in 1994.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment, \nas further modified. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I move to table the Feinstein amendment \nand ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable amendment No. 343, as further modified. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye) and \nthe Senator from New York (Mr. Moynihan) are necesssarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from New \nYork (Mr. Moynihan) would vote ``no.''\n  The result was announced--yeas 39, nays 59, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 116 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--39\n\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cochran\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Enzi\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Leahy\n     Lott\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n\n[[Page S5238]]\n\n\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n\n                                NAYS--59\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Boxer\n     Bryan\n     Byrd\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Smith (OR)\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Inouye\n     Moynihan\n       \n  The motion was rejected.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent that we vitiate the yeas and nays \non the underlying amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof Senator Feinstein.\n  The amendment (No. 343), as further modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Snowe \nbe added as a cosponsor to the Hatch-Craig amendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the Chamber is not in order. I was \nunable to hear the request. I would like to hear it before it is agreed \nto.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator renew his request?\n  Members in the well will take their conversations to the cloakroom.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Snowe \nbe added as a cosponsor to the Hatch-Craig amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to call to the attention of the \nSenate that we have possible Democrat amendments of 51 and possible \nRepublican amendments of 22. We have disposed of 12 or 13.\n  Look, this is ridiculous. We have been very fair. Both sides have had \nan opportunity to present what they wanted to present. We have had some \nterrible amendments here from one side or the other, and we fought them \nthrough and we have done what is right.\n  Let me tell you something. I would like to move through this matter \nas quickly as we can. I would like to have colleagues on both sides \nreduce the number of amendments. If you absolutely don't have to have \nthe amendment, let's withdraw it. This is a very, very important bill. \nWe are talking about kids all over this country who are getting away \nwith murder.\n  We are talking about vicious, violent juveniles who are wrecking our \ncountry and wrecking our schools and creating gangs and doing things \nthat are really causing this country chaotic conditions.\n  We have a bill here that is bipartisan that really will do something \nabout that. There have been wins on both sides, and I think to the \nbetterment of this bill. I think it is time for us to get down and \nstart working on it and get it done.\n  I can't imagine why anybody in this body wouldn't want to get this \nbill done, especially with 2 years of work and all kinds of effort and \nwork here on the floor by both sides.\n  I want to compliment my Democratic leader on this bill for the good \nwork he has done on this, and the work we have been able to do \ntogether. It is clear we can't pass this bill with 77 amendments.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order, and the Senator \nfrom Utah is going to be heard, especially if he is going to be \npraising me. I want him to be heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). We will please have order in \nthe body.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. We clearly can't pass this bill if we have to have 73 \namendments. There is just no way we have time in this legislative \nsession to do it. This bill has virtually everything in it to help us \nto resolve these problems. We all have pet projects in the amendments \nthat we bring up. It is time to start restraining ourselves and quit \ndelaying this particular bill.\n  I am getting to the point--we are not there yet, but we are getting \nto the point where I am going to start moving to table every doggone \namendment that will come up. I am going to table them right off the \nbat, because I think we have gone way too far here. If we had a big \npartisan thing here where your side or our side was being mistreated, \nthat is another matter, but this has been very fairly conducted, and \neverybody knows it.\n  I think it is time to get serious about solving these juvenile \njustice problems in our society. This bill has been improved to a large \ndegree. Some of us believe it has been hurt a little bit, but that is \nthe process. Now it is time to sit down and get this done.\n  Look, we have the Hatch-Craig amendment. Admittedly, our side has had \nmore time on that amendment.\n  I would like to get a time agreement. The minority has had that \namendment for well over 2\\1/2\\ hours, maybe 3\\1/2\\ hours. I can't \nremember, but it has been a long time. We have had major, major \namendments from them. But we have taken one-half hour to get it \nprepared. It is time to argue it. It is time to get it over with. We \nare willing to grant most of the time to the distinguished Senator from \nNew Jersey, or others on the minority side. But I would suggest we set \na time to vote on this amendment. I would like to get that over with, \nbecause I believe this is an amendment that virtually everybody in this \nbody ought to support, because we have made real efforts to try to \naccommodate people on both sides of the floor. And we have incorporated \nDemocrat ideas in this amendment as well. We have done it to try to \nbring this matter to an effective and decent conclusion.\n  I know this: The majority leader means it. We are going to be in here \nall week, and it is just ridiculous to do that, especially when we have \ncome this far and we have had this kind of an open debate. We have \ndebated some of the more controversial and difficult issues, and both \nsides have been given every chance to speak on it.\n  I suggest we come to a time agreement that gives most of the time to \nthe distinguished Senator from New Jersey and those who are on the \nminority side who deserve a right to debate this amendment. We are \nwilling to go ahead and do that.\n  I just would like to get a time limit on it and then move on from \nthere, and move to the similar amendment, which we would get a time \nagreement on.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, if the manager will yield.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield for a question only.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this is a fairly complicated change, \nas I see it, from the original Lautenberg amendment. But certainly it \nhas to be considered, in all due respect to the Senator from Utah. I \nknow how hard he worked and how serious he is about it. We have great \nrespect and friendship. But I wonder, because we are not able to reach \nan immediate time agreement, whether or not we could put it aside so \nthat we can discuss our differences and see if we can come any closer \ntogether to try to resolve it. I, too, like everyone else, wish to see \nthis bill moved, but I think we have not had enough time to really \ndebate it.\n  Mr. HATCH. If I could respond to the Senator, we have people on our \nside who are going to move to table this amendment. I would like to \navoid that by having a reasonable time for the Senator from New Jersey \nto argue this amendment. There is nothing complicated about it. We \nexplained it in detail. It is easy to understand. Frankly, there is not \none thing in here that is new and that can't be understood readily.\n\n  I would be happy to sit down with the Senator and go over the detail \nof this amendment. I think he would be pleased with most all of it. But \nI would like to avoid a motion to table. I would like the Senator to \nhave time to debate this amendment. But the way things are going, he is \ngoing to be cut off on his time. I don't want to have that happen, nor \ndo I want this to evolve into a situation--we have been trying to be \ncooperative and trying to make this thing work. And it is apparent some \npeople around here are trying to delay it.\n  I am not accusing the distinguished Senator from New Jersey, but I \nbelieve\n\n[[Page S5239]]\n\nwe could get this bill finished tonight if we would sit down and get it \nfinished. I don't see any reason we shouldn't. The sooner we get it \nfinished, the sooner the kids in our society are going to understand \nwhat the game is and that we are going to stop some of this violent \njuvenile crime in this country. We are giving the tools to law \nenforcement to be able to do it. We have $50 million in here for \nadditional juvenile prosecutors, just to name one thing out of that \n$1.1 billion in this bill. I would like to get a time limit. I am \nwilling to give the Senator all of the time, but let's get a time limit \non this and go from here.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am glad to yield to my friend.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, let's be realistic.\n  First, I yield to nobody in this body in my support of good strict \nlaw enforcement. I would like to see this bill wrapped up and voted up \nor voted down. There are different suggestions I made to the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah that might do that. But what I would \nsuggest is that we be serious on this. Unfortunately, on something that \nshould be a nonpartisan issue--juvenile crime--there are some things \nthat have delayed us unnecessarily.\n  Wednesday, Senate Republicans voted against a Democratic package, and \nthen today voted for the exact same thing when it was introduced on the \nother side.\n  For example, the Leahy amendment, which proposed stiffer penalties \nfor the transfers to or possession of handguns and assault weapons, or \nhigh-capacity ammunition clips to juveniles, was voted down by the \nRepublicans yesterday, and voted up by the Republicans today.\n  Moreover, the Leahy amendment also proposed the ban of juvenile \npossession of handguns, assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition \nclips, which was again voted down by the Republicans yesterday, and \nvoted up by the Republicans today.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield on that point? The reason is it was \npart of an overall package that the Republicans couldn't accept. So we \ncan certainly accommodate.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Almost everything that was in that Leahy package is now \nbeing proposed on the Republican side. The $50 million for more \nvigorous enforcement of gun laws, ``juvenile Brady,'' the lifetime ban \non gun ownership by dangerous juvenile offenders, the youth crime gun \ninitiative on gun tracing, increased number of cities eligible for \ngrants under the YCG-II. All the Democratic proposals of yesterday are \nnow in the Hatch-Craig amendment of today.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Let me finish that one sentence, if I might. And I mention \nthis one. I am pleased that when you voted it down yesterday that you \nare willing to vote it up today when you bring it up. That is OK. I \nwill support a number of those things that come back. But that is what \nwe have to avoid.\n  I think, frankly, one way out of this--I just suggest it and I have \nsuggested it to others--is that we debate the Craig-Hatch amendment, \nand the amendment of the distinguished Senator from New York, Mr. \nSchumer is going to have--we debate those as the Members want, set that \nvote for an early hour tomorrow morning, and when that debate is \nfinished, let the Senator from Utah and the Senator from Vermont stay \nhere and try to get through as many amendments either on the Republican \nor on the Democratic side that can be handled by voice vote, even if we \nhave to stay here all night long to do that, so we then have a very \nclear shot of finishing.\n  It is one suggestion.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Of course, I yield.\n  Mr. HATCH. First of all, those suggestions you had were in the $1.4 \nbillion comprehensive amendment you made that had less than 9 percent \nfor accountability. We have 45 percent on this bill on the money for \naccountability and 55 percent for prevention.\n\n  I said at the time, many of those amendments we could accept and that \nwe would present them later, which is what we have done. We have tried \nto do it in a reasonable, short period of time. It is to the Senator's \ncredit that we all agree on those particular amendments.\n  What I would like to do is finish the Hatch-Craig amendment. Assuming \nwe do need a little bit more time on that, I suggest we set that aside \nso the Senator can have a little bit more time, and go to the Schumer \namendment, which I believe we can do in 30 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Or more.\n  Mr. HATCH. We will try for 30 minutes. If we need more, we will \ncertainly give it every consideration.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Just a couple of points here.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Regular order, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Thirty minutes equally divided on Schumer, and then we can \nbe back with a time agreement on----\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. Of course.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. First of all, two questions. One, the Hatch-Craig \namendment is a major overhaul of the way we license gun dealers in this \ncountry. The provision of special registrants, which is brand-new, \ncould create----\n  Mr. HATCH. That was in the underlying amendment. Hatch-Craig \nbasically does the four things I discussed, and that is not a major----\n  Mr. SCHUMER. We did not have any opportunity to address this special \nregistrants issue. As I understand it, Hatch-Craig elaborates on the \nreporting requirements of special registrants and other important \nthings. Let me say to my good friend from Utah, it is a major new way \nof dealing with firearm licenses.\n  I understand the urgency that my friend from Utah places on the $50 \nmillion for more juvenile prosecutors. It is something I share, because \nlives might be saved.\n  How can we rush through a whole new way of dealing with firearm \ndealers, something that we first saw at 3:30, something we are vetting? \nThat is my concern. We could rush it through and find that this type of \nprovision has totally changed things.\n  For instance, as I understand it----and I want to know about it \nbefore giving any permission for time limits----these special \nregistrants don't have to keep any records. Someone could go to a gun \nshow, be a special registrant, sell a gun, and there would be no way to \nsee to whom they sold the gun, why, and where.\n  That, to me, is extremely serious. I don't think it is fair, given \nthat this is a major change, admittedly, to a gun show provision. I \nwant to move this bill, but I would like to know more about that.\n  Mr. HATCH. Yesterday, the Senator voted for the special registrant.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I voted against it.\n  Mr. HATCH. You voted aye. We would like to make it mandatory, which \nwe think corrects the problem.\n  I worked hard to get that done and to resolve that because there was \nsuch a conflict between both sides.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Let's rehearse the history. The Craig amendment was added at the last \nminute. I asked the Senator from Idaho whether it had these provisions \nin it. He said no. He said I didn't understand the amendment.\n  It was then voted on with the feeling by many Members, if not most, \nthat those provisions weren't in the bill.\n  Then this morning we hear--in all consideration, the Senator from \nIdaho was very gentlemanly, saying he was wrong--those new provisions \nwere in the bill.\n  So we have never had a serious debate on one of the most fundamental \nchanges in the way we sell guns in this country.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  I am prepared to do that. We argued it on our side. What I am \nsuggesting is that your side has had this amendment now for a lot \nlonger than we have had any amendment of yours and some of your \namendments were much more extensive than this.\n  I suggest we set aside the Hatch-Craig amendment, move to your \namendment at this time, with 30 minutes equally divided, and then agree \nto\n\n[[Page S5240]]\n\na time agreement as soon as we are through with yours.\n  We can stack the votes. That would be fine with me.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I say to the Senator, I have no problems with moving----\n  Mr. HATCH. Then why don't we do that?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Again, I think it is significant. We ought to move. \nWould we vote on it immediately after the debate?\n  Mr. HATCH. Let's make that determination then.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I would like to get a commitment that we would have a \nvote immediately after the debate on the Schumer amendment, and then I \nwould like to take a little more time on it.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, let me suggest to the Senator we work with \nthe Senator on when the vote should take place. We are talking about \nprotecting some Senators, we are talking about----\n  Mr. SCHUMER. In all due respect, I cannot set a time limit until I \nhave some assurance as to when we would vote on that amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will move to table everything that comes up. I am \ngetting sick of it. If we can't get some reasonable time agreements, \nwhich we have done time after time after time, this could go into the \nquagmire that defeats the bill. I am not going to put up with that kind \nof stuff, after what we have done here for 3 days in a row on a bill \nthat everybody should want.\n  Look, I am trying to be reasonable. If the Senator insists on having \nvotes when the Senator wants the vote, and I am trying to protect \nDemocrat Senators, I think that is the wrong thing to do. I am prepared \nto table everything that comes up. I don't care. I will table \nRepublican amendments, too, if that is what it takes. I will be fair to \nboth sides; I will table everything.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. If the Senator will yield, I am not trying to delay, but \nI think we should have a vote.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is what it looks like to me.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I spent a lot of time on this amendment. It is a \nsignificant vote.\n  Mr. HATCH. Then give me a vote on my amendment. Go to my amendment. I \nwill give you all the time on your side. We have debated it. We won't \neven make a point on our side. We will give you the time and vote on \nmine, bring yours up and vote on yours; or we will stack them together \nto accommodate Senators here, some of whom are Democrats.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. The Senator made a proposal to me on my amendment. I \nthink it involves discussion with some of my colleagues. If the Senator \nwould yield on the whole package----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I move to table the pending amendment, and \nI ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HATCH. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The question is on agreeing \nto the amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the question is on which amendment? Is it \nthe Hatch-Craig amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have not been ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could say this so Members will \nunderstand how we are going to proceed and how we are going to deal \nwith this issue and others, I regret that we have had that much time on \nthis vote. We had been trying to work out some way to make progress on \nthis bill tonight and, hopefully, even get some amendments done tonight \nor complete it. At this point, it is obvious we are not getting enough \nmovement to achieve that tonight. I know there are a lot of Senators \nwho have commitments tomorrow and hoped we could complete it tonight. \nAt this juncture, sufficient progress is not being made and it is \nunrealistic to attempt that.\n  I have a unanimous consent request to deal with two of the amendments \nthat are in line now, and we would have the two votes in the morning at \n9:30. After that, during the process of the night, hopefully more \namendments can be accepted, combined, or even worked out, where we \ncould have more than just the two votes in the morning, or the next \ncouple of amendments would be in order.\n  What I am saying here is, with this consent request, we would expect \ntwo votes at 9:30 a.m., and we would expect to keep going, and we will \nsee where we are in the morning. Something short of that has not been \nachievable at this point.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that with respect to amendment \nNo. 344--that is the Hatch-Craig amendment--debate be limited to 2 \nhours equally divided in the usual form with no amendments in order to \nthe amendment prior to the vote, and following that debate the \namendment be laid aside.\n  I ask consent that Senator Schumer be recognized to offer an \namendment regarding Internet firearms, and that the debate be limited \nto 1 hour, that following that debate the amendment be laid aside and \nthe Senate proceed to a vote in the order in which the amendments were \noffered, with 5 minutes prior to each vote for explanation.\n  So we will come in at 9:30, have 5 minutes of explanation on the \namendments, equally divided, and the votes will begin at 9:40 a.m. \nFriday.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, and I will not because I \nthink this is a very good proposal, I wish we could actually be asking \nfor more than this. I appreciate the managers' efforts to get us to \nthis point. As I have noted to the majority leader, we started with 89 \namendments and we went down from there to about 40 amendments. I thank \nSenators Reid and Dorgan on our side. We are now down to around 20 \namendments. But those 20 are amendments where the authors have waited \npatiently for the opportunity to present them and have a debate. I hope \nthey will do it tonight and tomorrow, and I hope we can do it on \nMonday. I believe we ought to use those days to have the remaining \ndebate about these amendments. They are good amendments and they ought \nto be voted on. Senators have waited patiently.\n  We also have a right to expect Senators to come forward and present \ntheir amendments in good faith and have debate. We are going to be here\n\n[[Page S5241]]\n\ntomorrow, I assume, and I hope we will continue to conduct ourselves \nthe way we have all week. This has been a good debate. We have had \nabout the same number of amendments on both sides, Republican and \nDemocrat. We have had good votes. Nobody has been playing political \ngames here. We offer the amendments and have the debate in good faith. \nI hope we can continue to do that. I have no objection to the unanimous \nconsent request.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I say to the \ntwo leaders that Senator Dorgan and I have worked very hard. As a \nsuggestion, I think we are to a point on this side where we can lock in \nthe full breadth of all the amendments in numbers and probably, with \nrare exception, as to time. So that is something the two leaders should \nlook at tomorrow morning.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could respond, I encourage Senator Reid \nto continue that effort, and I ask Senators Hatch and Nickles, who will \nwork with him on that, to continue. I urge the managers, Senator Leahy \nand Senator Hatch, during the debate tonight, to sit down and see if we \ncan't squeeze this down. Some of you are thinking that if we just stay \nwith it and keep working tonight, we might actually see this thing \nconcluded at 11, 12, 1, or 2. We have been thinking in those terms, but \nwe have not been able to get an agreement beyond what we have right \nhere. It is going to take, apparently, 3 hours of debate to get through \nthese two amendments, which will put us to 10:15 or 10:30. At that \npoint, it would be physically impossible to complete this action.\n  So I hope we can complete it tonight, but I think there is no choice \nother than to be in session on Friday and have votes, which we have \ntold the Members we would do up until at least noon on Friday. In this \ncase, it could actually go beyond noon. The good news is, as we \nannounced some time ago, there will not be recorded votes next Monday \nor Friday because of conflicts which we identified to the Members 2 \nmonths ago. But that also makes it difficult for us to do the other \nthings we have to do next week, including the supplemental \nappropriations, Y2K liability, and bankruptcy reform. We must conclude \nthis bill either tomorrow or Saturday or sometime before we have to go \nto these other bills.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I shall \nnot object, as the leader knows, this is a resolution which I and \nothers had suggested earlier this evening. The leaders know that the \nSenator from Utah and I have talked probably a dozen times every hour \non this, trying to get it through. I have worked with the leadership \nstaff and the whip on this side, our leader, and others, as Senator \nHatch has with those on the Republican side, trying to get these \nnumbers down. I tell my friend from Mississippi that we have knocked \ndown the numbers considerably. The Senator from Utah and I will be here \nthis evening to try to get it down more. It is a difficult bill. The \nlast crime bill took 11 days. We have a number of things on which we \nare unified, and we have some things that are going to require votes \nbecause they do divide us. But with good faith it can be done and \nshould be done.\n\n  I support the unanimous consent request.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I wasn't going to say anything--\nreserving the right to object, and I will not, but listening to this \ndiscussion, can I reinforce--I as one Senator don't want to delay \ntonight and going into tomorrow, but can I reinforce the remarks of \nSenator Daschle?\n  Some of us have amendments that are on point on this piece of \nlegislation. We have patiently waited for days and were glad to do so. \nWe don't intend to trivialize our amendments. We don't intend to \ntrivialize the debate. We think these are important issues. That is why \nwe are in the Senate, and we intend to go forward.\n  I will tell you something else. It probably will be hard in the \nfuture to get cooperation from Senators who wait, and all of a sudden \nwe find the debate relegated to midnight and on weekends with most \nSenators gone. That doesn't seem really acceptable to me.\n  We will see what we agree to tomorrow. But I want to express my \nreservations about the direction of this. There is a whole lot of \nsubstantive debate that needs to take place, that hasn't taken place, \nand will take place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, one reason I wanted the Hatch-Craig \namendment voted on this evening is because all day long the President \nhas been bad-mouthing the Republicans and the Attorney General has been \nbad-mouthing the Republicans, and I think taking unfair political \nadvantage because of some of the votes we had yesterday. One of the \nthings they are bad-mouthing the Republicans on is because we have \nclosed that loophole with regard to gun shows. Today, the Hatch-Craig \namendment does it. Then we find ourselves unable to vote on it.\n  I am happy we are going to vote in the morning, but I suggest we move \non ahead this evening. We have the unanimous consent agreement locked \nin. I suggest we line up some more votes for tomorrow right after we \nfinish those two votes.\n  If Senator Wellstone has an amendment he would like to bring up \ntonight, let's do it, and we will see what we can do. We will try to \nalternate between the two sides.\n  If you are serious about your amendments, let's go at it tonight. We \nhave about 3 hours of debate ahead of us right now. We will go from \nthere.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator McConnell be the next one to lay \nhis amendment down, following the debate on these two, and then--could \nI have the minority leader's attention, and also Senator Leahy?\n  I ask unanimous consent that we go with the McConnell amendment right \nafter we debate the two that we have the unanimous consent agreement \non.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I want to make sure I understand. What is the Senator from \nUtah requesting?\n  Mr. HATCH. We have a unanimous consent to proceed to the debate on \nthese two amendments tonight. As soon as that is completed, I suggest \nSenator McConnell be able to lay down his amendment, and we debate that \ntonight and schedule that for a vote tomorrow.\n  Mr. LEAHY. For how long?\n  Mr. HATCH. I think we can do that in a half hour or less; I ask \nunanimous consent.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Why don't we start this debate, and we can interrupt the \ndebate to make that request. Let me see what the amendment is.\n  Mr. HATCH. All right. Let's just proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to urge the two managers, if \nyou would tonight, to work to get a McConnell and a Kohl--or what other \namendments are in order--get those two locked in, and a vote, and do it \ntonight. The Members would like to know what the timeframe is going to \nbe tomorrow morning. If you could get that locked in tonight during the \nprocess of the debate, that will help facilitate moving forward.\n  Having said that, then, we have had the last vote of the night. The \nnext votes will be the two votes stacked in the morning at 9:40.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is under the control of the Senator \nfrom Utah and the Senator from Vermont.\n  Who yields time?\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator from Utah yield? Are we under \ncontrolled time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are under 2 hours of debate.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. On which amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 344.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is fine. I had indicated to the floor manager that \nafter the disposition or the general debate, I would wish to address \nthe Senate on the underlying bill. I am glad to yield an hour, or do it \ntomorrow afternoon. I am glad to do whatever.\n\n[[Page S5242]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. How much time does the Senator desire?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would say 15 minutes. If other Senators have \namendments and want to debate them, I will wait until they conclude \nthat. If I can just have the assurance that I do it at the end of the \ndebate on amendments tomorrow, that is fine with me.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is fine with me.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield the time under my control to the \nSenator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. President, just to put some order to the debate, to confirm that \nthere is an hour available on each side, I ask what happens in the \nevent of a quorum call in the debate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A quorum call is charged to the side that \nsuggests the quorum call. If no one speaks, the time is charged.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, if we could have order, we can get this debate \nstarted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Senate will be in \norder.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I heard the distinguished Senator from \nUtah say that the loopholes have been closed in what was initially the \nLautenberg amendment request to close the loopholes and now the \nredesign of the Craig-Hatch response. It says that they closed the \nloopholes, that they have taken care of the problem.\n  I submit the problems are not taken care of. Maybe it is viewed by \nthose who would like to just get this out of the way that the problems \nhave been dealt with.\n  What were the problems initially? Mr. President, the problem was \nsimply around whether or not there were loopholes through which lots of \ndeterminations would be made as to who is the purchaser of a gun.\n  The Senator from Idaho has said his revised amendment is going to \nclose the gun show loophole. But it won't. And I think what we are \nseeing this evening is a response to what happened yesterday after the \npublic had the chance to see the result of the vote count. It was 51 to \n47 against closing the loopholes that derive from gun shows. We had a \nstrong debate. There were six Republicans who joined in with all but \ntwo Democrats to say close the loopholes. We don't want people to be \nable to buy guns. We don't want people to be able to be induced by a \nso-called dealer at a gun show.\n  Over 4,000 gun shows a year are held, by the way. We don't want a \ndealer selling guns, someone selling guns who doesn't ask for your \nname, doesn't have to ask for your name, doesn't have to ask for your \naddress, doesn't have to talk about anything that identifies this \nbuyer. We are talking about buyers anonymous. That is what we are \ntalking about--gun buyers anonymous. That is a pretty horrible specter \nto contemplate--gun buyers anonymous.\n  Mr. President, I want to make sure everyone understands what is \nhappening here.\n  Yesterday, we had a vote that was defeated on an amendment that I \nwrote, a vote of 51-47. The 47 votes included all but two Democrats and \ndid include six Republicans.\n  The fact of the matter is, when all was said and done, not enough was \ndone because we lost the opportunity to close a loophole that applies \nespecially to gun shows.\n  Let me take a moment to describe what a gun show is for those who \ndon't know. It is fairly popular across this country. The President, in \nan address he made a couple of weeks ago, talked about how as a child \nhe would go to gun shows. It was a family event. People would go to see \nwhat was being offered. They were curious.\n  I want to remove any suggestion, innuendo, or insinuation that says \nthat gun shows are the gathering place for the degenerates, the thugs, \nthe criminals. That is not suggested at all.\n  There are over 4,000 gun shows a year across this country. That is \npretty significant. That is 80 a week, on average. There are lots of \nlegitimate hunters, sports persons, et cetera, who go to these shows.\n  There is, however, an enormous loophole that should scare the life \nout of everybody in this country. That is the anonymous buyer, the \nbuyer who can go in, step up to an exhibitor's table and say: I want to \nbuy some guns.\n  The person on the other side of the table says: How many?\n  Give me 25. What do you have? Some nice sporting models, small ones \nwith a comfortable pistol grip, those that we can trigger off a lot of \nshells? Because I like to do some target shooting.\n  The seller doesn't have to say: Who are you? All he has to say is: \nThese 25 guns will cost you $2,500. The man says: OK, here are 25 \nfresh, hundred dollar bills, take these.\n  They shake hands. The guy gathers up his 25 guns and off he goes, we \nknow not where. We don't know who he is; we don't know what town he \ncomes from; we don't know whether he just got out of a mental \ninstitution or, worse, a prison. We do not know anything about this \nman. Why in the world would there be resistance to closing that \nloophole? I do not understand it, I must tell you.\n\n  I come from New Jersey. Maybe we do have different cultural views \nabout how life functions. We do not have much room for hunting and we \ndo not have as many hunters as in our great wide open Western States. \nBut all of us--whether from the East, West, North, South--respect life. \nI never saw a family whose principal interest was not the safety of \ntheir children, the education of their children, the caring for those \nchildren. Yet they are willing, in this house of the people, the U.S. \nSenate, to say: Listen, one thing you have to do is you have to protect \ncitizens' rights to buy guns. Why do we need more bureaucratic \ninterference with that process?\n  I don't understand, says one. Another says: Why should you have to \nwait a couple of days to get a gun? If you want to buy a gun, you ought \nto be able to buy it like a postage stamp--go to the store and buy it \nand get out of here.\n  Frankly, I think that is the wrong way to go. I am smart enough to \nknow we are not about to propose legislation to take away everybody's \ngun. There is a serious debate about how guns should be managed. I \nthink it is an earnest debate that ought to be carried on here. But to \nsimply dismiss it because they say it is a bureaucratic intrusion, it \nis yet another law? I remind everybody that America, this country of \nours, is a nation of laws. That is what makes this society as great as \nit is. When you have laws, you have to have law enforcers, whether it \nis police, whether it is drug agents, whether it is the FBI, whether it \nis the Army; we enforce our laws. To deny that is something that ought \nto be done because we want to protect the anonymous buyer who walks up \nand says, ``Give me a couple of guns, here is the money'' and not think \nabout protecting the well-being of the children is not to look at \nLittleton, CO.\n  By the way, that is not a phenomenon that just existed there --Pearl, \nMS; West Paducah, KY; Oregon; Illinois. It has been throughout our \nsociety. School violence--we all tremble at the thought that our \nchildren are in a classroom where other kids have a gun, where other \nstudents are bent on violence, where they may be deranged, on drugs, \npsychotic. We all worry about that. I saw one of the parents from \nColumbine High School who said: This gun-toting society of ours is out \nof control. The worst thing is the accessibility of guns.\n  We get into a perennial argument here about whether or not it is the \ngun or the person who does the killing. It is not just criminals, \nunfortunately, who do the killing--until sometimes they become \ncriminals for the first time--an enraged husband; a mentally deranged \nperson, young, old, who suddenly, in a fitful moment, takes out a gun \nand commits his or her first crime with the murder of another person.\n  So what are we talking about? Frankly, I think at times we are \ntalking gibberish, because the American public will not understand it. \nIn a recent poll, 87 percent said it is necessary to close the loophole \nof anonymous buying at gun shows. That is what we are talking about. We \nfailed to agree to that yesterday. Honestly, it was a very sorry defeat \nfor us. Not for me personally--the fact that I authored the law. I \nauthored the law with people's faces in mind, with an understanding \nabout how much I love my children, four of\n\n[[Page S5243]]\n\nthem, and my six grandchildren. Heaven forbid anything ever happens to \nthem.\n  I know there is not a parent who can hear me who does not feel the \nsame way about his or her children. There is no asset more valuable \nthan our children--money, jewelry, houses--nothing means anything when \nit comes to our children.\n  Why do we insist that the buyer, the anonymous buyer of a gun, has to \nhave protected his right or her right to be free from this bureaucratic \nsociety, this great country that everybody loves? Everybody wants to \nmove to America, but we call it the great bureaucracy at times, instead \nof the great democracy. It is foul language, as far as I am concerned.\n  So we are offered a substitute. It is a substitute produced by two \ndistinguished Senators, one from Utah and one from Idaho, who say they \nare going to close the loophole. But it does not. It does not require a \nbackground check for all gun sales at gun shows. Some licensees, \nFederal licensees, on a special form, do not require a background \ncheck. The provision for people who are not licensed would enable them \nto sell guns without, again, going through a background check.\n  There is another loophole. There is a category now called ``special \nlicensees,'' that the Hatch-Craig amendment would create--a new \nbureaucracy, by the way, strangely enough. They are willing to concede \na bureaucracy that would issue these special licenses is OK. But other \nbureaucracies are dangerous, dangerous to your individual rights. They \nwould not have to conduct background checks. He did not change his \noriginal position, which makes background checks voluntary for special \nlicensees. So, if you want to sell a gun and you are a special \nlicensee, you can do it if you feel like it. But you do not do it \nunless you feel like it. You do not have to go through that nonsense--\nbackground check. It could take 10 minutes for a background check. Who \nwants to waste 10 minutes when you have a hot deal and you have other \npeople there?\n  What happens at the gun shows, as I understand it--and I have never \nbeen, but this is as I hear it--is that there are often discounts by \nthese unlicensed dealers who have acquired their guns--who knows how in \nmany cases. They could say: We are special collectors. It has been \nestablished some of these collections are from criminals. Special \ncollector? Hey, we will give you a cheap deal on these guns. Where a \nlegitimate licensed dealer has a price, it is out there, it is public. \nThey do have some expenses in maintaining their license--not a lot, but \nthe unlicensed dealer: Here, I'll give you a real discount. Come here \nyoung man. You want to buy some nice guns?\n  It ought not be that way. These loopholes are still available.\n  It would not cover a flea market where there are tables with 100 or \n200 or even more guns. It would not cover a gun show that had 10 \nexhibitors or fewer. Ten exhibitors could sell 500 guns, but they would \nnot be covered. That is, if you will forgive me, a nonsensical hurdle. \nA couple of people could get together and say: You know what, let's put \nup one table. I have some of these to sell, she has some of those to \nsell, he has some of these to sell, and we will sell at one table, and \nthat gets rid of two others, and we can reduce ourselves to 10 tables. \nThen we do not have to worry about those bureaucrats who want our \nnames. Who are they? Imagine, those guys want our names, while we buy \nthese lethal weapons.\n  Then there is another category. It says that if firearm exhibitors \nare not more than 20 percent of all exhibitors, they are exempt as \nwell. So you have to have more than 20 percent of the materials being \nexhibited--it could be sporting materials, could be lifeboats, could be \nall kinds of things, skis, you name it--but if the firearms people do \nnot have more than 20 percent, they do not have to do anything to get \nthese people registered who are buying these guns.\n  It creates other loopholes. Even though prohibited persons are five \ntimes more likely to pawn their guns at a pawnshop than other citizens, \nthis proposal from that side, those who say they are closing the \nloopholes, would say that anyone who has a claim ticket--whether they \nborrowed the money, they borrowed $200 for the gun--if they have the \nclaim ticket, even if they do not show up for 60 days, if they pay the \ninterest, they say the pawnshop dealer/owner has to just give them \ntheir gun without any questions--no questions asked.\n  This bird may have been in jail for 60 days, but they are not allowed \nto ask: Where have you been for the last 60 or 90 days?\n  Oh, no, that is a bureaucratic imposition; we do not want that. \nAnother loophole. I do not, frankly, understand that.\n  Why are we protecting those who might be criminals who want to redeem \ntheir guns when the ordinary citizen who goes to buy a gun from a \nlegitimate licensed dealer has to identify himself and undergo a \nbackground check?\n  There have been so many suggestions that the people who man this \nagency, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, are some kind of \nogres, they are out to rob you of your independence, rob you of your \nthought. That is not true. They are there because we want them there to \nenforce the law.\n  The right to own a gun is one that is often debated, but so far I \nhave not seen anything that confirms the fact that every citizen has a \nright to bear arms. We are not considering that question now, but the \nCourt has ruled many times since 1939 that in order to have a well-\nregulated militia, the citizenry shall have the right to bear arms. \nThat is quite a qualification.\n  In addition to the pawnshop loophole, there is another loophole, and \nthat is, now suddenly federally licensed gun dealers who may be in the \nState of Massachusetts or the State of New Jersey or the State of \nIllinois--you name it--now can only sell firearms at a gun show in the \nsame State as that specified on the dealer's license. The Craig \namendment will give dealers an out-of-State license. It will broaden \nthe geography of where that license can be used to all across the \ncountry without any checking. Without any further discussion, that \nlicense now is a lot broader than what was intended.\n  That is not closing a loophole to me; It is creating another one. It \nwill make it harder for law enforcement people to crack down on shady \ndealers, and we do have some.\n  Years ago, there were more gun dealers than there were gas stations \nin this country. Not too many years ago, there were over 250,000; now \nit is slightly over 100,000. What we did was change the fee for \nlicensed gun dealers from $30 for 3 years--$30 for 3 years, $10 a year \nand you never were checked or asked any questions--to $200 for 3 years, \nand that includes some kind of a check and some kind of a test you must \npass in order to get that license. While we have reduced the number of \ndealers, the Craig amendment will open it up.\n  Everyone knows what the NRA response is going to be. That is the \nNational Rifle Association. Their views were represented amply on the \nfloor of the Senate. They say gun laws do not work; otherwise we would \nnot have the kinds of killings that we do.\n  I do not think it is the gun law. I think it is the accessibility of \nguns. But I do point out that the number of murders by guns have \nreduced somewhat, not significantly enough, but they have been reduced. \nThis country of ours, this wonderful democracy in which we live, sees \n35,000 people a year die from handguns--35,000; 13,000 of them are \nmurdered. Thirteen kids die every day from handguns, 4,000 a year. In \n20 years, over 75,000 children will have died from gunshots. We have \n18,000 suicides. We have 3,000 accidents from guns--guns, guns, guns, \nguns, guns, and people are dying from them.\n  Yet, I hear this cry through this place: Protect the liberty of the \ngun owner. I want to hear them say one time: My God, we are sorry about \nwhat happened in Littleton, CO. Our hearts bleed for them. When we look \nat the families, when we look at the children who lost their \nschoolmates, when we look at those who were so frightened, we have to \nask: What kind of protection are they entitled to? I think they are \nentitled to a lot of protection, but we continue here with loophole \nheaven.\n\n  I thought that Littleton would shock some of our friends into the \nrealization that the public is sick and tired of it. They do not want \nit, and I do not understand why it is that the NRA insists that this is \nan encroachment on their\n\n[[Page S5244]]\n\nfreedom just to say: Put your name down if you want to buy a gun. If \nyou want to buy a car, you better put your name down or you are not \ngoing to buy the car.\n  Yet, that rage, that sense of grief, that sense of anguish has not \nyet reached this place. Mr. President, 87 percent of the people in \nAmerica in a poll said they want these loopholes closed. We lost that \nvote yesterday, and now they come back with this wolf in sheep's \nclothing wanting to pretend that the loopholes are closed. But they are \nnot.\n  I hope we will be able to get some control of gun violence in our \nsociety. There are a couple of ways we can do it: make parents \nresponsible for what their kids do. If you give your child who is \nunderage a car and he or she goes out and kills somebody, do you know \nwho is responsible? It is the parent. Why then shouldn't a parent be \nresponsible when a child takes a gun and kills his brother or his \nsister or his friend accidentally? We ought to get ahold of these \nthings. This is an opportunity to show good faith to the American \npeople, but we failed to take advantage of that opportunity to close it \ndown. This will not take away their guns, except those we know do not \nqualify.\n  We hear complaints about the Brady bill. The Brady bill stopped over \n250,000 unfit persons from fulfilling their desire to buy a gun--\n250,000. That is a lot to me.\n  I see my friend and colleague from Illinois is on the floor. If he \nwants to make some remarks, I will be happy to yield 10 minutes to the \nSenator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Jersey.\n  To recount where we are in this arduous debate over gun control in \nlight of the Littleton tragedy, yesterday my colleague from the State \nof New Jersey, Mr. Lautenberg, offered a very clear amendment that \nsaid: If you want to purchase a gun at a gun show, you are going to be \nheld to the same standards as a person who buys it from a licensed \nfirearms dealer.\n  In other words, we will do a background check and make sure that you \nare not a prohibited person under the law, make certain you do not have \na criminal record, a history of violent mental illness or something of \nthat nature.\n  It was a very good amendment, and I commend my colleague from New \nJersey for his leadership. He envisioned this problem long before many \nof us did and, frankly, put before us a very straightforward option. I \nwas happy to support him.\n  Unfortunately, it did not receive a majority of support in the \nSenate. The sad reality is that 6 of the 55 Republican Senators voted \nfor it and 41 of the 45 Democratic Senators voted for it--2 were \nabsent--and it was not enough, so the Lautenberg amendment went down in \ndefeat.\n  That was a bitter disappointment. But even worse was the fact there \nwas an amendment offered by the Senator from Idaho, Mr. Craig, which he \npurported to offer as an alternative to Senator Lautenberg's amendment.\n  Let me tell you what has happened in the 24 hours since the Senate \nadopted that amendment. People have seen through it. It is transparent. \nIt not only did not deal with the problem of gun shows and stopping the \nsale of guns to people who should not own them, it took a step \nbackwards and made it easier for those sales to be made.\n  So there has been a mad scramble in the last 48 hours from the other \nside of the aisle. Once the public had an opportunity to look at this \nCraig amendment, there has been a mad scramble to undo what the Craig \namendment sought to accomplish.\n  The NRA, the National Rifle Association, shot the Republican Senate \nleadership in the foot yesterday, and they have been hopping around all \nday today trying to figure out how they are going to salvage this mess. \nSo they have come up with another amendment. It is unclear to me what \nthey are thinking about, because they took a bad amendment, the Craig \namendment, and added another bad amendment to it.\n  In this case, two wrongs will not make a right. What we have now in \nthis so-called Hatch-Craig amendment is an abomination. It doesn't \naddress the gun show problem. Senator Lautenberg did that clearly.\n  Let me tell you how bad this bill is, this Hatch-Craig second bill. \nThis is Senator Craig's Thursday bill.\n  This bill, sadly, sets up at least two, maybe three different \ncategories under the law for sales at gun shows. In his original bill, \nhe had some special licensee category, voluntary category, that you \ncould sell a gun at a gun show under that category. No background check \nwas necessary; it was not necessary, of course, to send the name and \naddress and gun serial number into any group that might check to see if \nit had any criminal history, if that weapon might have been used in a \ncrime to kill someone or in a drug deal that went bad. No.\n  Then he came back today, and in this amendment they have created some \nmore categories of how to sell guns at gun shows and they are just as \ndifficult to follow.\n  One says, licensed gun dealers at gun shows can sell a gun. I do not \nhave a problem with that. That is what we are seeking here. That is \nwhat Senator Lautenberg is seeking here, so that the background check \nis accomplished.\n  Then they had a provision in there that violates the Brady law we \nhave lived under for so many years. Instead of giving law enforcement 3 \ndays to check on the background of a would-be purchaser at a gun show, \nthey give them 24 hours. And if they don't get the completed inquiry \nback in 24 hours, they sell the gun. The presumption is on the side of \nthe purchaser. We are saying to those in law enforcement: Take a back \nseat. We want to keep these guns moving. This is big business.\n  Is that really what America wants? I do not think so.\n  So we have these categories of who can sell guns at gun shows. It is \na labored attempt by the National Rifle Association to accomplish \nnothing--nothing--other than to take away from law enforcement their \nauthority to do what American people ask for under the Brady law.\n  In this country what they said under the Brady law is, do not sell a \ngun to someone who has a history of having committed a felony or has a \nviolent mental illness. The NRA has never liked that. They have tried \nto keep this gun show loophole alive. And they do it with this latest \nRepublican amendment.\n  What a sad, sad situation, where those with serious mental illness, \nfugitives, stalkers, straw purchasers can still run to these gun shows, \nand under this Hatch-Craig amendment they can find a way to get their \nhands on the guns. Is it a problem? There are 4,000 gun shows a year \nacross America. They are in my home State of Illinois, and over 200 in \nthe year 1998.\n  When they had an investigation into these gun shows to find out who \nthey were selling guns to without background checks, they found out it \nincluded a lot of felons prohibited from acquiring firearms who have \nbeen able to buy them at gun shows.\n\n  In fact, the Department of Treasury and the Department of Justice \nfound that felons buying or selling firearms were involved in more than \n46 percent of the investigations involving gun shows. This is a \nloophole that is producing guns right and left.\n  We are still trying to trace the guns used by those two kids in \nLittleton, CO. At least three, if not all four of them, came out of gun \nshows. Is it important that we know how they were bought or sold? Of \ncourse it is. You go to any police department in America--start with \nChicago; pick your hometown--and ask them whether tracing a firearm is \nan important part of a criminal investigation. They will tell you it is \ncritical. Where did that gun come from? Who sold it to them?\n  Let's try to establish a chain of purchase here and get down to the \nroot cause of crime in America. The National Rifle Association talks \nabout the second amendment and what they want to protect. And yet they \ncome in with this amendment which literally takes away the power of law \nenforcement to try to enforce the laws and reduce crime.\n  That isn't the end of it. One of the most insidious aspects of this \namendment was put in that would exempt pawnshops from doing a \nbackground check on a gun that is resold to someone who pawns it.\n\n[[Page S5245]]\n\n  Picture this: A person needs money, picks up a handgun, walks into a \npawnshop, hands it to the pawnshop owner, and says: How much are you \ngoing to give me? $20. He takes the ticket and the $20 and leaves.\n  That pawnshop owner may, but is not required to, report to law \nenforcement where that gun came from, the source of it, as well as the \nserial number. If they do not, under the current law, when the person \nwalks back in and says: Here is the $20 and the ticket; I want my gun \nback, they are required to say: First, we have to check and make sure \nyou are qualified under Brady. If you have a criminal history of mental \nillness, we will not sell it back to you.\n  The National Rifle Association, in this amendment, takes out that \nrequirement. So the pawnbroker turns around and hands that gun back to \nthe street.\n  Is it important in a pawnshop? Consider this: It is five times more \nlikely that criminals are going into pawnshops with guns than those who \nhave not committed crimes--five times more likely. And the National \nRifle Association, which insists they want to keep guns out of the \nhands of criminals, puts this provision in the law, which many on that \nside of the aisle are now lauding as a great improvement. It is not. It \nis a step backwards.\n  Then there is the question about all the records of these gun \npurchases. If these records are not kept, we are basically tying the \nhands of law enforcement. It is no wonder to me that law enforcement \nacross this country cannot understand the amendment that is being \noffered on the Republican side of the aisle.\n  This is a sad situation. We have a national tragedy on our hands--270 \nmillion Americans, 200 million guns, more gun crime than any country on \nEarth. We stiffen the penalties right and left. We are determined to \nreduce gun violence. Yet, when it comes to the most basic thing, to \nkeep guns out of the hands of people who do not need them and should \nnot have them, to keep them out of the hands of kids, we face \namendments such as this.\n\n  It is really, in my estimation, unsettling. I cannot understand where \na notion like background checks at gun shows--which enjoys the support \nof 87 percent of the American people--has such a tough time passing. \nSenator Lautenberg deserved 87 votes at a minimum on his amendment, an \nhonest straightforward amendment to deal with gun shows. We could not \nget half of the Members of the Senate to vote for it.\n  The best thing for us to do is to defeat the Hatch-Craig amendment. \nIt is a step in the wrong direction. We are going backwards instead of \nforwards.\n  The NRA, incidentally, put in one provision which they now put in \neverything. If you get involved in one of these purchases, and you sell \na gun to somebody who kills another person, the National Rifle \nAssociation said, well, you should not be sued for that, should you? Of \ncourse you should be liable and accountable for that, as we all are for \nour actions.\n  They build immunity into this law from civil prosecution, immunity in \nthe law. Who is immune from prosecution in America? Foreign diplomats \nand some health insurance companies. That is it. And now the National \nRifle Association says, and, of course, the people who sell guns at gun \nshows, make them immune from liability, too. That is so far over the \nline it is hard to explain, let alone defend.\n  I salute my friend from New Jersey for his leadership on this issue. \nI hope my colleagues in the Senate will not be misled by this new \nHatch-Craig amendment. If this is an effort to undo the damage done to \nthose who voted for Mr. Craig's original amendment, they did not \naccomplish it. This second amendment compounds the problem. It makes it \nthat much worse.\n  Let's get back to the basics. Let's support Senator Lautenberg's \namendment--a straightforward amendment, supported by law enforcement \nand families across America who are sick of school violence, sick of \ngun violence, and expect this Senate to meet its constitutional \nresponsibility to pass laws to accomplish these goals and make America \na safer place to live.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  A lot of people have had a lot to say since the shooting in \nLittleton, CO. Much of it was sad, but some of it was thoughtful and \neven inspirational. So it was particularly unfortunate when a couple of \nweeks ago President Clinton added some comments to the mix that were \nnot just unfair but outrageous and downright unforgivable. I bring this \nup this evening because even though his rhetoric and some of the \nrhetoric here on the floor has changed in the last 2 weeks, his \nsentiments are alive and well and regrettably evident on the floor of \nthe Senate in this debate.\n  I am referring to the President's comments on April 27, when he laid \nthe blame for the Columbine High School tragedy on our culture. Except \nthe President was not talking about the same cultural crisis that we \nare talking about here today and tonight--the breakdown of families, \nthe powerlessness of communities, the alienation of young people, and \nthe violence and brutality promoted by the entertainment industry. No, \nwhat the President chose to blame was, and I quote from the speech that \nwas later released by the White House and printed on its web page, \n``the huge hunting and sport shooting culture of America.''\n  He proceeded to talk about ``Americans' rights to responsible hunting \nand sport shooting'' and said that the:\n\n       movement will evaporate [w]hen people from rural \n     Pennsylvania and rural West Virginia and rural Colorado and \n     Idaho start calling their congressmen and saying, hey, man, \n     we can live with this, this is no big deal, you know?. . .We \n     would gladly put up with a little extra hassle, a little \n     wait, a little this, a little that, because we want to save \n     several thousand kids a year.\n\n  That was the President's quote. Now, where do you begin to list what \nis wrong with those comments? Well, let's start with the concept that \nall gun owners live in rural parts of the country or that the second \namendment protects the right of hunting and sport shooting. Excuse me. \nI misspoke. The President limited it to responsible hunting and \nshooting. I am not sure what that means, but it probably involves new \nFederal regulations. What is more clear is the President's suggestion \nthat those who take their individual civil liberties seriously are \nignorant rubes who need reeducating in their responsibility to what he \ncalls ``the larger community.''\n  All of this would have been merely insulting to the tens of millions \nof Americans who own and use firearms for legitimate reasons, but then \nhe gets to the truly unforgivable part. What is truly unforgivable is \nthat he insinuated that law-abiding Americans are somehow responsible \nfor what happened in Littleton and, worse, that if they refuse to \ntolerate encroachment upon their liberties, they do not care about the \nlives of children.\n  It is a sad day in America when a President of the United States \nspeaks to and implies that thought. That is right. The leader of the \nfree world accused those who uphold the law as being responsible for \nthose who flaunt the law. He accused those who would passionately \ndefend their civil liberties as being bad citizens. He accused those \nwho may have a firearm for the sole purpose of defending themselves and \ntheir families, accused these people of not wanting to save children's \nlives. Now, that is what is unbelievable.\n\n  I can only say shame on him for attacking decent, law-abiding \ncitizens, and shame on any in this Chamber who would follow his lead. \nTo say that the hunters and sport shooters of America are responsible \nfor what happened in Littleton is to say that safe drivers are \nresponsible for the road-crazed, road-raged killers who drive others \noff the road. But it is worse than the automobile analogy, because \nunlike an automobile, a gun has the capacity to save lives as well as \ntake lives. A firearm is a tool. In the hands of a criminal, it is used \nfor evil. But in the hands of a law-abiding citizen, it can save lives. \nAnd it does save lives--an estimated 2.1 million times per year, \ngenerally without a shot even being fired. Of the 65 million Americans \nwho own firearms, more than a fair number purchase them not for \nhunting, not for sport shooting purposes, but self-protection.\n  They live in parts of the country where they really feel they need \nprotection, and they have an American\n\n[[Page S5246]]\n\nright of self-defense. They arm themselves for that purpose in a legal, \nlaw-abiding way. While hunters may do it for sport or they may do it to \nput food on their tables still in rural America, there are many \nAmericans who own guns to protects themselves. It is in this area of \nself-protection that the question of encroachment on second amendment \nrights becomes not just a political question but one of life and one of \ndeath.\n  Unlike President Clinton, the woman in a crime-ridden inner city does \nnot have a personal security force protecting her night and day. Some \nchoose, and women are choosing in increasing numbers, to obtain a \nfirearm in a legal way to protect themselves. The obstacles to firearm \nownership the President talks about--``a little wait, a little this, a \nlittle that, a little extra hassle,'' are to the woman, to the \noftentimes single woman of America who chooses to go out and buy a gun \nfor her self-protection.\n  Think about it. She is doing it to prevent harm to herself and, if \nshe is a single mother in a crime-ridden neighborhood, she may be doing \nit to protect her children. If you are wondering why law-abiding gun \nowners think gun control is a big deal, that is why. It is not because \nthey are ignorant, nor have they been duped by the NRA or stampeded \ninto making up horror stories. It is because they understand the \npurpose, the legitimate purpose, the constitutional right and purpose \nof the legal and appropriate use of firearms.\n  A gun is a great equalizer. It enables the feeble, the disabled, the \nold, the small to defend themselves against a more powerful aggressor. \nBut with the right to keep and bear arms comes a solemn, a very solemn \nresponsibility to use those arms safely and within the law.\n  Those who do should be celebrated for their exercise of civil \nliberties in the great tradition of our country--not make the tragedy \none of a cowardly cheap shot from the White House and the President.\n  Let me say this about hunters and sports shooters in America, not to \nmention the collectors and the skilled crafts people who enjoy the \nhistory and artistry of firearms as a hobby: They have already been \nplundered, in some instances, by gun laws. Again and again in the past, \nwhen some effort to grab headlines was made, lawmakers reacted with \nanother restriction, and another and another and another. Yesterday, \nwhen the Senator from New Jersey and I were debating an important \nissue, I talked about 40,000 gun laws. Many of those were the result of \nan illegal action and a political reaction.\n  I am not saying that all of them are bad. But 40,000 at the city, \ncounty, State, and Federal levels? Do these 40,000 gun laws, stacked \none upon another, make America a safer place? Well, in Littleton, CO, \ntragically enough, 20 of those 40,000 gun laws were violated by those 2 \nyoung men, and some by other people who got guns for them. Some of \nthose people have been arrested. Some of those are working, as they \nshould, and those are the kinds of laws I support; law-abiding citizens \nsupport them, and guns rights defender organizations support them. But \nwe haven't stopped violent crime and we have only piled all of these \nproblems one on top of another.\n  Perhaps it is time for a sea change in our thinking. Instead of \nforcing law-abiding citizens to put up with inconveniences, as our \nPresident might suggest, or outright erosion of their civil liberties, \nperhaps we should demand that this administration's inconveniences are \nthe armed criminal. By prosecuting them, by going at them, as the \njuvenile crime bill does, and as the Hatch-Craig amendment does, to \nstrengthen the hands of the law enforcement officers to make sure we \nenforce at least some of the 40,000 gun laws we have--that is what we \nshould be doing, and that is what the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee of the Senate is trying to do--to build on and strengthen the \nbody of law that can be enforced, and to say to our U.S. attorneys: \nEnforce the law. Get out in the field and put those people behind bars \nwho are breaking the law with the use of a firearm.\n  So as we move through this debate, let's not follow the President's \nlead. Judging by the calls and letters and visits I am getting in the \nwake of the President's speech, the movement to secure the second \namendment is not going to evaporate anytime soon. Law-abiding gun \nowners in America flatly reject the argument that the only way to \ncontrol crime is through putting more burden on the exercise of their \nrights.\n  Any Senator who takes his or her constitutional responsibility \nseriously should carefully consider what a vote for more gun control is \ngoing to do. What is it going to do? Prevent crime? On rare occasions, \nit might. But it will be a political pill, so that we can go home and \nsay we did the right thing. Yet, Littleton happened. I suggest that we \nhave the opportunity to make changes, and they are here tonight, they \nare here in the juvenile crime bill. It is outrageous and unforgivable \nto suggest that anybody in this body needs to vote in favor of more gun \ncontrol in order to prove that he or she cares.\n  Why don't we make changes in what our children are doing, in the \naccess they have to violence on television, in the movies, in videos. \nThat is what we are trying to do in ensuring that those who would prey \nupon others with the use of a gun in the commission of a crime be \nlocked up and put behind bars. That is the message I am told Americans \nwant to hear. That is the message my citizens in Idaho want to hear. \nThey want to know that those who violate the laws will be arrested and, \nmost assuredly, that the criminal element will be denied access to \nfirearms.\n  If you vote for the Hatch-Craig amendment, that is what you vote for. \nIf you vote for the juvenile crime bill, as amended, you broaden the \nentire arena of changing the way we have done business in the past in \ndealing with violent juveniles and crime in America. We turn to this \nadministration and we turn to the Attorney General and we say: Enforce \nthe law. Go after the criminal. Make this country safe for those who \nare willing to defend their civil liberties and who believe strongly in \ntheir constitutional rights.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield such time as he needs to the \ndistinguished Senator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair and the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, who is managing this bill.\n  Mr. President, I want to say how much I have admired his skill, \nability, and knowledge in moving this important juvenile crime package \nforward. It makes positive steps in every area that deals with juvenile \ncrime and violence.\n  We were shocked and saddened by the events in Colorado. It caused us \nall to rethink and rededicate ourselves to making improvements. We have \nbeen working for 2 years to try to get this bill up for a final vote. \nMaybe now we can have that become a reality.\n  I hope we can continue to debate the issues and debate the amendments \nand vote. I just hope we don't have a group of Members who, for one \nreason or another, would rather not see a bill pass. If that is so, I \nthink some people need to be held accountable for that. I am willing to \ndebate and hear the amendments, vote on them, and put my record on the \nline and do what we can to pass this legislation. Without any doubt, \nthere is a major step forward in putting additional regulations on gun \nshows, which has been discussed here today. We have several other \namendments and provisions in this bill that crack down on the illegal \nuse of guns, including substantially increasing penalties for a lot of \ndifferent gun violations.\n  Mr. President, I had the occasion to be a Federal prosecutor for 12 \nyears, a U.S. attorney. I served, before that, as an assistant U.S. \nattorney. I also was attorney general of Alabama. What I have been \nhearing in the last few weeks about what we need to do about law \nenforcement and what is wrong in this country really frustrates me. The \nPresident of the United States, after this tremendous tragedy in \nColorado, proposes that we need to do something about it. As I recall, \nhis basic solutions were that we need a juvenile Brady bill, which was \nalready in our juvenile crime bill pending at that time. He said we \nneed to step up liability for parents whose children go out and commit\n\n[[Page S5247]]\n\ncrimes, which is a very difficult thing to do if you adhere to the \ntraditional rules of American and English criminal law: you have to \nhave criminal intent to be guilty of a crime. We have never made people \nguilty of crimes unless they had reason to be responsible criminally \nfor somebody else's crime. Maybe we can make progress and the States \nwill make progress, but there is not a lot you can do there. The \nPresident proposed a couple of other matters that dealt with guns, and \nthey are minor, not a realistic way to deal with what is happening with \ncrime in America.\n  I want to say that I have, from my experience, noted a real \nshortcoming in President Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno's \nDepartment of Justice.\n  They have not prosecuted the laws effectively. They simply have not \ndone so.\n  In 1992, before President Clinton took office, President Bush had a \nprogram called Project Triggerlock. It enhanced, increased, and \nintensified the prosecution of criminals who use guns illegally, felons \nwho possess firearms, people who carry firearms in the commission of a \ndrug offense, or other criminal activity, people who traffic in stolen \nguns, people who have sawed-off shotguns and fully automatic weapons. \nThey were prosecuted intensely.\n  In 1992, there were 7,048 cases of prosecutions under those laws that \nexisted at that time.\n  I direct your attention to this chart. It is the Executive Office of \nU.S. Attorneys' statistical data, which the Department of Justice lives \nby, which shows the number of prosecutions that have been going on in \nthis country. In 1992, there were 7,048.\n  I know that number, because I had a trigger lock prosecution team in \nmy office. I was directed by the President and the Attorney General to \ndo that. I was delighted to comply.\n  I sent out a newsletter to share it with the chiefs of police. It was \ndedicated solely to laws and information on how to be more productive \nin prosecuting these criminals who are using guns and killing people, \nbecause I knew then and I know today that can save lives.\n  Since this administration has been in office, look what has happened \nwith those numbers. They have gone down now to 3,807, a 40-percent \ndecline in prosecutions. That is a dramatic number.\n  It really offends me. I consider it astounding that the President of \nthe United States and the Attorney General of the United States would \ngo around and say, ``Oh, we are the toughest people in America about \nguns; we want to do more about guns, and if you Republicans in Congress \nwon't pass every law that we can think of to make some other event \ncriminal.'' They do not care about prosecuting criminals. I have a \nrecord of it.\n  In my tenure, we increased dramatically the number of gun \nprosecutions. I don't take a backseat to anyone over my commitment to \nprosecute people who use guns.\n  This administration wants to prosecute innocent people with guns, \npeople who have no criminal motive whatsoever, while they are allowing \nthe serious cases to erode dramatically.\n  They have more prosecutors today than they had in 1992, and they have \na 40-percent reduction. It is just an offensive thing to me.\n  I will also pull these charts, because I know how to read the U.S. \nattorney's manual. I did it for 12 years. They had to have several new \nlaws, and some of them are pretty good. I am supportive of them. These \nare going to fight crime, they said.\n  Look at this chart. This is shocking.\n  Here is one:\n  ``Possession of firearms on school grounds''--922(q).\n  There are a lot of subparts: 922(c), for carrying a firearm in the \ncommission of a crime by a felon carries 5 years without parole, if you \nare convicted of that.\n  This is 922(q): ``Possession of a firearm on school grounds.''\n  It was reported, I believe, that the First Lady at this press \nconference, when they wailed about gun laws and gun shows, said there \nwere 6,000 incidents last year of firearms on school grounds.\n  That is what they said.\n  In 1997, this Department of Justice--and every U.S. attorney in \nAmerica is appointed by the President of the United States--prosecuted \nfive cases. In 1998, eight. That is nationwide. That is for the whole \ncountry.\n  How is that stopping crime and making our communities safer? That is \nwhat I am saying. Is that making us safer?\n  ``Unlawful transfer of firearms to juveniles''--that is a pretty good \nlaw--922(x)(1). That law passed and closed a little problem there, a \nloophole. It was closed several years ago.\n\n  ``Unlawful transfer of firearms to juveniles.'' In 1997, this \nDepartment of Justice, which makes guns its priority, only prosecuted \nfive cases; in 1998, six.\n  Look at this one: ``Possession or transfer of a semiautomatic \nweapon''--that is the assault weapon ban that was allowed. There have \nbeen a lot of disputes about it, and a lot of debate about it, because \nit is really a semiautomatic weapon, but it looks bad. So they banned \nit.\n  In 1997, there were 34 prosecutions; and, in 1989, 84.\n  I think that begins to make a point.\n  We don't need to be dealing in symbolism or politics. There is a \nSecond Amendment right to bear arms. It is in my Constitution. I don't \nknow. Somebody else may read in certain amendments they like and \ncertain ones that they don't. But it is in the Constitution. And it \ngives the people the right to keep and bear arms. That is not going to \nbe given away.\n  We passed a lot of rules that are considered to be reasonable \nrestraints on that. I prosecuted gun dealers for violation of \nregulations. So we expect them to adhere to the regulations we passed.\n  But I will just say with regard to these cases that what we are \nsuggesting: what we are hearing today, or in the last day or so, is an \nattempt to distract attention from the merits of a good, sound, tough, \ncompassionate juvenile justice bill, and derail it on the basis of \nwhether or not we have a sufficient bureaucracy at a gun show, where I \nwill assure you that probably not more than 1 out of 1,000 guns in \nAmerica are bought at gun shows, as if that is going to save crime. It \nis not going to save crime anymore than this law did, or this law did, \nor that law did.\n  Next year, we will probably come in here and they will have a half \ndozen prosecutions under that law, and they want to have that kind of \nthing.\n  What we need to do is go back to a serious prosecution, back to the \nseven, or maybe 10,000 prosecutions under the gun laws that are already \nin existence, and focus on them.\n  I would just share this story with you because I think it is \nrevealing.\n  I have been raising this very issue with this very chart for over a \nyear--this chart which I have been holding up for the Attorney General, \nthe Chief of the Criminal Division, and the Associate Attorney General \nof the U.S. Department of Justice, and I have been asking why they are \nnot doing their job. They don't have a very good answer, if you want to \nread the transcript.\n  What has happened? Early this year we held a hearing. We set it for \nMonday, March 22, just a few months ago. It had been set for some time. \nWe had asked the administration to come and testify, because we were \ngoing to ask them about this failure, this collapse, in Federal efforts \non prosecutions.\n  We had heard that U.S. attorney Helen Fahey, down in Richmond, was \ndoing a triggerlock-type program, and being very successful. The chief \nof police in Richmond was just delighted. They had a 41-percent \nreduction in murder and a 21-percent reduction in violent crime. We \nwanted to highlight this.\n  So we had a hearing. It made the administration nervous. We said: We \nare going to ask you about these numbers. We are going to ask you why \nyou quit President Bush's Project Triggerlock, and why aren't you \nreplicating and repeating what you are doing successfully down in \nRichmond?\n  That was going to be on a Monday.\n  On Saturday, March 20, the President of the United States--I guess \nthe word got up to them that they had a little problem.\n  So he had a radio address to the Nation. He focused it on gun \nprosecutions. He had the United States attorney Helen Fahey in his \noffice, and the chief of police in his office. She was going to testify \non Monday. And he talked about the very thing we talked about.\n  I thought: Wasn't that interesting. Maybe we have finally gotten \nthrough to somebody.\n\n[[Page S5248]]\n\n  This is what he said:\n\n       Today I am directing Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and \n     Attorney General Janet Reno to use every available tool to \n     increase the prosecution of gun criminals and shut down \n     illegal gun markets. I am asking them to work closely with \n     local, State, and Federal law enforcement officials, and to \n     report back to me with a plan to reduce gun violence by \n     applying proven local strategies to fight gun crime \n     nationwide. My balanced budget----\n\n  He always says that--``my balanced budget.''\n  What that has to do with this, I don't know.\n       My balanced budget will help to hire more Federal \n     prosecutors and ATF agents so we can crack down on even more \n     gun criminals and illegal gun trafficking all across America.\n\n  That was his radio address.\n  On Monday, U.S. Attorney Helen Fahey testified that\n\n       Project Exile [what they called the project in Richmond] is \n     essentially triggerlock with steroids.\n\n  They basically took the Project Triggerlock activities and enhanced \nit.\n\n       Plus community involvement and advertising . . . Project \n     Exile is simple and straightforward in its execution and \n     requires relatively limited prosecution and law enforcement \n     resources. The program's focus and message is clear, concise \n     and easily understood, and most importantly, unequivocal. The \n     message: An illegal gun gets you 5 years in Federal prison.\n\n  That was President Clinton's U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of \nVirginia.\n  On May 5 we had oversight hearings with the Department of Justice in \nthe Judiciary Committee. I asked Attorney General Reno if she had \ngotten this directive, and what she was doing about it. She indicated:\n\n       The prosecution by Federal Government of small gun cases \n     that can be better handled by the State court . . . doesn't \n     make such good sense.\n\n  I cross-examined her a good bit about that because it was stunning to \nme. I said: Did you get a directive from the President? Did he send it \nto you in writing or did he call you on the phone or were you supposed \nto listen to the radio? How did you get this message? Are you going to \ndo it?\n  She steadfastly refused to make a commitment to replicate and \nreproduce the Project Exile in Richmond, VA, and to use that around the \ncountry--even though her own people are telling her of the 41-percent \nreduction in the murder rate and a 20-percent reduction overall of \nviolent crime.\n  This bill provides money for that. We have a proposal to increase \nsubstantially, perhaps as much as $10 million or $50 million to the \nJustice Department to replicate this project. We are going to insist on \nit. We believe it will save lives.\n  The chart shows from 7,000 to 3,000 prosecutions, a 40-percent \nreduction. There are those who talk about caring about innocent victims \nof crime and doing something about crime. There are innocent people in \nAmerica who have died because those cases weren't prosecuted, those \ncriminals using guns were not prosecuted. They have gone on and killed \nother people. It is a shame and a tragedy.\n  I believe what we have to do first and foremost is to create a \nclimate and a mentality in this Department of Justice that they are \ngoing to use the laws they have been given and not to excuse themselves \nby discussing some new law that they have little or no intent on \nprosecuting effectively.\n  That is the true fact of the matter. We are talking about thousands \nof cases.\n  My view is if it is a good law and it is not unconstitutional and it \nis not too burdensome and we can figure a way to make it work, I am all \nsupportive of it. I voted for and support several.\n  The real problem is cracking down on the criminals who are using \nguns. The laws already on the books are the ones that are going to be \nused 99 percent of the time when those cases are prosecuted. If used \neffectively, we can remove dangerous criminals from our streets, reduce \nviolent crime and murder, and save the lives of innocent people.\n  I thank Chairman Hatch for all the work he has done, the leadership \nhe has given, and the patience he as demonstrated in moving this \nlegislation forward.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 19 minutes 44 seconds and the \nminority has 22\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield 8 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nMissouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, the Senator from Utah.\n  I rise to address a number of provisions in the Hatch-Craig amendment \nthat I am particularly concerned with, provisions that I have sought to \nmove forward over the last several months and in the last several \nyears, provisions that set or increase mandatory minimum sentences for \ngun crimes and drug crimes which endanger juveniles.\n  First, we need to address federal firearms offenses and impose \nsubstantial penalties on violent firearms offenses. Those who misuse \nfirearms to commit crimes impose a tremendous cost on American society \nand on our culture. They destroy lives, they destroy families, they \ndestroy businesses, they destroy neighborhoods. We need to have a \nFederal policy with a zero tolerance for those who are misusing \nfirearms to perpetrate violent crimes or to traffic in drugs--the kind \nof criminal activities that are destroying the very fabric of our \nculture.\n  An essential part of this zero tolerance policy are mandatory minimum \nsentences that creates a serious deterrent for those who commit Federal \nviolent and drug crimes, including carjacking and violent crimes on \nschool grounds.\n  In order for mandatory minimum sentences to provide such a deterrent, \nthey need to be long enough to make the offenders think about \ncommitting these crimes. They need to think twice about what they are \ngoing to do. Those sentences also need to be long enough to protect our \nlaw-abiding citizens from these criminals for a long time, by putting \nthe criminals away for substantial period of time.\n  Current Federal law provides mandatory minimum sentences for \npossessing or using a firearm in the commission of a Federal crime of \nviolence or drug trafficking. The current minimum sentence for \npossessing a firearm during such a crime is 5 years. This is a serious \npenalty for simply having a gun, not even showing it or firing it; just \nhaving it on your person. My amendment doesn't increase this penalty. \nWe think it is sufficient as it is, particularly because there is truth \nin sentencing in the Federal system.\n  We do, however, seek in this amendment to change the current minimums \nfor using a firearm during such crimes. The current minimum sentence \nfor brandishing a firearm in a violent Federal crime or drug \ntrafficking crime is 7 years. In this amendment we raise that penalty \nto 10 years. We would raise the penalty for discharging a firearm and \nthereby endangering life and limb from a 10 year minimum to 12 years. \nThe law does not presently provide any mandatory minimum for wounding, \ninjuring or maiming with a firearm. We create a minimum 15-year penalty \nfor those who actually cause physical harm with a firearm.\n  Finally, the law currently provides a maximum penalty of 10 years \nimprisonment for knowingly transferring a firearm, knowing that it will \nbe used in the commission of a crime. We would impose a mandatory \nminimum sentence of 5 years for knowingly facilitating gun violence by \ntransferring a firearm to someone whom you knew was going to commit a \ncrime.\n  These penalties are serious, but the problem is serious. These \npenalties will help create a real set of incentives to tell criminals \nthey better leave their guns at home.\n  Let me also address mandatory minimum sentences for federal drug \ncrimes. The current penalties for adults who target vulnerable \njuveniles by distributing drugs to minors or by selling drugs in or \nnear schools are the same--both of these crimes currently carry a 1-\nyear mandatory minimum for both the initial and subsequent offenses. \nThis amendment raises the mandatory minimum term for each of these \ncrimes from 1 year to 3 years for the initial violation, and 5 years \nfor subsequent offenses.\n  This amendment is similar to two other provisions in the core bill we \nare debating, S. 254. One provision already included in S. 254 \nincreases the mandatory minimum penalties for adults who use minors to \ncommit crimes. Adults should not be able to use minors to\n\n[[Page S5249]]\n\ncommit their crimes for them in order to escape penalty. Another \nprovision in S. 254 increases the penalties on adults who use juveniles \nto commit crimes of violence. Penalties are doubled for first-time \noffenders and trebled for repeat offenders.\n  Together, these provisions send a clear message to adults who would \nprey on our children, attempting to ensnare them in the dangerous life \nof committing crimes, and often in the violent world of illegal drugs.\n  Last year, I introduced all of these provisions in a package designed \nto target adults who use and exploit juveniles to commit crimes. It is \ntime for us to send an unmistakably clear message that we will not, as \na culture, tolerate those who use juveniles, who lead them or point \nthem in the direction of lives of crime in an effort to avoid penalties \nfor their own criminal action. The system already lets young people off \nwith a slap on the wrist and a clean slate when they turn 18. Why \nshould any adult risk serious jail time by committing the crimes \nthemselves? Instead, have a juvenile commit it for them. I think it is \ntime to make it clear that we will deal harshly with adults who use \njuveniles in the commission of crimes.\n  Sadly, our current treatment of juveniles gives adults an incentive \nto exploit children in this way. We need to make sure it cannot be \ndone. If a store sold candy for $5 to adults, but $1 to children, there \nwould be a lot of adults sending kids in to buy candy for them. The \nsame is sadly true with the criminal justice system. Lenient treatment \nof juveniles has too frequently caused adults to think they can get \njuveniles to perpetrate the crimes for them. We must make it clear that \nno adult can escape crime by having a juvenile commit a crime on his or \nher behalf. It is no wonder that in my home State of Missouri, a 20-\nyear-old in Poplar Bluff had her 16-year-old accomplice take the lead \nin a recent armed robbery. Why should she risk serious adult time in \nprison when she could have a juvenile do the crime for her? We cannot \ncontinue to encourage this intolerable behavior. Those who would \ncorrupt our children deserve our stiffest sanctions. We need these \nenhanced penalties on adults who use juveniles to commit federal \nviolent offenses and drug crimes.\n  The provisions in S. 254 and those in this amendment correct the \nperverse incentives in the current system by severely punishing adults \nwho endanger our children and attempt to ensnare them in the world of \ndrugs and crime.\n  Mr. President, I ask how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 40 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Chair. I yield the remainder of my time to \nthe chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to my colleague \nfrom New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Jersey for \nthe time and for his leadership. I understand there is movement on the \nother side to try to deal with the gun show loophole. I appreciate \nthat. But I say to all my colleagues, if we pass the amendment \nsponsored by the Senators from Utah and Idaho, we will not close that \nloophole and we will be back here hearing about more tragedies from \nguns emanating from gun shows. There are six reasons for that which we \nshould talk about.\n  First and most egregious, the amendment creates and deals with \nsomeone called a ``special licensee,'' a person who would be licensed \nto sell in volume at gun shows who would not require background checks. \nThis is overturning 31 years of having federally licensed firearms \ndealers with a new system that is as weak as a wet noodle. The \nlicensees will not have to----\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield on that? My gosh, they do not have \nany controls at all on gun shows. This puts controls on it. It actually \ndoes what those on your side of the floor wanted to do yesterday, and \nour side of the floor did not do. Now we are correcting that. But right \nnow there is no limit at all. We put limits on. We do exactly what the \nPresident was bad-mouthing Republicans for not doing today.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Reclaiming my time----\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be glad to give you some of ours for this, but, \nlook, that just is not quite accurate.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. The point I make is this. We have always had the only \npeople who can legitimately sell guns in quantity are federally \nlicensed dealers. We are now creating an exception.\n  I ask my colleague, the Senator from Utah, why we exempt these people \nfrom any reporting requirements? When you talk to our law enforcement \npeople in either the Justice Department or in the Treasury Department, \nthey say if one of these new licensees--because they have no reporting \nrequirements whatsoever--were to simply pass guns out, we would have no \nway to check.\n  My friend from Utah and many from the other side have talked about \nthe need to enforce existing laws. This creates such a huge loophole we \nwould never be able to enforce any existing laws.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will yield, actually now in intrastate \nsales they do not have to do anything. There is no gun check at all. \nThere is no instant check at all; there is no requisite check at all. \nWhat we do is solve that problem and we do it better than what the \nDemocrat amendment was yesterday. And when we do it--I just want to \ncorrect the record.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Right now, for interstate, these people could go \ninterstate. That is the basic problem. If these people, these federally \nlicensed special licensees had to stay within their State, I would \nconcede to the Senator from Utah that maybe it is nonexistent--but not \na step backwards. But they can. So now for the first time we have \npeople who can sell out of State who are not federally licensed dealers \nand who do not have any reporting requirements.\n  There is sort of a split, almost a schizophrenia in the logic of the \nother side, which is we must enforce. We do not need new laws to \nenforce. But we take away every single tool of enforcement.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield on this point?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am happy to yield to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I wanted to ask a question about the pawnshop loophole. \nBefore I do, I want to thank my friend from New York because he does \nsomething around here that is very important. He reads every word of \nthe bill.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you.\n  Mrs. BOXER. And he finds out some of the fine print. We had a \nsituation on the floor with the Senator from Idaho. I was on the floor \nat the time. The Senator from New York said to the Senator from Idaho: \nWith great respect, I think you have a problem in your bill--and he \npointed it out. The Senator from Idaho at that point argued \nvociferously with the Senator from New York, who held his ground and \nhappily everyone reached agreement that in fact what the Senator from \nNew York said was true.\n  But what interests me is one of the loopholes that is not closed. \nThat is this pawnshop loophole. I want to ask my friend from New York a \nquestion. Am I right in understanding that under current law, if \nsomeone goes back to retrieve a gun in a pawnshop, they must undergo an \ninstant check?\n  Let's say somebody puts his gun in the pawnshop and then goes out and \ncommits a crime with another weapon and they come back to retrieve \ntheir gun. It is my understanding there is no instant check on that \nperson. It is further my understanding that people who retrieve their \nguns from pawnshops are five times as likely to be criminals as those \nwho would go to an ordinary dealer; is that correct?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. The Senator from California is exactly correct. What we \nare doing now is making it easier because we take one of the barriers \naway for criminals to get their guns back at pawnshops. Why, for the \nlove of God, are we making it easier for felons to get guns? It is an \namazing thing. If the American people were all listening to this \ndebate, they would be utterly amazed. Let me yield to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, whom I respect so much and I thank so \nmuch for his leadership on this, I think what we have created with the \nCraig bill yesterday is essentially a safe deposit box for criminals to \nput their guns in--a pawnshop--and never have\n\n[[Page S5250]]\n\nto answer to any instant check or anybody looking at them when they \ncome back to get their gun.\n  Would that not be an accurate description of what the Craig amendment \ndid yesterday, and it is not fixed in this amendment; am I correct in \nthat?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I say the Senator is exactly correct. If I were a clever \ncriminal, I would use a pawnshop after this law passes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. It is very ironic, I say to my friend; we are doing a \njuvenile justice bill, and we are creating a tremendous injustice here \nbecause criminals will have a safe place to leave their guns and never \nhave to undergo an instant check again when they pick their guns up \nfrom the pawnshop.\n  I thank my friend for yielding.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator.\n  I say to my good friend from Utah, who I know is very sincere in \nthis, if the sponsors of this legislation were to accept a provision \nthat says let's have the same reporting requirements for the special \nlicensees as we have for the Federal dealers, he might be making a step \nin the direction--it would not be as strong as the Lautenberg bill, but \nit would move in that direction.\n  I remind him of one other thing. Right now, the only people who can \nsell guns in large quantities at gun shows are federally licensed \ndealers. Under this legislation, for the first time--and that is what I \nwas saying--we would have a new group of people allowed to sell guns in \nlarge quantities at gun shows. These are people who have not gone under \nthe rigors of the check before becoming a Federal dealer. They are not \npeople who have the licensing requirements. It is a loophole so wide \nyou can drive a Mack truck through it.\n  Our law enforcement people tell us, again, if we are talking about \nenforcement, I am sure we want to trace guns that criminals have. \nEveryone on the other side is saying tougher penalties for the \ncriminals. I agree with that. One of the reasons I believe I befuddled \nsome of the folks on the other side is I am a tough guy on law and \norder. I believe in tough punishment and have worked for it. But tough \npunishment and gun laws are not contradictory.\n  The NRA and others always set up that straw man: Well, we need tough \nenforcement.\n  Yes, we do. If the two people who brought the guns into Littleton \nHigh had lived, I would have wanted the book thrown at them. But may I \nsay to my friends and my fellow Americans, I would have also wanted \nthem never to have been able to get a gun, because punishing after the \ncrime, while important and necessary, does not save a life.\n  To say that we need tough laws and tough enforcement is correct. To \nsay that that means we do not need gun laws is incorrect. And that is \nthe basic illogic of the arguments I have heard made on the other side \ntonight. Tough punishment, yes; tough gun laws, yes.\n  The Senator from Idaho talked about where the American people are. I \nwill tell you--I agree with you--they are for tough punishment, no \nquestion about it. They are also for tougher gun laws. In a recent CNN \nsurvey, 4 percent said they did not think the gun laws ought to be \ntoughened. In another survey--I forget who did it--87 percent said \nclose the gun show loophole. They did not say come up with a mechanism \nby which other people can sell quantities of guns and never report to \nwhom they sold those guns at a gun show. That is what this amendment \ndoes.\n  Let's make no mistake about it. Is this a diluted version of the \nLautenberg amendment? It is worse, because it gives the impression we \nare tightening the loophole.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time yielded to the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask the Senator if he will yield me 1 more minute to \nfinish my point.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. One more minute, yes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator from New Jersey.\n  We are trying to give the impression that we are toughening things \nup, but, in a sense, not only are we not because of these special \nlicensees--and I still have not heard a single good reason why they \nshould not have reporting requirements--but at the same time, we are \ncreating a new mechanism. And sure as we are sitting here--and I say \nthis to the American people because the Senate seems unable to \nunderstand the pleas of the American people--they are going to start \nusing special licensees as opposed to federally licensed dealers all \nacross America.\n  Violence will increase, and we will be hearing calls for more tough \npunishment, which we will need because there will be more criminals and \nmore gun deaths.\n  I urge rejection of the Hatch-Craig amendment. If you want to do \nsomething real, pass the Lautenberg amendment. We will have a chance, \nhopefully, to revote on it next week, and then we will see who wants to \nclose the gun show loophole.\n  I thank my colleagues for their time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, how much time do the two sides have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 11 minutes 25 \nseconds. The Senator from New Jersey has 10 minutes 37 seconds.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the Hatch-Craig amendment we offered \nearlier this afternoon requires every nonlicensed individual who \ndesires to sell a firearm at a gun show to have a background check. \nThey can get a background check through a licensed Federal firearms \ndealer or through a special registrant, but he must get a background \ncheck.\n  The language in the amendment clearly states that a nonlicensed \nseller ``shall only make'' a sale at a gun show after getting a \nbackground check through the instant check system.\n  ``Shall'' means ``shall.'' It does not mean ``maybe,'' ``sometimes,'' \nor ``if you want to''; it means ``shall.''\n  The distinguished Senator from New Jersey says we are a nation of \nlaws.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator from Utah yield for a brief moment?\n  Mr. HATCH. I will on your time because I only have a limited amount \nof time and I want to get through these points.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I think we are out of time.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me see if I have enough time at the end.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I yielded a little to the Senator before.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to at the end if we have some time, but we \nare short on time.\n  The distinguished Senator from New Jersey says we are a nation of \nlaws. He says we must close the loophole that allows nonlicensed \nindividuals to buy a gun at a gun show.\n  The Senator from New Jersey says the definition of ``gun show'' used \nin the amendment would exempt gatherings of fewer than 10 firearms \nexhibitors and, he said, would exempt gatherings of firearm exhibitors \nand other exhibitors where the percentage of firearm exhibitors is less \nthan 20 percent of the show. This is untrue. The amendment defines a \n``gun show'' as an event at which we have either, A, 20 percent or more \nfirearms exhibitors out of all the exhibitors at the show or, B, 10 or \nmore firearms exhibitors. The language is ``or,'' not ``and.''\n\n  Thus, if there are three exhibitors, one of which is a firearms \nexhibitor, this would constitute a ``gun show'' under the 20 percent \nrule--one out of three naturally being 33 percent, which is greater \nthan 20 percent. The event need not satisfy the ``10 or more'' tests. \nIt will be a gun show.\n  If there are 10 firearm exhibitors out of 100 exhibitors, that will \nbe a gun show under the ``10 or more'' rule. The event need not also \nsatisfy the 20 percent. It would be a gun show.\n  It is just that simple. There is no question about it. The threshold \nfor what constitutes a gun show is low and it is certain: 20 percent \nfirearms exhibitors or 10 or more firearms exhibitors.\n  What does that mean? In fact, the definition of ``gun show'' in the \nHatch-Craig amendment is more strict than Senator Lautenberg's original \ndefinition. He required 50 firearms and 2 or more firearms sellers. \nThus, if 1 of 3 exhibitors at a gathering is a firearms dealer and only \nbrings 49 firearms, Senator Lautenberg's amendment would not classify \nit as a gun show. The Hatch-Craig amendment would classify it as a gun \nshow.\n  The Republican amendment closes the loophole that the Democratic \namendment left open. To talk about loopholes, we know a little bit \nabout that. The Hatch-Craig amendment slams the door shut on the \nloophole\n\n[[Page S5251]]\n\nand slams it hard. Unfortunately for my Democratic colleagues, however, \nour amendment slams this door without more regulation, and without more \ntaxes and without much more Government and bureaucracy, which is what \nwould have happened under the Lautenberg amendment.\n\n  Next, the Senator from New Jersey says that we on this side of the \naisle do not believe that gun laws work. He is absolutely wrong on \nthat. We just know they are not enforced by this administration.\n  For all the loudmouth talking that this administration does, look at \nthis record of what they have done with regard to prosecutions of guns. \nI went through this early in the day.\n  Providing a firearm to a prohibited person, unspecified category--\neach number will be for 1996, 1997, 1998, in that order--17, 25, 10. It \nis pitiful.\n  Look at this. Providing firearms to a felon: 20, 13, 24; for 1996, \n1997, 1998.\n  Possession of a firearm by a fugitive: 30, 30, and 23 for last year.\n  Possession of a firearm by a drug addict or illegal drug user--we \nknow there are hundreds of thousands, at least, if not millions--46, \n69, 129.\n  Possession of a firearm by a person committed to a mental institution \nor adjudicated mentally incompetent: 1 in 1996, 4 in 1997, and 5 \nprosecutions in 1998.\n  Tell me that this administration is enforcing gun laws that are on \nthe books. And yet all we hear is crying and crying over spilled milk, \nthat we need more gun laws. But they won't enforce them. There are lots \nof gun laws on the books, but they just will not enforce them.\n  It is just the phoniest doggone issue I have seen yet, when everybody \nin this Senate knows that these problems with our teenagers and our \nyoung people, what they come down to is a myriad of problems, many of \nwhich are caused by broken homes, broken families, single families \nwhere the parent has to work and cannot take care of the kids, a \nbreakdown in society, a breakdown in religious values, a breakdown in \nfamily values, a breakdown in many other societal values, rotten \nmovies, rotten music, rotten Internet things, rotten video games.\n  All of this is adding to this. Guns is one small part of it. But look \nat all these laws. And they are not being enforced by this very \nadministration which continues to pop off every day about, we need more \ngun laws. Well, enforce the ones we have.\n  It is incredible to me that they get away with this. Sure, the polls \nwill say that people are concerned about guns. Naturally they are. We \nall are. But they ought to be concerned about an administration that \ndoes nothing about the laws already on the books, that continually \ncalls for more for political advantage. That is what bothers me about \nthis outfit.\n  Possession of a firearm by a person dishonorably discharged from the \narmed services: 0, 0, 2; for 1996, 1997, 1998.\n  Possession of a firearm by a person under a certain kind of \nrestraining order provision: 3 in 1996, 18 in 1997, 22 in 1998.\n  Possession of a firearm by a person convicted of a domestic violence \nmisdemeanor: 0 in 1996, 21 in 1997, 56 in 1998.\n  A country of 250 million people, and this is the record we have?\n  Possession of a firearm by a person convicted of a domestic violence \nmisdemeanor--think about it--0 in 1996, 21 in 1997, 56 in 1998.\n  Possession of a firearm or discharge of a firearm in a school zone--\nthousands of them--we had 4, 5, and 8 in the last 3 years. Think about \nit.\n\n  All violations under the Brady Act--we have heard nothing but Brady \nAct, Brady Act, Brady Act, and it has not done a thing compared to the \ninstant check system which we insisted on. But look at this. All the \nviolations under the Brady Act, first phase: No prosecutions in either \n1996 or 1997; one prosecution under the Brady Act in 1998. And you \nwould have thought the Brady Act was the last panacea for all gun \nproblems on this Earth.\n  All violations under the Brady Act in the instant check phase--they \nare not even doing it under the instant check that we have done--0, 0, \n0; for 1996, 1997, 1998. There is a point where you call it hypocrisy \nto continually try to make political points on guns when this \nadministration ignores every law that is on the books and then says we \nneed more laws to solve these problems.\n  My gosh, we know that the trigger lock cases have dropped an awful \nlot, from 7,500 under the Bush administration down to 3,500, because \nthis administration does not take it seriously. Yet they go out every \nday and make these political points that we need more gun laws so that \nthey have an opportunity not to enforce them, I guess.\n  Look at this. Theft of a firearm from a Federal firearms licensee: \n52, 51, 25.\n  Manufacturing, transferring, or possession of a nongrandfathered \nassault weapon: 16, 4, 4. We heard how terrible assault weapons are. \nHardly anything done about it.\n  Transfer of a handgun or handgun ammunition to a juvenile: 9, 5, 6, \neven though we know that is violated all over this country.\n  The fact of the matter is, these are laws we should be enforcing that \nare not being enforced. And I have only covered some of them. I do not \nhave enough time to cover all of them.\n  But the fact is, this administration, for all of its talk about guns, \nisn't enforcing the laws that exist. Now they are asking for more laws. \nAnd they will not enforce those either.\n  The Hatch-Craig amendment slams the door on these loopholes. And, \nfrankly, when are they going to enforce these laws the way they should \nbe enforced?\n  It is one thing to talk about punishing the criminal use of firearms; \nit is another thing to mean it. It is one thing to talk about \nprotecting innocent schoolchildren from violent juvenile offenders; it \nis another thing to actually pass a bill that will do it.\n  This bill will help. Yet we are in such a doggone logjam here, we \nmight have to pull this bill down, because all the amendments that \npeople are coming up with every day really are deterring the passage of \nthis bill.\n  Republicans want to pass this bill and protect our children now. And \nI believe my colleague on the other side, who is managing his side, \nwants to do so as much as I do.\n  Let's stop talking. Let's start acting. If you really want to protect \nour schoolchildren, prove it by passing the juvenile crime bill. That \nis the best way to do it. And let's not just center on guns, which may \nbe a problem, and probably is a whole series of problems, but that is \nonly one small part of this. I am saying, a lot of things are not being \ndone.\n  Senator Schumer criticizes this amendment by saying it would permit, \nfor the first time, transactions of firearms at gun shows by \nindividuals who are not Federal firearms licensees. But the entire \njustification of the gun show amendment--since the private sales are \noccurring at gun shows without any background checks whatsoever, we are \nputting in this bill, the Hatch-Craig amendment, instant checks on all \nsales. And it shall be done, according to this amendment. Senator \nSchumer's criticism suggests we are trying to address a problem that \ndoes not exist. Which is it? Is this a problem? Is there a problem with \nprivate sales at gun shows or not?\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All the time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent for 1 more minute, and I will \nfinish with that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. This amendment does not allow more types of firearms \ntransactions at gun shows. It does provide for a mandatory background \ncheck for all transactions at gun shows. Only those transactions where \nthere is currently no check at all will be able to take advantage of a \nspecial registrant background check. Right now, we have hardly any \nprotections.\n  This amendment will bring them to pass. This amendment will do what \nwas asked for yesterday. I think you can criticize anything to do with \nthis area, but this is the right way to go. We are going to solve this \nproblem. That is why people should vote for the Hatch-Craig amendment.\n  I thank my colleagues for their forbearance.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 90 \nseconds without it coming from anybody's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in many ways I feel that if the \ndistinguished\n\n[[Page S5252]]\n\nSenator from Utah and I were unconstrained by Senators on either side, \nwe could write a bill that would be very helpful. But I hope we do not \nget carried away with partisan rhetoric here.\n  The fact of the matter is that there have been a number of issues the \nDemocratic side of the aisle has brought up that have been voted down \nby the Republican side--not unanimously, I might say; in fact, I can \nthink of a couple where the distinguished Presiding Officer voted \ndifferently than the majority of his party--and then those parts were \nthen put into a Republican bill. That is fine. I am not interested who \ntakes credit; I am interested in stopping juvenile crime.\n  In fairness, let's point out, when we talk about what the \nadministration might or might not have done, in the past 6 years, the \nrate of violent crime has come down at a faster and greater level than \nat any time in my lifetime. I am 59 years old. That means through \nRepublican and Democratic administrations, the rate of violent crime \nhas come down faster than ever before in the 6 years of this \nadministration. The rate of juvenile crime has done the same. We have \nstopped thousands and thousands of gun sales to those with felony \nrecords. Let's stop saying who has done it or who has not done it. \nLet's do what is best for our children. We are parents. We are \ngrandparents.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 90 seconds have expired.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I intend that as a compliment to my friend from Utah.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am managing the time on our side. I yield myself \nsuch time as remains for my response to what we have heard.\n  Mr. President, I listened very carefully to the speeches. If I may \nsay, the rhetoric that was used here--decrying the Federal Government's \nefforts to curb crime, incriminating crime fighting within the \njurisdiction of the Federal Government, and saying that we are not \ndoing our job--it is outrageous to listen to, I must tell you, because \nthese things are concoctions. There are few people who I have more \nrespect for in this place than the distinguished Senator from Utah, but \nthat does not mean that I do not think he is wrong in some of the \nthings he has just said. I am responding with admiration and respect.\n  When we look at the ATF investigations, I hold here the report that \nis ``Gun Shows,'' issued January 1999, by the Bureau of Alcohol, \nTobacco and Firearms, Department of Justice, Department of the \nTreasury. It says: Together ATF investigations paint a disturbing \npicture of gun shows as a venue for criminal activity and a source of \nfirearms used in crimes. Felons, although prohibited from acquiring \nfirearms, have been able to purchase firearms at gun shows. In fact, \nfelons buying or selling firearms were involved in more than 46 percent \nof the investigations involving gun shows. Firearms involved in the 314 \nreviewed investigations numbered more than 54,000. A large number of \nthese firearms were sold or purchased at gun shows.\n  What I hear here is concern about protecting average citizens from \ninconvenience. What a terrible thing. Why should they have this big \nbrother looking over their shoulder? Why should we have speed limits? \nWhy should we have laws against drugs? Why should we have laws against \nalcohol? Because this is a nation of laws. That is what we are about. \nThat is what makes this society so distinctive. Instead, I haven't \nheard the pleas for the parents of those kids who have been killed by \nguns purchased, wherever they are. I haven't heard that. What I have \nheard is a nagging little complaint about, oh, what a pity, the \ninfringement of the person who wants to go buy a gun who needs it in a \nhurry, sticks it in his pocket, walks out of the place without \nidentifying himself.\n\n  Yes, the Hatch-Craig amendment does close some of the avenues for gun \npurchase, but it does not close them all, because if you are a special \nlicensed purveyor, you don't have to do any checking at all. That is \nwhat the amendment says. Perhaps it is careless, perhaps it is \ndeliberate, but it does not protect against that.\n  Then I hear a challenge to the President and his complaints about gun \nshows. He doesn't say that. He talks about gun shows with a degree of \nrespect, but he says there are problems that have developed as a result \nof excesses available through gun shows.\n  I think we have to look at what is happening. Federal gun \nprosecutions: Overall violent and property crimes are down more than 20 \npercent each; the murder rate is down 28 percent, the lowest level in \n30 years; homicides, robberies, and aggravated assaults committed with \nguns are down by an average of 27 percent. And yet, when we go ahead \nand talk about what we have to do to protect our citizens, we hear, get \nmore enforcement out there, get more of a bureaucracy.\n  But when it comes to providing the money for ATF agents and Federal \nprosecutors, we have a heck of a time trying to get it. Despite the \nrhetoric, the NRA has never supported backing its tough talk with real \nmoney for State, local, and Federal law enforcement agencies to \ninvestigate, arrest, and prosecute gun criminals.\n  Well, the reason for the decline in prosecutions is that we work more \nnow with State and local agencies than we ever did before. Overall, the \nrate of convictions and incarcerations has grown pretty steadily.\n  We are looking at what I will call straw men, reasons to find ways of \nnot inconveniencing the gun buyer. Heaven forbid the gun buyer should \nhave to obey the same laws that other people have to when they want to \nbuy an automobile or buy liquor or what have you. There are \nregulations, and so it should be. That doesn't take away anybody's \nright to buy a drink or buy a car. You just have to fess up to it. If \nyou want to buy a gun, in my view, you have to be able to say: This is \nmy name; this is where I live; this is what I want to do.\n  If the audience was not obscured through a television camera or not \naway from the folks in front of you but, rather, were the parents and \nthe families of the kids in Littleton, they would find that Americans \nblame the Littleton incident in significant measure on the availability \nof guns. They do not say there is too little prosecution. They don't \nsay that the gun laws are cumbersome. What they say is there are too \ndarned many guns in our society.\n  How much are each to blame for Littleton? Percentage responding, a \ngreat deal: availability of guns, 60 percent; parents, 51 percent; \nnearly all Americans support many gun control measures, particularly \nthose aimed at kids; require background checks on explosives and gun \nshow buyers, national poll, 87 percent.\n\n  In here we have 51 percent who went the other way just yesterday and \ntoday want to, in my view, set up a smokescreen, pretend we closed all \nthe loopholes. There is nothing malicious in it. They just happen to be \nwrong in the approach, because if they looked at their own amendment \nthey would see there are loopholes--whether they are requiring Federal \nagencies to get rid of records so they are not kept for too long a \ntime, leaving the pawnshop opening that we just heard about for someone \nwho is away. I just spoke to the Senator from Idaho. I said: What would \nhappen if the claimant, to retrieve a gun that is in a pawnshop, comes \nback 4 months later? Are they required to say anything about where they \nhave been during this period?\n  No. No, there is no requirement. The Senator from Idaho said there is \nno requirement. The guy could have been in jail for 90 days. But the \nfact is that he has come back. He has paid his interest. He has paid \nhis $50 to retrieve his gun. Give him his gun back. Don't ask any \nquestions.\n  I ask you, is that bordering on the absurd? I think so.\n  We, again, hear these lame arguments about why we couldn't adopt the \nLautenberg amendment as it was originally. And today, shame has filled \nthis place, embarrassment has filled this place, because calls have \ncome in and newspapers have editorialized and said what is the matter \nwith the Senate--87 percent of the people out there think that gun \nshows are a source of too many weapons.\n  But not here. Here we worry about not the victim, not the parent, not \nthe brother, the sister, or the child. No, we worry about the \ninconvenience or the big bureaucracy that may be created to\n\n[[Page S5253]]\n\nmake it inconvenient or slow down the pace of gun acquisition.\n  Are there too few guns in this society? I ask anybody, too few guns? \nI doubt it. Something like over 200 million guns, that is enough to go \naround pretty well.\n  They blame our culture. We heard a story the other day from the \nSenator from Michigan who said that in Windsor, Canada, just across the \nriver, they see the same television, are exposed to the same cultural \nelements, prefer the same music, everything else, yet they have so far \nfewer crimes with guns--about 30 or 40 times more in Detroit than they \nhave in Windsor. It has to do with the availability of guns, nothing \nmore and nothing less.\n  We ought to face up to it and not find different excuses for why it \nis that the gun wasn't involved. It is not the gun's fault, no; it is \nthe trigger person's fault. But that trigger person would have had a \nheck of a time knifing the 13 or 15 people in the Columbine High School \nin the situation they were in. It was easy, however, with their \nweapons, with their explosives. It is time to face up to it.\n  I wish we would pay the same attention to the victims: 35,000 victims \nin a year of handgun death, 13,000 of murder, in rough numbers, 18,000 \nof suicides, 3,000 of accidents. When you compare us to the other \nsocieties with whom we associate and work, there is just no comparison. \nWe are looking at societies that have less than 100 deaths a year from \nguns--the UK, Japan, and others. It just doesn't happen there. Why? \nThese are similar people with the same kinds of problems we have. They \nhave mixed societies and they have problems adjusting to conditions. \nBut they don't have the guns laying around in every nook and cranny.\n\n  So I hope that the American people will watch what happens here and \nsee who voted against the Lautenberg amendment yesterday because there \nare a couple loopholes that have been covered and yet many opened. I \nhope when we vote tomorrow, the public will be watching because the \nanswers will have to be given to them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from New York is to be \nrecognized to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Illinois, Mr. Durbin, be added as a cosponsor to this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. Before I get into this \namendment, I would like to make one final point, which I thought was \nrelevant to the Senator from Utah. I went over to him privately, but I \nthink the Record should show it because he mentioned my name in the \ndebate. I will discuss this after I send up my amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 350\n\n   (Purpose: To amend title 18, United States Code, to regulate the \n    transfer of firearms over the Internet, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York (Mr. Schumer), for himself, Mr. \n     Lautenberg, Mr. Kohl, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Torricelli, and Mr. \n     Durbin, proposes an amendment numbered 350.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 265, after line 20, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. INTERNET GUN TRAFFICKING ACT OF 1999.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Internet Gun Trafficking Act of 1999''.\n       (b) Regulation of Internet Firearms Transfers.--\n       (1) Prohibitions.--Section 922 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended by inserting after subsection (y) the \n     following:\n       ``(z) Regulation of Internet Firearms Transfers.--\n       ``(1) In general.--It shall be unlawful for any person to \n     operate an Internet website, if a clear purpose of the \n     website is to offer 10 or more firearms for sale or exchange \n     at one time, or is to otherwise facilitate the sale or \n     exchange of 10 or more firearms posted or listed on the \n     website at one time, unless--\n       ``(A) the person is licensed as a manufacturer, importer, \n     or dealer under section 923;\n       ``(B) the person notifies the Secretary of the Internet \n     address of the website, and any other information concerning \n     the website as the Secretary may require by regulation; and\n       ``(C) if any firearm posted or listed for sale or exchange \n     on the website is not from the business inventory or personal \n     collection of that person--\n       ``(i) the person, as a term or condition for posting or \n     listing the firearm for sale or exchange on the website on \n     behalf of a prospective transferor, requires that, in the \n     event of any agreement to sell or exchange the firearm \n     pursuant to that posting or listing, the firearm be \n     transferred to that person for disposition in accordance with \n     clause (iii);\n       ``(ii) the person prohibits the posting or listing on the \n     website of, and does not in any manner disseminate, any \n     information (including any name, nickname, telephone number, \n     address, or electronic mail address) that is reasonably \n     likely to enable the prospective transferor and prospective \n     transferee to contact one another directly prior to the \n     shipment of the firearm to that person under clause (i), \n     except that this clause does not include any information \n     relating solely to the manufacturer, importer, model, \n     caliber, gauge, physical attributes, operation, performance, \n     or price of the firearm; and\n       ``(iii) with respect to each firearm received from a \n     prospective transferor under clause (i), the person--\n\n       ``(I) enters such information about the firearm as the \n     Secretary may require by regulation into a separate bound \n     record;\n       ``(II) in transferring the firearm to any transferee, \n     complies with the requirements of this chapter as if the \n     firearm were being transferred from the business inventory of \n     that person; and\n       ``(III) if the prospective transferor does not provide the \n     person with a certified copy of a valid firearms license \n     issued to the prospective transferor under this chapter, \n     submits to the Secretary a report of the transfer or other \n     disposition of the firearm on a form specified by the \n     Secretary, which report shall not include the name of, or any \n     other identifying information relating to, the transferor.\n\n       ``(2) Transfers by persons other than licensees.--It shall \n     be unlawful for any person who is not licensed under section \n     923 to transfer a firearm pursuant to a posting or listing of \n     the firearm for sale or exchange on an Internet website \n     described in paragraph (1) to any person other than the \n     operator of the website.\n       ``(3) Interactive Computer Service.--Nothing in this \n     section may be construed to provide any basis for liability \n     against an interactive computer service which is not engaged \n     in an activity a purpose of which is to--\n       ``(A) originate an offer for sale of one or more firearms \n     on an Internet website; or\n       ``(B) provide a forum that is directed specifically at an \n     audience of potential customers who wish to sell, exchange, \n     or transfer firearms with or to others.''.\n       (2) Penalties.--Section 924(a) of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(7) Whoever willfully violates section 922(z)(2) shall be \n     fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 2 years, or \n     both.''.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, the point I was about to make regarding \nthe Orrin Hatch amendment, before we get into the substance of this \ndebate--I doubt that we will take the whole hour on this one--is this: \nUnder the Hatch-Craig amendment, there is a new category of people \ncalled ``special licensees'' who can sell at a gun show. They can sell \nguns en masse--lots of guns. Not only are they not required to do the \npaperwork, they are not required to do a background check. So when the \nSenator from Utah said before that they are toughening up the law, it \nis just not so.\n  It is true that federally licensed dealers would have to do a \nbackground check; it is true that the law is a little toughened up so \nthat individuals who sell to one another might have to do a background \ncheck. But we create a whole new huge category of special licensees who \ncan come to gun shows, sell en masse, do no background check and no \npaper recording. What a loophole.\n  That is why the Hatch-Craig amendment, more than any other reason, is \na giant step not forward but backward. That is why the amendment of the \nSenator from New Jersey, Mr. Lautenberg, is what is needed. I ask my \ncolleagues to look at that as part of the other debate.\n  Mr. President, we are here today to debate an amendment dealing with \nInternet sales of guns. I want to thank Chairman Hatch and Senator \nLeahy for the opportunity to offer this amendment. We have known for a \nlong time that gun shows are a loophole that have allowed people to buy \nguns without a background check. We know that. Well, there is another \nloophole that I believe is about to make a quantum change in the gun \nblack market\n\n[[Page S5254]]\n\nand is a disaster waiting to happen: At this moment, on your personal \ncomputer in your home, in your child's bedroom, there are thousands and \nthousands of guns available for sale by unlicensed dealers on the \nInternet.\n  These guns, including assault weapons, automatic weapons and cheap \nhandguns, are listed for sale on a no-questions-asked, honor system \nbasis, which leaves it up to anonymous buyers and sellers to comply \nwith Brady and State and local firearms laws. Any computer novice can \nso readily and so easily find gun web sites that owning a personal \ncomputer means having a gun show in your home 24 hours a day.\n  Last month, for instance, a 17-year-old Alabama boy acquired a Taurus \n9 millimeter semi-automatic pistol and 50 rounds of ammunition over the \nInternet. He was caught only because his mother was home and UPS \ndropped off the package. Who knows what crime may have been committed \nwith that Internet gun.\n  Since 1968, it has been illegal for a felon to buy a gun. The reason \nwe passed the Brady law is because enforcement had no mechanism to \nenforce that law. The Internet returns us to the pre-Brady period where \ndisreputable people can get together and evade gun laws with little \nprospect of detection. Mark my words, if we don't pass an amendment \nsuch as this one, within a year or two, the Internet will be the method \nof choice by which kids, criminals, and mentally incompetents obtain \nguns. We will rue the day we don't pass this amendment. Passing this \namendment now will save lives.\n  What does it do? My amendment simply requires that any web site that \nis set up to offer guns for sale on the Internet be a federally \nlicensed firearm dealer who will make certain that criminal background \nchecks occur with each sale. It just makes the Internet Brady \ncompliant--no more, no less.\n  Let me show you what is available on the web by simply typing in key \nwords like guns for sale, militia and AK-47. This is the Guns America \nWeb site right here on this paper. Anybody can punch into it. Guns \nAmerica boasts that it sells guns on the honor system, that there is \n``not an FFL dealer among the bunch of us,'' and that it will ``grow to \nhundreds of thousands of new listings every month.''\n  Guns America, at this very moment, has 21 AK-47s and AK-47 copies for \nsale, with no questions asked--not a soul watching, not a stitch of \noversight. It is solely up to anonymous buyers and sellers to comply \nwith all gun laws. Let me tell you, the chance of getting caught \nbreaking the law is as likely as mom finding the gun in junior's \nbedroom.\n  Now, this one here is the Weapons Rack, another honor system weapons \nsite. Since last week when I made this poster, the Weapons Rack has had \n3,300 visitors to its site. We don't know anything about these \nvisitors. Did they buy? Did they sell? Were they kids? Were they \nfelons? What we do know is that the number of visitors is indicative \nthat sales on the Internet are growing exponentially. Remember, 5 years \nago, practically nobody bought stocks on the Internet. Today, 30 \npercent of all stocks are sold online.\n  The internet is about to change the entire way guns are bought and \nsold in America. And if we don't get on top of it now and create and \nironclad enforcement mechanism to ensure Brady compliance, I promise \nyou just as sure as I am standing here, it will cost lives and we will \nsorely regret it.\n  This is the Weapons Rack disclaimer: ``It is the sole responsibility \nof the seller and buyer to conform to [firearms] regulations.''\n  Not exactly a confidence booster, is it?\n  If either the seller or buyer don't want to comply, they go right \nthrough.\n  GunSource.com has 3,600 guns for sale. Their disclaimer says, \n``Because user authentication on the Internet is difficult, we cannot \nconfirm that each user is who they claim to be.''\n  Isn't that amazing?\n  Let me read that again. This is right on the Internet. ``Because user \nauthentication on the Internet is difficult, we cannot confirm that \neach user is who they claim to be.''\n  This is a chilling admission. It is also an invitation to those who \ncannot buy a gun from a licensed dealer to use the cloak of the \nInternet to find illicit sellers and arms sellers.\n  Earlier this year eBay, the Nation's largest Internet auction site, \nput out this statement in conjunction with a directive banning the \nlisting of guns on this web site. This is what eBay said. They said:\n\n       The current laws governing the sale of firearms were \n     created for the non-internet sale of firearms. These laws may \n     work well in the real world, but they work less well for the \n     online trading of firearms, where the seller and the buyer \n     rarely meet face-to-face. The online seller cannot readily \n     guarantee that the buyer meets all the qualifications and \n     complies with the laws governing the sale of firearms.\n\n  Listen to the experts. eBay said selling guns on the web is too \ndangerous because they had no idea who was buying and who was selling; \nno way to find out; no way to ask; no way to verify--the guns are sold \npurely on faith.\n  My amendment is balanced, reasonable, and modest.\n  It replaces blind internet faith with fully Brady compliance, no \nmore, no less.\n  It bans the unlicensed sale of guns on the internet by requiring \nwebsites clearly designed to sell guns to be federally licensed \nfirearms dealers. It won't affect chat rooms. It won't affect newspaper \nwant ads. It won't affect licensed firearms dealers.\n  It requires internet gun sites to become ``middlemen'' and act as \nconduits for all sales by forwarding all gun sales to the appropriate \nfirearms dealer in the buyer's state who will perform the Brady \nbackground check. In this way, it is just like a mail-order sale. You \nhave an intermediary. When the gun is sold, it is sent to a gun dealer \nwho then does the background check and gives the gun to the buyer.\n  To prevent buyers and sellers from circumventing the website operator \nand from carrying out transactions which violate federal law--the \namendment prohibits sites from listing information like an e-mail \naddress or phone number that allows buyers and sellers to independently \ncontact each other.\n  Sellguns.com does this already. They are an FFL. This is an auction \nsite where buyers e-mail bids for a particular gun through the website \noperator.  The seller sends the firearm, the shipper pays, and the \nbuyer sends the bid, plus fees and shipping, and SellGuns.com makes the \nmatch and identifies the seller's item with the buyer's request. It \nworks well. It is happening now. We would require this to happen in \nevery sale. It doesn't interfere with the transaction of guns; it just \nmakes sure that kids and criminals can't get them.\n\n  When a final bid is accepted, the buyer sends a check to \nSellGuns.com. The seller sends the gun to SellGuns.com. They trade, the \ncheck and the gun cross, and everybody is happy.\n  That is the model for how all internet gun sales will proceed if this \namendment passes.\n  This amendment is also easy to enforce.\n  Since these websites operate on a volume basis they have to make \ntheir sites easily accessible. Most sites are linked to common words \nlike ``guns,'' ``AK-47,'' and ``militia.'' So gun sites are actually \neasy to find and easy to put into compliance or put out of business if \nthey refuse to comply.\n  Some members have asked me about the difference between a gun ad in \nsay, Guns and Ammo magazines or a newspaper want ad and gun sites on \nthe internet.\n  Number one: volume, The number of guns for sale right now on the \ninternet--20,000, 50,000, 100,000 guns--dwarfs anything available in \nany publication.\n  Number two: secrecy. Magazines are static publications. If the same \nindividual keeps showing up selling guns, law enforcement can look at \nback issues and investigate. The internet is ephemeral. Sellers come \nand go. Ads appear and disappear.\n  Number three: access. Gun sellers are in my home and your home. \nThey're in the bedrooms of my ten year old and my fourteen year old \ndaughters. Owning a personal computer means having a gun show in your \nhome.\n  All it takes is a curious and troubled teenager to cruise the web \nuntil they find someone willing to sell. At least with Guns and Ammo a \nkid has got to know the magazine exists and go to a magazine shop and \nbuy it. This gun store is in your home whether you like it or not.\n  Number four: anonymity. The web allows kids and criminals to use e-\nmail\n\n[[Page S5255]]\n\nto rapidly probe on-line sellers to see who is willing to bypass gun \nlaws. And since it is impossible to monitor any transaction there is \nonly the slimmest of chances that anyone would get caught.\n  In a magazine ad it would be enormously time consuming and frankly \ninvolve luck to figure out who is willing to sell under the table.\n  Number five: distance. The local want ads, are just that--local. The \ninternet moves the transaction from a neighborhood market to a national \nmarket.\n  Commerce on the internet is in its infancy. I agree with those who \nsay that we ought to be very careful before we prohibit certain \nactivities on the net.\n  I believe that the internet is one of the reasons that American \nproductivity is at an all-time high and growing at a remarkable pace.\n  But this is an area that cries out for common sense regulation. it is \nrare that Congress is ahead of the curve. We usually have to be prodded \nby crisis to act.\n  If we fail to close the internet loophole today--I promise you--it \nwill not be the last time that we hear about this issue. A child, a \ncriminal, a disturbed individual will exploit this loophole, evade a \nbackground check and commit a crime that will leave America in \nmourning.\n  In Alabama, where a juvenile succeeded in buying a gun on the \ninternet an ATF agent said:\n\n       The sale of guns on the internet is part of the growing \n     cottage gun industry, replacing face-to-face firearms sales \n     between dealers and individuals at local shops with e-mail \n     messages and shipping orders.\n       On the internet, the dealers don't know who they're dealing \n     with on the other end. You could be dealing with a career \n     criminal, a drug dealer or a high school student.\n\n  Do we really want to leave the sale of guns over the internet \ncompletely unregulated?\n  This bill I am presenting is a balanced, constitutionally sound bill \nwhich requires web sites that are clearly designed to offer guns for \nsale to be federally licensed firearm dealers--no more, no less.\n  We learned from the Brady bill that the honor system doesn't work for \nguns. It might for most people. It doesn't for criminals. And it \ndoesn't for kids who want to buy them and to do something terrible.\n  Pass this amendment and we solve the major problem. Let it fail and \nwe open a firearms cyberhighway that has no exit.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me clear up a point the Senator from \nNew York made this evening before I discuss the amendment that is \nbefore us.\n  He has made the allegation that the special licensee we have created \nin our amendment for dealing with gun shows is somehow not going to \nhave to do background checks. Language in the bill says, referring to \nthe special licensee, ``shall conduct his activities in accordance with \nall dealer record keeping required under this chapter for a dealer.''\n  We go to that chapter, 18922, and he falls within that chapter, and \nthat is the requirement of the background check.\n  So it is our intent. We believe we have covered that intent.\n  Let the record show that is what we believe the law to be as we \nproposed it in this form.\n  I am happy to sit down with the Senator tonight or tomorrow, but I \nbelieve we have covered it adequately. There is no question of our \nintent here. It is not a loophole. The special licensee is a dealer. We \nput him into the dealer section with all other gun dealers. We will \nleave it at that for the evening.\n  Very briefly; I want to get out of here.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I don't blame the Senator. I appreciate the courtesy.\n  As I understand the special licensees, a background check would not \nbe required; rather, the section of the law would require only \ncertification.\n  Mr. CRAIG. That is not true. The licensee would become a dealer and \nfalls under the dealer section of the law, 922 paragraph T(1). Check it \nout, read it tonight, see if you don't agree with us. If you don't, we \nwill be happy to discuss it tomorrow.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Let me talk about the Internet for a moment.\n  Somehow in the last day and a half we have heard this marvelous new \nword ``loophole.'' Everything has a loophole in it. Somehow through a \nloophole we are cramming everything today. It is a great mantra. I \nthink Bill Clinton coined it in one of his phrases lately--handgun \ncontrol loophole. Tonight we have a loophole in the Internet. It is \ncalled ``beam me up a gun, Scotty,'' except the Senator from New York, \nbeing the remarkable fellow he is, has not pioneered Star Trek \ntechnology to deal with guns.\n  The Internet is an advertising medium. It is not a medium of \nexchange. You advertise on the Internet.\n  Now, I am not a very good Internet surfer, but I know I can't push a \nbutton and see a gun come out from the screen. The Senator from New \nYork knows it, too. In fact, he refers to Guns America Web Site. We \npulled it up while he was talking. This is what it said:\n\n       Please note, as a buyer you must first call the seller of \n     the gun, confirm price and availability, and arrange for an \n     FFL dealer in your State to receive shipment. Your FFL dealer \n     must send a copy of their license to the seller.\n\n  My point is quite simple: If you buy a gun on the Internet, it \nsomehow has to make contact with you.\n  He referenced a young fellow who acquired a gun on the Internet and \nhis mother intercepted it because a common carrier had brought it to \ntheir home. The common carrier violated the law. It is against the law \nin America today to send a gun through the U.S. mail or to allow one to \nbe transferred by common carrier to be delivered to a recipient.\n  I guess that is my point. He may not like the style of advertising or \nthe rhetoric around the advertising, but there has to be a point of \ncontact. How do you make the contact? How does the gun move from the \nseller to the buyer? Therein lies the issue here.\n  If I believed what is being said were true, I would be alarmed. I \ndon't think any of us want a gun show in our kiddie's bedrooms. It is \ngreat rhetoric tonight. The gun show isn't in the kiddie's bedroom. \nThere is advertising on the Internet. The child can access the \nInternet. The child can't touch the gun. He cannot receive the gun. And \nthe example that he applied was a violation of the Federal law. Again, \none of those laws that we stacked on the books and somehow \nsomebody slipped through it. That is what happens with laws some of the \ntime unless we have this huge web of law enforcement.\n\n  My guess is the common carrier is libel in this instance. I don't \nknow the total story, but I do know the gun got delivered to the home \nand it had to come through some form of common carrier. We believe that \nto be a violation of the law.\n  The impact of this amendment is to simply restrict gun sellers to \n19th century advertising technology. That is, newspapers and fliers.\n  On a more serious note, the amendment would be an extraordinary and \nunprecedented restriction on commercial speech. That is called a \nviolation of the first amendment.\n  I am not a constitutional lawyer and I am not going to debate that \nthis is a constitutional violation. But my guess, if it were to become \nlaw, it would rapidly get tested in the courts because I believe it \ncould be that.\n  Our laws have never required an advertising medium to become part of \nthe business that it advertises. For example, we don't require a \nnewspaper to get a State liquor license before carrying alcohol ads. \nBut in any event, that would be well beyond anything this Congress ever \ncontemplated.\n  In fact, Federal law confirms exactly the opposite: The Firearms \nOwners Protection Act, which became law in 1986, specifically confirms \nthe right of individuals to make occasional sales, exchanges, and/or \npurchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection, for \na hobby, or to sell all or part of a personal collection of firearms \nwithin their State or their residence.\n  I do not quite understand what the Senator from New York is talking \nabout tonight about expanding beyond the boundary of a State. Yes, the \nInternet is national; it is international. But for a gun owner in New \nYork to buy a\n\n[[Page S5256]]\n\ngun out of California would be interstate activity, and that would be \nagainst the current law. I think the Senator from New York knows that.\n  What we are suggesting in our amendment, because we do address the \nissue of Internet activities, this Congress would not want anything \nillegal going on in the Internet. If you use the Internet to offer a \nfirearm to a felon, and you know it, you broke the law. That is what we \nare saying. If your intent is to sell to anybody on the Internet and \nnot require the checking, you are breaking the law. That is what we \nwould say.\n  The Hatch-Craig amendment makes it a crime to knowingly solicit--that \nis what you are doing on the Internet, you are soliciting. You are not \ntransporting guns, you are not putting them in the hands of kids, you \nare soliciting--to knowingly solicit an illegal firearm transaction \nthrough the Internet. That is what we do.\n  We go a step forward and talk about explosive materials. There is a \nvery real concern on the Internet today about bombs--not material, \nbecause you can't transport it, again, but the diagrams to build a \nbomb. I am opposed to that, too. But at least you have to go out and \nacquire the material to build one because the Internet doesn't ``beam \nit through to your home, Scotty,'' nor does it beam the gun.\n  That is the reality. Our amendment is simple. We think it addresses \nthe issue. I hope our colleagues tomorrow would vote for the Hatch-\nCraig amendment that covers all of these issues very clearly, very \nsuccinctly.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will answer a few points of the Senator \nfrom Idaho and maybe we can engage in a dialog.\n  The Senator is wrong in one sense. The Internet does not just do \nadvertising. Some sites just do advertising, and if there were no \nefforts to transfer guns, we would agree.\n  How about when a web site offers guns and earns a fee when there is a \nsale? That is not an advertisement, it is a business. The more guns \nthey sell, the more the web site makes.\n  The second point I make, and this is the most important point, the \nSenator from Idaho got up and he said they give each other the name and \naddress, and it is their responsibility to contact a firearms dealer.\n  Say I am a 15-year-old and I want a gun, but I don't tell the seller \nthat I want it, and I don't contact the firearms dealer. What is to \nstop me from doing that? That is the point here.\n  Sure, in a perfect world, the Senator from Idaho would be right. But \nthen we wouldn't be debating a juvenile crime bill. The fact that there \nare criminals, young and old, means there are people who won't obey the \nlaw. All we are trying to do is make it easy for law enforcement or \neven possible for law enforcement to make sure people obey the law.\n  I guess I would ask my friend from Idaho if the 15-year-old has no \nintention of going through a licensed dealer, which is the law for an \nout-of-State sale, how do we stop him under present law? How do we stop \nhim from getting the gun? That is the problem.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will respond briefly. The hour is late.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. CRAIG. We can conduct more dialog on this tomorrow.\n  Under current law--in other words, we are talking about ``the law,'' \nnot a vacuum but the law, let me read what Guns America says: ``As a \nbuyer, you must first call a dealer.''\n  The reason you have to do that is the gun is transferred through the \ndealer, not through the mail. Because the 15-year-old cannot----\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask the Senator, what if he doesn't call the dealer?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Then he will not get the gun.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. They will still mail him the gun. They don't know he is \n15.\n  Mr. CRAIG. The U.S. Postal Service says it is illegal.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. But the U.S Postal Service doesn't open every package.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I can't dispute that. In other words, he broke a law.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. He got the gun.\n  Mr. CRAIG. But he broke a law. You are going to create another law to \nbe broken. Why don't we enforce the law we have?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Reclaiming my time----\n  Mr. CRAIG. You have it.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. The point is, the two gentlemen from Columbine High \nSchool broke the law. If we want to allow every kid to get a gun and we \ncan then, after they create havoc, say they broke the law, we are in \npretty sad shape.\n  What we want to do here is prevent them from getting guns. To simply \nsay a 15-year-old who purchases a gun on the Internet broke the law is \nnot very satisfying to most Americans. They want to stop them from \ngetting the gun, prevent him from getting the gun.\n  So I suggest there in a nutshell is the whole argument. The Senator \nfrom Idaho says, since the law prohibits interstate gun sales, we \nshould allow a 15-year-old who wants to violate the law to use the \nexact mechanism we have talked about, the Internet, to get that gun and \nthen after he gets the gun we go after him.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am going to have to ask the Senator to yield because \nthat is a very improper portrayal of what I just said. Be accurate, \nplease.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Let me just finish my point and then I will be delighted \nto allow the Senator to respond.\n  The 15-year-old wants to break the law, sends for the gun, gets the \ngun, and because the Postal Service is not going to open every package \nahead of time, there is nothing that prevents the 15-year-old from \ngetting the gun. In fact, the Postal Service has no way of knowing that \ngun is being shipped to an underage person. So they cannot even--there \nis not even a suspicion. Then, after that person gets the gun, we say \nthat person broke the law.\n  In fact, the only way we are going to know they broke the law is if \nthey use that gun for a bad purpose. If there was ever a situation of \nclosing the barn door after the cows got out of the barn, this is it.\n  I simply ask my colleague to rethink his opposition to this \nlegislation based on his own statement. He broke the law. How do we \nknow it? The only human way we can know it, that is humanly possible, \nis after the gun is used in a crime. If the Senator would like me to \nyield, I will. I do not have to if he does not want to respond. Please. \nIt is on my time.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will only comment this much further and then I am \nthrough for the evening. I have been sitting here adding up the laws \nthat your description broke. The seller has broken the law tonight by \nyour definition.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. No.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Absolutely, if he sold to a juvenile.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. The seller has no knowledge that the child is 15.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I think he says he wants the knowledge here.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. But the point is, if the child writes in ``25,'' there \nis no way the seller knows.\n  Mr. CRAIG. If he doesn't check it out, he broke the law.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. How is he going to check it out?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Because it is his responsibility as a dealer.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I submit, none of the dealers and none of the \nadvertisers on the Internet actually go check. If someone says they are \nabove 25----\n  Mr. CRAIG. It sounds like ATF isn't doing their job.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. It doesn't sound like that to me.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I counted that breaking the law. The juvenile is breaking \nthe law.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Clearly.\n  Mr. CRAIG. And the common carrier is probably breaking the law.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I don't think the common carrier did.\n  But, again, my point is a simple one. They are all breaking the law, \nand there is no way to find out. This is not a question for the ATF. \nThis is a question because the Senator would be one of the first if the \nATF started opening every package to see if there were guns and \nknocking on the door of every person who ordered a gun to see what age \nthey were, which is of course an absurd situation, we would all be in \nan outcry. So, to say that three people broke the law is not very \nsatisfying. To say that Klebold and Harris broke the law in Littleton \nis not very satisfying to the parents who are grieving their children.\n  By this simple piece of legislation, we might have stopped it. \nWithout impinging on anyone's rights, without\n\n[[Page S5257]]\n\nchanging anything else, we might have stopped it.\n  With that, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Has all time been yielded back?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Amendment No. 329 more than any other we \nhave seen so far cobbles together a number of proposals that have been \naround for a long time. Let me start with the NIH study, the $2 million \nstudy required by the amendment.\n  I am concerned that this amendment singles out only a few potential \ninfluences on teen behavior. A better approach, in my view, would be to \nstudy all factors--the role of parents and schools, the existence of \ncounseling and guidance efforts, the alienation of young from their \npeers, and media influences, among other things.\n  The President has called on the Surgeon General to conduct just that \ntype of review. Perhaps we should include the NIH and other experts in \nthe Surgeon General study which is now underway.\n  In our rush to respond to very real tragedies, we should take care to \nstudy all the factors, and to seek solutions that won't trample the \nFirst Amendment. To artificially limit the NIH study to only media \ninfluences may not be proper scientific design. The role of parents \nmust be considered. Bad parenting can have devastating effects on the \nbehavior of children. Just ask the child in an alcoholic family, or in \na family where there is spouse abuse, or worse.\n  I am also concerned about the two sets of antitrust exemptions being \nproposed in this amendment.\n  I have spent a good deal of effort over the past several years \nworking to eliminate unjustified antitrust exemptions from the law. The \nbaseball antitrust amendment comes to mind as one that the Chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee and I worked on together for years until we \nfinally succeeded last year.\n  Do we have the views of the Department of Justice Antitrust Division \non either of these proposed antitrust exemptions?\n  Last time I examined this issue was when the Assistant Attorney \nGeneral for Antitrust clarified that it would not violate the antitrust \nlaws of television stations to agree on guidelines and viewer \nadvisories to reduce the negative impact of violence on television. \nThat was 1994. It was not illegal now. So, I do not understand the need \nfor antitrust exemptions.\n  My fear is that any such exemption might be abused and used to \nimmunize anti-competitive conduct to the detriment of consumers viewers \nand other companies in and around the entertainment industries.\n  I note that one of the exemptions tries at least to protect against \nlegalizing group boycotts. Whether that language succeeds, I cannot \ntell as I read it here on the floor. But I do know that the language \napplies to only one of the two exemptions and does not reach all \nanticompetitive conduct.\n  Does that create the implication that boycotts are an acceptable way \nto ``enforce'' rules or act anti-competitively? The language mandates \nenforcement but does not say how.\n  Senators Brownback and Hatch had initially provided me with two very \ndifferent amendments, and I assumed that the fight would have been over \nwhich amendment would win over the other--since they are inconsistent.\n  It never occurred to me that they would simply slap them together \ninto one inconsistent mass which will be impossible to interpret.\n  The combined amendment that passed yesterday has major flaws. It \ndefines the Internet in a way that could have major unintended effects \non other laws.\n  It hugely denigrates the role of parents--essentially the amendment \nconsiders parents almost irrelevant to the development of children into \nyoung adults. It blames most of the social problems of children on \ntelevision, movies and music--an easy target even in the face of \nfalling national crime statistics.\n  Television programming and movie content is a tempting subject for \ndemagoguery. It is much harder to deal with issues such as bad \nparenting and lack of parental supervision because then we can only \nblame ourselves.\n  Contrary to the findings in the amendment, there is no substitute for \nparental involvement in the raising of our children.\n  I am also very nervous about involving government in the day-to-day \nregulation of the content of television shows or movies and other forms \nof speech. I do not see how the government can step into the shoes of \nparents.\n  The Supreme Court has noted that ``laws regulating speech for the \nprotection of children have no limiting principle, and a well-\nintentioned law restricting protected speech on the basis of content \nis, nevertheless, state-sponsored censorship.''\n  Movies such as ``Saving Private Ryan'' or ``Schindler's List'' are \nviolent. I admit it. But I do not think that such films should be \ndiscouraged because of any government enforced content standards.\n  If this amendment were voluntary we, of course, would not need to \npass it since the entertainment industry leaders can already work \ntogether to develop guidelines, standards, ratings and label warnings. \nThat is why I worked out a deal, and signed a dear colleague letter, \nwith Senators Hatch, Lott, Daschle, McCain and others in July of 1997.\n  We agreed, based on clear guidance from the Justice Department, that \nentertainment industry leaders could meet to work out these guidelines \nand standards and that there would be no antitrust concerns.\n  Antitrust laws permit meeting to work out voluntary guidelines.\n  This slapped-together amendment goes way beyond that understanding.\n  Letters dated January 25, 1994, January 7, 1994, and November 29, \n1993, from the Justice Department make it clear that industry leaders \ncan work together to establish guidelines regarding violence in \nprogramming and movies.\n  One bedrock principle of our democratic government and one of the \nbasic protections of freedoms to enjoy as Americans is the First \nAmendment's guarantee that the government will keep itself out of the \nregulation of speech.\n  When the Constitution says that ``Congress shall make no law * * * \nabridging the freedom of speech,'' I believe it means what it says. \nThat provision ought to be respected until it is repealed which I hope \nnever, never, happens.\n  For years there have been crusades against the content of books and \nmovies but government enforcement is not the answer--where do you draw \nthe line?\n  This goes back to the old joke about a conference of ministers of \ndifferent faiths getting together and trying to start the meetings. \nThey could never agree on the opening prayer so that had to cancel the \nconference.\n  I know that some have fond memories of the days of content regulation \nwhen only separate beds could be shown on shows like Dick Van Dyke. One \nof the findings fondly looks back at these standards stating from page \n6 of the amendment that ``The portrayal of implied sexual acts must be \nessential to the plot and presented in a responsible and tasteful \nmanner.'' What is ``essential to the plot'' and who decides that \nquestion? What is ``tasteful'' and should the government decide that?\n  National crime statistics show crime has declined in recent years. I \nknow that Mayor Giuliani keeps talking about that reduction in crime. \nWhat does this drop in crime statistics mean in terms of this \namendment?\n  Section 505 of the amendment allows for the ``enforcement'' of \nguidelines ``designed to ensure compliance'' with ratings and labeling \nsystems. When you use words such as ``enforcement'' and ``designed to \nensure compliance'' that does not sound voluntary to me. I hope that we \ntake more time in conference to read this amendment and consider the \npossible problems posed by its language.\n  I know some want to permit government enforcement of vague standards \non the content of TV shows and movies. No one will know what is allowed \nand what isn't allowed. That is chilling, it violates the Constitution, \nand it relegates the role of parents to mere observers.\n\n[[Page S5258]]\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, on April 20, 1999 two Columbine High \nSchool students in Littleton, Colorado, swept into that school with \nsawed-off shotguns, one pistol, one semiautomatic rifle, and as many as \n60 homemade pipe bombs. Before they turned their guns on themselves, \nthey killed 12 fellow students and 1 teacher and wounded 21 others. In \ndoing so, they violated 17 separate federal and Colorado state Statutes \nrelating to guns and explosive devices, not to mention a host of \ncriminal laws criminalizing their assaults and murders.\n  In a justified aftermath of horror and revulsion, wide-ranging public \nopinions across the United States demands that the federal government \ndo SOMETHING, anything, to make this violence go away. The most \nprominent call is for more gun laws, many of which raise serious \nconstitutional questions under the 2nd Amendment.\n  Other attack Hollywood and the Internet for the pervasive violence in \nmovies, music and the Internet, all easily available to the most \nimpressionable of our teenagers. Any controls of this nature clearly \nrun afoul of the 1st Amendment.\n  Others blame parents, the lax law enforcement and the schools \nthemselves. Few, curiously enough, recognize the reality of an evil \nthat lurks in the minds of at least a handful of human beings and is \nclearly beyond the ability of any law to control.\n  It would be wonderful if we could just pass a law through Congress, \nanother gun control measure or another limitation on free speech that \ncould prevent another Littleton, Colorado, or Jonesboro, Arkansas. But \nwho, in the calm aftermath of this tragedy, believes that two or three \nmore gun laws, in addition to the dozen and a half violated by the two \nColorado teenagers, would have made the slightest difference in \nLittleton?\n  The perpetrators of this violence were far beyond caring about \nadhering to human laws. They were bent on killing. The arena in which \nto reach and stop this evil is not Congress. It is in those places \nwhere the human heart can be touched; the home, the community and the \nchurch, and in the humility to recognize that no human efforts will \never eliminate all evil from human hearts.\n  My children were in high school 25 years ago and I am struck by the \nthought that this kind of extreme violence involving school kids did \nnot happen in America then and in my own high school years more people \nmay have owned guns than do so today. I can't help but ask: What has \nchanged? Why does this happen now?\n  The Senate has begun a debate of a Juvenile Justice bill that will \nserve as a vehicle for a number of amendments relating to guns and \nexplosives. At least eight different such proposals were submitted to \nCongress by President Clinton in the wake of the Littleton tragedy. \nThis is the same President whose budget, bloated in so many other \nrespects, makes drastic cuts in the field of effective law enforcement \nassistance. This year, for example, over President Clinton's objection, \nCongress will continue to fund a Byrne Grant program--a program that \nencourages cooperative drug enforcement and treatment mechanisms across \nthe country and in my State of Washington. Last year Washington State \nreceived $10 million in Byrne Grants, without which our law enforcement \nofficials would find it next to impossible to combat the biggest drug \nproblem in our state--meth labs. Despite this success, the President \nproposes drastic cuts in this successful program.\n  Clinton's budget also zeroes out funding for a huge law enforcement \nprogram--the Local Law Enforcement Block Grant and the Violent Offender \nIncarceration and Truth in Sentencing Incentive Grants, which \nWashington state uses to help fund prison construction, was gutted in \nClinton's budget--from $772.5 million in FY 1999 to $75 million in FY \n2000.\n  Far better to fund anti-crime programs that have proven to be \nsuccessful than to ignore those successes and substitute new statutes \non the backs of statutes that have been unsuccessful in attaining their \nown goals. Why not enforce the gun laws we already have than add new \nones to those the Administration ignores?\n  Let me make a point clearly here--I thrive on working as an elected \nofficial because I believe that sensible actions by government can have \na positive impact on the lives of families and communities across \nAmerica.\n  One positive role for government is in promoting a safer society. As \nWashington State Attorney General and now as Senator, I have supported \nlaws to make safer products for consumers including safe food, clothes, \ncars and highways. I have worked nearly every day in the last three \nyears on the issue of school safety to change federal rules to give \nmore flexibility to local school districts to expel violent students. \nIndividuals in our society cannot assure a safe food supply or safe \nproducts or safe roads, so taking sensible steps to make lives safer is \na proper function of government.\n  Still, I am convince that more laws would not have prevented what \nhappened in Littleton and, what is more important as we look forward--I \nbelieve that it is dangerous to promote legislation as a solution. What \nis wrong with the President's gun law proposal and any other \nlegislation promoted under the banner of stopping violence? They are \nwrong because they are a mirage. We are repulsed by violence and the \nmirage of a federal government's answer to violence raises false hopes. \nThe false hope that violence will be stopped by new federal laws is \nalso wrong because it detracts attention from the need to fix what is \nwrong in individual families and communities the need to concentrate on \nthose sick elements in our nation that promote violence and disrespect \nfor life. This violence stemmed from an evil that found fertile ground \nin the hearts of two impressionable boys in Colorado and another \nfederal law will not eradicate that evil.\n\n  There are things that government can do to make our society safer, \nincluding making our schools safer, and we have already passed one \namendment to just that end, but the scope of evil which showed its face \nin Littleton is beyond the reach of government action. Controlling \nviolence of this scope will come when people care more for each other \nand I, for one, will not join in any chorus of politicians promising \nthat government will make that happen.\n  I know that there are people of goodwill who disagree with me. They \nwant so desperately to do something about this horrible event. I \nunderstand that desire. If I agreed, I would have already introduced \nlegislation. But I believe that actions closer to home are far more \nlikely to be successful. I know that this is a radical concept, but \nmost of what is good about America is not made so by federal \nlegislation. People across our country are searching their hearts and \ntheir communities for answers. In hundreds of local papers you can see \nthat nearly every school district in America has already called \ntogether teachers, parents and community members to see what can be \ndone locally. Local people in their churches of all denominations are \ngetting together to see how they can do more to reach kids in trouble. \nAnd every parent in America has considered carefully whether his or her \nchildren are at risk of committing violence.\n  We should allow this process of national soul searching to continue. \nIf out of this process positive actions for the federal government \nemerge we should respond, but we should not hold not immediate federal \naction as false hope in place of the real actions and changes that will \ntake place in communities, homes and schools across America.\n  It is difficult in this body to face the fact that we don't really \nneed new laws as much as we need the enforcement of the laws we already \nhave. Even more important than that, however, is a thorough examination \nof the culture of violence in our society and a broad base societal \ndemand that those who profit from that violence, in the media and \nelsewhere, be brought to show more responsibility and more restraint.\n  I am concerned that the underlying Juvenile Justice bill suffers from \nthe same defects. While it includes a few good ideas, it is another \nexample of Washington, DC knows best. It spends money we don't have and \ntells every state and local government that we here in Washington, DC, \nknow more about juvenile justice than those who spend their lives on \nthe subject do.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, my friend from Utah attacked the motion \npicture\n\n[[Page S5259]]\n\ntheater industry yesterday for not enforcing their voluntary rating \nsystem. Though no system, voluntary or mandatory, can every be perfect, \nthe fact is that the exhibition industry is doing an increasingly \nbetter job enforcing those movie ratings.\n  The National Association of Theater Owners, the industry trade \nassociation, and its members have made ratings enforcement a top \npriority. The association has developed a videotape training series on \nthe ratings and their enforcement for theater managers and employees.\n  It has distributed hundreds of thousands of brochures through \ntheaters to the public which explains the rating system.\n  It has published weekly bulletins to its members and newspapers on \nnew ratings.\n  It has published educational articles for its members, and it has \nheld industry-wide meetings twice a year in which code enforcement is \nemphasized.\n  Recently, the Motion Picture Association and the National Association \nof Theater Owners began developing slide presentations for display \nduring intermissions about the ratings.\n  The motion picture theater industry may be the only industry in the \ncountry which voluntarily turns down millions of dollars in ticket \nsales to enforce a voluntary rating system. We should all encourage the \nindustry to do more. But in our rush to judgement, let us remember to \nconsider the facts.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to lend my voice in support of \nthe juvenile justice bill currently before the Senate. This is an \nextensive, thoughtful approach to try to decrease the juvenile crime \nrate and to try to intervene in today's high-risk youth.\n  I stand before you to tell you that this is not only an urban \nproblem. In our largest city, Billings, we have about 80,000 people, \nsmall by most States' standards. However, we also have gangs. Size and \ncloseness of community doesn't innoculate us from the effects of our \nsociety. Even our tribal population is affected by juvenile crime. \nYouth on our reservations are being solicited for gang enrollment at \nincreasingly earlier ages. From Billings to Fort Belknap, from Helena \nto Havre, from Gallatin to Glasgow to Great Falls, no area of the state \nis immune from the problem of juvenile delinquency. This bill finally \ntries to provide a focused approach to both reach today's youth and to \nprosecute violent criminals.\n  I would like to say that I agree and support all provisions of this \nbill. However, like most major legislation, there are some minor issues \nthat cause me concern. But what we are really trying to do here is to \nintervene early in a youth's criminal career. By stopping the spree \nearly, we prevent a lifetime of crime and create a contributing member \nof society.\n  Let me highlight why this bill is so drastically different from any \nprevious juvenile justice legislation. First and foremost, this bill \nestablishes a $450 million block grant program for state and local \ngovernments to establish youth violence programs. This almost doubles \nthe FY 99 spending in equivalent programs. These funds can be used for \nrecord keeping, detention facilities, restitution programs, anti-\ntruancy programs, gang intervention, crime training programs, and \nvocational training. In addition, it encourages the establishment of \nprograms that will punish adults who knowingly use juveniles to help \ncommit crimes. This is a key provision, since often adults will use \nkids in crime specifically because they are exempt from some of the \nstiffer penalties that apply to adults.\n  I have long been a proponent of enforcing existing laws. Right now, \nthere is little additional penalty for repeat juvenile offenders. This \nlaw provides for graduated penalties to put some real teeth into law \nenforcement. There is also a juvenile version of the ``Brady bill,'' \nwhich prevents a person convicted of a violent felon of possessing a \nfirearm.\n  Overall, this bill provides $1 billion specifically for juvenile \ncrime programs. It covers everything from education to intervention. \nThis comprehensive package will make significant strides in trying to \nkeep our most precious commodity, our youth, out of harms way. I will \nbe casting my vote in favor of this bill, and I encourage my colleagues \nto do the same.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/13/senate-section/article/S5259-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Mr. President, Admiral Bud Nance, the Staff Director of \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee, passed away earlier this week \nand I rise to pay tribute to him and the service he rendered the \nnation.\n  Few others amassed the impressive record of public service that Bud \ndid. He served the United States during times of war and during times \nof peace, and none can challenge that he was a man who loved the nation \nand who worked to protect her interests, security, and most \nimportantly, citizens.\n  Born 77-years-ago in the ``Tarheel State'', Bud Nance became involved \nin public service at an early age, attending and graduating from the \nUnited States Naval Academy. It was 1944 when Bud Nance became an \nensign, and World War II was still a year away from ending, so the \nyoung officer was posted to the Battleship North Carolina where he \nbegan what was to be a long and illustrious career. Though many would \npoint to his achieving the rank of Rear Admiral as a demonstration of \nhis abilities as an officer, I would counter that it was his command of \nthe aircraft carrier USS Forrestal that serves as the best illustration \nof his professionalism and abilities as a sailor and leader. Simply \nput, there are few more coveted or more selectively assigned duties \nthan that of captain of a carrier.\n  I am sure that when Bud stowed his seabag at the end of his final \ntour and retired from the Navy, he thought his days of hard work, low \npay, and government service were behind him. Nothing could be further \nfrom the truth. As is common with all those who enter public service, \neven more so with the World War II generation, devotion to duty and a \ndesire to make a difference was at the core of what made Bud Nance \n``tick''. I doubt that he hesitated for a moment when Senator Helms \ncalled him in 1991 and asked him to become the ``skipper'' of the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee.\n  For the past eight-years, Bud Nance has worked tirelessly to promote \nAmerican foreign policy and he made many important and significant \ncontributions to international relations during his tenure as the staff \ndirector of the Foreign Relations Committee. Bud, more than most, \nunderstood that the policy and directives that emanate from Congress \ncan have a powerful impact on the world beyond the Beltway. He knew \nfrom firsthand experience that there is a tremendous difference in how \nthe world looks from the Senate Chamber and a foxhole in some remote \npart of the world. The advice and guidance that Bud gave Senator Helms \nand other members of the Foreign Relations Committee was based on a \nlifetime of experience and a world view that was unique and insightful.\n  Bud leaves behind many who cared for and admired this man, not the \nleast of whom is his widow, Mary. I know that each of us sends our \ndeepest condolences to her, as well as the children and grandchildren \nof the Nances, for their loss.\n  Mr. President, with the passing of Admiral Bud Nance, the Senate has \nlost a dedicated and selfless staffer, the nation has lost a true \npatriot, and many of us--especially Jesse Helms--have lost a good \nfriend. I join my friend from North Carolina in mourning this man, and \nI wish Admiral James ``Bud'' Nance fair winds and following seas on his \nfinal voyage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/13/senate-section/article/S5259-3", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5259-S5260]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      IN MEMORY OF MEG GREENFIELD\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, Meg Greenfield has just passed away.\n  On behalf of all colleagues in the Senate, our hearts go out to the \nfamily, to all of those who were so close to Meg over these years. \nThere are few giants in journalism who have the standing stature and \nthe extraordinary influence that Meg Greenfield has had through the \nyears.\n\n[[Page S5260]]\n\n  Her contribution to journalism has been legendary. Her contribution \nto her country through journalism has been extraordinary. It has been \nour good fortune to follow her leadership in journalism, to be guided \nby her wisdom, and certainly to be influenced by her good judgment on \nmany, many occasions over these extraordinary decades which she has \nbeen involved.\n  I express my condolences to her family and say farewell to someone \nwho has made an extraordinary impact on our country and on her \nprofession.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to join with Senator Daschle in \nexpressing our heartfelt thoughts to the members of her family. Meg \nGreenfield put up an extraordinary fight against cancer for a very long \nperiod of time and did so with incredible bravery and extraordinary \nelegance, style, and class.\n  For the past two decades, she was the editor of the editorial page at \nThe Washington Post, and in her long and brilliant career, the \neditorial page set an unsurpassed standard of excellence on all the \ngreat issues of the day in the nation's foreign and domestic policy.\n  She earned a Pulitzer Prize and many other honors during her \noutstanding career. For a quarter century, her extraordinary columns in \nNewsweek Magazine were a consistent voice of insight and reason that we \nlooked forward to and learned from.\n  I had the opportunity to visit her just about 2 weeks ago. She was \nalways immensely understanding and respectful of the political process. \nShe admired those who were part of the political process in the finest \nsense, and believed that those who were really committed to public life \ncould make a difference in our society.\n  She was a hopeful, idealistic person who wrote with great clarity, \ngreat eloquence, and great passion about the state of our nation. She \nestablished a high standard by which political leaders of both parties \ncould try to measure themselves.\n  She made an extraordinary difference with her life. She had scores of \nfriends and was highly regarded and respected in her business. To those \nwho knew her and respected her, she was a giant in the writing press. A \ngraduate of Smith College, Meg Greenfield became one of the greatest \nwomen and greatest journalists or our time, and we will miss her very \nmuch.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, my colleagues have spoken about Meg \nGreenfield. I also want to echo their sentiments.\n  I think what was most amazing about her was not just her great \ntalent, her ability to write, her extraordinary breadth of knowledge \nand interest, but to watch her, especially in the last few months, when \nravaged by disease, she continued that same interest. She continued her \nwork.\n  When you spoke with her or saw her, she never spoke about her own \nillness; she spoke of her interest in others. I have never once during \nher long illness heard her complain about her illness, but rather she \nwould talk of others.\n  This was an extraordinary woman who left much earlier than she should \nhave left this Earth, but she left behind a legacy of the truest of \nprofessionalism and one that will be missed.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, let me say a few words also about Meg \nGreenfield. This was an extraordinary journalist, an extraordinary \nperson, a person who anybody would have to look up to.\n  I remember as a young conservative meeting with her. She was fair and \ndecent to me. It just about meant everything to me that she would take \ntime to discuss some of the great issues of the day with me.\n  I have inestimable respect for her. My sympathy and the sympathy of \nmy wife Elaine goes out to her family. They have real reason to be very \nproud of her. She set standards of journalism that were very high. What \npleased me is that even though I know she disagreed with me on a number \nof issues, she was very fair, very frank, and very decent when we \ndiscussed them. She went out of her way to make me feel welcomed.\n  Whether you agree or disagree with the Washington Post--I personally \nbelieve it is one of the greatest newspapers in America--for her to \nrise to the pinnacle of her profession in that great newspaper and to \nmake sure that the editorial page and other aspects she worked with in \nthe Washington Post were done with integrity and decency always \nimpressed me.\n  We will miss her. Our love and affection and hearts go out to the \nfamily. She deserves the respect of everybody in this body, and, \nfrankly, many, many, more throughout the country.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, our sympathies go out to the family of \nMeg Greenfield. She was, indeed, an extraordinary person, a thoughtful \nand brilliant writer and reporter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/13/senate-section/article/S5260-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5260]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, South Carolina recently lost one of its \nmost prominent citizens, Holly Self Drummond, who was known and admired \nby many throughout the Palmetto State.\n  ``Miss Holly'' passed away at the age of 77, and though she led a \nfull life, her death still came too soon. Each of us who knew Holly \nDrummond remember her as a vibrant, outgoing, and gracious lady who was \na pillar of her community and an individual who embodied all that is \ngood about the South.\n  This was a woman who distinguished herself in many ways throughout \nher life. She was active in any number of organizations that made her \ncommunity and our State better places to live. She served as a member \nof the South Carolina Palmetto Cabinet; the Greenwood Woman's Club; the \nSasanqua Garden Club of Ninety Six; and, on the Board of Visitors of \nWinthrop University and Piedmont Technical College. She was also active \nin her local church, and of course, was a fixture at the State House \nwhere her able husband has served for many years. Her contributions \ntruly benefited others and served as an example of civic mindedness \nthat others strove to emulate.\n  Holly Drummond's passing is saddening for many reasons. My grief is \ndeepened for this woman was a loyal supporter, and more importantly, a \nvalued friend. I had known Holly for more years than I can remember, \nand her family was well known to me.\n  Mr. President, Holly Self Drummond's passing leaves a tremendous void \nnot only in the town of Greenwood and the State House of South \nCarolina, but in the lives of the many men and women who called her \n``friend.'' Holly Drummond will not soon be forgotten, and I am certain \nthat all those who knew her would join me in sending condolences to her \nfamily.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/13/senate-section/article/S5260-3", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5260-S5261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      DERAILING NBC'S ATOMIC TRAIN\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, scare tactics may boost your ratings, but \nthey won't do much for your credibility--especially when you advertise \nfiction as fact. This weekend, NBC will air a miniseries that is so far \nfrom plausible it is indeed laughable. The plot for this hyped up film \nrevolves around a horrifying nuclear accident stemming from the \ntransportation of nuclear weapons and hazardous waste on a train from \nCalifornia to Idaho.\n\n[[Page S5261]]\n\n  Could this really happen, as the network originally advertised? \nShould you be staying up late at night to worry if your daily commute \nwill include a rendezvous with spilled nuclear waste and Rob Lowe? \nUnfortunately, this movie only perpetuates Hollywood's warped depiction \nof all things nuclear. Because of past hype, Americans envision nuclear \nwaste as a glowing green mass causing human and environmental meltdown \non contact--not unlike the demise of the Wicked Witch of the West in \nthe The Wizard of Oz. However, nothing could be farther from the truth.\n  If and when Hollywood comes out with another ``scary'' nuclear waste \nfilm, they might remember a few lessons NBC forgot. First of all, \nnuclear weapons are not transported by train, nor are they ever armed \nen route. They are moved by specially crafted 18-wheelers with the \nlatest security and safety technologies and armed Federal agents. Even \nif an accident should occur, U.S. nuclear weapons are all designed to \nsurvive without detonation if jolted or engulfed in flames.\n  The plot of Atomic Train originally depicted the mutual \ntransportation of both a nuclear weapon and nuclear waste, but NBC has \nchanged any references to nuclear waste in the movie to ``hazardous'' \nwaste. Wrong again. Federal regulations prohibit hazardous waste and \nnuclear waste from traveling along with nuclear weapons.\n  Secondly, nuclear waste is not green, glowing, or horrific to look at \nand great care is taken in its transportation. Spent nuclear fuel is \nsolid, irradiated uranium oxide pellets encased in metal tubes and is \nnon-explosive. It is transported in metal casks which will survive \nearthquakes, train collision and derailment, highway accident or fire.\n  To give credit where credit is due, the movie's trailer was right on \none count--nuclear waste is transported far more frequently than most \nAmericans realize. This is because the threat to both public and \nenvironmental health has been minimized by stringent safety protocols \nand close to 34 years of fine tuning. The possibility of radioactive \nmaterials harming the public en route is slim to none. Since 1965, more \nthan 2,500 shipments of spent nuclear fuel have been transported safely \nthroughout the U.S. without injury or environmental consequences from \nradioactive materials. That's a pretty good track record to go on.\n  Materials contaminated by radiation are also transported across the \ncountry. In fact, the first shipment of transuranic nuclear waste was \nsafely and uneventfully transported from Idaho's own National \nEngineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) to the Waste Isolation \nPilot Plant (WIPP) in Carlsbad, New Mexico last month. It was carried \nin DOE certified containers and tracked by satellite during the 1,400 \nmile trip. The Western Governors Association worked for years to \ndevelop the safest route possible and notify all emergency responders \nof shipment dates, routes, and even parking areas. Such shipments will \nbecome a routine matter in the years ahead.\n  INEEL celebrates its 50th Anniversary this year, and was the \nbirthplace of harnessing the atom for electrical generation. Close to \ntwenty percent of our electricity comes from nuclear energy, and \nremains one of the safest energy sources our country has available. \nYes, nuclear waste requires special handling and precautions, but so do \nall of the chemical and industrial waste byproducts of our vibrant \neconomy.\n  Due to the outcry over NBC's, ``this could really happen,'' trailer, \nthe broadcasting company has made the wise decision to pull the ads, \nmake last minute script changes to fix some of the more blatant \ninaccuracies, and post a disclaimer at the beginning of the movie. Yes, \nthis is a piece of fiction, and it is predictable that Hollywood would \nstray far from the truth, but it is downright irresponsible of the \nnetwork to create mass hysteria to boost ratings. I can only hope that \nfuture films will promote a more intelligent plot line.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/13/senate-section/article/S5261-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5261-S5262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              PROMOTING HEALTH IN RURAL AREAS ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of S.980, the \n``Promoting Health in Rural Areas Act of 1999,'' which my colleagues \nand I on the Senate Rural Health Caucus introduced on May 6,1999.\n  There is no single issue that unites rural Americans more than access \nto quality health care. It is one of the most important components of \ngood quality of life in rural areas. The ability to receive high \nquality health care keeps people in and attracts them to small towns. \nGood health care services in a community can be both a source of great \npride and security and many times local hospitals are a community's \nlargest employer.\n  But some of that security is being threatened. Access to health care \nin rural areas can be problematic. Distances are greater. Some \nhospitals have closed. There are fewer choices of health plans than in \nurban areas. The ``Promoting Health in Rural Areas Act of 1999'' will \nhelp to improve access for rural citizens, increase payments to \nproviders in rural areas, and bring innovative technologies to rural \nareas.\n  Approximately 20 percent of the nation's population, or more than 50 \nmillion people, live in rural America. However, the rural population is \ndisproportionately poor, experiences significantly higher rates of \nchronic illness and disability, and is aging faster than the nation as \na whole. In rural areas, the elderly account for 18% of the population.\n  Poverty is more widespread in rural areas and in 1995 the poverty \nrate was 15.6% there. Poverty was especially high in minorities--\naffecting 35% of rural African Americans and 31% of rural Hispanics. \n22.4% of rural children live in poverty.\n  Health insurance coverage is also a problem. In 1996, only 53.7% of \nresidents in rural areas had private health insurance and in 1996 about \n10.5 million rural residents were uninsured. Medicare beneficiaries are \nmore likely than the general population to reside in rural areas. \nMedicare spends less on rural beneficiaries than on urban beneficiaries \nand Medicaid covered only 45% of the rural poor. The government has a \nresponsibility to rural communities and a responsibility to support the \nsafety net upon which so many rural communities depend.\n  Before coming to the Senate, I was a heart-lung transplant surgeon. \nIn that capacity, much of my time was spent working with rural health \ncare providers who were caring for trauma victims eligible for organ \ndonation. I spent many late nights flying to remote areas to harvest \norgans for transplantation elsewhere in the country. In this situation, \nI entered into their communities and worked side-by-side with rural \nhospitals, and their physicians, nurses, and other health \nprofessionals. These providers do an excellent job. However they work \nunder very difficult conditions and require special attention to their \nparticular needs.\n  To address the unique attributes of the health needs of the rural \nareas of America, I joined my colleagues in introducing this important \nlegislation. The Promoting Health in Rural Areas Act of 1999 contains a \nnumber of provisions designed to enhance rural health.\n  There are provisions in the legislation to assist rural hospitals. \nFor example, our bill reinstates the Medicare Dependent Hospital \nprogram which expired last year. This special designation directs \nspecial Medicare payments to eligible hospitals. Medicare Dependent \nHospitals include rural hospitals that are not Sole Community \nHospitals, have 100 or fewer beds, and at least 60% Medicare patient \ndischarges or days. The bill also protects the Sole Community Hospitals \nprogram which aids hospitals in remote areas that serve as the sole \nhospital in an area.\n  There are also provisions to expand wage index reclassification. This \nmeans that hospitals in areas that are classified as rural can apply to \nuse an urban wage index if they can show that their wages are similar \nto prevailing wages in urban areas. The provision would also direct the \nHealth Care Financing Agency (HCFA) to establish separate wage indices \nfor home health agencies and skilled nursing facilities so that their \npayments will be fairer and more accurate.\n  This bill would exclude Critical Access Hospitals, Medicare Dependent \nHospitals, and Sole Community Hospitals from the new Medicare \noutpatient prospective payment system (PPS) when it is implemented. The \nHCFA analysis has shown that these primarily small, rural hospitals \nwould\n\n[[Page S5262]]\n\nbe disproportionately impacted by the outpatient PPS as proposed.\n  The bill would improve Medicare payments to rural health clinics and \nallow HCFA to institute a prospective payment system. Medicare \ncurrently pays Rural Health Clinics for their reasonable costs up to a \nper-encounter cap of $60.40. The equivalent cap for Federally Qualified \nHealth Center services, which was set using more recent data and a \ndifferent methodology, is significantly higher ($80.62). S. 980 updates \nthe methodology used to calculate the per-encounter cap, which will \nimprove payments to rural health clinics.\n  There are provisions in the legislation to enhance choice of health \nplans in rural areas. The payment formula for Medicare+Choice plans, as \nrevised in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA), contains substantial \nchanges designed to lessen the variance in payments to health plans \namong geographic areas over time. Today, Medicare payments vary county \nto county by more than 350% because they had been tied to historical \ncharges. This is not a true reflection of the cost of delivering health \ncare and in fact penalizes rural areas with historically poor access to \nquality care. Therefore, S.980 adjusts the payment formulas for \nMedicare+Choice plans to help rural areas attract private health plans.\n  Attracting health professionals to rural areas, and having them \nremain in the those communities, has been an ongoing problem. But \naccess to high quality medical care is improved when there is an \nadequate supply of practitioners who remain in the community. S. 980 \nimproves the likelihood of attracting and retaining health care \nprofessionals in rural areas. S. 980 increases payments to \npractitioners serving in Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs) and \nassists rural communities with recruiting efforts. Specifically a 10% \nbonus will be paid to physician assistants and nurse practitioners for \noutpatient services provided in these areas. Our bill also assists with \nrecruitment of health professionals to serve rural areas. Currently a \ncommunity is not allowed to recruit and hire a practitioner until the \none being replaced has left. No longer would a community have to lose \nthe practitioner, before the recruitment process could begin. In \naddition, tuition benefits provided as scholarships through the \nNational Health Service Corps, would not be treated as taxable income. \nThese changes help ensure that trained health care professionals are \naccessible to seniors and individuals with disabilities living in rural \nareas.\n  The bill also makes changes to assist with training of physicians in \nrural hospitals. S.980 would allow rural hospitals to get credit for \nresidents who spend time training outside a hospital and in rural \nhealth clinics. It would also allow hospitals with only one residency \nprogram to add up to three residents to their limit. BBA froze the \nreimbursement for residents at 1996 levels. This was detrimental to \nrural areas. These changes will allow for the training of more \nphysicians in rural areas\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that S. 980 would enhance telemedicine \nand telehealth. Under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Medicare has \nbegun to pay for telemedicine consultations for patients living in \nrural areas that are designated as Health Professional Shortage Areas \n(HPSAs). The Promoting Health in Rural Areas Act would: (1) allow \nanything currently covered by Medicare to be reimbursed; (2) expand \neligibility for telemedicine reimbursement to include all rural areas; \nand (3) state definitively that the referring physician need not be \npresent at the time of the telehealth service, and clarify that any \nhealth care practitioner, acting on instructions from the referring \nphysician or practitioner, may present the patient to the consulting \nphysician.\n  In addition, the bill would formally authorize an existing group of \nCabinet level and private sector members and instruct them to focus on \nidentifying, monitoring, and coordinating federal telehealth projects. \nThe provisions also authorize the development a grant/loan program for \ntelemedicine activities in rural areas.\n  Mr. President, this bill was developed by the Senate Rural Health \nCaucus, of which I am a member. I am proud of the provisions directed \ntowards rural health care providers and the benefits they will have for \nthe citizens of rural communities.\n  This bill sends a strong message to rural America: Washington cares \nabout your problems and wants to help ensure access to quality health \ncare. This is accomplished by strengthening the Medicare program and by \nmaking the newest technology available to rural areas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/13/senate-section/article/S5262-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/13/senate-section/article/S5262-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   REPORT OF THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF BUILDING \n    SCIENCES FOR FISCAL YEAR 1997--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 28\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  In accordance with the requirements of section 809 of the Housing and \nCommunity Development Act of 1974, as amended (12 U.S.C. 1701j-2(j)), I \ntransmit herewith the annual report of the National Institute of \nBuilding Sciences for fiscal year 1997.\n                                                  William J.

UNDERSTANDINGS.\n\n       The Senate's advice and consent to the ratification of the \n     Amended Mines Protocol is subject to the following \n     understandings, which shall be included in the United States \n     instrument of ratification and shall be binding upon the \n     President:\n       (1) United states compliance.--The United States \n     understands that--\n       (A) any decision by any military commander, military \n     personnel, or any other person responsible for planning, \n     authorizing, or executing military action shall only be \n     judged on the basis of that person's assessment of the \n     information reasonably available to the person at the time \n     the person planned, authorized, or executed the action under \n     review, and shall not be judged on the basis of information \n     that comes to light after the action under review was taken; \n     and\n       (B) Article 14 of the Amended Mines Protocol (insofar as it \n     relates to penal sanctions) shall apply only in a situation \n     in which an individual--\n       (i) knew, or should have known, that his action was \n     prohibited under the Amended Mines Protocol;\n       (ii) intended to kill or cause serious injury to a \n     civilian; and\n       (iii) knew or should have known, that the person he \n     intended to kill or cause serious injury was a civilian.\n       (2) Effective exclusion.--The United States understands \n     that, for the purposes of Article 5(6)(b) of the Amended \n     Mines Protocol, the maintenance of observation over avenues \n     of approach where mines subject to that Article are deployed \n     constitutes one acceptable form of monitoring to ensure the \n     effective exclusion of civilians.\n       (3) Historic monuments.--The United States understands that \n     Article 7(1)(i) of the Amended Mines Protocol refers only to \n     a limited class of objects that, because of their clearly \n     recognizable characteristics and because of their widely \n     recognized importance, constitute a part of the cultural or \n     spiritual heritage of peoples.\n       (4) Legitimate military objectives.--The United States \n     understands that an area of land itself can be a legitimate \n     military objective for the purpose of the use of landmines, \n     if its neutralization or denial, in the circumstances \n     applicable at the time, offers a military advantage.\n       (5) Peace treaties.--The United States understands that the \n     allocation of responsibilities for landmines in Article \n     5(2)(b) of the Amended Mines Protocol does not preclude \n     agreement, in connection with peace treaties or similar \n     arrangements, to allocate responsibilities under that Article \n     in a manner that respects the essential spirit and purpose of \n     the Article.\n       (6) Booby-traps and other devices.--For the purposes of the \n     Amended Mines Protocol, the United States understands that--\n       (A) the prohibition contained in Article 7(2) of the \n     Amended Mines Protocol does not preclude the expedient \n     adaptation or adaptation in advance of other objects for use \n     as booby-traps or other devices;\n       (B) a trip-wired hand grenade shall be considered a \n     ``booby-trap'' under Article 2(4) of the Amended Mines \n     Protocol and shall not be considered a ``mine'' or an ``anti-\n     personnel mine'' under Article 2(1) or Article 2(3), \n     respectively; and\n       (C) none of the provisions of the Amended Mines Protocol, \n     including Article 2(5), applies to hand grenades other than \n     trip-wired hand grenades.\n       (7) Non-lethal capabilities.--The United States understands \n     that nothing in the Amended Mines Protocol may be construed \n     as restricting or affecting in any way non-lethal weapon \n     technology that is designed to temporarily disable, stun, \n     signal the presence of a person, or operate in any other \n     fashion, but not to cause permanent incapacity.\n       (8) International tribunal jurisdiction.--The United States \n     understands that the provisions of Article 14 of the Amended \n     Mines Protocol relating to penal sanctions refer to measures \n     by the authorities of States Parties to the Protocol and do \n     not authorize the trial of any person before an international \n     criminal tribunal. The United States shall not recognize the \n     jurisdiction of any international tribunal to prosecute a \n     United States citizen for a violation of the Protocol or the \n     Convention on Conventional Weapons.\n       (9) Technical cooperation and assistance.--The United \n     States understands that--\n       (A) no provision of the Protocol may be construed as \n     affecting the discretion of the United States to refuse \n     assistance or to restrict or deny permission for the export \n     of equipment, material, or scientific or technological \n     information for any reason; and\n       (B) the Amended Mines Protocol may not be used as a pretext \n     for the transfer of weapons technology or the provision of \n     assistance to the military mining or military counter-mining \n     capabilities of a State Party to the Protocol.\n\n     SEC. 4. CONDITIONS.\n\n       The Senate's advice and consent to the ratification of the \n     Amended Mines Protocol is subject to the following \n     conditions, which shall be binding upon the President:\n       (1) Pursuit deterrent munition.--\n       (A) Understanding.--The Senate understands that nothing in \n     the Amended Mines Protocol restricts the possession or use of \n     the Pursuit Deterrent Munition, which is in compliance with \n     the provisions in the Technical Annex.\n       (B) Certification.--Prior to deposit of the United States \n     instrument of ratification, the President shall certify to \n     the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations of the Senate and to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives that the Pursuit Deterrent Munition shall \n     continue to remain available for use by the United States \n     Armed Forces at least until January 1, 2003, unless an \n     effective alternative to the munition becomes available.\n       (C) Effective alternative defined.--For purposes of \n     subparagraph (B), the term ``effective alternative'' does not \n     mean a tactic or operational concept in and of itself.\n       (2) Humanitarian demining assistance.--The Senate makes the \n     following findings:\n       (A) United states efforts.--The United States contributes \n     more than any other country to the worldwide humanitarian \n     demining effort, having expended more than $153,000,000 on \n     such efforts since 1993.\n       (B) Development of detection and clearing technology.--The \n     Department of Defense has undertaken a program to develop \n     improved mine detection and clearing technology and has \n     shared this improved technology with the international \n     community.\n       (C) Expansion of united states humanitarian demining \n     programs.--The Department of Defense and the Department of \n     State have expanded their humanitarian demining programs to \n     train and assist the personnel of other countries in \n     developing effective demining programs.\n       (3) Limitation on the scale of assessment.--\n       (A) Limitation on assessment for cost of implementation.--\n     Notwithstanding any provision of the Amended Mines Protocol, \n     and subject to the requirements of subparagraphs (B) and (C), \n     the portion of the United States annual assessed contribution \n     for activities associated with any conference held pursuant \n     to Article 13 of the Amended Mines Protocol may not exceed \n     $1,000,000.\n       (B) Recalculation of limitation.--\n       (i) In general.--On January 1, 2000, and at 3-year \n     intervals thereafter, the Administrator of General Services \n     shall prescribe an amount that shall apply in lieu of the \n     amount specified in subparagraph (A) and that shall be \n     determined by adjusting the last amount applicable under that \n     subparagraph to reflect the percentage increase by which the \n     Consumer Price Index for the preceding calendar year exceeds \n     the Consumer Price Index for the calendar year three years \n     previously.\n       (ii) Consumer price index defined.--In this subparagraph, \n     the term ``Consumer Price Index'' means the last Consumer \n     Price Index for all-urban consumers published by the \n     Department of Labor.\n       (C) Additional contributions requiring congressional \n     approval.--\n       (i) Authority.--Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the \n     President may furnish additional contributions for activities \n     associated with any conference held pursuant to Article 13 of \n     the Amended Mines Protocol which would otherwise be \n     prohibited under subparagraph (A) if--\n\n       (I) the President determines and certifies in writing to \n     the appropriate committees of Congress that the failure to \n     make such contributions would seriously affect the national \n     interest of the United States; and\n       (II) Congress enacts a joint resolution approving the \n     certification of the President under subclause (I).\n\n       (ii) Statement of reasons.--Any certification made under \n     clause (i) shall be accompanied by a detailed statement \n     setting forth the specific reasons therefor and the specific \n     activities associated with any conference held pursuant to \n     Article 13 of the Amended Mines Protocol to which the \n     additional contributions would be applied.\n       (4) United states authority for technical cooperation and \n     assistance.--Notwithstanding any provision of the Amended \n     Mines Protocol, no funds may be drawn from the Treasury of \n     the United States for any payment or assistance (including \n     the transfer of in-kind items) under Article 11 or Article \n     13(3)(d) of the Amended Mines Protocol without statutory \n     authorization and appropriation by United States law.\n       (5) Future negotiation of withdrawal clause.--It is the \n     sense of the Senate that, in negotiations on any treaty \n     containing an arms control provision, United States \n     negotiators should not agree to any provision that would have \n     the effect of prohibiting the United States from withdrawing \n     from the arms control provisions of that treaty in a timely \n     fashion in the event that the supreme national interests of \n     the United States have been jeopardized.\n       (6) Land mine alternatives.--Prior to the deposit of the \n     United States instrument of ratification, the President shall \n     certify to Congress that--\n       (A) the President, in pursuing alternatives to United \n     States anti-personnel mines or mixed anti-tank systems, will \n     not limit the types of alternatives to be considered on the\n\n[[Page S5264]]\n\n     basis of any criteria other than those specified in \n     subparagraph (B);

and\n       (B) United States mines that do meet such specifications \n     have not contributed to this problem.\n       (10) Approval of modifications.--The Senate reaffirms the \n     principle that any amendment or modification to the Amended \n     Mines Protocol other than an amendment or modification solely \n     of a minor technical or administrative nature shall enter \n     into force with respect to the United States only pursuant to \n     the treaty-making power of the President, by and with the \n     advice and consent of the Senate, as set forth in Article II, \n     section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution of the United States.\n       (11) Further arms reductions obligations.--The Senate \n     declares its intention to consider for approval an \n     international agreement that would obligate the United States \n     to reduce or limit the Armed Forces or armaments of the \n     United States in a militarily significant manner only \n     pursuant to the treaty-making power as set forth in Article \n     II, section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution of the United \n     States.\n       (12) Treaty interpretation.--The Senate affirms the \n     applicability to all treaties of the constitutionally-based \n     principles of treaty interpretation set forth in condition \n     (1) of the resolution of ratification of the INF Treaty, \n     approved by the Senate on May 27, 1988, and condition (8) of \n     the resolution of ratification of the CFE Flank Document, \n     approved by the Senate on May 14, 1997.\n       (13) Primacy of the united states constitution.--Nothing in \n     the Amended Mines Protocol requires or authorizes the \n     enactment of legislation, or the taking of any other action, \n     by the United States that is prohibited by the Constitution \n     of the United States, as interpreted by the United States.\n\n     SEC. 5.

A bill to simplify and expedite access to the Federal courts \nfor injured parties whose rights and privileges, secured by the United \nStates Constitution, have been deprived by final actions of Federal \nagencies, or other government officials or entities acting under color \nof State law, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                 citizens access to justice act of 1999\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the \n``Citizens Access to Justice Act of 1999,'' or CAJA. More precisely, I \nam reintroducing the same bill that was voted out of the Judiciary \nCommittee last Congress, but was a victim of a filibuster by the left.\n  Why am I doing this? Some may say that it is fruitless. But even \nthough Senator Landrieu, other supporters of the bill, and myself, were \nunsuccessful last Congress in passing this much needed bill, property \nowners of Utah, and, indeed, of all of our States, still feel the heavy \nhand of the government erode their right to hold and enjoy private \nproperty. To make matters worse, many of these property owners often \nare unable to safeguard their rights because they effectively are \ndenied access to federal courts. Our bill was designed to rectify this \nproblem. Let me explain.\n  In a society based upon the ``rule of law,'' the ability to protect \nproperty and other rights is of paramount importance. Indeed, it was \nChief Justice John Marshall, who in the seminal 1803 case of Marbury v. \nMadison, observed that the ``government of the United States has been \nemphatically termed a government of laws, and not of men. It will cease \nto deserve this high appellation, if the laws furnish no remedy for the \nviolation of a vested right.''\n  Despite this core belief of John Marshall and other Founders, the \nability of property owners to vindicate their rights in court today is \nbeing frustrated by localities which sometimes create labyrinths of \nadministrative hurdles that property owners must jump through before \nbeing able to bring a claim in Federal court to vindicate their federal \nconstitutional rights. They are also hampered by the overlapping and \nconfusing jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims and the federal \ndistrict courts over Fifth Amendment property rights claims. CAJA seeks \nto remedy these situations.\n  The purpose of the bill is, therefore, at its root, primarily one of \nfostering fundamental fairness and simple justice for the many millions \nof Americans who possess or own property. Many citizens who attempt to \nprotect their property rights guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment of the \nConstitution are barred from the doors of the federal courthouse.\n  In situations where other than Fifth Amendment property rights are \nsought to be enforced--such as First Amendment rights, for example--\naggrieved parties generally file in a single federal forum to obtain \nthe full range of remedies available to litigants to make them whole. \nIn property rights cases, property owners may have to file in different \ncourts for different types of remedies. This is expensive and wasteful.\n  Moreover, unlike situations where other constitutional rights are \nsought to be enforced, property owners seeking to enforce their Fifth \nAmendment rights must first exhaust all state remedies with the result \nthat they may have to wait for over a decade before their rights are \nallowed to be vindicated in federal court--if they get there at all. \nCAJA addresses this problem of providing property owners fair access to \nfederal courts to vindicate their federal constitutional rights.\n  Let me be more specific. The bill has two main provisions to \naccomplish this end. The first is to provide private property owners \nclaiming a violation of the Fifth Amendment's Taking Clause some \ncertainty as to when they may file the claim in federal court. This is \naccomplished by addressing the procedural hurdles of the ripeness and \nabstention doctrines which currently prevent them from having fair and \nequal access to federal court. The bill defines when a final agency \ndecision has occurred for purposes of meeting the ripeness requirement \nand prohibits a federal judge from abstaining from or relinquishing \njurisdiction when the case does not allege any violation of a state \nlaw, right, or privilege. Thus, the bill serves as a vehicle for \novercoming federal judicial reluctance to review takings claims based \non the ripeness and abstention doctrines.\n  The second provision clarifies the jurisdiction between the Court of \nFederal Claims in Washington, D.C., and the regional federal district \ncourts over federal Fifth Amendment takings claims. The ``Tucker Act,'' \nwhich waives the sovereign immunity of the United States by granting \nthe Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction to entertain monetary claims \nagainst the United States, actually complicates the ability of a \nproperty owner to vindicate the right to just compensation for a \ngovernment action that has caused a taking. The law currently forces a \nproperty owner to elect between equitable relief in the federal \ndistrict court and monetary relief in the Court of Federal Claims. \nFurther difficulty arises when the law is used by the government to \nurge dismissal in the district court on the ground that the plaintiff \nshould seek just compensation in the Court of Federal Claims, and is \nused to urge dismissal in the Court of Federal Claims on the ground \nthat plaintiff should first seek equitable relief in the district \ncourt.\n  This division between law and equity is archaic and results in \nburdensome delays as property owners who seek both types of relief are \n``shuffled'' from one court to the other to determine which court is \nthe proper forum for review. The bill resolves this matter by simply \ngiving both courts concurrent jurisdiction over takings claims, thus \nallowing both legal and equitable relief to be granted in a single \nforum.\n  I must emphasize that the bill does not create any substantive \nrights. The definition of property, as well as what constitutes a \ntaking under the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment, is \nleft to the courts to define. The bill would not change existing case \nlaw's ad hoc, case-by-case definition of regulatory takings. Instead, \nit would provide a procedural fix to the litigation muddle that delays \nand increases the cost of litigating a Fifth Amendment taking case. All \nthe bill does is to provide for fair procedures to allow property \nowners the means to safeguard their rights by having their day in \ncourt.\n  Mr. President, I am very well aware that this bill has been opposed \nby the\n\n[[Page S5266]]\n\nDepartment of Justice, many localities, some interstate governmental \nassociations, and certain environmental groups. I believe that there \nconcerns that the bill would hinder local prerogatives and \nsignificantly increase the amount of federal litigation are highly \noverstated. The bill is carefully drafted to ensure that aggrieved \nproperty owners must first seek solutions on the local or state level \nbefore filing a federal claim. It just sets a limit on how many \nprocedures localities may interpose.\n\n  Moreover, I seriously doubt that there will be a rush of new \nlitigation, as some have contended, flooding federal courts. That there \nwill be no significant increase was the conclusion of the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office in its study of last year's bill.\n  It is extremely difficult to prove a takings claim, and this bill \ndoes not in any way redefine what constitutes a taking. These claims \nare also expensive to bring. Paradoxically, localities' need to defend \nfederal actions may be lessened by the bill because localities already \nmust litigate property rights claims on federal ripeness grounds, which \ntake years to resolve.\n  Let me restate this. By providing certainty on the ripeness issue, \nthe bill may very well reduce litigation costs to localities. \nSubstantive takings claims, unless they are likely to prevail on the \nmerits, are simply too hard to prove and too expensive to bring in \nfederal court. And the issue of ripeness will have been removed by the \nbill from the already crowded court dockets.\n  Mr. President, it is interesting to note that once many state \nofficials, localities, and state and trade organizations really examine \nthe measure, many become the bill's supporters. Those supporting the \nbill and increased vigilance in the property rights arena include the \nGovernors of Tennessee, Wisconsin, New Mexico, and North Dakota.\n  They also include the American Legislative Exchange Council, which \nrepresents over 3000 state legislators, and trade groups such as \nAmerica's Community Bankers, the National Mortgage Association of \nAmerica, the National Association of Home Builders, the National \nAssociation of Realtors, and the National Federation of Independent \nBusinesses, the organ of small business in the United States. They also \ninclude agricultural interests such as the American Farm Bureau, the \nAmerican Forest and Paper Association, the National Cattlemen's Beef \nAssociation, and the National Grange.\n  Just as important, let me point out that 133 House sponsors of the \nlast year's House passed bill were former state and local \nofficeholders. I do not believe that they would have voted for the bill \nif the bill would conflict with local sovereignty.\n  Mr. President, we have bent over backwards trying to accommodate \nthose expressing concerns about the bill which passed out of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee last year. We met with city mayors, representatives \nof local governmental organizations, attorneys generals, and religious \ngroups, to name just a few.\n  We held group meetings and asked for suggestions and changes to the \nbill which would alleviate opposition and concerns. These changes are \nincorporated in the present bill. These changes by and large alleviate \nmunicipalities' concerns that the bill would become a vehicle for \nfrivolous and novel suits. They remove any incentive the bill may have \nfor property owners to file specious suits against localities. They \nfoster negotiations to resolve problems. And, they recognize the right \nof the states and localities to abate nuisances without having to pay \ncompensation.\n  But I am under no illusion. I understand that many localities still \noppose the bill. The process that we so fruitfully began last year \nshould be continued. It is my hope that groups supporting property \nrights and those localities and governmental entities that oppose the \nbill should meet as soon as practicable. Let each side discuss their \nproblems and concerns. I believe--in the best tradition of American \npragmatic know how--that a solution to this problem can be worked out.\n  The bill I introduce today is a model. But it is a model that can be \nimproved. I assure all those concerned that we will consider all \nreasonable suggested changes to the bill. After all, it is not pride of \nauthorship that is important. What is important, instead, is a viable \nsolution to a vexing and unfair problem.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the entire text of the \nbill be inserted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1028\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) property rights have been abrogated by the application \n     of laws, regulations, and other actions by all levels of \n     government that adversely affect the value and the ability to \n     make reasonable use of private property;\n       (2) certain provisions of sections 1346 and 1402 and \n     chapter 91 of title 28, United States Code (commonly known as \n     the Tucker Act), that delineate the jurisdiction of courts \n     hearing property rights claims, frustrate the ability of a \n     property owner to obtain full relief for violation founded \n     upon the fifth and fourteenth amendments of the United States \n     Constitution;\n       (3) current law--\n       (A) has no sound basis for splitting jurisdiction between \n     two courts in cases where constitutionally protected property \n     rights are at stake;\n       (B) adds to the complexity and cost of takings and \n     litigation, adversely affecting taxpayers and property \n     owners;\n       (C) forces a property owner, who seeks just compensation \n     from the Federal Government, to elect between equitable \n     relief in the district court and monetary relief (the value \n     of the property taken) in the United States Court of Federal \n     Claims;\n       (D) is used to urge dismissal in the district court in \n     complaints against the Federal Government, on the ground that \n     the plaintiff should seek just compensation in the Court of \n     Federal Claims;\n       (E) is used to urge dismissal in the Court of Federal \n     Claims in complaints against the Federal Government, on the \n     ground that the plaintiff should seek equitable relief in \n     district court; and\n       (F) forces a property owner to first pay to litigate an \n     action in a State court, before a Federal judge can decide \n     whether local government has denied property rights \n     safeguarded by the United States Constitution;\n       (4) property owners cannot fully vindicate property rights \n     in one lawsuit and their claims may be time barred in a \n     subsequent action;\n       (5) property owners should be able to fully recover for a \n     taking of their private property in one court;\n       (6) certain provisions of section 1346 and 1402 and chapter \n     91 of title 28, United States Code (commonly known as the \n     Tucker Act) should be amended, giving both the district \n     courts of the United States and the Court of Federal Claims \n     jurisdiction to hear all claims relating to property rights \n     in complaints against the Federal Government;\n       (7) section 1500 of title 28, United States Code, which \n     denies the Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction to entertain \n     a suit which is pending in another court and made by the same \n     plaintiff, should be repealed;\n       (8) Federal and local authorities, through complex, costly, \n     repetitive and unconstitutional permitting, variance, and \n     licensing procedures, have denied property owners their fifth \n     and fourteenth amendment rights under the United States \n     Constitution to the use, enjoyment, and disposition of, and \n     exclusion of others from, their property, and to safeguard \n     those rights, there is a need to determine what constitutes a \n     final decision of an agency in order to allow claimants the \n     ability to protect their property rights in a court of law;\n       (9) a Federal judge should decide the merits of cases where \n     a property owner seeks redress solely for infringements of \n     rights safeguarded by the United States Constitution, and \n     where no claim of a violation of State law is alleged; and\n       (10) certain provisions of sections 1343, 1346, and 1491 of \n     title 28, United States Code, should be amended to clarify \n     when a claim for redress of constitutionally protected \n     property rights is sufficiently ripe so a Federal judge may \n     decide the merits of the allegations.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are to--\n       (1) establish a clear, uniform, and efficient judicial \n     process whereby aggrieved property owners can obtain \n     vindication of property rights guaranteed by the fifth and \n     fourteenth amendments to the United States Constitution and \n     this Act;\n       (2) amend the Tucker Act, including the repeal of section \n     1500 of title 28, United States Code;\n       (3) rectify the unduly onerous and expensive requirement \n     that an owner of real property, seeking redress under section \n     1979 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (42 U.S.C. \n     1983) for the infringement of property rights protected by \n     the fifth and fourteenth amendments of the United States \n     Constitution, is required to first litigate Federal \n     constitutional issues in a State court before obtaining \n     access to the Federal courts;\n\n[[Page S5267]]\n\n       (4) provide for uniformity in the application of the \n     ripeness doctrine in cases where constitutional rights to use \n     and enjoy real property are allegedly infringed, by providing \n     that a final agency decision may be adjudicated by a Federal \n     court on the merits after--\n       (A) the pertinent government body denies a meaningful \n     application to develop the land in question; and\n       (B)(i) the property owner seeks available waivers and \n     administrative appeals from such denial; and\n       (ii) such waiver or appeal is not approved; and\n       (5) confirm the proper role of a State or territory to \n     prevent land uses that are a nuisance under applicable law.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to amend title III of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act of 1965 to provide for digital education partnerships; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.\n\n\n                     digital education act of 1999\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the Digital \nEducation Act, a bill to amend title III of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act. I am pleased that the distinguished Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, joins me in introducing this \nlegislation to address some critical technology issues and the role of \npublic broadcasting in education.\n  This bill expands Ready to Learn, a program of combined successful \nefforts in early childhood education. It expands MATHLINE, a proven \nmodel of teacher professional development, and it supports production \nof new digital educational material. The Digital Education Act includes \ninnovative applications of progressive technology to promote the best \npractices in teaching and bring up to date information to classrooms \nthroughout the country.\n  The Federal Government, State departments of education, local \ncommunity businesses, and public television stations have made major \ninvestments in educational technology in recent years. These \ninvestments have focused on network infrastructure and computer \nhardware. It is time to invest in instructional resources that will \nmake these new networks relevant and ensure that students and teachers \nare prepared to benefit fully from the new technology.\n  The Ready To Learn Television program, first authorized in 1994, has \nmade a unique contribution to ensure that American children start \nschool ``ready to learn.'' The program has funded an unprecedented \nblending of services, including quality children's educational \ntelevision programming broadcast by the Public Broadcasting Service, \nand a variety of outreach services for parents, teachers and other care \ngivers.\n  Ready to Learn outreach programs have had tremendous success. Local \npublic television stations that subscribe to Ready to Learn provide \ntraining and other services to parents and care givers of \npreschoolchildren. Ready to Learn has grown from 10 public television \nstations to 130, reaching approximately 94 percent of the country. Each \nmonth Ready to Learn distributes over 35,000 books to children and over \n900,000 copies of a custom parent/care giver magazine, specifically \ndesigned to integrate programming with reading. Ready to Learn is \nproviding the opportunities for children and parents to build that \nfoundation for success. Over 330,000 parents and child care \nprofessionals have been trained in using television to encourage \nreading. Using Ready to Learn techniques, these adults have nurtured \nthe reading of 4,331,829 children.\n  The Mississippi Educational Network in my home State, targets \noutreach services to high poverty populations who are particularly \ndisadvantaged.\n\n[[Page S5269]]\n\n The services include basic lessons in parenting, developmental \nbenchmarks, health and nutrition, nurturing literacy in the home, and \nusing the television programs children watch most to reinforce the \nlessons.\n  The families in these communities often have no reading material in \ntheir house. The first book given to a child by Mississippi Ready to \nLearn is quite likely to be the first book the child has ever owned. \nAnd, while Ready to Learn is designed for prekindergarten children, \nthese families may have older children who may be equally in need. The \nlocal design of Ready to Learn allows the Mississippi director, \nCassandra Washington, to tailor her workshops and even have a few older \nchild books on hand for these families. Ms. Washington has been very \nresourceful in her outreach, finding non-traditional places for \neducation, such as the Women Infants and Children Distribution Centers \nthroughout Mississippi where families in need come regularly.\n  The International Reading Association stated recently, ``By the time \nchildren are exposed to beginning reading instruction in kindergarten \nand first grade, they should have a foundation that assures them early \nsuccess. Recent studies indicate just how critical those positive early \nexperiences are to cognitive development and lifelong reading.''\n  Congressionally authorized and Federally funded research at the \nNational Institutes of Health found that when parents read to their \nyoung children, it literally stimulates the brain development of the \nchildren. A recent University of Alabama study found that Ready to \nLearn families: watch 40 percent less television, watch more education-\noriented programming, read more often with their children, read longer \nat each sitting, read for more educational and informational purposes, \nand took their children to libraries and bookstores more often than \nothers.\n  Using the best research tested information available, Ready To Learn \nhas driven the development of two major, commercial-free broadcast \nseries for young children. The first, ``Dragon Tales,'' will begin \nairing this fall and will be integrated with carefully designed home \nand school resources to develop reading skills in young children.\n  The Digital Education Act will build on the early successes of Ready \nto Learn. It will authorize funding to increase station grants, produce \nnew outreach and training activities, and generate more services for \nparents and care givers, so that more children start school truly ready \nto learn.\n  The Digital Education Act provides for the demonstration of early \nchildhood education digital applications with public television \nstations that are technologically ready. Currently, there are digital \nbroadcast public television stations in Mississippi, Massachusetts, \nMissouri, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Wisconsin, and Washington. \nThese stations can transmit several programming services \nsimultaneously. New applications include a dedicated channel for early \nchildhood education and transmission of Internet accessible \nsupplementary information text and video.\n  Today, children's programs produced by PBS and individual public \nbroadcasting stations are among the television shows most watched by \nchildren and most used in classrooms. Many teachers and parents credit \nthese programs for stimulating curiosity, educating, and encouraging \ncontinued learning through reading and other resources. The increased \nfunding authorized in this bill will continue the investment of Ready \nto Learn resources in producing commercial-free children's programming \nof the highest educational quality.\n  Thirty years ago, Federal funding seeded the creation of Sesame \nStreet. This carved out a meaningful place for educational children's \nprogramming as analog public television developed. The Digital \nEducation Act stakes a new claim in the technological frontier for \nchildren and educational broadcasting and will ensure that this \nreinvention of television includes a major education component for \nchildren from the beginning.\n  The second element of the Digital Education Act concerns teacher \nprofessional development. In 1994, Congress authorized the \n``Telecommunications Demonstration Project for Mathematics,'' which has \nsupported a project called MATHLINE. Through MATHLINE, PBS has \npioneered a new model of teacher professional development, utilizing a \nblend of technologies, including online communications and video, to \nprovide quality resources and services to teachers of mathematics.\n  Through public and private funding, PBS MATHLINE developed The \nElementary School Math Project for teachers, grades K-5; The Middle \nSchool Math Project for teachers, grades 5-8; The High School Math \nProject: Focus on Algebra for teachers, grades 7-12; and The Algebraic \nThinking Math Project for teachers, grades 3-8.\n  Over 5,000 math teachers in 40 States and the District of Columbia \nhave participated in MATHLINE. These innovative teaching techniques \nhave taught more than 1.3 million students.\n  Three separate external evaluators have certified that MATHLINE is \nmaking a positive impact on the way teachers teach. For example, an \nevaluation of the Middle School Math Project by Rockman, et al. found, \n``The impact of PBS MATHLINE is clear. It has influenced how teachers \nsee themselves and helped them create a powerful and enriching \nmathematics environment in their classrooms * * * The gap between \nbelief and performance is narrowing * * * The combination of viewing, \ncommunicating, and doing seems to have resulted in substantive changes \nin teaching.''\n  The International Reading Association stated in February, ``The most \neffective professional development programs are those planned by \nteachers themselves, based on their assessments of their needs as \neducators and their students' needs as learners.'' MATHLINE does just \nthat. It is real teachers, teaching real students, and passing success \non to more teachers. The MATHLINE demonstration has worked.\n  Our legislation would authorize the New Century Program for \nDistributed Teacher Professional Development. Under this new program, \nthe successful MATHLINE model will expand to other core curriculum \nareas, such as literature, science and social studies. It will also \nconnect the digitized public broadcasting infrastructure with digital \neducation networks at schools, colleges and universities throughout the \nnation. Nearly every teacher in the United States will have access to \nthe New Century Program.\n  The third element of our legislation would authorize the Digital \nEducation Content Collaborative. As a nation, we have made tremendous \nprogress in the last decade bringing our schools from the 19th Century \nto 21st Century technologically. However, there is still one major \nelement that needs to be in place to make it all work. That is world-\nclass educational content that rivals video games for students' \nattention, is tied to state standards, which teachers seamlessly \nintegrate into daily learning activities.\n  Programs distributed by public broadcast stations are used by more \nclassroom teachers than any other because of their high quality and \nrelevance to the curriculum. A survey commissioned by the Corporation \nfor Public Broadcasting in 1997, found that 92 percent of teachers use \nvideos to improve their lessons and public broadcasting programs were \nthe highest rated. However, single channel analog distribution limited \nstation services to a few hours per day of linear video broadcasts.\n  Digital broadcasting will dramatically increase and improve the types \nof services local public broadcasting stations can offer schools. One \nof the most exciting is the ability to broadcast multiple video \nchannels and data information simultaneously. A vast library of \ninstructional video materials could be distributed on full time, \ncontinuous channels and it could be available on demand, when teachers \nand students need it. Digitally produced programs will allow local \nstations broadcast flexibility and new interactive content that matches \nstate standards and fits local curriculums.\n  As Members of the United States Senate, working to reauthorize the \nprograms our elementary and secondary schools depend upon, we are also \nlooking for successful models that lead to true educational reform and \nimprovement.\n\n[[Page S5270]]\n\n  The Digital Education Act takes the best of educational technology \nprograming; improves those proven to work; and places renewed \nconfidence in education's most trusted and successful content \ndevelopment partners.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to be associated with the public \nbroadcasting community, and I am proud of their commitment to our \nearliest learners. I hope more Senators will join us in supporting this \nimportant education legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1029\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Digital Education Act of \n     1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REVISION OF PART C OF TITLE III.\n\n       Part C of title III of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6921 et seq.) is amended to \n     read as follows:\n\n              ``PART C--READY-TO-LEARN DIGITAL TELEVISION\n\n     ``SEC. 3301. FINDINGS.\n\n       ``Congress makes the following findings:\n       ``(1) In 1994, Congress and the Department collaborated to \n     make a long-term, meaningful and public investment in the \n     principle that high-quality preschool television programming \n     will help children be ready to learn by the time the children \n     entered first grade.\n       ``(2) The Ready to Learn Television Program through the \n     Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and local public television \n     stations has proven to be an extremely cost-effective \n     national response to improving early childhood development \n     and helping parents, caregivers, and professional child care \n     providers learn how to use television as a means to help \n     children learn, develop, and play creatively.\n       ``(3) Independent research shows that parents who \n     participate in Ready to Learn workshops are more critical \n     consumers of television and their children are more active \n     viewers. A University of Alabama study showed that parents \n     who had attended a Ready to Learn workshop read more books \n     and stories to their children and read more minutes each time \n     than nonattendees. The parents did more hands-on activities \n     related to reading with their children. The parents engaged \n     in more word activities and for more minutes each time. The \n     parents read less for entertainment and more for education. \n     The parents took their children to libraries and bookstores \n     more than nonattendees. For parents, participating in a Ready \n     to Learn workshop increases their awareness of and interest \n     in educational dimensions of television programming and is \n     instrumental in having their children gain exposure to more \n     educational programming. Moreover, 6 months after \n     participating in Ready to Learn workshops, parents who \n     attended generally had set rules for television viewing by \n     their children. These rules related to the amount of time the \n     children were allowed to watch television daily, the hours \n     the children were allowed to watch television, and the tasks \n     or chores the children must have accomplished before the \n     children were allowed to watch television.\n       ``(4) The Ready to Learn (RTL) Television Program is \n     supporting and creating commercial-free broadcast programs \n     for young children that are of the highest possible \n     educational quality. Program funding has also been used to \n     create hundreds of valuable interstitial program elements \n     that appear between national and local public television \n     programs to provide developmentally appropriate messages to \n     children and caregiving advice to parents.\n       ``(5) Through the Nation's 350 local public television \n     stations, these programs and programming elements reach tens \n     of millions of children, their parents, and caregivers \n     without regard to their economic circumstances, location, or \n     access to cable. In this way, public television is a partner \n     with Federal policy to make television an instrument, not an \n     enemy, of preschool children's education and early \n     development.\n       ``(6) The Ready to Learn Television Program extends beyond \n     the television screen. Funds from the Ready to Learn \n     Television Program have funded thousands of local workshops \n     organized and run by local public television stations, almost \n     always in association with local child care training agencies \n     or early childhood development professionals, to help child \n     care professionals and parents learn more about how to use \n     television effectively as a developmental tool. These \n     workshops have trained more than 320,000 parents and \n     professionals who, in turn, serve and support over 4,000,000 \n     children across the Nation.\n       ``(7)(A) The Ready to Learn Television Program has \n     published and distributed millions of copies of a quarterly \n     magazine entitled `PBS Families' that contains--\n       ``(i) developmentally appropriate games and activities \n     based on Ready to Learn Television programming;\n       ``(ii) parenting advice;\n       ``(iii) news about regional and national activities related \n     to early childhood development; and\n       ``(iv) information about upcoming Ready to Learn Television \n     activities and programs.\n       ``(B) The magazine described in subparagraph (A) is \n     published 4 times a year and distributed free of charge by \n     local public television stations in English and in Spanish \n     (PBS para la familia).\n       ``(8) Because reading and literacy are central to the ready \n     to learn principle Ready to Learn Television stations also \n     have received and distributed millions of free age-\n     appropriate books in their communities as part of the Ready \n     to Learn Television Program. Each station receives a minimum \n     of 200 books each month for free local distribution. Some \n     stations are now distributing more than 1,000 books per \n     month. Nationwide, more than 300,000 books are distributed \n     each year in low-income and disadvantaged neighborhoods free \n     of charge.\n       ``(9) In 1998, the Public Broadcasting Service, in \n     association with local colleges and local public television \n     stations, as well as the Annenberg Corporation for Public \n     Broadcasting Project housed at the Corporation for Public \n     Broadcasting, began a pilot program to test the formal \n     awarding of a Certificate in Early Childhood Development \n     through distance learning. The pilot is based on the local \n     distribution of a 13-part video courseware series developed \n     by Annenberg Corporation for Public Broadcasting and WTVS \n     Detroit entitled `The Whole Child'. Louisiana Public \n     Broadcasting, Kentucky Educational Television, Maine Public \n     Broadcasting, and WLJT Martin, Tennessee, working with local \n     and State regulatory agencies in the childcare field, have \n     participated in the pilot program with a high level of \n     success. The certificate program is ready for nationwide \n     application using the Public Broadcasting Service's Adult \n     Learning Service.\n       ``(10) Demand for Ready To Learn Television Program \n     outreach and training has increased dramatically, with the \n     base of participating Public Broadcasting Service member \n     stations growing from a pilot of 10 stations to nearly 130 \n     stations in 5 years.\n       ``(11) Federal policy played a crucial role in the \n     evolution of analog television by funding the television \n     program entitled `Sesame Street' in the 1960's.

FINDINGS.\n\n       ``Congress makes the following findings:\n       ``(1) Since 1995, the Telecommunications Demonstration \n     Project for Mathematics (as established under this part \n     pursuant to the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994) (in \n     this section referred to as `MATHLINE') has allowed the \n     Public Broadcasting Service to pioneer and refine a new model \n     of teacher professional development for kindergarten through \n     grade 12 teachers. MATHLINE uses video modeling of standards-\n     based lessons, combined with professionally facilitated \n     online learning communities of teachers, to help mathematics \n     teachers from elementary school through secondary school \n     adopt and implement standards-based practices in their \n     classrooms. This approach allows teachers to update their \n     skills on their own schedules through video, while providing \n     online interaction with peers and master teachers to \n     reinforce that learning. This integrated, self-paced approach \n     breaks down the isolation of classroom teaching while making \n     standards-based best practices available to all participants.\n       ``(2) MATHLINE was developed specifically to disseminate \n     the first national voluntary standards for teaching and \n     learning as developed by the National Council of Teachers of \n     Mathematics (NCTM). During 3 years of actual deployment, more \n     than 5,800 teachers have participated for at least a full \n     year in the demonstration. These teachers, in turn, have \n     taught more than 1,500,000 students cumulatively.\n       ``(3)(A) In the first 3 years of the MATHLINE project, the \n     Public Broadcasting Service used the largest portion of the \n     funds provided under this part--\n       ``(i) to produce video-based models of classroom teaching;\n       ``(ii) to produce and disseminate extensive accompanying \n     print materials;\n       ``(iii) to organize and host professionally moderated, \n     year-long, online learning communities; and\n       ``(iv) to train the Public Broadcasting Service stations to \n     deploy MATHLINE in their local communities. In fiscal year \n     1998, the Public Broadcasting Service added an extensive \n     Internet-based set of learning tools for teachers' use with \n     the video modules and printed materials, and the Public \n     Broadcasting Service expanded the online resources available \n     to teachers through Internet-based discussion groups and a \n     national listserv.\n       ``(B) To extend Federal funds, the Public Broadcasting \n     Service has experimented with various fee models for teacher \n     participation, with varying results. Using fiscal year 1998 \n     Federal funds and private money, participation in MATHLINE \n     will increase by 10,000 MATHLINE scholarships to preservice \n     and inservice teachers. The Public Broadcasting Service and \n     its participating member stations will distribute \n     scholarships in each congressional district in the United \n     States, with teachers serving disadvantaged populations given \n     priority for the scholarships.\n       ``(4) Independent evaluations indicate that teaching \n     improves and students benefit as a result of the MATHLINE \n     program.\n       ``(5) The MATHLINE program is ready to be expanded to reach \n     many more teachers in more subject areas.

Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator Cochran \nin sponsoring the ``Digital Education Act of 1999.'' I commend him for \nhis leadership in improving technology for children and families, so \nthat more children come to school ready to learn.\n  In the early 1990's, Dr. Ernest Boyer, the distinguished former \nleader of the Carnegie Foundation, gave compelling testimony to the \nSenate Labor Committee about the appallingly high number of children \nwho enter school without the skills to prepare them for learning. Their \nlack of preparation presented enormous obstacles to their ability to \nlearn effectively in school, and seriously impaired their long-term \nachievement.\n  In response, Congress enacted the Ready-to-Learn program in 1992, and \ntwo years later its promise was so great that we extended it for five \nyears. Because of the Department of Education and the Corporation for \nPublic Broadcasting, the Ready-to-Learn initiative became an innovative \nand effective program. By linking the power of television to the world \nof books, many more children have been enabled to become good readers \nmuch more quickly.\n  Many children who enter school without the necessary basic skills are \nsoon placed in a remedial program, which is costly for school systems. \nIt is even more costly, however, for the students who face a bleaker \nfuture.\n  Today, by the time they enter school, the average child will have \nwatched 4,000 hours of television. That is roughly the equivalent of \nfour years of school.\n  For far too many youngsters, this is wasted time--time consuming \n``empty calories'' for the brain. Instead, that time could be spent \nreading, writing, and learning. Through Ready-to-Learn television \nprogramming, children can obtain substantial education benefits that \nturn T.V. time into learning time.\n  As a result of Ready-to-Learn television, millions of children and \nfamilies have access to high-quality television produced by public \ntelevision\n\n[[Page S5273]]\n\nstations across the country. Tens of thousands of parents and child-\ncare providers have learned how to be better role models, to reinforce \nlearning, and to be more active participants in children's learning \nfrom programs funded through Ready-to-Learn.\n  For many low-income families, the workshops, books, and television \nshows funded through this program are a vital factor in preparing \nchildren to read. These programs help parents and child-care providers \nteach children the basics, preparing them to enter school ready to \nlearn and ready to succeed.\n  Ready-to-Learn provides 6.5 hours of non-violent educational \nprogramming a day. These hours include some of the best programs \navailable to children, including Arthur, Barney & Friends, Mister \nRogers' Neighborhood, The Puzzle Place, Reading Rainbow, and Sesame \nStreet.\n  One of the most successful aspects of Ready-to-Learn is that it helps \nparents work more effectively with their children. Parents who \nparticipate in Ready-to-Learn workshops are more thoughtful consumers \nof television, and their children are more active viewers. These \nparents have more hands-on activities with their children, and they \nread more often with their children. They read less often for \nentertainment, and more often for education. They take their children \nmore often to libraries and bookstores.\n  The workshops provided by the Ready-to-Learn program are considered \nthe best of their kind. It also brings needed literacy services to \nparents and children at food distribution centers, homeless shelters, \nemployment centers, and supermarkets.\n  Many of the innovations under Ready-to-Learn have come from local \nstations. WGBH in Boston is one of the nation's leaders in public \nbroadcasting. It created the Reading Rainbow, and Where in the World is \nCarmen San Diego, which are leaders in educational programming across \nthe country.\n  Last year, WGBH hosted 34 Ready-to-Learn workshops in Massachusetts. \n1,100 parents and 265 child-care providers and teachers attended. These \nparents and providers in turn worked with 3,400 children, who are now \nbetter prepared to succeed in their schools.\n  WGBY of Springfield is the mainstay of literacy services for Western \nMassachusetts. This station trained 250 home day-care providers, who \nserve 2,500 children. A video lending library makes PBS materials \navailable to teachers to use in their classroom.\n  Workshop participants receive training on using children's programs \nas the starting point for educational activities. Participants receive \nfree books. For some, these are the only books they have ever owned. \nThey receive the PBS Families magazine, in English or Spanish, and they \nalso receive the broadcasting schedules. Each of these resources builds \non the learning that begins with viewing the PBS programs.\n  Through partnerships with the Massachusetts Office of Child Care \nServices and community-based organizations such as Head Start, Even \nStart, and the Reach Out & Read Program at Boston Medical Center, \nReady-to-Learn trainers are reaching many low-income families with \nmedia and literacy information.\n  In Worcester, the Clark Street Developmental Learning School offers a \nfamily literacy program that uses Reading Rainbow or Arthur in every \nsession with families. In addition, the school has now expanded its \nefforts to create an adult literacy center in the school. Many of the \nparents involved in the Ready-to-Learn project now attend the adult \neducation program there.\n  Similar successes are happening across the nation. Since 1994, the \nsponsors of Ready-to-Learn workshops have given away 1.5 million books. \nTheir program has grown from 10 television stations in 1994 to 130 \ntelevision stations today. They have conducted over 8,500 workshops \nreaching 186,000 parents and 146,000 child care providers, who have in \nturn affected the lives of over four million children.\n  The ``Digital Education Act of 1999'' we are introducing today will \ncontinue this high-quality children's television programming. Equally \nimportant, it will take this valuable service into the next century \nthrough digital television, a powerful resource for delivering \nadditional information through television programs.\n  The Digital Education Act will also increase the authorization of \nfunds for Ready-to-Learn programs from $30 million to $50 million a \nyear, enabling these programs to reach even more families and children \nwith these needed services.\n  The Digital Education Act also authorizes $20 million for high-\nquality teacher professional development. Building on the success of \nthe MATHLINE program, the bill will expand the program to include \nmaterials for helping teachers to teach to high state standards in core \nsubject areas.\n  Participating stations make the teachers workshops available through \ndistricts, schools, and even on the teachers' own television sets. In \nthis way, at their own pace, and in their own time, teachers can review \nthe materials, observe other teachers at work, and reflect on their own \npractices. They can consider ways to improve their teaching, and make \nadjustments to their own practices. Teachers will also receive \nessential help in integrating technology into their teaching.\n  Teachers themselves are very supportive of the contribution that \ntelevision can make to their classrooms. 88% of teachers surveyed in \n1997 by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting said that quality \ntelevision used in the classroom helped them be more creative, 92% said \nthat it helped them be more effective in the classroom.\n  Finally, the Act will create a new ``Digital Education Content \nCollaborative,'' with an authorization of $25 million. Its goal is to \nstimulate quality content and curriculum through video and digital \nprograms that will enable students to meet high state standards. Local \npublic telecommunications agencies will create the programs, so that \nteachers can teach more effectively to the state standards and assess \nhow well children are learning.\n  Again, I commend Senator Cochran for his leadership, and I urge my \ncolleagues to join us in support of this important legislation, so that \nmany more children can come to school ready to learn.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself, Mr. Helms, Mr. Burns, Mr. Roberts, \n        Mr. Fitzgerald, and Mr. Lugar):\n  S. 1032. A bill to permit ships built in foreign countries to engage \nin coastwise trade in the transport of certain products; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                    freedom to transport act of 1999\n\n Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing \nlegislation that will expand capacity and increase competition within \nthe domestic transportation system. This legislation, which will allow \nforeign built ships to transport bulk commodities, forest products, and \nlivestock between U.S. ports, will help to expand the overall capacity \nby allowing ship operators to expand their fleets through obtaining \naffordable ships.\n  Currently, Section 27 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, commonly \nreferred to as the Jones Act, requires that merchandise being \ntransported on water between U.S. ports travel on U.S. built, U.S. \nflagged, and U.S. citizen owned vessels that are documented by the \nCoast Guard for such carriage. The bill I am introducing today, The \nFreedom to Transport Act of 1999, does not seek to repeal the Jones \nAct. Rather, it provides very targeted modification--to allow foreign \nbuilt ships to carry bulk cargo in domestic trade. These ships would \nhave to register in the United States and comply with all U.S. laws, \nincluding Jones Act ownership and crewing requirements.\n  The current law makes it infeasible for domestic coastwise shipments \nof agricultural commodities to occur on bulk shipping vessels. This is \nlargely because the cost of purchasing a ship in the United States is \nas much as three times higher than it can be obtained on the world \nmarket. As a result, there has been little capital infusion into the \ndomestic Jones Act fleet for many years. As a consequence, the cost of \ntransport on bulk Jones Act vessels, if they are available at all, is \nprohibitively high.\n  Agriculture is a pillar to the Kansas economy, and an efficient \ntransportation is critical to American agriculture. Laws that raise the \ncost of conducting business and impede efficient means for transporting \nproduct have a negative impact on farmers around the country, including \nKansas. Moreover, the cost of transporting\n\n[[Page S5274]]\n\ngoods is always a proportionately high cost of the delivered product \nfor bulk commodities, but especially now as grain prices are at the \nlowest levels seen in years. Having means to the most cost-effective \nand efficient means for transporting product is now, more than ever, \ncritical to American farmers.\n  If ocean transportation between U.S. ports were more efficient, more \nproduct might be delivered to its destination by ocean rather than by \nrail. For example, the poultry and pork producers in the grain deficit \nsoutheastern United States could bring in grain by ocean through the \nGreat Lakes rather than by across the country by railroad. Since little \nof this type of trade currently occurs, this could have the effect of \nincreasing the overall capacity of the domestic \ntransportation infrastructure. That would make more railcars available \nfor transport in places like Kansas, particularly during the harvest \nseason when there is often a shortage of available cars. Furthermore, \nmore efficient coastwise transportation would bring down prices for \ntrade to Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Alaska, which oftentimes find it less \nexpensive to purchase products from other countries than to pay the \ninflated costs of shipping from the mainland U.S.\n\n  I am aware that the maritime industry has supported the Jones Act as \na protection of domestic industry for many years, and resists any \nchange to the current law. However, despite the ``protective'' nature \nof the Jones Act, it has protected very little. In the last 50 years \nthe merchant marine has lost 40,000 jobs and over 60 shipyards have \nclosed since 1987. In my view this legislation would not only benefit \nthe customers of transportation services, but would also inject new \nlife into an industry that has missed out on the unprecedented growth \nthat the rest of the economy has enjoyed in the last generation. I want \nto work with the maritime industry to address their concerns and look \nforward to their eventual support of this legislation, which I envision \nwill help them as much as it will help agricultural shippers.\n  I would like to point out that the legislation as introduced enjoys \nbroad support not only in the agriculture industry, but also among many \nindustries that ship bulk commodities--including oil, coal, clay, and \nsteel. Additionally, those engaged in commerce with the non-contiguous \nU.S. are supportive, including the Puerto Rico Manufacturers \nAssociation, the Hawaii Shippers Council, and the Alaska Jones Act \nReform Coalition. Finally, the National Taxpayers Union and Americans \nfor Tax Reform support this as a measure that would save consumers over \n$14 billion annually.\n  A healthy maritime industry increases competitiveness, lowers costs, \nand improves service for customers of transportation. It creates jobs \nin the U.S. not only for the people who crew the ships, but for those \nwho repair them, who own them, and who are employed by industries who \nbuy transportation services. It is a win-win-win-win proposal.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in reducing stifling government \nregulation and support this important bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 1033. A bill to amend title IV of the Social Security Act to \ncoordinate the penalty for the failure of a State to operate a State \nchild support disbursement unit with the alternative penalty procedure \nfor failures to meet data processing requirements; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                   child support penalty fairness act\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Child \nSupport Penalty Fairness Act. This important legislation will remedy a \nflaw in federal child support laws that could cost California $4 \nbillion annually.\n  On April 30, the Department of Health and Human Services announced \nits intent to reject the State of California's plan for child and \nspousal support because California does not have a centralized ``State \nDisbursement Unit'' that distributes child support collections to \nfamilies. The mandatory penalty for this failure is loss of all federal \nchild support administrative funding, which amounts to $300 million a \nyear.\n  In addition, because the 1996 welfare reform law requires states to \nhave an approved child support plan in order to receive the Temporary \nAssistance to Needy Families block grant, California could lose its \nentire TANF block grant of $3.7 billion a year.\n  In other words, California faces a $4 billion annual penalty for its \nfailure to operate a State Disbursement Unit.\n  This so-called ``nuclear penalty'' is completely unjust and out of \nproportion. It will devastate the State of California's ability to \nserve low-income children and families--both families on welfare, and \nfamilies who need child support so that they can stay off welfare. The \npenalty also will cripple the State's budget, seriously harming the \nlargest economy in this nation.\n  I am not questioning the value of a State Disbursement Unit, or \nCalifornia's need to develop one. On the contrary, I am urging Governor \nDavis and the State legislature to come up with a plan to develop a \nState Disbursement Unit as quickly as possible. But I do not believe \nthat poor families should be severely punished because the State has \nnot gotten its act together.\n  Moreover, California's failure to develop a State Disbursement Unit \nis a direct result of its failure to develop a statewide computer \nsystem that tracks child support cases--and California is already \npaying a penalty for the computer failure.\n  The computer system penalty, which Congress established just last \nyear, is fair and proportionate. More importantly, it rises over time, \ngiving California a powerful incentive to get a computer system up and \nrunning. If California does not have a computer system in place by \n2002, it will lose over $109 million annually in federal funds.\n  It is simply unfair to levy a $4 billion penalty against California \nfor not having a State Disbursement Unit, when the State's failure to \nestablish the unit is a direct result of a computer failure for which \nthe State is already being penalized.\n  The Child Support Penalty Fairness Act would provide that States \ncould not be penalized for failure to develop centralized disbursement \nunits, if they are already paying a penalty for computer-related \nproblems.\n  Under this bill, California would still have to pay a significant \npenalty for its computer-related troubles. Moreover, if California gets \na statewide computer system in place, but still fails to operate a \ncentralized disbursement unit, the State would be subject to additional \nsevere penalties. This provides powerful incentive for the State to \ndevelop both a computer system, and a central disbursement unit, \nquickly.\n  I believe that this bill is proportionate and fair. It will prompt \nthe State of California to develop a State Disbursement Unit in a \ntimely fashion, without placing aid to low income children and families \nat risk. It is simply the right thing to do. I hope that my colleagues \nwill take up and pass the Child Support Penalty Fairness Act as quickly \nas possible.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1033\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nincrease the amount of payment under the Medicare program for pap smear \nlaboratory tests; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n[[Page S5275]]\n\n                INVESTMENT in WOMEN's HEALTH act of 1999\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today marks the 116th birthday of Dr. \nGeorge Papanicolaou, who developed one of the most effective cancer \nscreening tests in medical history--the Pap smear. Cervical cancer was \none of the leading causes of cancer deaths in women in the United \nStates 50 years ago and it is still a major killer of women worldwide. \nI rise today to introduce the Investment in Women's Health Care Act, a \nbipartisan bill to increase the reimbursement for Pap smear laboratory \ntests under the Medicare program. I am pleased to be joined by my \ncolleagues--Senators Snowe, Murray and Collins.\n  The inadequacy of current lab test reimbursement was brought to my \nattention by pathologists who alerted me to the significant cost-\npayment differential for Pap smear testing in Hawaii. According to the \nAmerican Pathology Foundation, Hawaii is one of the 23 States where the \ncost of performing the test greatly exceeds the Medicare payment. In \nHawaii, the cost ranges between $13.04 and $15.80. Yet the Medicare \nreimbursement rate is only $7.15.\n  The large disparity between the reimbursement level and the actual \ncost of performing the test may force labs in Hawaii and around the \nNation to discontinue Pap smear testing. The below-cost reimbursement \nmay compel some labs to process tests faster and in higher volume to \nimprove cost efficiency. This situation increases the risk of \ninaccurate results and can severely handicap patient outcomes.\n  This bill would increase the a reimbursement rate for Pap smear \nlabwork from its current $7.15 to $14.60--the national average cost of \nthe test. This rate is important because it establishes a benchmark for \nmany private insurers.\n  Last year, we were successful in having language included in the \nomnibus appropriations conference report recognizing the large \ndisparity between the costs incurred to provide the screening tests and \nthe amount paid by Medicare. The conferees noted that data from \nlaboratories nationwide indicates that the cost of providing the test \naverages $13.00 to $17.00, with the costs in some areas being higher. \nAccordingly, conferees urged the Health Care Financing Administration \nto increase Medicare reimbursement for Pap smear screening. Although \nHCFA has indicated a willingness to increase this payment, I am \nconcerned that the adjustment the agency is considering may be \nsignificantly less than the costs incurred by most laboratories in \nproviding this service. Therefore, my colleagues and I are compelled to \nreintroduce legislation that would implement what we believe to be an \nappropriate increase.\n  Mr. President, no other cancer screening procedure is as effective \nfor early detection of cancer as the Pap smear. Over the last 50 years, \nthe incidence of cervical cancer deaths has declined by 70 percent due \nin large part to the use of this cancer detection measure. Evidence \nshows that the likelihood of survival when cervical cancer is detected \nin its earliest stage is almost 100 percent, if treatment and follow-up \nis timely. If the Pap smear is to continue as an effective cancer \nscreening tool, it must remain widely available and reasonably priced \nfor all women. Adequate payment is necessary to ensure women's \ncontinued access to quality Pap smears.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important bipartisan \nlegislation. Mr. President, I also ask consent the text of my bill be \nincluded in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord as follows:\n\n                                S. 1034\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Investment in Women's Health \n     Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. INCREASE IN PAYMENT AMOUNT FOR PAP SMEAR LABORATORY \n                   TESTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1833(h) of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 13951(h)) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(7) In no case shall payment under the fee schedule \n     established under paragraph (1) for the laboratory test \n     component of a diagnostic or screening pap smear be less than \n     $14.60.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall apply with respect to laboratory tests furnished on or \n     after January 1, 2000.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague from \nHawaii, Senator Akaka, in introducing the Investment in Women's Health \nAct.\n  Today we celebrate the 116th birthday of Dr. George Papanicolaou, the \nphysician who developed the Pap smear. In the 50 years since Dr. \nPapanicolaou first began using this test, the cervical cancer mortality \nrate has declined by an astonishing 70 percent. There is no question \nthat this test is the most effective cancer screening tool yet \ndeveloped. The Pap smear can detect abnormalities before they develop \ninto cancer. Having an annual Pap smear is one of the most important \nthings a woman can do to help prevent cervical cancer.\n  Congress has recognized the incomparable contribution of the Pap \nsmear in preventing cervical cancer and nine years ago directed \nMedicare to begin covering preventive Pap smears. Medicare \nbeneficiaries are eligible for one test every three years, although a \nmore frequent interval is allowed for women at high risk of developing \ncervical cancer. And through the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Congress \nexpanded the Pap smear benefit to also include a screening pelvic exam \nonce every 3 years.\n  But the Medicare reimbursement rate is artificially low and does not \naccurately reflect the true cost of providing this vital test. The \ncurrent Medicare rate of reimbursement is $7.15, though the mean \nnational cost of the test is twice that amount: $14.60 per test. The \nbill we introduce today, The Investment in Women's Health Act, will \nraise the Medicare reimbursement rate for Pap smears to at least $14.60 \nper test.\n  Women understand the usefulness and life-saving benefit of the Pap \nsmear. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported \nlast year that 95 percent of women age 18 years old and over have \nreceived a Pap smear at some point in their lives. And 85 percent of \nwomen age 18 years and older across the country have received a Pap \nsmear within the last 3 years.\n  Unfortunately, the artificially low reimbursement rate threatens both \nour country's local clinical laboratories and the health of women \nacross the country. Pathologists are increasingly concerned that low \nMedicare reimbursement for Pap smears will force them to stop providing \nthe service and to ship the slides to large out-of-state laboratories. \nShipping the slides to non-local, large-scale laboratories--``Pap \nmills''--reduces quality control, brings up continuity of care issues, \nand puts women at risk of higher rates of ``false positives'' or \n``false negatives.''\n  Providing Pap smears locally facilitates the likelihood of follow-up \nby a pathologist, comparison of a patient's Pap smear to cervical \nbiopsy, and facilitates better communication and consultation between \nthe patient's pathologist and attending physician or clinician. When \nPap smears are shipped out of the local community these vital \ncomparisons are much more difficult to complete and are more prone to \ninconsistencies and error.\n  Inadequate reimbursement for Pap smears provided through Medicare \nthreatens not only a woman's health but the financial stability of the \nlaboratory as well. If a lab is forced to continue to subsidize \nMedicare Pap smears they will eventually either stop providing the \nMedicare service or go out of business--and neither option is \nacceptable. Finally, local laboratories have a proven track record of \nproviding better service for the patients. A Pap smear is less likely \nto get lost in a local lab than among the tens of thousands of other \ntests in a ``Pap mill'' and cytotechnicians have better supervision by \na pathologist in smaller laboratories than in large volume operations.\n  The Pap test has contributed immeasurably to the fight against \ncervical cancer. We cannot risk erasing our advancements in this fight \nbecause of low Medicare reimbursement. I urge my colleagues to join us.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 1035. A bill to establish a program to provide grants to expand \nthe availability of public health dentistry programs in medically \nunderserved areas, health professional shortage areas, and other \nFederally-defined areas that lack\n\n[[Page S5276]]\n\nprimary dental services; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n\n\n                   DENTAL HEALTH ACCESS EXPANSION ACT\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \naddress a troubling--but little recognized--public health problem in \nthis country, and that's access to dental health.\n  Unlike many public health problems, there are clinically proven \ntechniques to prevent or delay the progression of dental health \nproblems. These proven techniques are not only more cost-effective, but \nalso are relatively simple if done early. I'm specifically referring to \nthe use of fluoride and dental sealants. The combination of fluoride \nand sealants is so effective against tooth decay that it has been \nlikened to a ``magic potion.'' In fact, an article in Public Health \nReports called the ``one-two combination of fluoride and sealants . . . \nsimilar to that of vaccinations.''\n  With such an effective prevention method in place, one might assume \nthat dental disease is becoming increasingly rare in this country. But \nthat's not the case, Mr. President, because, in order to receive these \npreventive treatments--this ``magic potion'' against dental disease--\nyou need to see a dentist, and there simply are not enough dentists to \nprovide these basic services to everyone who needs them. As of \nSeptember 30 of last year, the United States had 1,116 dental health \nprofessions shortage areas, or Dental HPSA's according to the Health \nResources and Services Administration. The chart I have here shows the \ncounties in Wisconsin that have areas designated as shortage areas, but \nevery single state in our Nation has a portion designated as a dental \nshortage area.\n  There are proven methods for preventing dental disease, yet 1,116 \ncommunities across our country--particularly underserved rural and \ninner-city communties--do not have enough dentists to provide simple \npreventive services. Barriers to dental care are particularly acute \namong lower income families, Medicaid enrollees, and the uninsured. \nStudies indicate that the prevalence of dental disease increases as \nincome decreases. In many areas, there simply are not enough dentists \nto provide basic treatment to all who need them, and although there is \na federal method for designating such areas as dental health \nprofessional shortage areas (DHPSA's) to become eligible for additional \nfunding, the designation process can be so tedious that State dental \ndirectors simply lack the resources to complete the necessary \ndocumentation.\n  To illustrate this problem of undercounting shortage areas, as of \nSeptember 30 of last year, only eight counties in Wisconsin had \nportions designated as DHPSA's according to the Health Resources and \nServices Administration (HRSA), but statewide only 23 percent of \nMedicaid enrollees had received dental care. As you can see from this \nchart, in 13 Wisconsin counties, fewer than 10 percent of Medicaid \nenrollees received dental care. According to Wisconsin's state dental \ndirector, Dr. Warren LeMay, 80 percent of tooth decay is found in the \npoorest 25 percent of children. Given the effectiveness of dental \nhealth care in preventing dental disease--particularly the combination \nof check-ups, fluoride, and sealants--the access problems are simply \nunacceptable.\n  And the impact of so many people going without dental care is \ndevastating. Those of us who have ever had a toothache remember how \nexcruciating that pain can be, making it difficult if not impossible to \nwork, go to school or otherwise go about our business. For those \nAmericans who lack access to dental services, however, the toothache is \nmore than a bad memory--it is the here and now.\n  Mr. President, imagine you had a child, a daughter, in need of dental \nservices. But you lack insurance, and cannot afford to pay out-of-\npocket to see a dentist. Or you may have Medicaid, but the nearest \ndentist is more than 2 hours away, and you don't own a car. Since your \nchild hasn't received the preventive care treatments, she has a lot of \nuntreated tooth decay--decay that leads to infection, fevers, stomach \naches, and, worst of all, debilitating pain, making it almost \nimpossible for her to concentrate in school. She may also develop \nspeech difficulties, since she may lack the teeth necessary to form \ncertain words and sounds. When you try to get her emergency dental \nservices, you find that the few dentists in the area have waiting lists \nof two months or more.\n\n  Mr. President, one mother, from Rhinelander, WI--which is in Oneida \nCounty in the northern part of my state--called me to tell me about her \n8-year-old daughter in just that situation. He daughter was in \nexcruciating pain because of a severe toothache, but the one dental \nprovider in the area had a waiting list of several weeks, so that \nmother had no choice but to take her child to the nearest hospital \nemergency room, where the child was given painkillers to use until she \ncould be seen by a dentist. Whereas routine primary dental care could \nhave prevented this decay altogether, this mother had to take her young \nchild to the hospital emergency room for prescription painkillers in \norder to make the wait before seeing the dentist bearable.\n  Mr. President, the unfortunate reality is that I hear such stories \nfrom my constituents on a regular basis, and I have heard enough to \nknow that it's time to stop this needless suffering from dental disease \nby increasing access to dental care.\n  The legislation I am introducing today, the Dental Health Access \nExpansion Act, will establish take three important steps to promote \naccess to dental health services:\n  First, the bill creates a federal grant program to be administered by \nthe Health Resources and Services Administration through which \ncommunity health centers and local health departments in designated \ndental health professionals shortage areas can apply for funding to \nassist in the hiring of primary care dentists. Strengthening locally \nrun dental access programs ensures a safety net for these vitally \nimportant services.\n  The bill also creates a grant program to give bonus payments to \ndentists in shortage areas who devote at least 25 percent of their \npractice to Medicaid patients. More than 90 percent of America's \ndentists are in private practice, and incentive payments for dentists \nto increase their Medicaid practice helps to bring needy patients into \nthe dental care mainstream.\n  Finally, the bill requires that HRSA work with the Association of \nState and Territorial Dental Directors and other organizations \ninterested in expanding dental health access to simplify the process \nfor designating dental shortage areas. Right now the system is so \ncomplicated that states simply don't have the resources to fill out the \npaperwork needed to get the designation.\n  Mr. President, the Dental Health Access Expansion Act is meant to \ncomplement existing initiatives--such as Health Professions Training \nProgram expansions of general dentistry residencies, and the National \nHealth Service Corps scholarship program--to increase access to primary \ncare dental services in underserved communities. I have supported these \nand other programs in the past, and will continue to do so. My \nlegislation is also meant to complement the excellent oral health \ninitiatives proposed by my colleague, Senator Bingaman of New Mexico. I \nam thankful for the good work he has done in increasing awareness about \nthis issue, and look forward to working with him to increase access to \ndental health services.\n  Through the legislation I am proposing, we can increase the number of \ndentists providing care to underserved communities, and in doing so \nstrengthen our nation's existing network of Community Health Centers \nand local health departments.\n  Advances in dentistry have given us the tools to eradicate most \ndental diseases--what we need now is to provide people with access to \ndental care so that they can receive the simple preventive treatments \nthey need, and that's what my legislation can help us achieve.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself, Mr. Dodd, and Mr. Rockefeller):\n  S. 1036. A bill to amend parts A and D of title IV of the Social \nSecurity Act to give States the option to pass through directly to a \nfamily receiving assistance under the temporary assistance to needy \nfamilies program all child support collected by the State and the \noption to disregard any child support that the family receives in \ndetermining a family's eligibility for, or\n\n[[Page S5277]]\n\namount of, assistance under that program; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n            children first child support reform act of 1999\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, along \nwith my colleagues Senator Dodd of Connecticut and Senator Rockefeller \nof West Virginia, to provide more resources to America's children and \nfamilies by encouraging more parents to live up to their child support \nobligations. My legislation, the Children First Child Support Reform \nAct, would enhance the options and incentives available to states to \nallow more child support to be paid directly to the families to whom it \nis owed and not be counted against public assistance benefits. My \nlegislation will help assure more noncustodial parents that the child \nsupport they pay will actually contribute to the wellbeing of their \nchild, rather than the government, and also help reduce administrative \nburdens on the state.\n  As my colleagues know, since its inception in 1975, our Federal-State \nChild Support Enforcement Program has been tasked with collecting child \nsupport for families receiving public assistance and other families \nthat request help in enforcing child support. Toward this end, the \nprogram works to establish paternity and legally binding support \norders, while collecting and disbursing funds on behalf of families so \nthat children receive the support they need to grow up in healthy, \nnurturing surroundings.\n  But on one crucial point, the current program does not truly work on \nbehalf of families and, perhaps more importantly, actually works \nagainst families.\n  Under current law, if a family is not on public assistance, support \ncollected by the Child Support Enforcement Program is generally sent \ndirectly to the family. However, and this is the crux of the problem, \nsupport collected on behalf of families receiving public assistance is \nkept by the State and Federal Governments as reimbursement for welfare \nexpenditures. Thus, for families on public assistance, the child \nsupport program ends up benefiting the financial interests of the \ngovernment, rather than their children.\n  The research shows that many noncustodial parents are discouraged \nfrom paying child support because they realize and resent the fact that \ntheir payments go to the government rather than benefiting their \nchildren directly. In addition, some custodial parents are skeptical \nabout working with the child support agency to secure payments since \nthe funds are generally not forwarded to them. Obviously, these builtin \nprogram obstacles to reliable, timely child support payments serve to \nundermine the program's intended goals of promoting self-sufficiency \nand personal responsibility.\n  Mr. President, we know that an estimated 800,000 families would not \nneed public assistance if they could count on the child support owed to \nthem. In addition, we know that 23 million children are owed more than \n$43 billion in outstanding support. Clearly, the vital importance of \nchild support in keeping families off of assistance remains as true \ntoday as when the program began. In a world with TANF time limits, it \nhas never been more important. And with these figures in mind, it is \nnot unthinkable that some policymakers may have or might still consider \nthis program as a means of recovering welfare expenditures.\n  But I am convinced that that thinking must change, if not be cast off \nentirely, because, simply put, times have changed. The welfare reform \nlaw of 1996, which I supported, paved the way for time limits and work \nrequirements that provide clear and compelling incentives for families \nto enter the workforce and find a way to stay there. Open ended, \nunconditional public support is no longer a reality, and our goal and \nresponsibility as policymakers, now more than ever before, is to give \nfamilies the tools and resources they need to prepare for and \nultimately survive the day when they are without public assistance.\n  We fundamentally changed welfare, now we fundamentally reexamine the \ncentral role of child support in helping families as they struggle to \nbecome and remain self-sufficient. To this end, we've made some, but \nnot nearly enough, progress. Under the welfare reform law, states will \neventually be required to distribute state-collected child support \narrears owed to the family before paying off arrears owed to the state \nand Federal governments for welfare expenditures. In addition, states \nwere provided with some ability to continue or expand the $50 \npassthrough that had been required under previous law. But only one \nstate--my homestate of Wisconsin--has opted to let families retain all \nsupport paid. As you know, Wisconsin has been a leader and national \nmodel in the area of welfare reform. Under Wisconsin's welfare program, \nchild support counts as income in determining financial eligibility for \nwelfare assistance, but once eligibility is established, the child \nsupport income is disregarded in calculating program benefits. In other \nwords, families are allowed to keep their own money. Non-custodial \nparents can be assured that their contribution counts and that their \nchild support payments go to their children. And both parents are \npresented with a realistic picture of what that support means in the \nlife of their child.\n  I worked with Wisconsin to secure the waivers necessary to pursue \nthis innovative policy and want to provide the other states with \nadditional flexibility and options so that they can follow Wisconsin's \nexample.\n  In addition to helping families, the expanded passthrough and \ndisregard approach also has significant benefits on the administrative \nside. The current distribution requirements place significant \naccounting and paperwork burdens on the states. They are also costly. \nData from the Federal Office of Child Support demonstrates that nearly \n20 percent of program expenditures are spent simply processing \npayments. States are required to maintain a complicated set of accounts \nto determine whether support collected should be paid to the family or \nkept by the government. These complex accounting rules depend on \nwhether the family ever received public assistance, the date a family \nbegins and ends assistance, whether the non-custodial parent is current \non payments or owes arrears, the method of collection and other \nfactors.\n  We know that we have already asked much of the states in the realm of \nautomation, systems integration and welfare law child support \nenforcement adjustments. We hope and believe these improvements will \nlead to better collection rates. Now we have a chance to simplify and \nimprove distribution of support. What could be simpler than a \ndistribution system in which child support collected would \nautomatically be delivered to the children to whom it is owed? A \ndistribution system in which child support agencies would distribute \ncurrent support and arrears to both welfare and non-welfare families in \nexactly the same way?\n  Mr. President, child support financing must be addressed in the near \nfuture. First, our current distribution scheme is out of step with the \nphilosophy of current welfare policy. We must move the child support \nprogram from cost-recovery to service delivery for all families. \nSecond, the current financing scheme is no longer workable. TANF \ncaseloads are decreasing dramatically, even as overall child support \ncaseloads are increasing. Therefore, while the system needs additional \nresources, the portion of the caseload that produces those resources is \ndecreasing. We must put the child support program on a sound financial \nfooting that confirms a strong Federal and state commitment to the \nprogram and gives states additional flexibility to put more resources \ninto the hands of children and let families keep more of their own \nmoney.\n\n  Let me strongly affirm that by advocating an expanded passthrough and \ndisregard approach, I am absolutely not advocating a disinvestment in \nour child support system by either the Federal government or the \nstates. Our commitment to this program must remain strong and \nsteadfast. I am working to expand the passthrough for the reasons that \nI've explained, but I am also committed to paying for it in a \nresponsible way. Not knowing what the proposal will cost today \nnecessarily requires that we keep ourselves open to adjustments as the \ndebate proceeds.\n  That said, it is time for us to envision a child support program that \ntruly serves families and works to advance, not undermine, the TANF \npolicy goals of self-sufficiency and personal responsibility with which \nit is inextricably\n\n[[Page S5278]]\n\ncombined. Because assistance is now time-limited, we must give families \nthe tools to survive in a world without public help, a world where they \nmust rely on their own resources. In that equation, we all know that \nchild support is fundamental. Letting as many as 5 years go by with \nchild support payments either not being or accuring to the state rather \nthan the family does nothing to advance those goals.\n  Mr. President, it's time to put our children first and envision a \nchild support program that truly serves families. We can do that by \npassing this legislation to improve the public system, let families \nkeep more of their own money, and make child support truly meaningful \nin the everyday lives of children on public assistance.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1036\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Toxic Substances Control Act to provide \nfor a gradual reduction in the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce \nlegislation to nationally phase-out the use of the fuel oxygenate \nmethyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE). My bill provides for a priority \nphase-out schedule designed to immediately prohibit MTBE use in areas \nwhere it is leaking into ground and surface waters, to prevent the \nspread of MTBE to areas where its use is currently limited or \nnonexistent, and to set us on a course to removing MTBE in all other \nareas of the nation.\n  MTBE has been used in the blending of gasoline since the 1970s, but \nits use increased dramatically following the passage of the Clean Air \nAct Amendments of 1990. In regions of the country with particularly \npoor air quality, including Southern California and Sacramento, the Act \nrequired the use of reformulated gasoline.\n  Under the Act, reformulated gasoline must contain 2% oxygenate by \nweight.\n  Today, about 70% of the gasoline sold in California contains 2% \noxygen by weight due to this requirement. While other oxygenates like \nethanol may be used to meet this 2% requirement, the ready availability \nof MTBE and its chemical properties made it the oxygenate of choice \namong most oil companies.\n  While the oxygenate of choice, however, MTBE is also classified as a \npossible human carcinogen. Moreover, when MTBE enters groundwater, it \nmoves through the water very fast and very far. Once there, MTBE \nresists degrading in the environment. We know very little about how \nlong it takes to break down to the point that it becomes harmless. We \ndo know that at even very low levels, MTBE causes water to take on the \ntaste and odor of turpentine--rendering it undrinkable.\n  That is, it makes water smell and taste so bad that people won't \ndrink it.\n  I first became aware of the significance of the threat MTBE posed to \ndrinking water following the discovery that MTBE had contaminated \ndrinking water wells in Santa Monica. Ultimately, Santa Monica was \nforced to close drinking water wells that supplied approximately half \nof its drinking water due to that contamination. Clean up of Santa \nMonica's drinking water supply continues today under the oversight of \nthe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at significant cost.\n  Following that discovery, I held a California field hearing of the \nSenate Committee on Environment and Public Works, of which I am a \nmember, on the issue of MTBE contamination. Based upon the testimony I \nreceived at that hearing, I became convinced that MTBE posed a \nsignificant threat to drinking water not only in California, but \nnationwide. Shortly after the hearing, I wrote what would be one of \nmany letters to the Administrator of EPA urging her to take action to \nremove this threat to the nation's drinking water supply.\n  While EPA has taken many laudable actions to speed the remediation of \nMTBE contaminated drinking water, it has been slow to respond to my \ncalls for a nationwide MTBE phase-out. EPA maintains that it lacks the \nlegal authority to phase-out the use of this harmful gasoline additive.\n  In the face of this federal inaction, and since the discovery of MTBE \ncontamination in Santa Monica and my\n\n[[Page S5279]]\n\nhearing in California, revelations of MTBE contamination in California \nand the nation have proliferated. In June 1998, the Lawrence Livermore \nNational Laboratory estimated that MTBE is leaking from over 10,000 \nunderground storage tanks in California alone. Potential clean up costs \nassociated with MTBE contamination in my state range between $1 to $2 \nbillion. Reports of MTBE contamination in the northeastern United \nStates are also now becoming more common, and several state \nlegislatures have introduced legislation to phase-out or ban MTBE use.\n  This flurry of activity in the northeastern states follows upon the \nfirst state action to prohibit the use of MTBE. Specifically, on March \n26, 1999, California Governor Gray Davis provided that MTBE use in \nCalifornia will be prohibited after December 31, 2002.\n  While the action in California and several other states to begin to \naddress the MTBE problem is certainly to be commended, I believe it \ndemonstrates a failure of federal policymakers to design a national \nsolution to what is clearly a national problem.\n  The legislation I introduce today would provide that solution.\n  First, my bill empowers the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to \nimmediately prohibit MTBE use in areas where the additive is leaking \ninto ground or surface waters. In my view, we must swiftly stop the use \nof MTBE in areas where we know we've got leaking underground storage \ntanks. That's just common sense.\n  Second, my bill prohibits the use of MTBE after January 1, 2000 in \nareas around the nation where the use of oxygenates like MTBE is not \nrequired by law. It has been recently revealed that oil companies have \nbeen adding significant quantities of MTBE to gasoline in the San \nFrancisco area even though oxygenates like MTBE are not required to be \nused in that area. Notwithstanding California's MTBE phase-out, such \nMTBE use may legally continue throughout California until the state \nphase-out deadline of December 31, 2002.\n  As we face an estimated $1 to $2 billion in MTBE clean up costs in \nCalifornia alone, I believe we must swiftly take steps to prevent the \nspread of MTBE contamination to areas where its use is currently \nlimited and is in no sense required under the law.\n  Third, the bill prohibits MTBE use nationwide after January 1, 2003, \nand provides for specific binding percentage reductions of MTBE use in \nthe interim. Finally, the bill requires EPA to conduct an environmental \nand health effects study of ethanol use as a fuel additive.\n  I am hopeful that my House and Senate colleagues can act quickly to \nensure the passage of my legislation to provide a nationwide solution \nto the nationwide problem of MTBE contamination.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my legislation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1037\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to permit \ncertain members of the Armed Forces not currently participating in the \nMontgomery GI Bill educational assistance program to participate in \nthat program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans \nAffairs.\n\n\n                  gi education opportunity act of 1999\n\n   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation \nthat will assist the men and women serving in our armed forces in \nattaining an education. The GI Education Opportunity Act is targeted at \na group serving in our military that has been forgotten since the \npassage of the Montgomery GI Bill. Before the GI Bill was enacted in \n1985, new servicemen were invited to participate in a program called \nthe Veterans' Educational Assistance Program, or VEAP. This program \noffered only a modest return on the service member's investment and, as \na consequence, provided little assistance to men and women in the armed \nservices who wanted to pursue additional education. It was and is \ninferior to the Montgomery GI Bill that every new serviceman is offered \ntoday.\n  The GI Education Opportunity Act would allow active duty members of \nthe armed services who entered the service after December 31, 1976 and \nbefore July 1, 1985 and who are or were otherwise eligible for the \nVeterans' Educational Assistance Program to participate in the \nMontgomery GI Bill. This group of military professionals largely \nconsists of the mid-career and senior noncommissioned officer ranks of \nour services--the exact group that new recruits have as mentors and \nleaders. If we really believe in the importance of providing our \nservicemen and women with the education opportunities afforded by the \nMontgomery GI Bill, it is critical that we offer all service members \nthe opportunity to participate of they choose.\n  It is important to remember that much of the impetus for the creation \nof the Montgomery GI Bill was that the Veterans' Educational Assistance \nProgram was not doing the job. It was not providing sufficient \nassistance for young men and women to go to college. It was expensive \nfor them to participate, and provided little incentive for young men \nand women to enter the military. The Montgomery GI Bill offers those \nserving in the military a significant increase in benefits over its \npredecessor and has been one of the most important recruiting tools \nover the last decade. It is essential that active military still \ncovered under VEAP but not by the Montgomery GI Bill be brought into \nthe fold.\n  The injustice that my bill attempts to address is that new recruits \nare eligible for a better education program than the noncommissioned \nofficers responsible for their training and well-being. Expanding \nMontgomery Bill eligibility to those currently eligible for VEAP would, \nin many cases, help mid-career and senior noncommissioned officers, who \nare the backbone of our force and set the example for younger troops, \nbecome better educated. This legislation is modest in its scope and \napproach, but is enormously important\n\n[[Page S5280]]\n\nfor the individual attempting to better himself through education. \nMoreover, this legislation sends a meaningful message to those serving \nto protect the American interest that Congress cares. S. 4, the \nSoldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines Bill of Rights Act which I was \nproud to cosponsor was an enormous step in this direction, and my \nlegislation complements that effort.\n  Some of the common sense provisions of The GI Education Opportunity \nAct are: 1. Regardless of previous enrollment or disenrollment in the \nVEAP, active military personnel may choose to participate in the GI \nBill. 2. Participation for VEAP-eligible members in the GI Bill is to \nbe based on the same ``buy in requirements'' as are currently \napplicable to any new GI Bill participant. For example, an active duty \nmember is required to pay $100 a month for twelve months in order to be \neligible for the Montgomery GI Bill. The same would be required of \nsomeone previously eligible for VEAP. 3. Any active duty member who has \npreviously declined participation in the GI bill may also participate. \n4. There will be a one year period of eligibility for enrollment.\n  I believe that if we are to maintain the best trained, and most \ncapable military force in the world, we must be committed to allowing \nthe people that comprise our armed forces to pursue further education \nopportunities. I believe that this modest legislation will have a \npositive effect on morale and give our noncommissioned officers \nadditional opportunities for self-improvement and life-long learning. I \nask for my colleagues support in this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Domenici, Mr. \n        Bingaman, Mr. Lott, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Thomas, Mr. \n        Brownback, and Mr. Gramm):\n  S. 1042. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nencourage domestic oil and gas production, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n       DOMESTIC ENERGY PRODUCTION SECURITY AND STABILIZATION ACT\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce \nwith my colleague from Louisiana, Senator Breaux, the Domestic Energy \nProduction Security and Stabilization Act. This bill represents a \nnecessary and workable proposal to ensure that the United States does \nnot lose even more of its energy independence.\n  Mr. President, the oil and gas industry in this country is in a state \nof unprecedented crisis. Over the last year-and-a-half, oil and gas \nprices have been a historic lows. This has led to the closing of over \n200,000 domestic oil and gas wells, has brought new exploration to a \nvirtual standstill, and has cost an estimated quarter of a million \nAmerican jobs.\n  Not only is this an economic issue, it is also a national security \nissue. We are importing more oil than we produce. This is not a healthy \nsituation for shaping our foreign policy agenda. If our domestic \nindustry is to survive, then Congress needs to act now to provide tax \nincentives to encourage energy production in America.\n  To reverse these trends and increase our energy independence, I have \nworked on a bipartisan basis to develop the Domestic Energy Production \nSecurity and Stabilization Act. The bill provides tax incentives in our \nsignificant areas to ensure that our domestic energy infrastructure is \nnot decimated during prolonged periods of low energy prices.\n  First, the legislation would provide a $3 dollar a barrel tax credit, \non the first three barrels that can offset the cost of keeping marginal \nwells operating during periods of critically low oil and gas prices. \nMarginal wells are those that produce 15 barrels a day or less. There \nare close to 500,000 such wells across the U.S. that collectively \nproduce 20 percent of America's oil, more oil than we import from Saudi \nArabia.\n  Second, the bill would provide some relief from the alternative \nminimum tax (AMT), again during prolonged periods of low energy prices. \nIn a time of financial crisis for the oil and gas industry, this tax \nhas had the effect of exacerbating the impact of low commodity prices \nand driving even more producers out of business. The AMT was enacted to \nensure that companies reporting large financial income paid at least \nsome level of taxes. Unfortunately, for the oil and gas industry, the \nAMT has only served to make a bad situation worse.\n  Third, Mr. President, this legislation would change the net income \nlimitation on percentage depletion by eliminating the 65 percent \ntaxable income limitation. Carried-over percentage depletion could also \nbe carried back ten years. This would enable companies to fully utilize \ntheir percentage depletion allowance, which many have not been able to \ndo since the onset of the oil and gas crisis.\n  Finally, Mr. President, this bill brings the U.S. Tax Code in line \nwith the present-day realities of the oil and gas industry by allowing \noil and gas exploration (geological and geophysical) costs to be \nexpensed rather than capitalized, and by allowing delay rental lease \npayments to be deducted in the year in which they are paid, rather than \nwhen the oil is actually pumped. Even the Treasury Department has \ntacitly endorsed these proposed changes as making for sound economic \nand tax policy.\n  Taken together, these four major tax provisions will help the job-\ncreating oil and gas sector of the economy to withstand the volatility \nof the international oil and gas markets. We simply must not allow our \nnation to become even more dependent on foreign oil. Nor can we afford \nto shut-down our domestic gas production capability, particularly since \nnatural gas consumption is expected to grow rapidly in the near future, \nand, unlike oil, natural gas is not imported.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is long overdue, and I appreciate the \nsupport of Senator Breaux and my other colleagues who are cosponsoring \nthe bill. Most importantly, I urge my other colleagues, particularly \nthose from non-energy producing states, to join with us in supporting \nthis effort. America simply has too much at stake to stand by and let \nour domestic oil and gas industry jobs and infrastructure be lost to \nthe whims of the world markets.\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the \ndistinguished Senator from the State of Texas. Senator Hutchinson, in \nintroducing the Domestic Energy Production Security and Stabilization \nAct. I believe it is legislation all of our colleagues should support.\n  First, I'd like to outline the problem and then discuss how this \nlegislation helps address it. Oil prices may be in the early stages of \nrecovery, but over the last 17 months, a glut in the world market \nforced crude oil prices down to their lowest inflation-adjusted levels \nin 50 years. The Independent Petroleum Association of America estimates \nthat, since November 1997, when the price of oil began to decline, more \nthan 136,000 crude oil wells and more than 57,000 natural gas wells \nhave been shut down.\n  The U.S. petroleum industry last year lost almost 30,000 jobs because \nof falling crude prices, according to the American Petroleum \nInstitute's annual report. Despite the recent rise in oil prices, job \nlosses continue. Another 3,600 jobs were lost between February and \nMarch. This brings the loss since December 1997 to about 54,400 jobs, a \ndecline of 16 percent. In the first three months of 1999, losses \namounted to about 24,000 jobs, or a drop of almost 8 percent.\n  Mr. President, independent producers account for almost a third of \nGulf of Mexico oil production on the outer continental shelf (OCS), and \nalmost half of natural gas production. According to the Minerals \nManagement Service, on a per-day basis, the OCS accounts for 27 percent \nof the nation's natural gas production and 20 percent of the nation's \ncrude oil production. In 1997, production on the federal OCS off \nLouisiana resulted in $2.9 billion or 83 percent of the $3.5 billion \nroyalties received for all of the OCS. It is not difficult to see that \nas domestic production falls, so will federal royalty receipts.\n  And, let's not forget the thousands of jobs created in non-energy \nsectors to service the energy industry: computers, steel and other \nmetals, transportation, financial and other service industries. When \ndomestic oil and gas production increases, so does the number of jobs \ncreated in all these sectors.\n  This legislation will provide marginal well tax credits, alternative \nminimum tax relief, expensing of geological and geophysical costs and \ndelay\n\n[[Page S5281]]\n\nrental payments and other measures to encourage domestic oil and gas \nproduction. It is a safety net. The bill's provisions phase in and out \nas oil prices fall and rise between $17 and $14 per barrel and natural \ngas prices fall and rise between $1.86 and $1.56 per thousand cubic \nfeet. It will provide a permanent mechanism to help our domestic \nproducers cope with substantial and unexpected declines in world energy \nprices.\n\n  Let's examine how one aspect of this bill--marginal well production--\naffects this nation. A marginal well is one that producers 15 barrels \nof oil per day or 60,000 cubic feet of natural gas or less. Low prices \nhit marginal wells especially hard because they typically have low \nprofit margins. While each well produces only a small amount, marginal \nwells account for almost 25 percent of the oil and 8 percent of the \nnatural gas produced in the continental United States. The United \nStates has more than 500,000 marginal wells that collectively produce \nnearly 700 million barrels of oil each year. These marginal wells \ncontribute nearly $14 billion a year in economic activity. The marginal \nwell industry is responsible for more than 38,000 jobs and supports \nthousands of jobs outside the industry.\n  The National Petroleum Council is a federal advisory committee to the \nSecretary of Energy. Its sole purpose is to advise, inform, and make \nrecommendations to the Secretary of Energy on any matter requested by \nthe Secretary with relating to oil and natural gas or to the oil and \nnatural gas industries. The National Petroleum Council's 1994 Marginal \nWell Report said that:\n\n       Preseving marginal wells is central to our energy security. \n     Neither government nor the industry can set the global market \n     price of crude oil. Therefore, the nation's internal cost \n     structure must be relied upon for preserving marginal well \n     contributions.\n\nThe 1994 Marginal Well Report went on to recommend a series of tax code \nmodifications including a marginal well tax credit and expensing key \ncapital expenditures. The Independent Petroleum Association of America \nestimates that as many of half the estimated 140,000 marginal wells \nclosed in the last 17 months could be lost for good.\n  Mr. President, the facts speak for themselves. The U.S. share of \ntotal world crude oil production fell from 52 percent in 1950 to just \n10 percent in 1997. At the same time, U.S. dependence on foreign oil \nhas grown from 36 percent in 1973 (the time of the Arab oil embargo) to \nabout 56 percent today. That makes the U.S. more vulnerable than ever--\neconomically and militarily--to disruptions in foreign oil supplies. \nThis legislation will provide a mechanism to help prevent a further \ndecline in domestic energy production and preserve a vital domestic \nindustry.\n Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Kay \nBailey Hutchison and a number of other colleagues in the introduction \nof legislation which we believe will provide critically needed relief \nand assistance to our beleaguered domestic oil industry.\n  Our bill contains a number of incentives designed to increase \ndomestic production of oil and gas. The decline in domestic oil \nproduction has resulted in the estimated loss of more than 40,000 jobs \nin the oil and gas industry since the crash of oil prices at the end of \n1997. Our legislation will not only put people back to work, it will \nrevitalize domestic energy production and decrease our dependence on \nimports.\n  I have sought relief for the oil and gas industry from a number of \nsources this year. As a member of the Senate Budget Committee, I \nstrongly opposed the $4 billion tax which the Clinton budget proposed \nto levy on the oil industry. As my colleagues know, that tax is now \ndead.\n  Earlier this year I contacted Secretary of State Madeleine Albright \nand urged her to conduct a thorough review of our current policy which \npermits Iraq to sell $5.25 billion worth of oil every six months. The \nrevenue generated from such sales is supposed to be used to purchase \nfood and medicine but reports make it clear that Saddam Hussein has \ndiverted these funds from their intended use and that they are being \nused to prop up his murderous regime. The United States should not be a \nparty to such a counterproductive policy.\n  Senator Hutchison and I earlier this year introduced legislation \nwhich contained a series of tax law changes intended to spur marginal \nwell production. The legislation which we introduce today contains \nthose provisions as well as others, such as reducing the impact of the \nAlternative Minimum Tax (AMT) on the oil and gas industry and relaxing \nthe existing constraints on use of the allowance for percentage \ndepletion.\n  I am looking forward to working with my colleagues in an effort to \nenact the legislation as soon as possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 1043. A bill to provide freedom from regulation by the Federal \nCommunications Commission for the Internet; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/13/senate-section/article/S5281-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5281-S5305]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE INTERNET REGULATORY FREEDOM ACT\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce The Internet \nRegulatory Freedom Act of 1999. This legislation will help assure that \nthe enormous benefits of advanced telecommunications services are \naccessible to all Americans, no matter where they live, what they do, \nor how much they earn.\n  Advanced telecommunications is a critical component of our economic \nand social well-being. Information technology now accounts for over \none-third of our economic growth. The estimates are that advanced, \nhigh-speed Internet services, once fully deployed, will grow to a $150 \nbillion a year market.\n  What this means is simple: Americans with access to high-speed \nInternet service will get the best of what the Internet has to offer in \nthe way of on-line commerce, advanced interactive educational services, \ntelemedicine, telecommuting, and video-on-demand. But what it also \nmeans is that Americans who don't have access to high-speed Internet \nservice won't enjoy these same advantages.\n  Mr. President, Congress cannot stand idly by and allow that to \nhappen.\n  Advanced high-speed data service finally gives us the means to assure \nthat all Americans really are given a fair shake in terms of economic, \nsocial, and educational opportunities. Information Age \ntelecommunications can serve as a great equalizer, eliminating the \ndisadvantages of geographic isolation and socioeconomic status that \nhave carried over from the Industrial Age. But unless these services \nare available to all Americans on fair and affordable terms, Industrial \nAge disadvantages will be perpetuated, not eliminated, in the \nInformation Age.\n  As things now stand, however, the availability of advanced high-speed \ndata service on fair and affordable terms is seriously threatened. \nCurrently, only 2 percent of all American homes are served by networks \ncapable of providing high-speed data service. Of this tiny number, most \nget high-speed Internet access through cable modems. This is a \ncomparatively costly service --about $500 per year --and most cable \nmodem subscribers are unable to use their own Internet service provider \nunless they also buy the same service from the cable system's own \nInternet service provider. This arrangement puts high-speed Internet \nservice beyond the reach of Americans not served by cable service, and \nlimits the choices available to those who are.\n  If this situation is allowed to continue, many Americans who live in \nremote areas or who don't make a lot of money won't get high-speed \nInternet service anywhere near as fast as others will. And, given how \ncritical high-speed data service is becoming to virtually every segment \nof our everyday lives, creating advanced Internet ``haves'' and ``have \nnots'' will perpetuate the very social inequalities that our laws \notherwise seek to eliminate.\n  This need not happen. Our nation's local telephone company lines go \nto almost every home in America, and local telephone companies are \nready and willing to upgrade them to provide advanced high-speed data \nservice.\n  They are ready and willing, Mr. President, but they are not able--at \nleast, not as fully able as the cable companies are. That's because the \nlocal telephone companies operate under unique legal and regulatory \nrestrictions. These restrictions are designed\n\n[[Page S5282]]\n\nto limit their power in the local voice telephone market, but they are \nmistakenly being applied to the entirely different advanced data \nmarket. And as a result, their ability to build out these networks and \noffer these services is significantly circumscribed.\n  Mr. President, it's very expensive for to build high-speed data \nnetworks. Unnecessary regulation increases this already-steep cost and \nthereby limits the deployment of services to people and places that \nmight otherwise receive them--and many of them are people and places \nthat won't otherwise be served. This legislation will get rid of this \nunnecessary regulation, thereby facilitating the buildout of the \nadvanced data networks necessary to give more Americans access to high-\nspeed Internet service at a cheaper price and with a greater array of \nservice possibilities.\n  That's called ``competition,'' Mr. President, and some people don't \nlike it very much. AT, for example, owns cable TV giant TCI and its \nproprietary Internet service provider @Home. AT doesn't face the same \nregulatory restrictions as the telephone companies do, and AT will \nfight furiously to retain these restrictions so that it can continue to \nenjoy the ``first-move'' advantage it now has in the market for high-\nspeed Internet service. So will other local telephone company \ncompetitors such as MCI/Worldcom, many of whom, like AT, prefer \ngaming the regulatory process to competing in the marketplace.\n  They're right about one thing, Mr. President--competition sure isn't \nnice. It's tough. Some companies win, and some companies lose. But the \nimportant thing to me is this: with competition, consumers win.\n  The 1996 Telecommunications Act effectively nationalized telephone \nindustry competition. That's one of the many reasons I voted against \nit. As subsequent events have shown, the Act has been a complete and \nutter failure insofar as most Americans are concerned. All the average \nconsumer has gotten are higher prices for many existing services, with \nlittle or no new competitive offerings. Most of the advantages have \naccrued to gigantic, constantly-merging telecommunications companies \nand the big business customers they serve.\n  Mr. President, we must not let this misguided law produce the same \nmisbegotten results when it comes to making high-speed data services \navailable and affordable to all Americans. The service is too \nimportant, and the stakes are too high.\n  Even the former Soviet Union managed to recognize that centralized \nplanning was a flat failure, and abandoned it decades ago. It's time we \nstarted doing the same with centralized competition planning under the \n1996 Act, and advanced data services are the best place to start. \nUnfettered competition, not federally-micromanaged regulation, is the \nbest way of making sure that high-speed data services will be widely \navailable and affordable. That's what I want, that's what consumers \ndeserve, and that's what this legislation will do.\n  The first is the fact that the high-speed cable modem service being \nrolled out by AT on many of the nation's cable television systems \nfavors its own proprietary Internet service provider, which limits \nconsumer choice. Although AT's cable customers can access AOL or \nother Internet service providers of their own choice, they must first \npass through, and pay for, AT's own Internet service provider, @Home. \nThe fact that it typically costs around $500 a year to subscribe to \n@Home is a big disincentive to paying even more to access another \nservice provider.\n  The second problem is every bit as troubling. Even though cable \nsubscribers have only limited choice in accessing high-speed Internet \nservice, 98 percent of Americans are even worse off, because they \naren't served by any network that can carry high-speed Internet \nservices.\n  Obviously, Mr. President, telephone networks serve almost everybody, \nand the large telephone companies very much want to convert their \nnetworks and make these services available to subscribers who might not \notherwise get them, especially in rural and low-income areas, and also \nprovide competitive alternatives for AT's cable modem subscribers. \nBut, although AT can roll out cable modem service in a virtually \nregulation-free environment, federal regulation significantly impedes \nthe ability of telephone companies to do the same thing.\n  Mr. President, this is blatantly unfair to the telephone companies--\nbut that's not the worst of it. The benefits of business development, \nemployment, and economic growth will go where the advanced data \nnetworks go. If these benefits go to urbanized, high-income areas \nfirst, the resulting disparities may well be difficult, if not \nimpossible, to equalize.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1043\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require coverage for colorectal cancer screenings; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n              the eliminate colorectal cancer act of 1999\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today we are introducing a bill \nthat will require all private insurers to provide coverage for \nscreening tests for colorectal cancer. More than 56,000 Americans die \nfrom colon cancer each year and we know that the vast majority of these \ntragedies could have been prevented by early detection and treatment.\n  Millions of Americans are at risk of contracting colon cancer during \ntheir lifetime. Persons over age 50 are particularly vulnerable, and so \nare family members of those who have had this illness. Effective \ntreatments are well-established for this disease, but it must be \ndetected early in order for the treatment to be successful.\n  Unfortunately, fewer than 20 percent of Americans take advantage of \nthe routine screening tests that can identify those who have the \ndisease or who are at risk. Too many physicians fail to recommend or \neven mention it. The cost of screening those at risk is minor compared \nto the savings gained by reducing the overall costs of treatment, \nsuffering, lost productivity, and premature death.\n  As many colon cancer survivors have told us, early recognition and \ntreatment are essential to winning this battle. Over 90% of people who \nhave been\n\n[[Page S5283]]\n\ndiagnosed as a result of these screening tests and then treated for \nthis cancer have resumed active and productive lives.\n  People on Medicare already have the right to these screening tests. \nThe legislation we are introducing today will extend the same benefit \nto everyone else who has private insurance coverage. Under our \nproposal, coverage for screening tests will be available to anyone over \nage 50, and also to younger persons who are at risk for the disease or \nwho have specific symptoms. The type of tests and frequency of tests \nwould be determined by the doctor and the patient. This is a very \nreasonable and cost-effective measure that is essential to prevent \nthousands of unnecessary deaths.\n  Our bill has already received support and endorsements from all the \nmajor gastrointestinal professional organizations, the American Cancer \nSociety, the American Gastroenterological Association, the Cancer \nResearch Foundation of America, the American Society for \nGastrointestinal Endoscopy, the American Society of Colon and Rectal \nSurgeons, STOP Colon and Rectal Cancer Foundation, the United Ostomy \nAssociation, the Colon Cancer Alliance, Cancer Care, Inc., and the \nAmerican Association of Homes and Services for the Aging.\n  A companion bill is being introduced in the House with the bipartisan \nleadership of my respected colleagues, Congresswomen Louise Slaughter \nand Connie Morella. They have rightly emphasized that this disease is \none that affects women as much as men. I look forward to working with \nthem and my colleagues here in the Senate to get this very important \nprotective legislation passed.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAFEE (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Grassley, Mr. \n        Rockefeller, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Kerrey, and Mr. Robb):\n  S. 1045. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to impose \nan excise tax on persons who acquire structured settlement payments in \nfactoring transactions, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                  structured settlement protection act\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Structured \nSettlement Protection Act, together with Senators Baucus, Grassley, \nRockefeller, Breaux, and Kerrey of Nebraska. Companion legislation has \nbeen introduced in the House as H.R. 263, sponsored by Representatives \nClay Shaw and Pete Stark and a broad bipartisan group of Members of the \nHouse Ways and Means Committee.\n  The Act protects structured settlements and the injured victims who \nare the recipients of the structured settlement payments from the \nproblems caused by a growing practice known as structured settlement \nfactoring.\n  Structured settlements were developed because of the pitfalls \nassociated with the traditional lump sum form of recovery in serious \npersonal injury cases. All too often a lump sum meant to last for \ndecades or even a lifetime swiftly eroded away. Structured settlements \nhave proven to be a very valuable tool. They provide long-term \nfinancial security in the form of an assured stream of payments to \npersons suffering serious, often profoundly disabling, physical \ninjuries. These payments enable the recipients to meet ongoing medical \nand basic living expenses without having to resort to the social safety \nnet.\n  Congress has adopted special tax rules to encourage and govern the \nuse of structured settlements in physical injury cases. By encouraging \nthe use of structured settlements Congress sought to shield victims and \ntheir families from pressures to prematurely dissipate their \nrecoveries. Structured settlement payments are non-assignable. This is \nconsistent with worker's compensation payments and various types of \nfederal disability payments which are also non-assignable under \napplicable law. In each case, this is done to preserve the injured \nperson's long-term financial security.\n  I am very concerned that in recent months there has been sharp growth \nin so-called structured settlement factoring transactions. In these \ntransactions, companies induce injured victims to sell off future \nstructured settlement payments for a steeply-discounted lump sum, \nthereby unraveling the structured settlement and the crucial long-term \nfinancial security that it provides to the injured victim. These \nfactoring company purchases directly contravene the intent and policy \nof Congress in enacting the special structured settlement tax rules. \nThe Treasury Department shares these concerns and has included a \nsimilar proposal in the Administration's FY 2000 budget.\n  An article in the January 25 issue of U.S. News & World Report \nhighlights the growing problem of structured settlement purchases. \nOrion Olson was bitten by a dog when he was three years old. The dog \nbite caused him vision and neurological problems. The settlement \nresulting from his lawsuit called for Mr. Olson to receive $75,000 in \nperiodic payments once he turned 18. Unfortunately, Mr. Olson was lured \ninto selling his payments for a lump sum payment of $16,100. Within six \nmonths this money was gone and Mr. Olson was living in a car.\n  Last year, the National Spinal Cord Injury Association wrote to the \nChairman of the Finance Committee strongly supporting the legislation. \nThey stated: [o]ver the past 16 years, structured settlements have \nproven to be an ideal method for ensuring that persons with \ndisabilities, particularly minors, are not tempted to squander \nresources designed to last years or even a lifetime. That is why the \nNational Spinal Cord Injury Association is so deeply concerned about \nthe emergence of companies that purchase payments intended for disabled \npersons at drastic discount. This strikes at the heart of the security \nCongress intended when it created structured settlements.''\n  The legislation we are introducing would impose a substantial penalty \ntax on a factoring company that purchases the structured settlement \npayments from the injured victim. This is a penalty, not a tax \nincrease. Similar penalties are imposed in a variety of other contexts \nin the Internal Revenue Code to discourage transactions that undermine \nCode provisions, such as private foundation prohibited transactions and \ngreenmail. The factoring company would pay the penalty only if it \nengages in the transaction that Congress has sought to discourage. An \nexception is provided for genuine court-approved hardship cases to \nprotect the limited instances where a true hardship warrants the sale \nof future structured settlement payments.\n  This bipartisan legislation, which is supported by the Treasury \nDepartment, should be enacted as soon as possible to stem this growing \nnationwide problem.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill, a \nsummary of the legislation and the article from U.S. News & World \nReport be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1045\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Accordingly, the Act would impose on the \n     factoring company that acquires structured settlement \n     payments directly or indirectly from the injured victim an \n     excise tax equal to 50 percent of the difference between (i) \n     the total amount of the structured settlement payments \n     purchased by the factoring company, and (ii) the heavily-\n     discounted lump sum paid by the factoring company to the \n     injured victim.\n       Similar to the stiff excise taxes imposed on prohibited \n     transactions in the private foundation and pension contexts--\n     which can range as high as 100 to 200 percent--this stringent \n     excise tax is necessary to address the very serious public \n     policy concerns raised by structured settlement factoring \n     transactions.\n       The excise tax under the Act would apply to the factoring \n     of structured settlements in tort cases and in workers' \n     compensation. A structured settlement factoring transaction \n     subject to the excise tax is broadly defined under the Act as \n     a transfer of structured settlement payment rights (including \n     portions of payments) made for consideration by means of \n     sale, assignment, pledge, or other form of alienation or \n     encumbrance for consideration.\n\n\n   2. Exception from Excise Tax for Genuine, Court-Approved Hardship\n\n       The stringent excise tax would be coupled with a limited \n     exception for genuine, court-approved financial hardship \n     situations. The excise tax would apply to factoring companies \n     in all structured settlement factoring transactions except \n     those in which the transfer of structured settlement payment \n     rights (1) is otherwise permissible under applicable Federal \n     and State law and (2) is undertaken pursuant to the order of \n     a court (or where applicable, an administrative authority) \n     finding that the extraordinary, unanticipated, and imminent \n     needs of the structured settlement recipient or his or her \n     spouse or dependents render such a transfer appropriate.\n       This exception is intended to apply to the limited number \n     of cases in which a genuinely extraordinary, unanticipated, \n     and imminent hardship has actually arisen and been \n     demonstrated to the satisfaction of a court (e.g., serious \n     medical emergency for a family member). In addition, as a \n     threshold matter, the transfer of structured settlement \n     payment rights must be permissible under applicable law, \n     including State law. The hardship exception under this \n     legislation is not intended to override any Federal or State \n     law prohibition or restriction on the transfer of the payment \n     rights or to authorize factoring of payment rights that are \n     not transferable under Federal or State law. For example, the \n     States in general prohibit the factoring of workers' \n     compensation benefits. In addition, State laws often prohibit \n     or directly restrict transfers of recoveries in various types \n     of personal injury cases, such as wrongful death and medical \n     malpractice.\n       The relevant court for purposes of the hardship exception \n     would be the original court which had jurisdiction over the \n     underlying action or proceeding that was resolved by means of \n     the structured settlement. In the event that no action had \n     been brought prior to the settlement, the relevant court \n     would be that which would have had jurisdiction over the \n     claim that is the subject of the structured settlement or \n     which would have jurisdiction by reason of the residence of \n     the structured settlement recipient. In those limited \n     instances in which an administrative authority adjudicates, \n     resolves, or otherwise has primary jurisdiction over the \n     claim (e.g., the Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust Fund), the \n     hardship matter would be the province of that applicable \n     administrative authority.\n\n\n   3. Need to Protect Tax Treatment of Original Structured Settlement\n\n       In the limited instances of extraordinary and unanticipated \n     hardship determined by court order to warrant relief under \n     the hardship exception, adverse tax consequences should not \n     be visited upon the other parties to the original structured \n     settlement. In addition, despite the anti-assignment \n     provisions included in the structured settlement agreements \n     and the applicability of a stringent excise tax on the \n     factoring company, there may be a limited number of non-\n     hardship factoring transactions that still go forward. If the \n     structured settlement tax rules under I.R.C. Sections 72, 130 \n     and 461(h) had been satisfied at the time of the structured\n\n[[Page S5285]]\n\n     settlement, the original tax treatment of the other parties \n     to the settlement--i.e., the settling defendant (and its \n     liability insurer) and the Code section 130 assignee--should \n     not be jeopardized by a third party transaction that occurs \n     years later and likely unbeknownst to these other parties to \n     the original settlement.\n       Accordingly, the Act would clarify that if the structured \n     settlement tax rules under I.R.C. Sections 72, 130, and \n     461(h) had been satisfied at the time of the structured \n     settlement, the section 130 exclusion of the assignee, the \n     section 461(h) deduction of the settling defendant, and the \n     Code section 72 status of the annuity being used to fund the \n     periodic payments would remain undisturbed. That is, the \n     assignee's exclusion of income under Code section 130 arising \n     from satisfaction of all of the section 130 qualified \n     assignment rules at the time the structured settlement was \n     entered into years earlier would not be challenged. \n     Similarly, the settling defendant's deduction under Code \n     section 461(h) of the amount paid to the assignee to assume \n     the liability would not be challenged. Finally, the status \n     under Code section 72 of the annuity being used to fund the \n     periodic payments would remain undisturbed.\n       The Act provides the Secretary of the Treasury with \n     regulatory authority to clarify the treatment of a structured \n     settlement recipient who engages in a factoring transaction. \n     This regulatory authority is provided to enable Treasury to \n     address issues raised regarding the treatment of future \n     periodic payments received by the structured settlement \n     recipient where only a portion of the payments has been \n     factored away, the treatment of the lump sum received in a \n     factoring transaction qualifying for the hardship exception, \n     and the treatment of the lump sum received in the non-\n     hardship situation. It is intended that where the \n     requirements of section 130 are satisfied at the time the \n     structured settlement is entered into, the existence of the \n     hardship exception to the excise tax under the Act shall not \n     be construed as giving rise to any concern over constructive \n     receipt of income by the injured victim at the time of the \n     structured settlement.\n\n\n 4. Tax Information Reporting Obligations With Respect to a Structured \n                    Settlement Factoring Transaction\n\n       The Act would clarify the tax reporting obligations of the \n     person making the structured settlement payments in the event \n     that a structured settlement factoring transaction occurs. \n     The Act adopts a new section of the Code that is intended to \n     govern the payor's tax reporting obligations in the event of \n     a factoring transaction.\n       In the case of a court-approved transfer of structured \n     settlement payments of which the person making the payments \n     has actual notice and knowledge, the fact of the transfer and \n     the identity of the acquirer clearly will be known. \n     Accordingly, it is appropriate for the person making the \n     structured settlement payments to make such return and to \n     furnish such tax information statement to the new recipient \n     of the payments as would be applicable under the annuity \n     information reporting procedures of Code section 6041 (e.g., \n     form 1099-R), because the payor will have the information \n     necessary to make such return and to furnish such statement.\n       Despite the anti-assignment restrictions applicable to \n     structured settlements and the applicability of a stringent \n     excise tax, there may be a limited number of non-hardship \n     factoring transactions that still go forward. In these \n     instances, if the person making the structured settlement \n     payments has actual notice and knowledge that a structured \n     settlement factoring transaction has taken place, the payor \n     would be obligated to make such return and to furnish such \n     written statement to the payment recipient at such time, and \n     in such manner and form, as the Secretary of the Treasury \n     shall by regulations provide. In these instances, the payor \n     may have incomplete information regarding the factoring \n     transaction, and hence a tailored reporting procedure under \n     Treasury regulations is necessary.\n       The person making the structured settlement payments would \n     not be subject to any tax reporting obligation if that person \n     lacked such actual notice and knowledge of the factoring \n     transaction. Under the Act, for purposes of the reporting \n     obligations, the term acquirer of the structured settlement \n     payment rights'' would be broadly defined to include an \n     individual, trust, estate, partnership, company, or \n     corporation.\n       The provisions of section 3405 regarding withholding would \n     not apply to the person making the structured settlement \n     payments in the event that a structured settlement factoring \n     transaction occurs.\n\n\n                           5. Effective Date\n\n       The provisions of the Act would be effective with respect \n     to structured settlement factoring transactions occurring \n     after the date of enactment of the Act.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From U.S. News & World Report, Jan. 25, 1999]\n\n                           Settling for Less\n\n\n          should accident victims sell their monthly payouts?\n\n                          (By Margaret Mannix)\n\n       Orion Olson has had his share of hard knocks. When he was a \n     3 year old, a dog bite caused him vision and neurological \n     problems, as well as injuries requiring plastic surgery. In \n     his teens, he dropped out of high school and wound up \n     homeless. But he had hope. On his 18th birthday, the \n     Minneapolis man was to start receiving the first of five \n     periodic payments totaling $75,000 from a lawsuit stemming \n     from the dog attack. He received the first installment of \n     $7,500, but the money didn't last long.\n       So when Olson saw a television ad for a finance company \n     named J. G. Wentworth & Co. that provided cash to accident \n     victims, he saw a way to get his life back on track. He \n     agreed to sell his remaining future payments of $67,500 to \n     Wentworth for a lump sum of $16,100. ``I needed money,'' says \n     Olson, now 20 years old. ``If I could get the money out like \n     they were saying on TV, I wouldn't have to worry about being \n     on the street anymore.'' Within six months, however, Olson \n     had spent all the money and was living in a car. He now \n     wishes he had waited for his regular payments.\n       Olson may be financially unsophisticated, but he is also \n     caught up in a burgeoning, and unregulated, new industry that \n     specializes in converting periodic payments into fast cash. \n     Also known as factoring companies, these firms can be a \n     godsend to accident victims, lottery winners, and others who \n     have guaranteed future incomes but need immediate funds. But \n     like a modern-day Esau trading his inheritance for a bowl of \n     soup, the unwary consumer may be selling future sustenance \n     for cheap. A growing number of federal and state legislators, \n     as well as several attorneys general, contend that factoring \n     companies charge usurious interest rates, fail to properly \n     disclose terms, and take advantage of desperate people. \n     ``It's unconscionable,'' says Minnesota Attorney General Mike \n     Hatch. ``They are really preying upon the vulnerable.''\n       Frittering away. Critics further allege that factoring \n     companies undermine the very law that Congress passed to help \n     beneficiaries of large damage awards. In 1982, seeking to \n     prevent accident victims from frittering away large sums \n     intended to provide for them over their lifetimes, Congress \n     instituted tax breaks for those who agreed to receive their \n     money over a period of years. But now, contends Montana Sen. \n     Max Baucus, a sponsor of that legislation, the careful \n     planning that goes into the structuring of these payments \n     ``can be unraveled in an instant by a factoring company \n     offering quick cash at a steep discount.''\n       A number of advanced-funding companies compete for their \n     share of future payments that include more than $5 billion in \n     structured settlements awarded each year. The largest buyer \n     is Wentworth, handling an estimated half of all such \n     transactions. Based in Philadelphia, the firm began by \n     financing nursing homes and long-term care facilities. In \n     1992 it started buying settlements that auto-accident victims \n     were owed by the state of New Jersey. Since then, Wentworth \n     has completed more than 15,000 structured-settlement \n     transactions with an approximate total value of $370 million.\n       The deals work like this: A structured-settlement recipient \n     who wants to sell, say, $50,000 in future payments, will not \n     get a limp sum of $50,000. That's because, as a result of \n     inflation, money schedule to be paid years from now is worth \n     less today. Formulas based on such factors as inflation and \n     the date that payments begin are used to determine the \n     ``present value'' of the future payments. The seller is, in \n     essence, borrowing a lump sum that is paid back with the \n     insurance company payments. The interest on the borrowed sum \n     is called the ``discount rate.''\n       Wentworth and other advanced-funding companies say they are \n     providing a valuable service because structured settlements \n     have a basic flaw: They are not flexible. Consumer needs \n     change, they note, and a fixed monthly payment does not. \n     Wentworth points to an Ohio woman who sold the company a $500 \n     portion of her monthly payments for six years when her bills \n     were piling up and her home mortgage was about to be \n     foreclosed. She received instant cash of $21,000, at a \n     discount rate of 15.8 percent. The customer, who did not wish \n     to be identified, says she is grateful to Wentworth for \n     advancing her the money when her insurance company would not. \n     ``The insurance companies just don't understand,'' she says, \n     ``When I needed their help, they were not there.'' Likewise, \n     a New York quadriplegic, who also did not want to be named, \n     says he secured funds from Wentworth at a 12 percent discount \n     rate to expand his won business and, as a result, is more \n     successful than ever. ``It was definitely worth it for me,'' \n     he ways.\n       But other customers are not as satisfied. New York City \n     resident Raymond White lost part of one leg when we has \n     struck by a subway train in 1990. A lawsuit led to a \n     settlement that guaranteed White a monthly payment of $1,100, \n     with annual cost-of-living increases of 3 percent. In 1996, \n     White, who did not have a job, wanted cash to buy a car and \n     pay medical bills. So he turned to Wentworth, selling \n     portions of his monthly payments for the next 15 years in six \n     different transactions.\n       Altogether White gave up future payments totaling $198,000. \n     He received a total of $54,000 in return, but the money, \n     which he used for living expenses, is now gone. He bought a \n     car, but it has been repossessed. He bought a plot of land in \n     Florida, but lost it to foreclosure. With debts mounting, he \n     now relies partially on public assistance to get by. \n     ``Unfortunately I was so overwhelmed with debt and striving \n     for a better life that I went along with it,'' says White. \n     ``In reality, what I was doing was accumulating more debt for \n     myself.''\n\n[[Page S5286]]\n\n       Some Wentworth customers say they might have realized the \n     repercussions of their transactions had the contracts been \n     clearer about the long-term costs. Jerry Magee of Magnolia, \n     Miss., who has filed a class action suit against the company, \n     is one of them. In a mortgage contract, for instance, lending \n     laws require that consumers see their interest rate and the \n     total amount of money they will be paying over the life of \n     the loan. By contrast, Magee's lawyer says, neither the \n     effective interest rate nor the total amount of the \n     transaction was clearly spelled out in the 13-page contract \n     or in the 25 other documents Wentworth required him to sign. \n     Wentworth says it has been revising its documents to make \n     them easier to understand.\n       Change of address. While the factoring transaction itself \n     is complex, the transfer of payments is simple. The \n     structured settlement recipient instructs the insurance \n     company to change his or her address to that of the factoring \n     company. The check remains in the recipient's name, and the \n     factoring company uses a power of attorney, granted by the \n     recipient, to cash it.\n       This roundabout method is used because insurance companies \n     say structured payments should not be sold. Most settlement \n     contracts specify that payments cannot be ``assigned,'' and \n     the Internal Revenue Service says that payments ``cannot be \n     accelerated, deferred, increased or decreased.'' Selling \n     payments, the insurance companies say, amounts to \n     accelerating them. And that may threaten the claimant's tax \n     break. Insurance companies say that if their annuitants start \n     selling their payments, the social good that justifies the \n     tax break disappears. Ironically, they make this argument \n     even though some insurance companies themselves are not \n     making counteroffers to factoring companies, accelerating \n     payments to their own claimants. Berkshire Hathaway Life \n     Insurance Co., for example, recently offered a claimant a \n     lump sum of $59,000, beating Wentworth's offer of $45,000. \n     The IRS has not formally addressed the tax issues, but the \n     U.S. Department of the Treasury has recommended a tax on \n     factoring transactions to discourage them.\n       Insurance companies also worry about having to pay twice. \n     Last year, a judge ruled an insurance company was \n     obligated to pay a workers' compensation recipient his \n     monthly payments because the factoring transaction he \n     entered into was invalid under Florida's workers' \n     compensation statute. For their part, the factoring \n     companies argue that even though the claimants do not own \n     the annuities--the insurance companies do--the factoring \n     companies can buy the ``right to receive'' the payments.\n       Insurance companies are getting wise to these factoring \n     deals--CNA, a Chicago-based insurer, noticed that annuitants \n     from all over the country were changing their addresses to \n     Wentworth's Philadelphia post office box--and some are trying \n     to stop the transactions. Some insurance companies, for \n     example, refuse to honor change-of-address requests or \n     redirect the payments back to the annuitant after the deal is \n     done. But redirecting a payment can cause serious \n     consequences for the claimant. In Wentworth's case, the \n     company has each customer sign a clause called a ``confession \n     of judgment,'' which allows the factoring company to sue \n     customers quickly for default when their payments are not \n     received; customers also waive the right to defend \n     themselves.\n       Christopher Hicks, a 20-year-old accident victim from \n     Oklahoma City, learned the effects of that clause the hard \n     way. In 1997, Hicks signed over to Wentworth half of his \n     $2,000 monthly payments for the next 32 months and $1,500 for \n     the 26 months after that. In exchange, Hicks received \n     $37,500, which he admits he quickly spent on furniture, \n     clothes, and other items. When Wentworth failed to receive a \n     check from the insurance company that pays Hicks the annuity, \n     it secured a judgment against him for the entire amount of \n     the deal--$71,000.\n       No clue. To collect, Wentworth garnisheed Metropolitan \n     Life, meaning that Metropolitan Life was supposed to start \n     sending Hicks's monthly checks to Wentworth. It did not--the \n     company won't say why--and Hicks, who was supposed to be \n     getting $1,000 back from Wentworth, was left with nothing. \n     ``When the money stopped, I had no clue what was going on,'' \n     says Hicks, who had to rely on family and friends until the \n     two companies settled their differences in court. Hicks now \n     wishes he had never gotten involved with Wentworth. ``They \n     make you think you are doing the right thing in the long \n     run,'' says Hicks, ``but you are really messing up your \n     life.''\n       Wentworth makes liberal use of confession-of-judgment \n     clauses even though they are illegal in consumer transactions \n     in the company's home state of Pennsylvania. The Federal \n     Trade Commission also bans the clauses as an unfair practice \n     in consumer-credit transactions. The clauses are allowable in \n     business transactions in Pennsylvania if they are accompanied \n     by a statement of business purpose. So in each case Wentworth \n     certifies that the agreements ``were not entered into for \n     family, personal, or household purposes.''\n       Such language is used in affidavits despite cases like that \n     of Davinia Willis, a 24-year-old resident of Richmond, \n     Calif., who entered into a transaction with Wentworth in 1996 \n     to stop her house from being foreclosed upon and to repair \n     wheelchair ramps--clearly, she says, personal uses. In a \n     class action lawsuit against the company, she cites the \n     confession of judgment as one reason why the contract is \n     ``illegal, usurious, and unconscionable.'' Wentworth says the \n     clauses are necessary to keep its customers from reneging on \n     their agreements.\n       In the end, the controversy over factoring companies comes \n     down to a fundamental disagreement over the definition of \n     their business. The factoring companies say they are not \n     subject to usury or consumer-credit disclosure laws because \n     they are not, in fact, lenders. ``We don't make loans,'' \n     declares Andrew Hillman, Wentworth's general counsel. ``We \n     buy assets.'' But some state attorneys general say these \n     transactions differ very little, if at all, from loans and \n     perhaps should be classified as such. That way, says Shirley \n     Sarna, chief of the New York attorney general's consumer \n     fraud and protection bureau, the law could prevent factoring \n     companies from charging discount rates that she says in some \n     cases have exceeded 75 percent. Wentworth says its average \n     rate is 16 percent, and several factoring companies insist \n     their rates would be much lower if insurance companies did \n     not make it expensive from them to complete the deals. ``By \n     getting the insurance companies to process the address \n     changes, it would overnight transform our discount rates from \n     high teens to the single digits,'' says Jeffrey Grieco, \n     managing director of Stone Street Capital, an advanced-\n     funding firm in Bethesda, Md.\n       Who is right and who is wrong is being hammered out in \n     courtrooms and statehouses across the country. The insurance \n     companies were heartened last summer when a Kentucky judge \n     denied four of Wentworth's garnishment actions, saying the \n     purchase agreements the customers signed were neither valid \n     nor legal. But other courts have ruled differently.\n       In Illinois, a new state law says that structured \n     settlements can be sold as long as a judge approves the \n     transaction. Wentworth notes that more than 100 such sales \n     have been approved. At the same time, several state attorneys \n     general are examining the factoring industry's practices. \n     ``You have got to worry about people who have a debilitating \n     injury,'' says Joseph Goldberg, senior deputy attorney \n     general for Pennsylvania. ``The injury is never going away \n     and they have no real means of income and probably no means \n     of employment. . . . If they give that monthly payment up, it \n     could have serious consequences.'' Voicing similar concerns, \n     disability groups like the National Spinal Cord Injury \n     Association, which now refuses to accept factoring companies' \n     advertisements in its magazine, are warning members about the \n     hazards of cashing out. The association is ``deeply concerned \n     about the emergency of companies that purchase payments \n     intended for disabled persons at a drastic discount,'' says \n     its executive director, Thomas Countee.\n       While opinions are divided about the validity of factoring \n     transactions, both sides agree that regulation of the \n     secondary market is necessary. As in Illinois, Connecticut \n     and Kentucky have passed laws requiring a judge's approval of \n     advanced-funding deals, as well as fuller disclosure of \n     costs. Faced with mounting criticism, Wentworth this week \n     will announce its pledge to submit every request for purchase \n     of a settlement to a court for approval. Other states are \n     expected to address the issue this year, and in Congress, \n     Rep. Clay Shaw, a Florida Republican, has reintroduced a \n     measure that would tax factoring transactions.\n       The factoring companies respond to all these efforts by \n     also calling for better disclosure from the primary market--\n     the insurance companies, attorneys, and brokers that set up \n     the structured settlements in the first place. Factoring \n     companies argue that structured settlements are not always as \n     generous as they are represented to be. ``We challenge \n     insurance companies and their brokers to take the same \n     pledge.'' said Michael Goodman, Wentworth's executive vice \n     president.\n       Whatever the outcome of the debate, consumers thinking \n     about selling their future payments are well advised to take \n     a hard look at what they are getting into.\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join today with \nSenator Chafee and a bipartisan group of our colleagues from the \nFinance Committee in introducing the Structured Settlement Protection \nAct.\n  Companion legislation has been introduced in the House (H.R. 263) by \nRepresentatives Clay Shaw and Pete Stark. The House legislation is co-\nsponsored by a broad bipartisan group of Members of the House Ways and \nMeans Committee.\n  The Treasury Department supports this bipartisan legislation\n  I speak today as the original Senate sponsor of the structured \nsettlement tax rules that Congress enacted in 1982. I rise because of \nmy very grave concern that the recent emergence of structured \nsettlement factoring transactions--in which favoring companies buy up \nthe structured settlement payments from injured victims in return for a \ndeeply-discounted lump sum--complete undermines what Congress intended \nwhen we enacted these structured settlement tax rules.\n  In introducing the original 1982 legislation, I pointed to the \nconcern over the premature dissipation of lump sum\n\n[[Page S5287]]\n\nrecoveries by seriously-injured victims and their families:\n\n       In the past, these awards have typically been paid by \n     defendants to successful plaintiffs in the form of a single \n     payment settlement. This approach has proven unsatisfactory, \n     however, in many cases because it assumes that injured \n     parties will wisely manage large sums of money so as to \n     provide for their lifetime needs. In fact, many of these \n     successful litigants, particularly minors, have dissipated \n     their awards in a few years and are then without means of \n     support. [Congressional Record (daily ed.) 12/10/81, at \n     S15005.]\n\n  I introduced the original legislation to encourage structured \nsettlements because they provide a better approach, as I said at the \ntime: ``Periodic payment settlements, on the other hand, provide \nplaintiffs with a steady income over a long period of time and insulate \nthem from pressures to squander their awards.'' (Id.)\n  Thus, our focus in enacting these tax rules in section 104(a)(2) and \n130 of the Internal Revenue Code was to encourage and govern the use of \nstructured settlements in order to provide long-term financial security \nto seriously-injured victims and their families and to insulate them \nfrom pressures to squander their awards.\n  Over the almost two decades since we enacted these tax rules, \nstructured settlements have proven to be a very effective means of \nproviding long-term financial protection to persons with serious, long-\nterm physical injuries through an assured stream of payments designed \nto meet the victim's ongoing expenses for medical care, living, and \nfamily support. Structured settlements are voluntary agreements reached \nbetween the parties that are negotiated by counsel and tailored to meet \nthe specific medical and living needs of the victim and his or her \nfamily, often with the aid of economic experts. This process may be \noverseen by the court, particularly in minor's cases. Often, the \nstructured settlement payment stream is for the rest of the victim's \nlife to ensure that future medical expenses and the family's basic \nliving needs will be met and that the victim will not outlive his or \nher compensation.\n  I now find that all of this careful planning and long-term financial \nsecurity for the victim and his or her family can be unraveled in an \ninstant by a factoring company offering quick cash at a steep discount. \nWhat happens next month or next year when the lump sum from the \nfactoring company is gone, and the stream of payments for future \nfinancial support is no longer coming in? These structured settlement \nfactoring transactions place the injured victim in the very predicament \nthat the structured settlement was intended to avoid.\n  Court records show that across the country factoring companies are \nbuying up future structured settlement payments from persons who are \nquadriplegic, paraplegic, have traumatic brain injuries or other grave \ninjuries. That is why the National Spinal Cord Injury Association and \nthe American Association of Persons With Disabilities (AAPD) actively \nsupport the legislation we are introducing today. The National Spinal \nCord Injury Association stated in a recent letter to Chairman Roth of \nthe Finance Committee that the Spinal Cord Injury Association is \n``deeply concerned about the emergency of companies that purchase \npayments intended for disabled persons at drastic discount. This \nstrikes at the heart of the security Congress intended when it created \nstructured settlements.''\n  As a long-time supporter of structured settlements and an architect \nof the Congressional policy embodied in the structured settlement tax \nrules, I cannot stand by as this structured settlement factoring \nproblem continues to mushroom across the country, leaving injured \nvictims without financial means for the future and forcing the injured \nvictims onto the social safety net--precisely the result that we were \nseeking to avoid when we enacted the structured settlement tax rules.\n  Accordingly, I am pleased to join with Senator Chafee in introducing \nthe Structured Settlement Protection Act. The legislation would impose \na substantial penalty tax on a factoring company that purchases \nstructured settlement payments from an injured victim. There is ample \nprecedent throughout the Internal Revenue Code, such as the tax-exempt \norganization area, for the use of penalties to discourage transactions \nthat undermine existing provisions of the Code. I would stress that \nthis is a penalty, not a tax increase--the factoring company only pays \nthe penalty if it undertakes the factoring transaction that Congress is \nseeking to discourage because the transaction thwarts a clear \nCongressional policy. Under the Act, the imposition of the penalty \nwould be subject to an exception for court-approved hardship cases to \nprotect the limited instances of true hardship of the victim.\n  I urge my colleagues that the time to act is now, to stem as quickly \nas possible these harsh consequences that structured settlement \nfactoring transactions visit upon seriously-injured victims and their \nfamilies.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED:\n  S. 1046. A bill to amend title V of the Public Health Service Act to \nrevise and extend certain programs under the authority of the Substance \nAbuse and Mental Health Service Administration, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n  wrap around services for detained or incarcerated youth act of 1999\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwould help local communities coordinate services for juvenile offenders \nwho are leaving the juvenile justice system and returning to their \ncommunities. This provision was included in the Robb amendment to S. \n254, the Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender Accountability and \nRehabilitation Act of 1999, which was unfortunately tabled earlier this \nweek.\n  The problem of mental illness plagues an alarming number of youth, \nwho too often find themselves caught up in the juvenile justice system. \nWhile overall crime rates in this country have been in decline for the \npast few years, we have seen alarming increases in the number of \nserious and violent crimes committed by minors. Each year, more than \ntwo million youngsters under the age of 18 are arrested. What's more, \nstatistics show that thirty percent of these young people will commit \nanother crime within a year of their initial arrest.\n  Often, society views these young people, who have turned to crime at \nsuch an early age, as a ``lost cause'' or simply beyond hope of \nrehabilitation. The said fact that often gets overlooked is that many \nof these youngsters are battling with a serious emotional or mental \ndisorder that winds up manifesting itself in criminal behavior. We \ncannot condone this behavior, yet, we as a society have failed to \ndedicate the resources necessary to bring these children back from the \nedge of self-destruction.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would help local agencies to \ncoordinate the array of mental health, substance abuse, vocational, and \neducation services a youngster may need to successfully transition back \ninto the mainstream. Once a youth has been through the juvenile or \ncriminal justice system, we need to do all we can to prevent a similar \nincident. If these children have been identified as having a mental or \nemotional disorder, they need to have access to appropriate treatment \nand services while they are incarcerated, but perhaps more imperatively \nwhen they leave incarceration. Turning these young people out on the \nstreet with no services to facilitate their transition does not help \nthese children and does not help society as a whole.\n  Studies have found the rate of mental disorder is two to three times \nhigher among the juvenile offender population than among youth in the \ngeneral population. According to a 1994 Department of Justice study, 73 \npercent of juvenile offenders reported mental health problems and 57 \npercent reported past treatment for their condition. In addition, it is \nestimated that over 60 percent of youth in the juvenile justice system \nhave substance abuse disorders, compared to 22 percent in the general \npopulation.\n  In an effort to bring desperately needed mental health services to \nthis terribly underserved population, my legislation would authorize \nthe Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), \nin collaboration with the Departments of Justice and Education, to \nadminister a\n\n[[Page S5288]]\n\ncompetitive grant program that responds to the array of social and \neducational needs of children who are leaving the juvenile justice \nsystem.\n  These cooperative ``wrap-around services'' would enable juvenile \njustice agencies to work together with educational and health agencies \nto provide transitional services for youth who have had contact with \nthe juvenile justice system, in order to decrease the likelihood that \nthese young people will commit additional criminal offenses.\n  These services, which would be targeted toward youth offenders who \nhave serious emotional disturbances or are at risk of developing such \ndisturbances, could include diagnostic and evaluation services, \nsubstance abuse treatment, outpatient mental health care, medication \nmanagement, intensive home-based therapy, intensive day treatment \nservices, respite care, and therapeutic foster care.\n  I think it is important for my colleagues to note that this proposal \nis modeled after existing programs with a proven record of success. For \ninstance, my home state of Rhode Island is one of four states (the \nothers include California, Wisconsin, and Virginia) that has sought to \ntarget teens who have been diagnosed with a serious emotional \ndisturbance and provide them with the services they need to get back on \ntrack.\n  The Rhode Island Department of Youth and Families last year initiated \na statewide program called ``Project Hope'', for youth ages 12 to 18 \nwith serious emotional disturbances who are in the process of \ntransitioning from the Rhode Island Training School back into their \ncommunities. The goal of the partnership is to develop a single, \ncommunity-based system of care for these children to reduce the \nlikelihood that they will re-offend. The program brings a core set of \nservices to these young people that includes health care, substance \nabuse treatment, educational/vocational services, domestic violence and \nabuse support groups, recreational programs, and day care services. A \nkey component in the program's strategy is to engage young people and \ntheir families in the planning and implementation of these transition \nservices.\n  A similar program that has been in operation in Milwaukee, Wisconsin \nsince 1994 has reported a 40 percent decline in the number of felonies \ncommitted and a 30% decrease in misdemeanors after providing \ncomprehensive services to children with serious emotional disorders for \none year.\n  This legislation would provide states with the resources and \nflexibility to start filing a critical service gap for youngsters who \nare leaving the juvenile justice system and re-entering their \ncommunities. The provisions of adequate transitional and aftercare \nservices to prevent recidivism is essential to reducing the societal \ncosts associated with juvenile delinquency, promoting teen health, and \nfostering safe communities.\n  I am pleased to introduce this legislation today. The provisions \noutlined in this bill will help community agencies to coordinate \nservices, which will prevent these troubled juveniles from committing \nadditional crimes and falling into a life on the fringes of society. It \nis in our best interest to take responsibility for these teens instead \nof turning our backs on them at such a critical stage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself and Mr. Bingaman) (by request):\n  S. 1047. A bill to provide for a more competitive electric power \nindustry and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  S. 1048. A bill to provide for a more competitive electric power \nindustry, and for other purposes, to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n           comprehensive electricity competition and tax acts\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, at the request of the Administration, \nSenator Bingaman and I are introducing the President's proposed \nelectricity legislation. The Administration's legislation is being \nintroduced as two separate bills because Title X of their proposed \nlegislation amends the Internal Revenue Code. I will speak first with \nrespect to the restructuring portion of the Administration's \nlegislation, Titles I through IX.\n  Mr. President, I am not introducing the restructuring portion of the \nAdministration's legislation because I support it--I do not. Some of \nits provisions I agree with, but many of its key provisions I am \nopposed to. Instead, I am introducing the Administration's legislation \nin order to initiate the debate in the hope that through the \nlegislative process Congress can craft legislation that will enjoy \nbipartisan support and will benefit consumers.\n  At the outset, let me observe that our electric power industry isn't \nbroken. We have the finest electric system in the world bar none. Our \nelectric utilities have done an excellent job supplying electricity to \nthe consumers of this Nation. As a result, today electricity is both \nreliable and reasonably-priced. But that isn't to say that improvements \ncannot, and should not, be made. I believe that consumers will benefit \nthrough enhanced competition. The key question we face is: Should we \ntry to enhance competition through increased reliance on the free \nmarket, or through increased use of government regulation? I think the \nanswer is self evident.\n  Although deregulation is our goal, some regulation will remain \nnecessary to protect consumers. However, such regulation should not be \nmade the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal government, as some have \nsuggested. The retail market has traditionally been the jurisdiction of \nthe States, and it should remain that way. States are the closest to \nthe people, and are best able to determine what is in their consumers' \nbest interests. Let me speak now about some of the key provisions of \nthe Administration's legislation.\n  There are several important components of the Administration's \nlegislation that I strongly support. For example, it proposes to repeal \nthe Public Utility Holding Company Act (PUHCA) and the Public Utility \nRegulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA), two anticompetitive laws that \ncost consumers billions of dollars every year in above-market electric \nrates. If we do nothing else, repeal of PUHCA and PURPA would \nmaterially advance competition and reduce electric rates to consumers.\n  The Administration's legislation also shows a clear interest in \naddressing several contentious issues left out in their bill in the \nlast Congress. For example, the Administration's legislation includes \nprovisions that will begin the debate on what to do about the Federal \nutilities--the Federal power marketing administrations and the \nTennessee Valley Authority. The Administration's legislation also takes \na significant step forward by addressing the very difficult issue of \ncreating a level playing field between municipal and private \nutilities--the tax-exempt municipal bond issue. This is an issue that \nmust be dealt with. The Administration's bill also addresses \nreliability and it makes all wholesale transmission open access, two \nvery important matters. Also of note is the Administration's \nrecognition of the need to deal with the high cost of electricity in \nrural communities. Senator Daschle and I have introduced legislation to \ndeal with this problem, and the Administration's legislation \nincorporates part of our bill.\n  There are, however, several provisions in the Administration's \nlegislation that I am opposed to. First, I do not support its Federal \nretail competition mandate which overrides State law. I see no need for \nthis. The States are moving aggressively to implement retail \ncompetition in a manner and a time frame that benefits consumers. \nAccording to the DOE's Energy Information Administration, twenty States \nhave already enacted restructuring legislation or issued a \ncomprehensive regulatory order. More than half the U.S. population live \nin these twenty States. Again according to DOE's Energy Information \nAdministration, twenty-eight of the remaining thirty States are in the \nprocess of deciding what is in the best interests of its residents. \nAccordingly I ask: With States making such good progress on retail \ncompetition what need is there for a Federal mandate--assuming such a \nmandate is Constitutional? Moreover, because the Administration's \nproposed mandate would apply even to the twenty States that have \nalready acted, I am concerned that such a Federal mandate would upset \nthe progress these States have made. In this connection, I am not \nconvinced that the Administration's ``opt-out'' provision will in fact\n\n[[Page S5289]]\n\nprotect consumers from the adverse consequences of Federally-mandated \nretail competition.\n  Second, the bill's so-called ``renewable portfolio mandate'' is also \na significant problem. For reasons that I do not understand, the \nAdministration has decided to exclude hydroelectric power from the \ndefinition of renewable energy, even though hydro is this Nation's most \nsignificant renewable energy source. Without hydroelectric power being \ncounted, to meet this new Federal mandate ``renewable'' generation \nwould have to increase to 7.5 percent by the year 2010. Clearly, an \nimpossibility.\n  Third, I am also troubled with the Administration's so-called \n``public benefits'' fund. It puts a Federal $3 billion per year tax on \nelectric consumers, that a Federal board gets to spend for vaguely \ndefined public purposes. It also appears to require a matching $3 \nbillion per year State expenditure. At the very outset, this eats up a \nvery large share of the claimed consumer savings resulting from \nenactment of the Administration's bill.\n  Finally, the Administration's bill also contains numerous new \nFederal oversight, regulatory and environmental programs, many of which \ngive the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission major oversight--much of \nwhich comes at the expense of the States. There are far too many of \nthese in the Administration's legislation to identify and discuss here. \nSome of these may be worthwhile, but clearly many are not. Each will \nhave to be carefully scrutinized and will have to be justified on their \nown merits if it is to be included in a final bill. I will speak now \nabout the tax provisions of the Administration's proposed legislation \nwhich I am introducing as a separate measure.\n\n  Mr. President, at the request of the Administration I am also \nintroducing the portion of their electricity restructuring bill that \ndeals with tax-exempt debt issued by municipal utilities. This is Title \nX of the Administration's proposed legislation. In addiition, the \nAdministration's bill clarifies the tax rules regarding contributions \nto nuclear decommissioning costs.\n  Mr. President, if consumers and businesses are to maximize the full \nbenefits of open competition in this industry it will be necessary for \nall electricity providers to interconnect their families into the \nentire electric grid. Unfortunately, this system efficiency is \nsignificantly impaired because of current tax law rules that \neffectively preclude public power entities--entities that financed \ntheir facilities with tax-exempt bonds--from participating in State \nopen access restructuring plans, without jeopardizing the exempt status \nof their bonds.\n  No one wants to see bonds issued to finance public power become \nretroactively taxable because a municipality chooses to participate in \na state open access plan. That would cause havoc in the financial \nmarkets and could undermine the financial stability of many \nmunicipalities. At the same time, public power should be obtain a \ncompetitive advantage in the open marketplace based on the federal \nsubsidy that flows from the ability to issue tax-exempt debt.\n  The Administration's proposal attempts to resolve this issue by \nprohibiting public power facilities from issuing new tax-exempt bonds \nfor generating facilities and transmission facilities. However, tax \nexempt debt could be issued for new distribution facilities. In \naddition, the Administration's proposal ensures that outstanding bonds \nwould not lose their tax-exempt status if transmission facilities \nviolate the private use rules because of a FERC order requiring non-\ndiscriminatory open access to such facilities. Outstanding debt for \ngeneration would not lose it's tax-exempt status if the private use \nrules were triggered simply because the entity entered into a contract \nin response to a marketplace based on competition.\n  Mr. President, I am not endorsing every concept in the tax portion of \nthe Administration's proposal. I believe it is a good starting point \nfor discussion of how we transition from a regulated environment to a \nfree market competitive landscape. It is my hope that the public power \nand the investor owned utilities will sit down and come to a reasonable \ncompromise on how to resolve the tax issues affecting the industry. My \ndoor is always open to hear all sides on this issue and see whether we \ncan fix the problems that exist in the tax code so that competition in \nthe industry becomes a reality.\n  Mr. President, the introduction of the Administration's bill is just \nthe beginning of a very long and arduous process. I hope to be able to \nwork with the electric power industry, my Republican and Democratic \ncolleagues to both the Finance Committee and the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, and DOE Secretary Richardson to craft legislation \nthat will benefit consumers and our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Administration's \ntransmittal letter and section-by-section analysis be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                      The Secretary of Energy,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 15, 1999.\n     Hon. Al Gore,\n     President of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Enclosed is proposed legislation, the \n     Comprehensive Electricity Competition Act (CECA), that will \n     reduce electricity costs, benefit the economy, and improve \n     the environment by promoting competition and consumer choice \n     in the electricity industry.\n       The basic Federal regulatory framework for the electric \n     power industry was established with the enactment in 1935 of \n     the Public Utility Holding Company Act and Title II of the \n     Federal Power Act. These statutes are premised upon State-\n     regulated monopolies rather than competition. Now, however, \n     economic forces are beginning to forge a new era in the \n     electricity industry, one in which generation prices will be \n     determined primarily by the market rather than by legislation \n     and regulation. Consequently, Federal electricity laws need \n     to be updated so that they stimulate, rather than stifle, \n     competition.\n       In this new era of retail competition, consumers will \n     choose their electricity supplier. The Administration \n     estimates that consumers will save $20 billion a year. \n     Competition will also spark innovation in the American \n     economy and create new industries, jobs, products, and \n     services, just as telecommunications reform spawned cellular \n     phones and other new technologies.\n       Competition also will benefit the environment. The market \n     will reward a generator that wrings as much energy as \n     possible from every unit of fuel. More efficient fuel use \n     means lower emissions. In addition, competition provides \n     increased opportunities to sell energy efficiency services \n     and green power. Moreover, CECA's renewable portfolio \n     standard and enhanced public benefit funding will lead to \n     substantial environmental benefits.\n       The following are key provisions of CECA:\n       All electric consumers would be able to choose their \n     electricity supplier by January 1, 2003, but a State or \n     unregulated cooperative or municipal utility may opt out of \n     retail competition if it believes its consumers would be \n     better off under the status quo or an alternative retail \n     competition plan.\n       States would be encouraged to allow the recovery of \n     prudently incurred, legitimate, and verifiable retail \n     stranded costs that cannot be reasonably mitigated.\n       The regions served by the Tennessee Valley Authority and \n     the Federal Power Marketing Administrations would have \n     greater access to alternative sources of power.\n       All consumers would have the opportunity to reap the full \n     benefits of competition, because CECA would require retail \n     suppliers to provide information regarding the service being \n     offered; provide the Federal Trade Commission with the \n     authority to prevent ``slamming'' and ``cramming;'' require \n     States to consider implementing anti-redlining requirements; \n     allow for aggregation; authorize the establishment of an \n     electricity consumer database to help consumers compare \n     various offers, and establish a Model Retail Supplier Code \n     for States.\n       All users of the interstate transmission grid would be \n     subject to mandatory reliability standards. The Federal \n     Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) would approve and oversee \n     an organization that would develop and enforce these \n     standards.\n       FERC would have the authority to require utilities to turn \n     over operational control of transmission facilities to an \n     independent regional system operator.\n       A Renewable Portfolio Standard would be established to \n     ensure that by 2010 at least 7.5 percent of all electricity \n     sales consist of generation from non-hydroelectric renewable \n     energy sources.\n       A Public Benefits Fund would be established to provide \n     matching funds of up to $3 billion per year to States and \n     Indian tribes for low-income energy assistance, energy-\n     efficiency programs, consumer information, and the \n     development and demonstration of emerging technologies, \n     particularly renewable energy technologies. A rural safety \n     net would be created if significant adverse economic effects \n     on rural areas have occurred or will occur as a result of \n     electric industry restructuring.\n       Indian tribes would receive additional support through the \n     creation of a grant's program, the establishment of an Energy \n     Policy and Programs Office of the Department of\n\n[[Page S5290]]\n\n     Energy, and special incentives for renewable energy \n     production on Indian lands.\n       Barriers would be removed in order to encourage combined \n     heat and power and distributed power technologies.\n       The Environmental Protection Agency would be given \n     authority for interstate nitrogen oxides trading to \n     facilitate attainment of the ambient air quality standard for \n     ozone in the eastern United States.\n       Federal electricity laws would be modernized to achieve the \n     right balance of competition without market abuse by \n     repealing outdated laws including the Public Utility Holding \n     Company Act of 1935 and the ``must buy'' provision of the \n     Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 and by giving \n     FERC enhanced authority to address market power.\n       A separate bill being transmitted today would change \n     Federal tax law to address certain tax-exempt bonds, nuclear \n     decommissioning costs, class life for distributed power \n     facilities, and to provide a temporary tax credit for \n     combined heat and power facilities.\n       We urge the prompt enactment of CECA to provide lower \n     prices, a cleaner environment, and increased technical \n     innovation and efficiency.\n       The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act requires that all \n     revenue and direct spending legislation meet a pay-as-you-go \n     (PAYGO) requirement. That is, no such bill should result in \n     net budget costs: and if it does, it could contribute to a \n     sequester if it is not fully offset. This proposal affects \n     direct spending and receipts; therefore, it is subject to the \n     PAYGO requirement. The net PAYGO effect of this bill is \n     currently estimated to be a net cost of $60 million in FY \n     2000 and a net savings of $274 million from FY 2000 to FY \n     2004.\n       The proposals to provide an investment tax credit for \n     combined heat and power and to deny tax-exempt status for new \n     electric utility bonds except for distribution related \n     expenses, are included in the President's FY 2000 Budget. The \n     Budget contains proposals for mandatory spending reductions \n     and increases in receipts that are sufficient to finance \n     these proposals.\n       This estimate is preliminary and subject to change.\n       The pay-as-you-go effect of this draft bill is:\n\n                                                   FISCAL YEAR\n                                            [In millions of dollars]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                           1999    2000     2001      2002      2003      2004\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTax Provisions:\n  Revenue Effect \\1\\....................................      -1     -60       -88       -90       -22        34\n                                                         -------------------------------------------------------\nRenewable Portfolio Standards:\n  Offsetting receipts...................................  ......      -5        -9        -9        -9        -9\n  Outlays...............................................  ......       5         9         9         9         9\n                                                         -------------------------------------------------------\n      Net Cost..........................................  ......  ......  ........  ........  ........  ........\nPublic Benefits Fund and Electricity Reliability\n Organization:\n  Offsetting receipts...................................  ......  ......    -3,005    -3,005    -3,005    -3,005\n  Outlays...............................................  ......  ......     2,505     3,005     3,005     3,005\n                                                         -------------------------------------------------------\n      Net Cost..........................................  ......  ......      -500  ........  ........  ........\n                                                         =======================================================\n      Total Net Cost....................................       1      60      -412        90        22       -34\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ For tax provisions, a ``+'' is a revenue gain; a ``-'' is a revenue loss. These proposals have been fully\n  offset in the President's budget.\n\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is \n     no objection to the presentation of this legislation to the \n     Congress and that its enactment would be in accord with the \n     program of the President.\n       If you require any additional information, please call me \n     or have a member of your staff contact Mr. John C. Angell, \n     Assistant Secretary for Congressional and Intergovernmental \n     Affairs, at (202) 586-5450.\n       Yours sincerely,\n     Bill Richardson.\n                                  ____\n\n\n     Section-by-Section Analysis of the Comprehensive Electricity \n                            Competition Act\n\n\n                    TITLE I. RETAIL ELECTRIC SERVICE\n\n                    Section 101. Retail competition\n\n       This provision would amend the Public Utility Regulatory \n     Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) to require each distribution \n     utility to permit all of its retail customers to purchase \n     power from the supplier of their choice by January 1, 2003, \n     but would permit a State regulatory authority (with respect \n     to a distribution utility for which it has ratemaking \n     authority) or a non-regulated utility to opt out if it finds, \n     on the basis of a public proceeding, that consumers of the \n     utility would be served better by the current monopoly system \n     or an alternative retail competition plan.\n       The section also would enunciate a Federal policy that \n     utilities should be able to recover prudently incurred, \n     legitimate, and verifiable retail stranded costs that cannot \n     be mitigated reasonably, but States and non-regulated \n     utilities would continue to determine whether to provide for \n     retail stranded costs recovery. If States and non-regulated \n     utilities are considering implementation of retail \n     competition, they would also be required to consider \n     providing assistance for electric utility workers who may \n     become or have become unemployed as a result of the \n     implementation of retail competition. If a State or non-\n     regulated utility decides to impose a stranded cost charge, \n     it would be required to consider reducing that charge if the \n     charge results from the use of on-site efficient or renewable \n     generation. This section does not retrocede to States \n     authority over Federal enclaves.\n\n       Section 102. Authority to impose reciprocity requirements\n\n       This section would amend PURPA to permit a State that has \n     filed a notice indicating it is implementing retail \n     competition to prohibit a distribution utility that is not \n     under the ratemaking authority of the State and that has not \n     implemented retail competition from directly or indirectly \n     selling electricity to the consumers covered by the State's \n     notice. This section also would permit a nonregulated utility \n     that has filed a notice of retail competition to prohibit any \n     other utility that has not implemented retail competition \n     from directly or indirectly selling electricity to the \n     consumers covered by the nonregulated utility's notice.\n\n    Section 103. Aggregation for purchase of retail electric energy\n\n       This section would amend PURPA to ensure that electricity \n     customers and entities acting on their behalf, subject to \n     legitimate and non-discriminatory State requirements, would \n     be allowed to acquire retail electric energy on an aggregate \n     basis if they are served by one or more distribution \n     utilities for which a notice of retail competition has been \n     filed.\n\n\n                     TITLE II. CONSUMER PROTECTION\n\n                   Section 201. Consumer information\n\n       This section would amend PURPA to permit the Secretary of \n     Energy to require all suppliers of electricity to disclose \n     information on price, terms, and conditions; the type of \n     energy resource used to generate the electric energy; and the \n     environmental attributes of the generation, including air \n     emissions characteristics. This requirement would be \n     enforceable by the Federal Trade Commission and by individual \n     States.\n\n    Section 202. Access to electric service for low-income consumers\n\n       This section would amend PURPA to require a State \n     regulatory authority or nonregulated distribution utility \n     that files a notice of retail competition to consider \n     assuring that its low-income residential consumers have \n     service comparable to its other residential consumers and \n     that all retail electric suppliers in the State share \n     equitably any costs necessary to provide such service.\n\n                  Section 203. Unfair trade practices\n\n       This section would amend the Federal Trade Commission Act \n     to establish slamming and cramming in supplying electricity \n     as unfair trade practices punishable by the Federal Trade \n     Commission (FTC). Under this section, a person may not submit \n     or change, in violation of procedures established by the FTC, \n     a retail electric customer's selection of a retail electric \n     supplier. Also, a person may not charge a retail electric \n     customer for a particular service, except in accordance with \n     procedures established by the FTC.\n\n         Section 204. Residential electricity consumer database\n\n       This section would amend PURPA to authorize the Secretary \n     of Energy to establish a database containing information to \n     help residential electric consumers compare the offers of \n     various retail electric suppliers.\n\n                Section 205. Model retail supplier code\n\n       This section would amend PURPA to authorize the Secretary \n     of Energy to develop for State use a model code for the \n     regulation of retail electricity suppliers for the protection \n     of electric consumers.\n\n            Section 206. Model electric utility worker code\n\n       This section would amend PURPA to authorize the Secretary \n     of Energy to develop for State use a model code setting \n     standards for electric utility workers to ensure that \n     electric utilities are operated safely and reliably.\n\n\n         TITLE III--FACILITATING STATE AND REGIONAL REGULATION\n\n Section 301. Clarification of State and Federal authority over retail \n                         transmission services\n\n       Subsection (a) would clarify that the Federal Power Act \n     (FPA) does not prevent States and nonregulated distribution \n     utilities from ordering retail competition or imposing \n     conditions, such as a fee, on the receipt of electric energy \n     by an ultimate customer within the State. This section also \n     would clarify the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's \n     (FERC) authority over unbundled retail transmission.\n       Subsection (b) would reinforce FERC's authority to require \n     public utilities to provide open access transmission services \n     and permit recovery of stranded costs. This section also \n     would provide retroactive effect to Commission Order No. 888 \n     and clarify FERC's authority to order retail transmission \n     service to complete an authorized retail sale.\n       Subsection (c) would extend FERC's jurisdiction over \n     transmission services to municipal and other publicly-owned \n     utilities and cooperatives.\n       Subsection (d) would give the Secretary of Agriculture \n     intervention rights in FERC rulemakings that directly affect \n     a cooperative with loans made or guaranteed under the Rural \n     Electrification Act of 1936.\n\n   Section 302. Interstate compacts on regional transmission planning\n\n       This section would amend the FPA to permit FERC to approve \n     interstate compacts that establish regional transmission \n     planning agencies if the agencies meet certain criteria \n     relating to their governance.\n\n    Section 303. Backup authority to impose a charge on an ultimate \n                 consumer's receipt of electric energy\n\n       This section would amend the FPA to reinforce FERC's \n     authority to provide a back-up for the recovery of retail \n     stranded costs if a State or a non-regulated utility has \n     filed a\n\n[[Page S5291]]\n\n     retail competition notice and concludes that such charges are \n     appropriate but lacks authority to impose a charge on the \n     consumer's receipt of electric energy.\n\n Section 304. Authority to establish and require independent regional \n                            system operation\n\n       This section would amend section 202 of the FPA by \n     permitting FERC to establish an entity for independent \n     operation, planning, and control of interconnected \n     transmission facilities and to require a utility to \n     relinquish control over operation of its transmission \n     facilities to an independent regional system operator.\n\n\n                       TITLE IV--PUBLIC BENEFITS\n\n                   Section 401. Public benefits fund\n\n       This section would amend PURPA by establishing a Public \n     Benefits Fund administered by a Joint Board that would \n     disburse matching funds to participating States and tribal \n     governments to carry out programs that support affordable \n     electricity service to low-income customers; implement energy \n     conservation and energy efficiency measures and energy \n     management practices; provide consumer education; and develop \n     emerging electricity generation technologies. Funds for the \n     Federal share would be collected from generators, which, as a \n     condition of interconnection with facilities of any \n     transmitting utility, would pay to the transmitting utility a \n     charge, not to exceed one mill per kilowatt-hour. The \n     transmitting utility then would pay the collected amounts to \n     a fiscal agent for the Fund. States and tribal governments \n     would have the flexibility to decide whether to seek funds \n     and how to allocate funds among public purposes. In addition, \n     a rural safety net would be created if the Secretary of \n     Energy determines, in consultation with the Secretary of \n     Agriculture, that significant adverse economic effects on \n     rural areas have occurred or will occur as a result of \n     electric restructuring.\n\n           Section 402. Federal renewable portfolio standard\n\n       This section would amend PURPA to establish a Federal \n     Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) to guarantee that a \n     minimum level of renewable generation is developed in the \n     United States. The RPS would require electricity sellers to \n     have renewable credits based on a percentage of their \n     electricity sales. The seller would receive credits by \n     generating power from non-hydroelectric renewable \n     technologies, such as wind, solar, biomass, or geothermal \n     generation; purchasing credits from renewable generators; or \n     a combination of these, but would receive twice the number of \n     credits if the power was generated on Indian lands. The RPS \n     requirement for 2000-2004 would be set at the current ratio \n     of RPS-eligible generation to retail electricity sales. \n     Between 2005-2009, the Secretary of Energy would determine \n     the required annual percentage, which would be greater than \n     the baseline percentage but less than 7.5%. In 2010-2015, the \n     percentage would be 7.5%. The RPS credits would be subject to \n     a cost cap of 1.5 cents per kilowatt hour, adjusted for \n     inflation.\n\n                       Section 403. Net metering\n\n       This section would amend PURPA by requiring all retail \n     electric suppliers to make available to consumers ``net \n     metering service,'' through which a consumer would offset \n     purchases of electric energy from the supplier with electric \n     energy generated by the consumer at a small on-site renewable \n     generating facility and delivered to the distribution system. \n     This section also would clarify that States are not preempted \n     under Federal law from requiring a retail electric supplier \n     to make available net metering service.\n\n              Section 404. Reform of section 210 of PURPA\n\n       This section would repeal prospectively the ``must buy'' \n     provision of section 210 of PURPA. Existing contracts would \n     be preserved, and the other provisions of section 210 would \n     continue to apply.\n\n          Section 405. Interconnections for certain facilities\n\n       This section would amend PURPA to require a distribution \n     utility to allow a combined heat and power or a distributed \n     power facility to interconnect with it if the facility is \n     located in the distribution utility's service territory and \n     complies with rules issued by the Secretary of Energy and \n     related safety and power quality standards.\n\n    Section 406. Rural and remote communities electrification grants\n\n       This section would amend the Rural Electrification Act of \n     1936 to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture, in \n     consultation with the Secretary of Energy, to provide grants \n     for the purpose of increasing energy efficiency, lowering or \n     stabilizing electric rates to end users, or providing or \n     modernizing electric facilities for rural and remote \n     communities and Indian tribes.\n\n                  Section 407. Indian tribe assistance\n\n       This section would amend the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to \n     require the Secretary of Energy to establish a grant and \n     technical assistance program to assist Indian tribes to meet \n     their electricity needs. Among other things, the program \n     could provide assistance in planning and constructing \n     electricity generation, transmission, and distribution \n     facilities.\n\n        Section 408. Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs\n\n       This section would authorize the Secretary of Energy to \n     establish an office within the Department of Energy to \n     coordinate and implement energy, energy management, and \n     energy conservation programs for Indian tribes.\n\n             Section 409. Southeast Alaska electrical power\n\n       This section would authorize appropriations as necessary to \n     ensure the availability of adequate electric power to the \n     greater Ketchikan area in southeast Alaska, including an \n     intertie.\n\n\n         TITLE V--Regulation OF MERGERS AND CORPORATE STRUCTURE\n\n     Section 501. Reform of holding company regulation under PUHCA\n\n       This section would repeal the Public Utility Holding \n     Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA). In addition, FERC and State \n     regulatory commissions would be given greater access to the \n     books and records of holding companies and affiliates.\n\n                 Section 502. Electric company mergers\n\n       This section would amend the FPA by conferring on FERC \n     jurisdiction over the merger or consolidation of electric \n     utility holding companies and generation-only companies. This \n     section also would streamline FERC's review of mergers. In \n     addition, this section would require that FERC consider the \n     effect a merger could have on wholesale and retail electric \n     generation markets.\n\n            Section 503. Remedial measures for market power\n\n       This section would amend the FPA to authorize FERC to \n     remedy market power in wholesale markets. This section also \n     would authorize FERC, upon petition from a State, to remedy \n     market power in retail markets.\n\n\n                   title vi--electricity reliability\n\n      Section 601. Electric reliability organization and oversight\n\n       This section would amend the FPA to give FERC authority to \n     approve and oversee an Electric Reliability Organization to \n     prescribe and enforce mandatory reliability standards. \n     Membership in the organization would be open to all entities \n     that use the bulk-power system and would be required for all \n     entities critical to system reliability. The Electric \n     Reliability Organization would be authorized to delegate \n     authority to one or more Affiliated Regional Reliability \n     Entities, which could implement and enforce the standards \n     within a region.\n\n             Section 602. Electricity outage investigation\n\n       This section would amend the Department of Energy \n     Organization Act to establish in the Department of Energy a \n     board to investigate and determine the causes of a major \n     bulk-power system failure in the United States.\n\n             Section 603. Additional transmission capacity\n\n       This section would amend PURPA to give the Secretary of \n     Energy authority to call and chair a meeting of \n     representatives of States in a region in order to discuss \n     provision of additional transmission capacity and related \n     concerns.\n\n\n                  title vii--environmental protection\n\n           Section 701. Nitrogen oxides cap and trade program\n\n       This section would clarify Environmental Protection Agency \n     authority to require a cost-effective interstate trading \n     system for nitrogen oxide pollutant reductions addressing the \n     regional transport contributions needed to attain and \n     maintain the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for \n     ozone.\n\n\n                   title viii--federal power systems\n\n              Subtitle A--Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA)\n\n                        Section 801. Definition\n\n             Section 802. Application of Federal Power Act\n\n       This section would subject TVA to relevant provisions of \n     the FPA for purposes of TVA's transmission system, but would \n     provide that any determination of the Commission would be \n     subject to any other laws applicable to TVA, including the \n     requirement that TVA recover its costs.\n\n                    Section 803. Antitrust coverage\n\n       This section would subject TVA to the antitrust laws \n     effective January 1, 2003, except that TVA would not be \n     liable for civil damages or attorney's fees.\n\n                      Section 804. TVA power sales\n\n       This section would permit TVA, effective January 1, 2003, \n     to sell electric power at wholesale to any person. With \n     regard to sales at retail, this section would permit TVA to \n     sell (1) to existing customers or (2) to customers of an \n     existing wholesale customer of TVA, if the distributor has \n     firm power purchases from TVA of 50 percent or less of its \n     total retail sales, or if the distributor agrees that TVA can \n     sell power to the customer.\n\n        Section 805. Renegotiation of long-term power contracts\n\n       This section would require TVA to renegotiate its long-term \n     power contracts with respect to the remaining term; the \n     length of the termination notice; the amount of power a \n     distributor may purchase from a supplier other than TVA \n     beginning January 1, 2003, and access to the TVA transmission \n     system for that power; and stranded cost recovery. This \n     section would require that, if the parties are unable to \n     reach agreement within the one year, they would submit the \n     issues in dispute to the Federal Regulatory Commission for \n     final resolution.\n\n                  Section 806. Stranded cost recovery\n\n       This section would provide the Commission with the \n     authority to provide TVA with stranded cost recovery\n\n                   Section 807. Conforming amendments\n\n       This section would make conforming amendments to the \n     Tennessee Valley Authority Act.\n\n[[Page S5292]]\n\n              Subtitle B--Bonneville Power Administration\n\n                        Section 811. Definitions\n\n             Section 812. Application of Federal Power Act\n\n       This section would subject Bonneville to relevant \n     provisions of the FPA for purposes of Bonneville's \n     transmission system, but would provide that any determination \n     of the Commission would be subject to a list of conditions, \n     including a requirement that the rates and charges are \n     sufficient to recover existing and future Federal investment \n     in the Bonneville Transmission System.\n\n   Section 813. Surcharge on transmission rates to recover otherwise \n                          nonrecoverable costs\n\n       This section would require the Commission to establish a \n     mechanism that would enable the Administrator to place a \n     surcharge on rates or charges for transmission services over \n     the Bonneville Transmission System under limited \n     circumstances in order to recover power costs unable to be \n     recovered through power revenues in time to meet Bonneville's \n     cost recovery requirements.\n\n                        Section 814. Complaints\n\n       This section would clarify that the PMAs may file \n     complaints with the Commission.\n\n                Section 815. Review of Commission orders\n\n       This section would clarify that the PMAs may file a \n     rehearing request or may appeal a Commission order.\n\n                   Section 816. Conforming amendments\n\n       This section would make conforming amendments to the FPA, \n     the Federal Columbia River Transmission System Act, the \n     Pacific Northwest Regional Preference Act, the Pacific \n     Northwest Electric Power Planning and Conservation Act, and \n     the Bonneville Project Act.\n\n Subtitle C--Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) and Southwestern \n                      Power Administration (SWPA)\n\n                        Section 821.

Mr. President, at the request of the \nadministration, I am today joining with my good friend Senator \nMurkowski, the Chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, \nto introduce the president's electricity restructuring legislation.\n  The administration has presented Congress a fully comprehensive set \nof legislative proposals. For the first time we have detailed \nprovisions on every major issue affecting the electricity industry as \nit moves into the new world of competition. Significantly, the \npresident's comprehensive proposals include a framework for the \ntransition of the Bonneville Power Administration and the Tennessee \nValley Authority into the new competitive arena.\n  In considering the administration's proposals, Congress should look \nto areas that complement the states' ongoing restructuring activities, \nwhile leaving the key decisions on retail competition to state and \nlocal authorities. Let me mention three areas for federal concern. \nFirst, I believe Congress should remove federal impediments to states \nthat chose to implement retail competition. Second, we should take \nsteps to improve the regulation of interstate transmission and assure \nthe continued security and reliability of the nation's grid. And third, \nCongress should ensure that fair competition can operate at both the \nwholesale and retail levels. These are the issues that only Congress \ncan address.\n  Mr. President, Congress should not dwell any longer on whether retail \ncompetition is good or bad, or whether or not it will benefit all \nconsumers--the states are already making these decisions. It should be \nclear to all senators that retail competition for electric power \ngeneration is quickly becoming a reality. Nearly half of the states \nhave now enacted restructuring legislation. Last month, New Mexico \nenacted restructuring legislation that will soon bring retail \ncompetition in electricity to my state.\n  The consensus is growing on the need for federal legislation focused \nnarrowly on wholesale transactions, interstate transmission, and \nreliability. Mr. President, this is not a simple question of ``de-\nregulation'' versus ``re-regulation;'' this is about keeping America's \nhigh-tension grid system secure, reliable, and economical. The federal \nrole in regulating interstate commerce in electric power is clear. I \nhope we will move forward soon to resolve, at a minimum, the critical \nfederal issues.\n  Rather than commenting here on the pros and cons of any particular \nprovision in the president's bill, I will wait until the administration \nhas a fair opportunity to explain the bill to the Energy Committee in a \nlegislative hearing. I know the committee already has a very full \nplate, but I hope the Chairman will find time to hold a hearing soon on \nthis important topic.\n  Mr. President, Congress still has time to pass vital federal \nelectricity legislation, but we've got to get the process underway \npromptly. I hope the administration's proposals will help fuel interest \nin the Senate. Today America has the world's best electric power \nsystem. Let's not wait until serious problems develop to begin making \nthe needed changes in federal regulation. Electricity is too important \nto the nation to leave critical federal issues unresolved.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 1049. A bill to improve the administration of oil and gas leases \non Federal land, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n[[Page S5293]]\n\n      federal oil and gas lease management improvement act of 1999\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 1050. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nincentives for gas and oil producers, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                 energy security tax policy act of 1999\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the production of oil and gas in the \nUnited States is fast becoming a thing of the past. I am introducing \ntwo bills today to halt, and if possible, reverse that trend.\n  The economic consequences of the 1973 oil embargo were severe and \nlong lasting. Whole sectors of our economy underwent significant \nchanges and dislocations. Parts of the United States were plunged into \nrecession which remained for a decade as they adjusted to the \nfluctuations and insecurity of energy supplies in the 1970's. At the \ntime of the embargo, imports made up 36% of our oil consumption.\n  Our foreign policy was modified to reflect our growing dependence and \nprotecting oil-producing regions of the world took on a new importance. \nBy the time of the Gulf War of 1990-91, oil imports were roughly 50%.\n  Today, the United States depends upon foreign sources for some 56% of \nour supply. This is despite Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency (CAFE) \nstandards for cars which have almost doubled gas mileage. This is \ndespite the creation of the Department of Energy. This is despite the \nuntold billions of dollars which have been invested by U.S. industry in \nenergy-saving equipment and processes in order to remain competitive in \na world economy.\n  If no changes are made in federal policy to protect our domestic oil \nand gas industry--the ``pilot light'' of our nation's economy and \nsecurity upon which all productive enterprise depends--our future \nindeed may be bleak. The Department of Energy predicts 68% dependency \non foreign oil by the year 2010. This is just shy of a doubling of our \noil imports since the embargo of 1973.\n  In two recent hearings the Senate Energy & Natural Resources \nCommittee examined the state of the domestic oil and gas industries and \ntheir future. What we learned has been the impetus for my introduction \nof these bills today.\n  During the past 18 months, 136,000 U.S. oil wells and 57,000 gas \nwells have been shut in. 50,000 men and women throughout the United \nStates have lost their jobs in these industries--15% of all employees. \nWith operating oil rigs at an all-time low and new investment in the \nU.S. drying up, the future for domestic production of oil and gas is \ngrim.\n  While the consumption of natural gas is favored by the Administration \nas a means to reduce emissions, unless changes are made now in federal \npolicy to make production and delivery of natural gas easier, the \nprojected 50% increase in the need for natural gas by the year 2010 \nwill not be met without severe price shocks for American citizens.\n  The price of oil today is high enough for investment in the U.S. by \nthose who will or can still invest in our domestic oil and gas economy. \nHowever, the fact is that the fundamentals for investment in America \nare not good. Access to prospective areas is severely restricted, \nenvironmental costs are extremely high and production rates from U.S. \nwells are liable to be quite low, in comparison to other areas in the \nworld.\n  The U.S. is a mature and high cost oil producing region of the world. \nIn response to a changing world oil market, other producing countries \nare undertaking changes in their government policies to attract and \nretain economic investment in what they properly consider to be an \nimportant national industry.\n  For example, the United Kingdom has undertaken a significant \nregulatory reform effort to speed, simplify and provide certainty to \ninvestments in their energy industry. They are actively reviewing their \ntax and royalty systems to adjust them to the new realities of the \nworld energy markets. Colombia, likewise, is undertaking major \nreductions in royalties to attract and retain investment. These nations \nand others have determined that they must compete with the rest of the \nworld for investment capital, and are thus moving to make their nations \nmore attractive to such investment. The U.S. lags far behind.\n  The first of the bills I am introducing is identical to a measure \nbeing introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives by Congresswoman \nBarbara Cubin, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral \nResources. It makes significant changes in the oil and gas leasing \npolicies of the United States, by simplifying procedures and granting \nmore certainty for those who choose to invest in our domestic energy \nbusiness.\n  This legislation grants States the option of assuming federal \nregulation of oil and gas leases within their borders, after a federal \ndecision to lease is made. States already perform identical functions \non their lands, and this would standardize regulatory functions within \na State's borders. The States are closer than the federal government to \noil and gas leasing activities within their borders, and are best \npositioned to make timely and responsible regulatory decisions. In \nreturn for opting to assume the specified federal responsibilities for \nthese activities, the States would receive payment of up to 50% of the \ncosts currently assessed them by the federal government for these \nfunctions. Federal ownership of the lands would continue.\n  An important part of this legislation clarifies that the federal \ngovernment can no longer charge States via the existing ``net receipts \nsharing'' program for the costs of programmatic planning activities on \nfederal lands unrelated to mineral leasing activities. This would stop \ncreative legal interpretations by the Department of Interior like that \nwhich charged Utah for the government's secret planning which resulted \nin the creation of an enormous National Monument in that State. This \ntype of creative accounting undermines the respect of the citizenry in \ntheir governmental institutions, and with this bill, we will plug this \nleak in the public trust.\n  The legislation also assists States by dropping the requirement that \ntheir share of mineral leasing on federal lands within their borders be \nreduced by the government's costs of administering mineral leasing if a \nState opts to assume the federal government's responsibility for \nregulation of oil and gas activities.\n  In order to speed development of secure sources of domestic oil and \ngas by making federal practices more competitive with the rest of the \nworld, I have included in the bill certain provisions which are \nintended to correct federal practices which are hastening the flight of \noil and gas development capital to foreign shores.\n  One recurring criticism from those who would like to invest in \nAmerica's domestic energy development is the uncertainty they encounter \nwhen they do business with their own federal government. In order to \nmake investment decisions, they must have some certainty about when \nthey might reasonably be expected to be able to actually take \npossession of, and invest capital in, a federal lease. Moreover, the \ngovernment is increasingly charging potential lessees for governmental \nactivities before they have any reasonable expectation of being granted \na lease. This is akin to charging customers just to stand in line to \nbuy a lottery ticket for a drawing which may never be held. This is \nabsurd, and is a clear signal to potential investors that the U.S. \ncares little about whether the investment is made here or abroad. This \nlegislation will reverse that signal and provide the certainty that \ninvestors need.\n  Additionally, my legislation would establish reasonable and \nresponsible time frames for the government to respond to requests for \npermits. If legally-required analyses could not be undertaken by the \ngovernment within a reasonable time, the applicant could be offered the \nopportunity to contract for such analyses by an independent party for \nthe government's use. My bill would allow the applicant to receive a \ncredit against royalties due from eventual production in the area for \nsuch costs, in recognition of the fact that the more rapidly lands are \nleased and put into oil or gas production, the more revenues the \ngovernment will receive and the quicker it will receive it.\n  My legislation also sets fair but rigid performance deadlines for the \ncompletion of federal lease decision-making.\n\n[[Page S5294]]\n\nOne of the most frequent concerns I hear from small companies \nthroughout the country in the oil and gas producing business is the \nsnail-like pace of federal decision-making. Customers of government \nservices deserve a ``yes'' or ``no'', instead of the endless series of \n``maybes'' to which they have become accustomed. They deserve no less, \nand I seek to correct that deficiency before all oil and gas investment \nflees our shores.\n  Coordination among federal land management agencies over leasing \npolicies is also long overdue. The bill requires the Secretaries of the \nInterior and Agriculture to report to Congress with recommendations \nexplaining the most efficient means of eliminating duplication of \neffort and inconsistent policy between the Bureau of Land Management \nand the Forest Service with respect to the treatment of oil and gas \nleases.\n  The U.S. government and the public deserve to have the best knowledge \npossible about our domestic supplies of energy. The legislation I am \nintroducing today initiates a modern, science-based energy inventory \nprocess to be undertaken by the Secretary of Interior and the Director \nof the U.S. Geological Survey. Technology for determining oil and gas \navailability has revolutionized the private sector; it is time for this \nquantum leap information to be used by the government.\n  I am particularly happy to include as Title 4 of the bill a provision \nthat Senator Don Nickles recently introduced as S. 924, concerning \nfederal royalty certainty. This would put an end to the seemingly \nintractable problem that has sprung up between lessees and the \nDepartment of Interior over the issue of where oil is to be valued for \nroyalty purposes. While other nations around the world are taking steps \nto become more competitive for energy investments by changing laws to \nencourage investment and provide certainty to possible investors, this \nrecent back-door royalty increase by the Administration has sent a \nstrong signal to domestic producers that they are no longer welcome \nhere. Title 4 merely clarifies what congress has been saying all \nalong--that oil should be valued for royalty purposes at or near the \nlease. This clarification is absolutely essential if consumers are to \nreceive the 30 trillion cubic feet of gas the Administration says they \nwill demand in a decade at a cost they can afford.\n\n  The final title of the legislation will serve as a strong signal to \nour domestic industry that we value the jobs they provide for our \nneighbors and the investment they make right here at home. It \nrecognizes that when world oil prices make investments in American \nenergy production uncompetitive with foreign investments, the U.S. will \nadjust our take from the current direct royalty to a system which \npromotes jobs and investment in down times and increases royalty and \nU.S. production later. Specifically, it calls for a 20% credit against \nroyalties due the federal government against capital expenditures \nduring times of lowered oil and gas prices. If a landlord discovered \nthat his rental units were vacant because they were overpriced compared \nto the competition, he would drop the price to attract renters. The \nfederal government should do the same.\n  The legislation would also adjust the definition of what constitutes \na ``marginal'' oil well, and allow for suspensions of leases at the \nlessee's option when oil prices dip precipitously.\n  This bill is a comprehensive attempt to bring some of our mineral \nleasing laws and regulations up-to-date with the realities of today's \nworld energy markets. Our domestic industry is dying on the vine \nbecause of a combination of governmental actions and inactions, complex \nregulation and outdated governmental approaches to this important part \nof our national economy. We need to take steps to make sure that the \n``pilot light'' of our economy does not go out, and it is my belief \nthat this legislation will go a long way to ensuring its continuing \ncontributions to our nation's strength.\n  Mr. President, the second measure that I am introducing today will \nredress some of the unfair tax penalties that hinder the continued \ndevelopment and modernization of a domestic oil and gas industry. In \nparticular the legislation focuses on aspects of the alternative \nminimum tax (AMT) that have a perverse effect on the industry, \nespecially when energy prices are low.\n  Mr. President, in adopting the AMT in 1986, Congress stated that its \npurpose was to ``serve one overriding objective: to ensure that no \ntaxpayer with substantial economic income can avoid significant tax \nliability by using exclusions, deductions and credits.'' Yet the \nunintended consequence of the AMT is that companies with high fixed \ncosts, such as the oil and gas industry, can face higher effective AMT \ntax rates when the price of oil is low than when the price is high. In \nother words, when oil and gas companies are struggling to cope with low \nworld prices, the AMT serves to impose a tax penalty simply because \nprices are low.\n  Let me give you an example of the perverse effect of the AMT. If the \nprice of oil is $10 a barrel and an oil and gas company sells 100,000 \nbarrels of oil, the company's revenues would be $1 million. If its \nproduction costs were $500,000, its gross profits would be $500,000. If \nthe company took advantage of percentage depletion and other oil and \ngas incentives, it could reduce it's taxable income to $100,000 and owe \n$35,000 in taxes. However, because the AMT takes back many of these oil \nand gas incentives, the same company would be subject to a $90,000 AMT. \nThat is a 90 percent tax rate.\n  By contrast, assuming the same fixed costs and incentives, if the \nprice of oil was $20 a barrel and the company had $1.1 million in \ntaxable income, its regular tax rate would only be 35 percent and it's \nAMT liability would be only 26.4 percent. Mr. President, that is not \nthe way the AMT was designed to work.\n  My bill tackles this problem head-on. It eliminates the AMT \npreferences for intangible drilling costs, percentage depletion, and \nthe depreciation adjustment for oil and gas assets. In addition, it \neliminates the impact of intangible drilling costs, depletion and \ndepreciation on oil and gas assets from the adjusted current earnings \nadjustment. Finally, the proposal allows the enhanced oil recovery \ncredit and the Section 29 credit to be used to offset the AMT.\n  In addition to trying to resolve the AMT problems that face the \nindustry, I have adopted a portion of a bill introduced by Senator Kay \nBailey Hutchison that attempts to maintain viable independent producers \nand ensure that marginal wells stay in operation. Marginal wells are \nthose that produce less than 15 barrels a day. In reality they produce \non average about 2.2 barrels of oil a day. While individually these \nwells may not seem like important components of our domestic energy \nsupply, together they produce as much oil as the United States imports \nfrom Saudia Arabia. To maintain these marginal wells, the legislation \nincludes a marginal well tax credit of $3.00 per barrel in order to \nprolong marginal domestic oil and gas well production.\n\n  Mr. President, in an effort to stimulate enhanced recovery of oil and \nthereby increase U.S. production, my legislation enlarges the \ndefinition of enhanced oil recovery by including horizontal drilling in \nareas of Alaska where the only feasible method of recovering some oil \nis to use such methods. In Alaska, it is just not economically feasible \nto search for oil by moving drilling platforms from area to area. \nInstead, the oil companies attempt to locate oil by using a single \ndrilling platform and employing horizontal drilling techniques to \nsearch for oil. My legislation recognizes these economic realities and \nencourages further development of horizontal drilling techniques so \nthat we can recover oil more feasibly.\n  Finally, Mr. President, this second measure addresses a problem that \nhas recently arisen with natural gas gathering lines. These lines are \nused to transport natural gas from the well-head to a central \nprocessing facility for processing before it can be transported via \ntrunk lines to an end user such as a distribution facility. The Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission (FERC) exempts gas processor gather lines \nfrom FERC jurisdiction because they are classified as gas gathering \nequipment that is part of the production facility, not pipeline \ntransportation under FERC rules.\n  IRS has taken the position that these lines should be depreciated \nover a 15 year period if they are owned and operated by an entity that \ndoes not produce oil or gas transported in the line. However, if gas \ntransported in the line is\n\n[[Page S5295]]\n\nowned by the producer, the line can be depreciated over 7 years.\n  Mr. President, this rule does not make sense. The depreciable life of \nan asset should depend on the use of the asset and not who owns the \nasset. For that reason, my legislation clarifies that these gathering \nlines are depreciable over 7 years no matter who the owner of the \npipeline is.\n  Mr. President, there are many other tax changes that have been \nproposed to assist the oil and gas industry. It is my view that the \nproposals I have offered will, over the long term, improve the health \nof the industry in the most cost-effective manner.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the two bills be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1049\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) State governments have a long and successful history of \n     regulation of operations to explore for and produce oil and \n     gas; the special role of the States was recognized by \n     Congress in 1935 through its ratification under the \n     Constitution of the Interstate Compact to Conserve Oil and \n     Gas;\n       (2) under the guidance of the Interstate Oil and Gas \n     Compact Commission, States have established effective \n     regulation of the oil and natural gas industry and subject \n     their programs to periodic peer review through the \n     Commission;\n       (3) it is significantly less expensive for State \n     governments than for the Federal Government to regulate oil \n     and gas lease operations on Federal land;\n       (4) significant cost savings could be achieved, with no \n     reduction in environmental protection or in the conservation \n     of oil and gas resources, by having the Federal Government \n     defer to State regulation of oil and gas lease operations on \n     Federal land;\n       (5) State governments carry out regulatory oversight on \n     Federal, State, and private land; oil and gas companies \n     operating on Federal land are burdened with the additional \n     cost and time of duplicative oversight by both Federal and \n     State conservation authorities; additional cost savings could \n     be achieved within the private sector by having the Secretary \n     defer to State regulation;\n       (6) the Federal Government is presently cast in opposing \n     roles as a mineral owner and regulator; State regulation of \n     oil and gas operations on Federal land would eliminate this \n     conflict of interest;\n       (7) it remains the responsibility of the Secretary of the \n     Interior to carry out the Federal policy set forth in the \n     Mining and Minerals Policy Act of 1970 (30 U.S.C. 21a) to \n     foster and encourage private sector enterprise in the \n     development of economically sound and stable domestic mineral \n     industries, and the orderly and economic development of \n     domestic mineral resources and reserves, including oil and \n     gas resources; and\n       (8) resource management analyses and surveys conducted \n     under the conservation laws of the United States benefit the \n     public at large and are an expense properly borne by the \n     Federal Government.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to transfer from the Secretary to each State in which \n     Federal land is present authority to regulate oil and gas \n     operations on leased tracts and related operations as fully \n     as if the operations were occurring on privately owned land;\n       (2) to share the costs saved through more efficient State \n     enforcement among State governments and the Federal treasury;\n       (3) to prevent the imposition of unwarranted delays and \n     recoupments of Federal administrative costs on Federal oil \n     and gas lessees;\n       (4) to effect no change in the administration of Indian \n     land; and\n       (5) to ensure that funds deducted from the States' net \n     receipt share are directly tied to administrative costs \n     related to mineral leasing on Federal land.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to implement further the Act (Public Law 94-241) \napproving the Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern \nMariana Islands in Political Union with the United States of America, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n          northern mariana islands covenant implementation act\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I am introducing a \nmodified version of legislation that the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources reported to the Senate last Congress to address \nvarious problems that have arisen in the Commonwealth of the Northern \nMariana Islands. As reported by the Committee last Congress, the \nlegislation would have created an industry committee to establish \nminimum wage levels similar to committees that had been created for \nother territories and that still exist for American Samoa. The \nlegislation would also have established a mechanism for the extension \nof federal immigration laws if the government of the Northern Marianas \nproved unable or unwilling to adopt and enforce an effective \nimmigration system. The legislation that I am introducing today does \nnot include any provisions dealing with wages. I continue to believe \nthat an industry committee is preferable to outright extension of \nfederal wage rates, but the Northern Marianas, the Administration, and \nsome of my cosponsors would prefer to have that debate on another \nvehicle.\n  Immigration, however, is at the heart of the problems facing the \nNorthern Marianas. This legislation reflects the recommendation of the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources last Congress. What appears \non the surface to be a prosperous diversified economy in the Northern \nMarianas, is in fact a far more fragile economy that is becoming ever \nmore dependent on a system of imported labor. Unemployment among US \nresidents remains high and the public sector is rapidly becoming the \nonly source of employment for US citizens residing in the Marianas. The \npublic sector workforce has doubled over the past several years and \npayroll is the largest expense of the government. The recent downturn \nin tourism as a result of economic problems in Asia has only served to \naggravate the situation in the Marianas, increase the pressures on \npublic sector employment, and tighten the dependence of the Marianas on \nimported labor for the private sector, mainly garment manufacturing.\n  The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) is a three \nhundred mile archipelago consisting of fourteen islands stretching \nnorth of Guam. The largest inhabited islands are Saipan, Rota, and \nTinian. Magellan landed at Saipan in 1521 and the area was controlled \nby Spain until the end of the Spanish American War. Guam, the \nsouthernmost of the Marianas, was ceded to the United States following \nthe Spanish-American War and the balance sold to Germany together with \nthe remainder of Spain's possessions in the Caroline and Marshall \nIslands.\n  Japan seized the area during World War I and became the mandatory \npower under a League of Nations Mandate for Germany's possessions north \nof the equator on December 17, 1920. By the 1930's Japan had developed \nmajor portions of the area and begun to fortify the islands. Guam was \ninvaded by Japanese forces from Saipan in 1941. The Marianas were \nsecured after heavy fighting in 1944 and the bases on Tinian were used \nfor the invasion of Okinawa and for raids on Japan, including the \nnuclear missions on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In 1947, the Mandated \nislands were placed under the United Nations trusteeship system as the \nTrust Territory of the Pacific Islands (TTPI) and the United States was \nappointed as the Administering Authority. The area was divided into six \nadministrative districts with the headquarters located in Hawaii and \nthen in Guam. The TTPI was the only ``strategic'' trusteeship with \nreview by the Security Council rather than the General Assembly of the \nUnited Nations. The Navy administered the Trusteeship, together with \nGuam, until 1951, when administrative jurisdiction was transferred to \nthe Department of the Interior. The Northern Marianas, however, were \nreturned to Navy jurisdiction from 1952-1962. In 1963, administrative \nheadquarters were moved to Saipan.\n  With the establishment of the Congress of Micronesia in 1965, efforts \nto reach an agreement on the future political status of the area began. \nAttempts to maintain a political unity within the TTPI were \nunsuccessful, and each of the administrative districts (Kosrae \neventually separated from Pohnpei District in the Carolines) sought to \nretain its separate identity. Four of the districts became the \nFederated States of Micronesia, the Marshalls became the Republic of \nthe Marshall Islands, and Palau became the Republic of Palau, all \nsovereign countries in free association with the United States under \nCompacts of Free Association. The Marianas had sought reunification \nwith Guam and US territorial status from the beginning of the \nTrusteeship. Separate negotiations with the Marianas began in December, \n1972 and concluded in 1975.\n  In 1976, Congress approved a Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of \nthe Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States \n(PL 94-241). The Covenant had been approved in a United Nations \nobserved plebescite in the Northern Mariana Islands and formed the \nbasis for the termination of the United Nations Trusteeship with \nrespect to the Northern Mariana Islands in 1986 together with the \nRepublic of the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of \nMicronesia. Prior to termination, those provisions of the Covenant that \nwere not inconsistent with the status of the area (such as extension of \nUS sovereignty) were made applicable by the US as Administering \nAuthority. Upon termination of the Trusteeship, the CNMI became a \nterritory of the United States and its residents became United States \ncitizens. Under the terms of the Covenant certain federal laws would be \ninapplicable in the CNMI, including minimum wage to take into \nconsideration the relative economic situation of the islands and their \nrelation to other east Asian countries.\n  Although the population of the CNMI was only 15,000 people in 1976 \nwhen the Covenant went into effect, the population now exceeds 60,000 \nand US citizens are a minority. The resident population is probably \nabout 24,000 with about 28,000 alien workers and estimates of at least \n10,000 illegal aliens. Permits for non-resident workers were reported \nat 22,500 for 1994, the largest category being for manufacturing. \nTourism has climbed from about 230,000\n\n[[Page S5302]]\n\nvisitors in 1987 to almost 600,000 in 1994. Total revenues for the CNMI \nfor 1993 were estimated at $157 million.\n  The 1995 census statistics from the Commonwealth list unemployment at \n7.1%, with CNMI born at 14.2% and Asia born at 4.5%. Since no guest \nworkers should be on island without jobs, the 4.5% suggests a serious \nproblem in the CNMI. The 14.2% local unemployment suggests that either \nguest workers are taking jobs from local residents, or the wage rates \nor types of occupation are not adequate to attract local workers.\n\n  The Covenant established a unique system in the CNMI under which the \nlocal government controlled immigration and minimum wage levels and \nalso had the benefit of duty and quota free entry of manufactured goods \nunder the provisions of General Note 3(a) of the Harmonized Tariff \nSchedules. The Section by Section analysis of the Committee Report on \nthe Covenant provides in part:\n\n       Section 503.--This section deals with certain laws of the \n     United States which are not now applicable to the Northern \n     Mariana Islands and provides that they will remain \n     inapplicable except in the manner and to the extent that they \n     are made applicable by specific legislation enacted after the \n     termination of the Trusteeship. These laws are:\n       The Immigration and Naturalization Laws (subsection (a)). \n     The reason this provision is included is to cope with the \n     problems which unrestricted immigration may impose upon small \n     island communities. Congress is aware of those problems. . . \n     . It may well be that these problems will have been solved by \n     the time of the termination of the Trusteeship Agreement and \n     that the Immigration and Nationality Act containing adequate \n     protective provisions can then be introduced to the Northern \n     Mariana Islands. . . .\n       The same consideration applies to the introduction of the \n     Minimum Wage Laws. (Subsection (c)). Congress realizes that \n     the special conditions prevailing in the various territories \n     require different treatment. . . . In these circumstances, it \n     would be inappropriate to introduce the Act to the Northern \n     Mariana Islands without preliminary studies. There is nothing \n     which would prevent the Northern Mariana Islands from \n     enacting their own Minimum Wage Legislation. Moreover, as set \n     forth in section 502(b), the activities of the United States \n     and its contractors in the Northern Mariana Islands will be \n     subject to existing pertinent Federal Wages and Hours \n     Legislation. (S. Rept. 94-433, pp.77-78)\n\n  The Committee anticipated that by the termination of the Trusteeship, \nthe federal government would have found some way of preventing a large \ninflux of persons into the Marianas, recognizing the Constitutional \nlimitations on restrictions on travel. In part, the Covenant attempted \nto deal with that possibility by enacting a restraint on land \nalienation for twenty-five years, subject to extension by the CNMI. The \nminimum wage issue was more difficult, especially in light of the \nCommittee's experience in the Pacific. The extension of minimum wage to \nKwajalein was a proximate cause of the overcrowding at Ebeye in the \nKwajalein Atoll as hundreds of Marshallese moved to the small island in \nhope of obtaining a job at the Missile Range. The CNMI, at the time the \nCovenant was negotiated, had a limited private sector economy and was \nunder the overall Trust Territory minimum wage, which was considerably \nlower than the federal minimum wage. The Marianas also had been a \nclosed security area until the early 1960's, further limiting \ndevelopment. Congress fully expected that the Marianas would establish \nits own schedule and would, within a reasonable time frame, raise \nminimum wages as the local economy grew. At the time of the Covenant, \nGuam's local minimum wage exceeded the federal levels, and the \nCommittee anticipated that the Northern Marianas would mirror the \nhistory of Guam.\n  Shortly after the Covenant went into effect, the CNMI began to \nexperience a growth in tourism and a need for workers in both the \ntourist and construction industries. Interest also began to grow in the \npossibility of textile production. Initial interest was in production \nof sweaters made of cotton, wool and synthetic fibers. The CNMI, like \nthe other territories, except for Puerto Rico, is outside the U.S. \ncustoms territory but can import products manufactured in the territory \nduty free provided that the products meet a certain value added amount \nunder General Note 3(a) of the Tariff Schedules (then called Headnote \n3(a)). The first company began operation in October, 1983 and within a \nyear was joined by two other companies. Total employment for the three \nfirms was 250 of which 100 were local residents. At the time, Guam had \na single firm, Sigallo-Pac, also engaged in sweater manufacture with \n275 workers, all of whom, however, were U.S. citizens.\n  Attempts by territories to develop textile or apparel industries have \ntraditionally met resistence from Stateside industries. The use of \nalien labor in the CNMI intensified that concern, and efforts began in \n1984 to sharply cut back or eliminate the availability of duty free \ntreatment for the territories. The concerns also complicated Senate \nconsideration of the Compacts of Free Association in 1985 and led to a \ndelay of several months in floor consideration when some Members sought \nto attach textile legislation to the Compact legislation. By 1986, \nconditions led the Assistant Secretary, Territorial and International \nAffairs of the Department of the Interior to write the Governor on the \nsituation and that ``[w]ithout timely and effective action to reverse \nthe current situation, I must consider proposing Congressional \nenactment of U.S. Immigration and Naturalization requirements for the \nNMI''.\n  By 1990, the population of the CNMI was estimated at 43,345 of whom \nonly 16,752 had been born in the CNMI. Of the 26,593 born elsewhere, \n2,491 had entered from 1980-1984, 2,591 had entered in 1985 or 1986, \n6,438 had entered in 1987 or 1988, and 12,955 had entered in 1989 or \n1990. Of the population in 1990, 21,332 were classified as Asian. The \nlabor force (all persons 16+ years including temporary alien labor) \ngrew from 9,599 in 1980 to 32,522 in 1990. Manufacturing grew from 1.9% \nof the workforce in 1980 to 21.9% in 1990, only slightly behind \nconstruction which grew from 16.8% to 22.2% in the same time frame. The \nconstruction numbers track a major increase in hotel construction. At \nthe same time, increases in the minimum wage were halted although wages \npaid to U.S. citizens (mainly public sector and management) exceeded \nfederal levels.\n  In 1993, in response to Congressional concerns, the CNMI stated that \nit proposed to enact legislation to raise the wage rates from $2.15 to \nfederal levels by stages and that legislation would be enacted to \nprevent any abuse of workers.\n  Repeated allegations of violations of applicable federal laws \nrelating to worker health and safety, concerns with respect to \nimmigration problems, including the admission of undesirable aliens, \nand reports of worker abuse, especially in the domestic and garment \nworker sectors, led to the inclusion of a $7 million set aside in \nappropriations in 1994 to support federal agency presence in the CNMI. \nThe Administration was not prepared to commit agency resources to the \nCNMI absent the funding, but with an agreement for reimbursement, the \nDepartment of the Interior reported to the Committee on April 24, 1995 \nthat:\n  1) $3 million would be used by the CNMI for a computerized \nimmigration identification and tracking system and for local projects;\n  2) $2.2 million would be used by the Department of Justice to \nstrengthen law enforcement, including the hiring of an additional FBI \nagent and Assistant US Attorney;\n  3) $1.6 million would be used by Labor for two senior investigators \nas well as for training; and\n  4) $200,000 would be used by Treasury for assistance in investigating \nviolations of federal law with respect to firearms, organized crime, \nand counterfeiting.\n  In addition, the report recommended that federal law be enacted to \nphase in the current CNMI minimum wage rates to the federal minimum \nwage level in 30 cent increments (as then provided by CNMI \nlegislation), end mandatory assistance to the CNMI when the current \nagreement was fulfilled, continue annual support of federal agencies at \na $3 million/year level (which would include funding for a detention \nfacility that meets federal standards), and possible extension of \nfederal immigration laws.\n  During the 104th Congress, the Senate passed S. 638, legislation \nsupported by the Administration, that in part would have enacted the \nphase in of the CNMI minimum wage rate to US levels in 30 cent \nincrements. No action was taken by the House, and, in the interim, the \nCNMI delayed the scheduled increases and then instituted a limited \nincrease of 30 cents/hour except for the garment and construction \nindustries\n\n[[Page S5303]]\n\nwhere the increase was limited to 15 cents/hour. The legislation also \nrequired the Commonwealth ``to cooperate in the identification and, if \nnecessary, exclusion or deportation from the Commonwealth of the \nNorthern Mariana Islands of persons who represent security or law \nenforcement risks to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands \nor the United States.'' (Section 4 of S. 638) At the same time that \nCongress began to consider legislation on minimum wage and immigration \nissues, concern over the commitment of federal agencies to administer \nand enforce those federal laws already applicable to the CNMI led the \nCommittee to include a provision in S. 638 that the annual report on \nthe law enforcement initiative also include: ``(6) the reasons why \nFederal agencies are unable or unwilling to fully and effectively \nenforce Federal laws applicable within the Commonwealth of the Northern \nMariana Islands unless such activities are funded by the Secretary of \nthe Interior.'' (Section 3 of S. 638)\n  In February, 1996, I led a Committee trip to the CNMI. We met with \nlocal and federal officials as well as inspecting a garment factory and \nmeeting with Bangladesh security guards who had not been paid and who \nwere living in substandard conditions. Their living conditions were \nintolerable. There was no running water, no workable toilets, the \nshack--and that is being kind--was in deplorable condition. As I said \nat the time, this was a condition that should never exist on American \nsoil. It existed in the shadow of the Hyatt Hotel.\n  I raised my concerns with the Governor and with other officials in \nSaipan. We were assured that corrective action would be taken. Those \nassurances, especially those dealing with minimum wages, seem to have \ndisappeared as soon as our plane was airborne. As a result of the \nmeetings and continued expressions of concern over conditions, the \nCommittee held an oversight hearing on June 26, 1996 to review the \nsituation in the CNMI. At the hearing, the acting Attorney General of \nthe Commonwealth requested that the Committee delay any action on \nlegislation until the Commonwealth could complete a study on minimum \nwage and promised that the study would be completed by January. That \ntiming would have enabled the Committee to revisit the issue in the \nApril-May 1997 period after the Administration had transmitted its \nannual report on the law enforcement initiative. While the CNMI Study \nwas not finally transmitted until April, the Administration did not \ntransmit its annual report, which was due in April, until July. On May \n30, 1997, the President wrote the Governor of the Northern Marianas \nthat he was concerned over activities in the Commonwealth and had \nconcluded that federal immigration, naturalization, and minimum wage \nlaws should apply.\n  Given the reaction that followed the President's letter, I asked the \nAdministration to provide a drafting service of the language needed to \nimplement the recommendations in the annual report and informed the \nGovernor of the Commonwealth of the request and that the Committee \nintended to consider the legislation after the Commonwealth had an \nopportunity to review it. The drafting service was not provided until \nOctober 6, 1997 and was introduced on October 8, 1997, shortly before \nthe elections in the CNMI. The Committee deferred hearings so as not to \nintrude unnecessarily into local politics and to allow the CNMI an \nopportunity to review and comment on the legislation after the local \nelections.\n  The U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform conducted a site visit to \nthe Northern Marianas in July 1997 and issued a report which, in \ngeneral, supports the need to address immigration. The report, however, \nalso raises some concerns with the extension of US immigration laws. \nThe report found problems in the CNMI ``ranging from bureaucratic \ninefficiencies to labor abuses to an unsustainable economic, social and \npolitical system that is antithetical to most American values'' but ``a \nwillingness on the part of some CNMI officials and business leaders to \naddress the various problems''. The report expressed some concerns over \nthe extension of federal immigration laws, but that absent the threat \nof federal extension, ``the CNMI is unlikely on its own to correct the \nproblems inherent in its immigration system''. The report recommended \nthat specific benchmarks for an effective immigration system be \nnegotiated and that the ``benchmarks should be codified in statute, \nwith provision for immediate imposition of federal law if the \nbenchmarks are not met within the prescribed time.'' Specifically the \nreport recommended that ``[s]hould the CNMI fail to negotiate \nexpeditiously and in good faith, or renege on the negotiated \nagreements, we agree that imposition of federal law by Congress would \nbe required.'' (Emphasis in original)\n\n  While the outright exception from the minimum wage provisions of \nfederal law in the Covenant is an anomaly, so also was the direct phase \nin to federal levels contained in the legislation as transmitted by the \nAdministration. Congress has generally recognized the different \neconomic circumstances of the territories and provided for a ``special \nindustry committee''. The objective of an industry committee is to set \nwage rates by industry ``to reach as rapidly as is economically \nfeasible without substantially curtailing employment the objective of \nthe [federal] minimum wage rate'' (29 U.S.C. 208(a)). The committees \nmay make classifications within industries. Such committees were \nestablished for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands in 1940 and \ncontinued until Congress provided for step increases in 1977 for the \nremaining covered industries. An industry committee has been applicable \nin American Samoa since 1956. In 1992, the Department of the Interior \nprovided formal Administration opposition to legislation that would \nhave extended federal minimum wage rates to Samoa stating that \n``[i]mposition of the United States mainland minimum wage on American \nSamoa would have a serious, perhaps devastating effect on the \nterritorial economy and jobs''. The industry committee for Samoa set \nrates for 1996 that ranged from $2.45/hour for local government \nemployees to $3.75/hour for the subclass of stevedoring and lighterage. \nWages for the canneries was set at $3.10/hour.\n  While the economic situation of the CNMI is considerably different \nfrom that of American Samoa, it is not absolutely clear that all \nsegments of all industries in the CNMI are capable of sustaining \nfederal minimum wage rates. Unlike American Samoa, the minimum wage \nissue in the CNMI appears to involve only temporary non-immigrant \nworkers. All U.S. citizens resident in the CNMI appear to be earning at \nor above federal minimum wage levels. The CNMI completed a minimum wage \nanalysis in April 1997 by the HayGroup. The analysis recommended \nagainst a change in current wage rates for at least three years and \nplanning to accommodate growth. An industry committee would be able to \nassess the merits of claims by individual industries and structure a \nsystem that takes into account the individual needs of particular \nindustries or sub-classes.\n  As I stated earlier, I believe that an industry committee is the \nproper approach. I have not included the provision in this legislation \ndue to the opposition of the Northern Marianas, the Administration, and \nseveral of my colleagues. The Northern Marianas believes that it can \navoid becoming entangled in the federal minimum wage legislation \npending in Congress. I don't share their belief, but this is their \nchoice.\n  The Committee conducted a hearing on March 31, 1998 on S. 1275 and S. \n1100, similar legislation introduced by Senator Akaka and others. The \nCommittee heard from the Administration, the government of the CNMI, \nworkers and representatives of the local industry, as well as public \nwitnesses. At a business meeting of the Committee on May 20, 1998, the \nlegislation was amended and then ordered to be favorably reported to \nthe Senate. Unfortunately, the Senate did not take action on the \nmeasure prior to adjournment.\n  The portion of the Committee amendment that I am introducing today \nprovides for full extension of the Immigration and Nationality Act \ncontingent on the Attorney General finding that 1) the Northern \nMarianas does not possess the institutional capacity to administer an \neffective system of immigration control or 2) the Northern Marianas \ndoes not have a genuine commitment to enforce the system. Neither I nor \nthe Committee question the\n\n[[Page S5304]]\n\ncommitment of the current administration of the Northern Marianas to \nattempt to rectify the problems that led to this legislation, but we \nare mindful that commitments have been made in the past and then \nignored. We also recognized that the Commisssion on Immigration Reform \nand others have concluded that some of the problem is structural and \nthat a local government simply may not have the capability to maintain \nan effective immigration program within our federal system. As a \nresult, the Committee adopted a provision that will take effect without \nfurther Congressional action if the requisite findings are made. The \nCommittee viewed this as a last opportunity for the local government \nand provided that the Attorney General must promptly issue standards so \nthat the Marianas is on full notice of what will be required.\n  If, however, it does become necessary to extend federal law, the \nCommittee also adopted amendments to the bill as introduced to ensure \nthat those industries, especially construction, that depend on \ntemporary workers for temporary jobs will have full access to alien \nlabor as necessary. The Committee was mindful of the concern by the \nhotel industry over access to workers, and accordingly adopted a \nprovision that would permit the transition provisions to be extended \nfor additional five year periods as long as necessary. The Committee \namendment required the Attorney General and the Secretary of Labor to \nconsult with the Northern Marianas one year prior to the expiration of \nthe transition period, and at 5-year intervals thereafter, to determine \nwhether the provisions will continue to be needed. The Committee and I \nfully expect that any uncertainty be resolved in favor of the Northern \nMarianas. If the provisions are extended, a similar consultation will \noccur in the fourth year of the extension to decide if further \nextensions are warranted.\n  The Committee reluctantly adopted these provisions because it \nbelieves that conditions in the Northern Marianas leave no alternative. \nExtension of additional federal laws, however, will not resolve the \nproblems if federal agencies do not maintain their present commitment \nto administration and enforcement of federal law. A continuation of \nlocal efforts by the present administration of the Northern Marianas \nwill also be necessary.\n  Although the legislation contains the one-year grace period contained \nin the Committee amendment from last Congress, the one year has \nexpired. The record of the Northern Marianas, and the status of local \nlegislation, will determine whether and on what terms federal laws \nshould be extended. The action earlier this year by the Northern \nMarianas to lift the moratorium on entry permits for new workers is \nparticularly troubling.\n\n  There are legitimate questions concerning immigration and minimum \nwage. We should now have sufficient experience to assess whether the \nMarianas is capable of providing the pre-clearance for any persons who \nattempt to enter the Marianas. The Immigration Commission concluded \nthat they are not capable of undertaking such prescreening and \nclearance because they do not have the resources of the federal \ngovernment through the State Department. The United States routinely \ndoes prescreening in foreign countries as part of our visa process. The \nsituation that I saw with the Bangladesh workers should never have \nhappened and would not have happened had federal immigration laws and \nprocedures been in place and enforced. Reports of other workers who \narrive only to find no jobs would also never happen. A particularly \ntroubling aspect of the current situation in the Northern Marianas is \nthe level of unemployment among guest workers. There should be no \nunemployment among the guest workers. If there are no jobs, then the \nworkers should not be present. These are legitimate immigration related \nissues. They do not necessarily lead to a federal takeover, but they \nare legitimate issues and it serves no purpose to distort history and \npretend that the current situation was the goal of the Covenant \nnegotiators. That does not make the Marianas corrupt, but if accurate, \nit points out that this Committee was correct when it stated that we \nwould need to make changes in the immigration laws prior to termination \nof the Trusteeship so that they could be extended to the Marianas.\n  The report of the Immigration Commission also raises legitimate \nquestions about the availability of asylum and the lack of civil rights \nsince the Marianas is using temporary workers for permanent jobs, \nthereby denying workers the rights they would have if admitted into the \nUS with a right of residency. That needs to be addressed. The \nCommission also expresses some grave concerns over outright extension \nof the Immigration laws and questions the willingness or commitment of \nthe INS to devote the personnel or resources to effective \nadministration. While I fully expect the INS to support the \nAdministration position in our hearings on this legislation, I also \nshare that concern. We do not need to make a bad local problem an \nequally bad federal one.\n  I also think that the focus on the garment industry by the \nAdministration and most of the critics of the situation in the Northern \nMarianas is somewhat shortsighted. The advantages that the Marianas can \nprovide garment manufacturers in terms of duty and quota free treatment \nexpire with the implementation of the multi-fibre agreement. The \nsuggestion in the Administration's task force report last year that \nthese jobs will move to the mainland if the garment industry is \ncurtailed in the Marianas is simply wrong. Those jobs in all likelihood \nare temporary until they move back to the Asian mainland in about five \nyears. That, by the way, is well within the transition period \ncontemplated under the legislation submitted by the Administration last \nyear. The legislation will actually have little or no effect on the \nindustry that the Administration is targeting. I should also note that \nthe Bank of Hawaii, in its economic study also concluded that the \ngarment industry in the Marianas was not likely to last. Other studies \nhave also come to that conclusion. The Administration has made it clear \nthat they hope the effect of this legislation will be the end of the \ngarment industry in the Marianas. Given both the studies and the \nAdministration's objective, I do have a question about why the \nPresident's budget claims about $187 million per year in additional \nrevenues from the enactment of the amendments to General Note 3(a). If \nthere is no industry, there will be no imports, and there will be no \nrevenues.\n  The problem is that the Administration does not seem to comprehend \nthat the Marianas is the United States. It is not a foreign country. \nThe failure of the Administration to enforce federal laws has led to a \nclimate conducive to worker abuse and to some sense within the Marianas \nthat federal laws will not be applied. On the other side, a large \npopulation of workers without full civil rights also offers the \nopportunity for people to exploit the situation. I am not happy with \neither side of this debate. The cries for federal takeover are too \nstrident and too partisan to ring true. The defense is simply \nunacceptable. In the middle are the workers who apparently no one cares \nabout, except for their value in being put on display in the media.\n  Complicating consideration of this legislation, however, is the \nAdministration's somewhat lackluster response to the flood of illegal \nentries into Guam from China. These individuals are being smuggled into \nGuam by boat. Most of the aliens come from the China mainland from \nFujian Province, but some have sought entry from the Northern Marianas. \nSo far this year, over 800 illegal aliens have been apprehended either \nin Guam or attempting to reach Guam.\n  Earlier this year I met with the Governor of Guam. He expressed his \nfrustration with the Immigration and Naturalization Service for \ndiverting revenues from Guam to the mainland. The result was that Guam \nhad to assume the costs of incarceration for these aliens. An article \nin the Pacific Daily News on Sunday May 9 suggested that as many as \n2,000 illegal aliens may already be in Guam. Only after the situation \nbecame even worse and the national media began to draw attention to \nwhat was happening, did the White House become involved. As a result of \nthat involvement, the Administration has finally begun to pay some \nattention and is beginning to dedicate resources to the interdiction of \nthese aliens. The Administration plans to\n\n[[Page S5305]]\n\nsend three more Coast Guard vessels and two C-130 aircraft to Guam and \napparently will reimburse the local government for its expenditures on \nbehalf of federal agencies. That response was too long in coming. \nParenthetically, I would note that INS did not care about extending \nimmigration laws to the Northern Marianas until after the Readers \nDigest and other publications began to question the Administration's \ncommitment to human rights and the White House became concerned with \nits image.\n  A continuing concern for my Committee over the years has been the \nreluctance of Executive Branch agencies, specifically the INS, to treat \nthe Marianas as part of the United States. Up until last Congress, the \nINS resisted any attempt to extend the immigration laws to the Northern \nMariana Islands. That resistance was not based on policy grounds or \nfrom a belief that the Northern Marianas was operating an effective \nimmigration system, but from the narrow administrative concern of not \nwanting to dedicate the personnel and resources. I must admit that I \nhave some apprehension over how solid the recent conversion of the INS \nis. Last Congress, they testified in support of the Administration's \nproposal to extend the immigration laws. They promised the Committee \nthat they would dedicate the necessary resources to ensure successful \nimplementation. Now we see that they are unwilling to dedicate the \nresources in Guam, where federal immigration laws already apply, until \nthey are directed to do so by the White House. The situation in the \nMarianas may be sufficiently problematic that we will have to go \nforward with the legislation despite my reservations. I intend to \nclosely examine the INS when we schedule hearings on this legislation.\n\n  I also am concerned over the Administration's decision to use the \nNorthern Marianas as a holding area for illegal aliens who are \nintercepted at sea. On May 8, the Coast Guard intercepted a Taiwanese \nvessel with 80 people suspected of trying to illegally enter Guam. The \nvessel was escorted to Tinian in the Northern Mariana Islands. \nApparently the Administration made that decision because the federal \nimmigration laws do not apply in the Marianas and that makes it easier \nto repatriate the aliens and prevent them from claiming asylum. If we \nextend the immigration laws, as one portion of the Administration \nwants, we will frustrate the interdiction and repatriation program \nbeing pursued by another portion of the Administration. The Committee \nwill need to sort this out during our hearings. I also will look \nforward to an explanation of why the use of Tinian in the Northern \nMarianas avoids claims of asylum. The asylum requirements are matters \nof international obligation and federal policy. In fact, the failure of \nthe Northern Marianas to deal with asylum issues as a matter of local \nlegislation was one of the arguments that the Administration made in \nsupport of the extension of federal legislation. That contradiction \nwill also need to be explored. It appears from press reports that the \nAdministration plans to consider claims of asylum, but given the \npeculiar situation of refugees from mainland China, it will be \ninteresting to see how those claims are processed.\n  I am also aware of suggestions in Guam that we need to amend the \nimmigration laws to prevent the claim of asylum on Guam. Congressman \nUnderwood has introduced legislation to that effect already. I think we \nneed to be very careful in considering legislation to extend the \nimmigration laws to the Northern Marianas that we do not create an even \nlarger problem than the one we already have in Guam. Guam is a single \nisland, about 33 miles by 12 miles. The Commonwealth of the Northern \nMariana Islands is an archipelago of fourteen islands three hundred \nmiles long. If we can not adequately patrol Guam, how are we going to \npatrol the entire Marianas? That also is a question that will need to \nbe answered before we move this legislation.\n  Before the opponents of this legislation start their celebration, I \nwant to repeat that I find the conditions and circumstances in the \nNorthern Marianas to be unacceptable. I have serious concerns over this \nlegislation, but something needs to be done. I am willing to consider \nmodifications to the legislation. Last year I included provisions to \nguarantee both construction and tourism sectors access to sufficient \nworkers, and I am willing to revisit those provisions or consider other \nchanges to support the economy of the Northern Marianas. At some point, \nhowever, the Marianas needs to take a hard look at the structure of \ntheir economy. They can not continue indefinitely with the public \nsector being the only source of employment for US residents. They need \nto provide a future for their children. The federal government needs to \nensure that federal laws are enforced and that they are applied in a \nmanner that recognizes the unique circumstances of this island \ncommunity. I support as much local authority and control as is \npossible. There are certain functions, however, that only the federal \ngovernment can effectively perform. There are also certain rights that \nevery individual who works and resides in the United States should \nexpect to be guaranteed. This legislation will provide an opportunity \nfor the Committee to see that those responsibilities are performed and \nthat those rights are protected.\n\n

Mr. President, I rise today along with my \ncolleagues, Senators Grassley, Roberts, and Ashcroft, to submit a \nresolution expressing the sense of the Senate regarding the next round \nof agricultural trade negotiations. As a member of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee, I am very concerned about U.S. agriculture's \nposition in the next round of negotiations. This resolution establishes \nclear direction to the Administration as it enters the Seattle \nnegotiations this November.\n  These process and procedural guidelines have been developed through a \nconsensus process of the Seattle Round Agricultural Committee (SRAC). \nSRAC represents over 70 agricultural organizations--from the Farm \nBureau to the National Oilseed Processors Association of Kraft Foods. \nThis diverse group of agriculturalists have spent many hours developing \nthese principles to ensure that our international agriculture markets \nremain strong, open and fair for our nation's farmers.\n  The U.S. agricultural sector is one of the only segments of our \neconomy that consistently produces a trade surplus. In fact, our \nagricultural surplus totaled $27.2 billion in 1996. However, we must \nnot rest on our laurels; the United States Department of Agriculture \nprojects that our agricultural trade surplus in 1999 will dwindle to \napproximately $12 billion. We must not let this trend continue.\n  Free and open international markets are vital to my home state. \nIllinois' 76,000 farms cover more than 28 million acres--nearly 80 \npercent of Illinois. Our farm product sales generate nine billion \ndollars annually and Illinois ranks third in agricultural exports. In \nfiscal year 1997 alone, Illinois agricultural exports totaled $3.7 \nbillion and created 57,000 jobs for our state. Needless to say, \nagriculture makes up a significant portion of my state's economy, and a \nhealthy export market for these products is important to my \nconstituents.\n  As you know, farm commodity prices have recently been in a slump. \nThis situation makes open debate on agricultural trade and the Seattle \nround even more timely and necessary. While the average tariff assessed \nby the United States on agricultural products is less than five \npercent, the average agricultural tariff assessed by other World Trade \nOrganization members exceeds 40 percent. This situation is clearly \nunfair and certainly depresses U.S. agricultural commodity prices. \nAccordingly, this issue must be addressed in the next round.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on policies to tear down \ninternational trade barriers and ensure that our agricultural trade \nsurplus expands and remains strong. This resolution is the first step \ntoward ensuring that agriculture is a top priority of the \nAdministration during the next round of multilateral trade \nnegotiations.\n  I want to recognize and commend my colleagues, Senators Grassley, \nRoberts, and Ashcroft, for joining me as original co-sponsors of this \nresolution. This resolution should enjoy bipartisan support, and I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in co-sponsoring this legislation important to \nour nation's farmers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/13/senate-section/article/S5307-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5307]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         SENATE RESOLUTION 102--APPOINTING SENATE LEGAL COUNSEL\n\n  By Mr. LOTT submitted the following resolution; which was considered \nand agreed to:\n\n                              S.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be referred to as the ``Criminal Use of \n     Firearms by Felons (CUFF) Act''.\n\n     SEC. 402. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Tragedies such as those occurring recently in the \n     communities of Pearl, Mississippi, Paducah, Kentucky, \n     Jonesboro, Arkansas, Springfield, Oregon, and Littleton, \n     Colorado are terrible reminders of the vulnerability of \n     innocent individuals to random and senseless acts of criminal \n     violence.\n       (2) The United States Congress has responded to the problem \n     of gun violence by passing numerous criminal statutes and by \n     supporting the development of law enforcement programs \n     designed both to punish the criminal misuse of weapons and \n     also to deter individuals from undertaking illegal acts.\n       (3) In 1988, the Administration initiated an innovative \n     program known as Project Achilles. The concept behind the \n     initiative was that the illegal possession of firearms was \n     the Achilles heel or the area of greatest vulnerability of \n     criminals. By aggressively prosecuting criminals with guns in \n     Federal court, the offenders were subject to stiffer \n     penalties and expedited prosecutions. The Achilles program \n     was particularly effective in removing the most violent \n     criminals from our communities.\n       (4) In 1991, the Administration expanded its efforts to \n     remove criminals with guns from our streets with Project \n     Triggerlock. Triggerlock continued the ideas formulated in \n     the Achilles program and committed the Department of Justice \n     resources to the prosecution effort. Under the program, every \n     United States Attorney was directed to form special teams of \n     Federal, State, and local investigators to look for gang and \n     drug cases that could be prosecuted as Federal weapon \n     violations. Congress appropriated additional funds to allow a \n     large number of new law enforcement officers and Federal \n     prosecutors to target these gun and drug offenders. In 1992, \n     approximately 7048 defendants were prosecuted under this \n     initiative.\n       (5) Since 1993, the number of ``Project Triggerlock'' type \n     gun prosecutions pursued by the Department of Justice has \n     fallen to approximately 3807 prosecutions in 1998. This is a \n     decline of over 40 percent in Federal prosecutions of \n     criminals with guns.\n       (6) The threat of criminal prosecution in the Federal \n     criminal justice system works to deter criminal behavior \n     because the Federal system is known for speedier trials and \n     longer prison sentences.\n       (7) The deterrent effect of Federal gun prosecutions has \n     been demonstrated recently by successful programs, such as \n     ``Project Exile'' in Richmond, Virginia, which resulted in a \n     22 percent decrease in violent crime since 1994.\n       (8) The Department of Justice's failure to prosecute the \n     criminal use of guns under existing Federal law undermines \n     the significant deterrent effect that these laws are meant to \n     produce.\n       (9) The Department of Justice already possesses a vast \n     array of Federal criminal statutes that, if used aggressively \n     to prosecute wrongdoers, would significantly reduce both the \n     threat of, and the incidence of, criminal gun violence.\n       (10) As an example, the Department of Justice has the \n     statutory authority in section 922(q) of title 18, United \n     States Code, to prosecute individuals who bring guns to \n     school zones. Although the Administration stated that over \n     6,000 students were expelled last year for bringing guns to \n     school, the Justice Department reports prosecuting only 8 \n     cases under section 922(q) in 1998.\n       (11) The Department of Justice is also empowered under \n     section 922(x) of title 18, United States Code, to prosecute \n     adults who transfer handguns to juveniles. In 1998, the \n     Department of Justice reports having prosecuted only 6 \n     individuals under this provision.\n       (12) The Department of Justice's utilization of existing \n     prosecutorial power is 1 of the most significant steps that \n     can be taken to reduce the number of criminal acts involving \n     guns, and represents a better response to the problem of \n     criminal violence than the enactment of new, symbolic laws, \n     which, if current Departmental trends hold, would likely be \n     underutilized .\n\n     SEC. 403.

FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (a) Citizens have an individual right, under the Second \n     Amendment to the United States Constitution, to Keep and Bear \n     Arms. The Gun Control Act of 1968 and the Firearms Owners \n     Protection Act of 1986 specifically state that it is not the \n     intent of Congress to frustrate the free exercise of that \n     right in enacting federal legislation. The free exercise of \n     that right includes law abiding firearms owners buying, \n     selling, trading, and collecting guns in accordance with \n     federal, state, and local laws for whatever lawful use they \n     deem desirable.\n       (b) The Internet is a powerful information medium, which \n     has and continues to be an excellent tool to educate citizens \n     on the training, education and safety programs available to \n     use firearms safely and responsibly. It has, and should \n     continue to develop, as a 21st century tool for ``e-\n     commerce'' and marketing many products, including firearms \n     and sporting goods. Many web sites related to these topics \n     are sponsored in large part, by the sporting firearms and \n     hunting community.\n       (c) It is the intent of Congress that this legislation be \n     applied where the Internet is being exploited to violate the \n     applicable explosives and firearms laws of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 432. PROHIBITIONS ON USES OF THE INTERNET.\n\n       (a) In General.--Chapter 44 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``Sec. 931.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor those police \nofficers who devotedly and selflessly work to protect and serve the \npublic on a daily basis. I also pay special tribute to those men and \nwomen who have given their lives in the line of duty.\n  According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation data, 138 law \nenforcement officers lost their lives while protecting our communities \nacross America in 1998. Of this total, 61 law enforcement officers were \nslain in the line of duty. Our Capitol community was tragically \naffected last July when Capitol Police Officer Jacob Chestnut and \nSpecial Agent John Gibson were mortally wounded while they upheld their \nsworn duty to protect visitors, staff and Members of Congress.\n  All Americans should keep alive the memory of these two brave and \nheroic men, and recognize the contributions of the countless other law \nenforcement officers who have either been slain or disabled while \nperforming their duties. For these reasons I am a proud cosponsor of S. \nRes. 22, which designates May 15, 1999, as ``National Peace Officers \nMemorial Day.''\n  Mr. President, during this week of poignant ceremonies, Minnesota \nremembers Corporal Timothy Bowe of the Minnesota State Patrol who was \nmurdered while assisting the Chisago County Sheriff Department on June \n7, 1997. Last year, Corporal Bowe's name was added to the National Law \nEnforcement Officers Memorial. Corporal Bowe was a devoted husband, \nfather, trooper, and friend. More importantly, Corporal Timothy Bowe \nwas a true Minnesota hero. This week, Corporal Bowe's name will be \njoined on the memorial by 155 other law enforcement officers who were \nkilled in the line of duty.\n  Sadly, in our society today, unless we are personally affected by \nviolence or disorder, we often do not realize the dedication of our law \nenforcement officers, and the sacrifices they make to keep our \ncommunities safe. ``National Police Week'' is an important time for all \nAmericans to recognize the role law enforcement officers play in \nsafeguarding the rights and freedoms we all enjoy daily and give thanks \nfor their countless hours of service.\n  Mr. President, we owe a debt of gratitude not only to the slain \nofficers who served their communities so courageously by preserving law \nand order, but also to their families, who have lost a spouse, parent \nor child. Our law enforcement officers are heroes and we must never \nforget their contributions and sacrifices--during ``National Police \nWeek,'' they are well remembered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/13/senate-section/article/S5316-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5316-S5317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RETIREMENT OF TREASURY SECRETARY RUBIN\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to share with my \ncolleagues a few thoughts on the announcement that Treasury Secretary \nRubin will be leaving his job in July.\n  It is hard to believe how far we have come in the six and a half \nyears of Bob Rubin's tenure at the Treasury Department. Our most \nfundamental ideas of how the world works--at least the world of \neconomics and finance--have been transformed during his leadership of \nPresident Clinton's economic team.\n  In our domestic finances, Mr. President, we have gone from a \ngeneration of seemingly intractable federal deficits to a new era of \nbudget surpluses. It turns out that it is no easier to make budget \npolicy now than it was before--in fact, it is probably harder. But the \nfederal government is paying its own way now, and the payoff in the \nprivate economy--strong growth, low and stable interest rates, \ninternational confidence in the dollar--are there for everyone to see.\n  As someone who came to the Senate over a quarter of a century ago, I \ncan tell my colleagues that there has been no more fundamental change \nin the way we do business around here.\n  And virtually everyone agrees that Bob Rubin's influence was the \ndeciding factor in this Administration's successful fight to restore \nbalance and responsibility to our federal budget. If that were his only \nlegacy, it would put him in the pantheon of our greatest Treasury \nSecretaries.\n  But Bob Rubin has left his mark on the international economy as well. \nThe United States--restored to its historic role as the strongest and \nmost influential economy in the world--was the indispensable leader \nduring the financial crisis that shook international markets in the \nlast two years. And it was Secretary Rubin's credibility that was on \nthe line as international financial institutions like the IMF scrambled \nto meet the first financial crisis of the new global economy.\n  Because he knew what key financial markets needed to see and hear \nfrom policy makers--and because he knew the strengths and the \nweaknesses of those markets first hand--his guidance was the essential \ningredient that contained the damage from that crisis.\n  Today, in the calm after the storm, there is still a lot of \nrebuilding to do--and too much troubling weakness in too many economies \nto say that the crisis is over. But it is not too early to say that the \ncrisis was a direct challenge America's leadership in the world's \neconomy, and Bob Rubin kept us on top.\n  I might add that among the many facets of that financial crisis, \nSecretary Rubin had to invest his considerable energy, skills, and \nreputation to get this Congress to provide the funds necessary for the \nIMF to do its job. If they gave medals in his line of work, Mr. \nPresident, he would have one for that campaign, too.\n  Robert Rubin was the recognized leader--with all of the heat that can \ncome in that position--in two of the biggest economy stories of this \ndecade: the battle against the deficit and the global financial crisis. \nHis decisiveness, clarity of purpose, and calm persistence made a \ndifference in this history of our time.\n  I noticed, Mr. President, that the financial markets genuflected \nyesterday at the news of Secretary Rubin's impending departure. They \ndipped for a while at the initial disappointment, but inevitably they \nrecovered because his replacement is an equally formidable--and \ntested--veteran of those\n\n[[Page S5317]]\n\nsame battles that have made Bob Rubin's reputation.\n  Larry Summers, as Deputy Treasury Secretary, has earned Bob Rubin's \nconfidence as his envoy to key countries in critical negotiations in \nthe global financial crisis and in many other important jobs. He \ninherits a healthy economy, sound federal finances, and a strong team \nat the Treasury Department. But if the past few years are any guide, \nMr. President, he will not lack for challenges.\n  I noticed that he thanked his teachers today in accepting the new \nopportunity President Clinton has offered him. Surely he had no more \nvaluable teacher than Bob Rubin. That should give us all confidence \nthat the Treasury Department remains in good hands.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/13/senate-section/article/S5317-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING GLORIA ``PAT'' HUTH\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Mrs. Gloria \n``Pat'' Huth upon her retirement which will be celebrated on May 18, \n1999.\n  Gloria ``Pat'' Huth was born on St. Patrick's Day to Mary and Martin \nHalasz. Mr. and Mrs. Halasz immigrated to the United States from \nHungary.\n  Pat Huth graduated from Bad Axe High School, and earned her Bachelor \nof Arts degree from Michigan State University. In 1962, she married her \nhusband, Robert, Sr. She began teaching with the Van Dyke school \nsystem, taking time off from full-time teaching to raise her sons, \nRobert, Jr. and Jeff. Mrs. Huth always believed in the value of \neducation and stressed that point to her students and her sons; her \nsons obtained Juris Doctor and Doctor of Medicine degrees, \nrespectively.\n  After her boys began attending elementary school, Pat Huth returned \nto full-time teaching. In 1971, she began teaching at Neil E. Reid \nschool in the L'Anse Creuse School District. In 1974, she was among \neight teachers that left Neil E. Reid with their principal, Joseph \nCarkenord to open the new elementary school, Tenniswood, in Clinton \nTownship, Michigan. Along the way, Pat obtained her Masters of \nEducation Degree from Eastern Michigan University.\n  In 1979, she received an Educational Specialist Degree (EDS) from \nOakland University. She was always continuing to attend school so that \nshe could stay on top of trends and issues to help her students.\n  Mrs. Huth taught second grade for the L'Anse Creuse schools for 29 \nyears and was a full-time teacher in Michigan for 33 years. \nAdditionally, 8 years were spent as a substitute teacher for different \nschool districts in Macomb County.\n  Among Pat's interests are serving in the Philanthropic Educational \nOrganization (PEO). She has been a member of St. Louis Parish since \n1973. Now Pat Huth considers among her hobbies enjoying three (and soon \nto be four) grandchildren and stressing the value of education for all \nthose that are fortunate enough to have contact with her.\n  I want to express my congratulations to Pat Huth upon her retirement. \nMost importantly, I would like to thank her for her years of commitment \nto the education of children. Pat, you truly are an example for others \nto follow.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/13/senate-section/article/S5317-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 A SALUTE TO LYTTLETON MACON YATES, SR.\n\n Mr. ROBB.

He started his career on May l5, \n1972 as a Computer Operator with the Sergeant at Arms Computer Center, \nand has worked his way up the ladder to his current position as \nSupervisor. As a valuable member of the Computer Center team, he was \ninstrumental in assisting with the creation of payroll forms, \nletterhead and other Senate forms still in use today.\n  Over the years, Lyt has enjoyed working with Senate staff--assisting \nwith countless individual requests, solving problems, and seeing the \njob through to completion.\n  He is looking forward to retirement with his wife, Joanna, in \nMidland, Virginia. His future plans include, traveling, wood carving \nand spending time with his eight grandchildren.\n  On behalf of his Senate family, I thank Lyt Yates for nearly three \ndecades of outstanding and dedicated service to the United States \nSenate--and I wish him well in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/13/senate-section/article/S5317-3", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   BOSTON MILLS/BRANDYWINE SKI RESORT\n\n Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, today I am pleased to recognize \nBoston Mills/Brandywine Ski Resort in Peninsula, OH. Boston Mills/\nBrandywine recently was awarded the Times Mirror Company's Silver Eagle \nAward for Environmental Excellence for their efforts in the area of \nenergy conservation. In response to the local community's increasing \nenergy demands during seasonal snowmaking operations, Boston Mills \nrecently installed a $1.5 million advanced snowmaking system which \nmonitors data from a nearby pumping station, weather stations, and \nsnowmaking machines to provide for maximum snow production at maximum \npower efficiency. This effort has enabled the area to produce the same \namount of snow in less time, and at a savings of 962,000 kilowatt hours \nof electricity, which represents 69.5 percent of the community's \nelectricity consumption. In addition, by leasing new grooming vehicles \nwhich operate on 33 percent less fuel and reduce grooming time, the \narea was able to reduce diesel fuel consumption by 46.9 percent, or \n9,404 gallons. I am proud to report on the positive impact that the \nBoston Mills/Brandywine Ski Resort has had on the local community in \nPeninsula and commend them for the example they have set in civic \nleadership on this front. I congratulate them on their award and \nbelieve the praise they have received for their efforts in \nenvironmental stewardship is well deserved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/13/senate-section/article/S5317-4", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5317-S5318]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         HONORING CALIFORNIA'S FALLEN LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

As Wetzel warned his fellow soldiers of the attack, \ntwo live grenades were thrown through the window of the farmhouse where \nhis unit was positioned; Wetzel then shielded his men by covering the \ngrenades with his body, sacrificing his life to save the lives of the \nothers in his unit.\n  As the ultimate recognition for his bravery and honor, the military \nposthumously awarded Private First Class Wetzel the Medal of Honor.\n  The memorial and sculpture are well-deserved tributes for the heroism \nof private Wetzel who made the ultimate sacrifice to protect the sacred \nvalues our country is founded upon.\n  Private Wetzel's commitment to fight and sacrifice to protect the \nUnited States and the freedoms Americans cherish is to be commended. He \ndeserves both respect and admiration by everyone for his dedication to \nour country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/13/senate-section/article/S5318-3", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5318]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING JOHN FLORENO\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM.
