Mr. President and colleagues, these two amendments are \nessential to begin to ensure that passengers in this country get a fair \nshake with respect to airline service.\n  We have seen in recent months that the airline industry is going to \ngreat lengths with their so-called customer service pledge to try, \nthrough a series of voluntary promises, to show to the American people \nthat they are really committed to improving airline service.\n  The fact is, Mr. President and colleagues, two studies that have just \ncome out demonstrate that these voluntary promises by the airline \nindustry really are not worth much more than the paper on which they \nare written. So I am very pleased to come to the floor of the Senate \ntoday with my good friend, the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator \nShelby, and the ranking minority member, Senator Lautenberg, to make it \nvery clear that in two key areas--overbooking and making sure that \npassengers can be informed of the lowest fare available--the inspector \ngeneral will be directed to investigate promptly when in fact consumers \nare ripped off in those areas.\n  Let me touch specifically on both of those provisions.\n  The first deals with the overbooking issue. In addition to my friend \nfrom Alabama, the chairman of the subcommittee, I am very pleased \nSenator Campbell has joined us in this effort, as well as Senator \nFeingold from this side of the aisle. It is truly bipartisan.\n  The reason it is needed is that if this morning you call an airline \nand inquire about purchasing a ticket on a flight and they are \noverbooked, that airline does not have to tell you they are overbooked \nbefore they take your money.\n  We do not think that is right. We think the public has the right to \nknow. Certainly the airline ought to be in a position to sell you a \nticket even if they are overbooked, but it ought to be the consumer's \nright to have that information before they actually put their money \ndown.\n  So the first proposal we are offering today makes sure that consumers \nwill be informed in these instances of overbooking.\n  The second amendment we are offering deals with making sure that \npassengers can be adequately informed of the lowest fare available on \nflights. Finding the lowest airfare is one of the great mysteries of \nWestern life. Today on any given flight, there may be as many different \nfares as there are passengers on the plane. So with respect to this \nmatter of making sure the passengers can be informed of the lowest fare \navailable, I offer a second amendment, again with the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, Mr. Shelby, and the ranking minority member, Senator \nLautenberg, to make sure that passengers will be in a position to be \ninformed of the lowest fares.\n  Some airlines right now are giving customers with computers a price \nbreak just because they have a computer to access the web site. We have \nall heard about the digital divide. In fact, some folks have the \ntechnology; others do not. The current situation penalizes the \ntechnology have-nots; they have to pay a higher fare. Of course, when \nthe airlines have you, the customer, on the phone, they have in fact \n``got you.'' You may not own a computer or have access to one. You have \nto pay whatever price the airline quotes you.\n  No matter how a customer contacts an airline--at the ticket counter, \nover the phone, or through the airline's web site--it is the view of \nthe sponsors of this amendment--myself, the distinguished chairman of \nthe subcommittee, Mr. Shelby, and the distinguished ranking minority \nmember, Senator Lautenberg--that the consumer ought to be informed.\n  Right now, on a voluntary pledge that has been made by the airline \nindustry, there is a lot of high-sounding rhetoric in telling customers \nabout the lowest fare, but the harsh reality is it is essentially \nbusiness as usual.\n  In fact, I think it is worth noting the language in the pledge, as it \nstands today, to offer the lowest fare available. What the pledge by \nthe airline industry stipulates today is: If a consumer uses the phone \nto call an airline and asks about a specific flight on a specific day \nin a specific class, the airline will tell you the lowest fare. That is \nsomething that they are already required to do by current regulation.\n  Not only will they not provide you relevant information about lower \nfares on other flights on the same airline, they will not even tell you \nabout lower fares that are probably on their web page.\n  For example, a Delta agent recently quoted a consumer over the phone \na round trip fare to Portland--my hometown--of $400. Five minutes \nlater, the consumer found a price for $218 for the exact flight on \nDelta's web page.\n  I do want to leave time for other colleagues to be able to speak on \nthese amendments. Both of the amendments, it seems to me, hit critical \nissues with respect to disclosure to airline passengers of information \nthat they need to make their travel choices.\n  We are not calling for a constitutional right to a fluffy pillow on \nan airline flight or a jumbo bag of peanuts. We are saying the public \nhas the right to know.\n  We had 100,000 people bumped last year, and we are finding, in the \nfirst 6 months of this year, consumer complaints are growing at an \nunprecedented level with respect to airline service.\n  Unfortunately, this voluntary pledge by the airline industry is \nessentially toothless. They give you three kinds of rights: First, a \nset of rights that you already have, and that deals with the disabled; \nsecond, rights that they are reluctant to actually write into the \nlegalese that constitute the real contract between the consumer and the \nairline--these are known as contracts of carriage; and, finally, the \nconsumers' rights that are ignored altogether.\n  The Wyden-Shelby-Lautenberg amendments we will be voting on at 11 \no'clock ensure that those rights which are being ignored altogether \nwould be protected, that in the future consumers will be informed when \na flight is overbooked. Consumers would be in a position to learn the \nlowest fare available, and if that is not the case, under this \namendment the Department of Transportation is directed to go on out and \ninvestigate that as a deceptive trade practice, and the consumer is \nprotected.\n  So I will reserve the remainder of my time. We may have other \ncolleagues who want to speak. But again, I express my appreciation to \nthe chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Shelby. He and Senator \nLautenberg have worked very closely with us on this amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  Mr. SHELBY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I will be brief. But I want to take a \ncouple minutes to commend the Senator from Oregon for having the \ncourage and the foresight and tenacity to push these amendments because \nthey make a lot of sense.\n  All of us travel by the airlines. We want our airlines to do well. We \nwant them to respond to all the people in the market. But we want it to \nbe done upfront and, I think, upright. I am not sure that is going on \ntoday. That is why I believe this legislation is necessary. I think it \nis a step in the right direction.\n  We all go back to the deregulation of the airlines. I want to \nderegulate everything. But I want competition to be out there in the \nmarketplace, including the airlines, to where people will have a \nchoice. I am not sure we have a choice today in the airline industry \nbecause we have such concentration. We all fly. We want some basic \nrights.\n  I believe the passengers, who are the customers who support the \nairlines--without customers there will be no airlines--ought to have a \nsay. I believe that is the thrust of the amendments offered by the \nSenator from Oregon. That is why I support them.\n\n[[Page S10877]]\n\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I know we have a scheduled vote at 11 \no'clock this morning. We have equal time here. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the running of the quorum call time on the clock be charged \nagainst both sides equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, if I might ask the distinguished \nsenior Senator from New Jersey, are we dealing with two amendments or a \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We are dealing with two sense-of-the-Senate \nresolutions that the Senator from Oregon has offered now, a substitute \nfor an earlier amendment.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Well, a sense-of-the-Senate resolution is preferable \nin that it doesn't become law and is not binding. It also implies, as I \nwould believe, that perhaps the case for the amendments is not as \nstrong as it once appeared to be.\n  I want to speak vehemently against whatever form this takes, whether \nit is two amendments or a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. There is no \nquestion that the Senator from Oregon is concerned with safety. The \nSenator from Oregon has the luxury of dealing with flights far better \nthan does the Senator from West Virginia. He has a consistent record on \nthat. I also need to say, however, that when he brought up what was to \nbe two amendments--both of which I disagree with and which I ask my \ncolleagues to vote against, whether in amendment form or resolution \nform--the Senator didn't give any advanced notice about it. He didn't \ninform those charged with responsibility for aviation issues on the \nCommerce Committee before he brought this matter up, for example.\n  Customer service is a problem we have been working on in the Commerce \nCommittee. What I need to point out is that on this very day the \nairlines are coming out with their plans to implement what Senator \nMcCain, Senator Hollings, Senator Gorton, and the Senator from West \nVirginia directed and worked with them to do to improve customer \nservice. Today they are coming out with a plan to address precisely the \nproblems the Senator is bringing up.\n  People talk about Washington intervening and Washington trying to do \nsomething on its own because Washington always knows best. This is \nprobably a classic case of that--especially on what looks like a \ntremendously popular consumer issue that can easily get a lot of \nattention. But we always have to ask the question, is it the right \npublic policy? My reaction in this case is, no, it is the wrong public \npolicy.\n  We sat down with the airlines and we had a very long series of \nnegotiations. We got them to agree to a whole series of things which \nthey are coming out with today, which we haven't actually seen yet, for \nimproving customer service. They are coming out with their detailed \nservice plans on this very day, at the same time that we are voting \nhere on these resolutions. What is interesting is that in the \nprinciples we negotiated with the airlines both of the problems \ncontemplated by these resolutions are specifically addressed, and will \nbe elaborated upon in the specific plans of each airline.\n  Now I don't have the advantage of is having the plans before me \nbecause they are being announced today. But we pushed the airlines hard \nand they came back with suggestions; and then we went to them again and \nsaid that is not good enough, and they came up with more. We also \ninformed the airlines that we would be working on legislation to direct \nthe Department of Transportation to exercise oversight and monitoring \nof airlines customer service plans and how they are implemented.\n  We are also working on legislation to increase penalties--if we can \never get to the FAA reauthorization bill, which a lot of people don't \ntalk about--including increases in baggage liability limits, civil \npenalties for consumer violations, and fines for mistreatment of \ndisabled passengers. We took a very tough approach with the airlines, \nsaying to them, look, we are going to give you this chance because we \nthink you know better than we do how wide a seat ought to be.\n  We think that when it comes to the cost of the fare, or informing \npassengers of cancellations or delays, you can do a better job for \npassengers than if we dictated to you how to do it.\n  And at the same time we said to the airlines: If you don't come forth \nwith meaningful service improvements and if you are not effective in \nimplementing these commitments, then we are going to come back at you \nwith legislation.\n  We were very clear in our message to them. Senator McCain, Senator \nHollings, Senator Rockefeller, and Senator Gorton--all of us--were very \nclear about the consequences. We are committed to considering a \nlegislative solution to make the airlines do these things, but first we \nare going to give them a chance to clean up their own houses.\n  The main difference between these resolutions and our approach is \nthat we don't want to legislate right out of the gate. We may have to \nend up legislating, if they don't improve things. But let's give them \nan opportunity first.\n  Consider the case of Southwest Airlines and the question of \noverbooking. Routinely 35 to 40 percent of the people who make \nreservations on Southwest don't show up for the flight. Do they have an \noverbooking procedure on 90 percent of their flights? Yes, they do. \nThey need to do that since on average 35 to 40 percent of their \npassengers don't show up for each and every flight.\n  On one hand, it seems as if overbooking is an easy thing to do \nsomething about. But in practice it is a more complicated question. So, \nshall we give the industry that knows it has problems a chance, albeit \nunder pressure and restrictions from the Congress and the DOT, but \nnonetheless a chance to solve their problems themselves? Or shall we \nsimply say we are going to do it for you, and this is how you are going \nto do it?\n  Again, if they don't come forward, if they don't do this correctly, \nthen we may very well move legislatively. I have said it frequently to \nthem in private and in public that we move to legislate if they don't \ntake this voluntary approach quite seriously, and we will direct and \nmandate that these customer service improvements be done. But I think \nto take the heavy-handed approach right out of the box is the wrong way \nto go.\n  I think it is also ironic, I have to say, that the focus is on \noverbooking and access to low fares, without giving equal attention to \nthe problems of air traffic control. We aren't paying any attention at \nall to the underlying problems--the infrastructure problems that are \nthe root cause of many customer complaints, including overcrowding, \nscheduling problems, cancellations and no-shows.\n  The airlines have until December 15 to get their detailed plans fully \nimplemented. I think we ought to give them the chance.\n  The inspector general of DOT is monitoring and watching each and \nevery airline for any failure to carry out the principles and promises. \nIf they are not effectuated, that will be considered a violation by the \nDOT.\n  But is there anything really that wrong with giving the people who \nknow how to do it and who will compete with one another to do it best a \nchance to self-regulate under this very unusual and extraordinary \npressure that they find themselves from myself and Senator Gorton? Or \ndo we simply say, no, we know how to do it best, and we are going to do \nit for you?\n  I hope my colleagues will understand that this a resolution that \ndoesn't do much good for airline passengers. What\n\n[[Page S10878]]\n\nwill do good by the traveling public is the plan which the airlines are \nannouncing today, and then the oversight and the implementation of \nthose plans, which we will watch very closely and then evaluate how \nthey've done. If they are ineffective in it, then we will move right to \nlegislation. But for heaven's sake, let's not start off that way and \npretend we can do all of this better than they can.\n  I yield the floor. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. President, I think what the Senator from Oregon is doing this \nmorning is offering some help for sat-upon air passengers--people who \nare totally discouraged by the treatment they get from our airlines. I \nam not saying the airlines are not a good, effective part of our \ncommunications system or that they don't care. Not at all. But they \nhave to be a little more sensitive to what the passengers need. The \npassengers need to know whether or not reservations they have made are \ngoing to be honored. They have to know whether or not they are buying \nright. If you go into a department store, you see signs telling you how \nmuch an article costs. When you call up an airline for reservations, \nyou never know whether you have three seats in L class, or two seats in \nY class, or six seats in E class, and you don't know whether you are \ngetting what you are getting.\n  I think there is an expression that is used commonly around here--``a \nright to know.'' The passengers have a right to know. They have a right \nto know that when they get to that airport, the seat they have reserved \nwhich they paid for is going to be available for them.\n  There is no one whom I like less to disagree with than my friend from \nWest Virginia, the distinguished Senator from West Virginia. But the \nairlines may know, to use his expression, ``how wide a seat is.'' But \nthey don't want to tell you how wide the seating spaces are in their \nairplanes compared to others.\n  I fly, as most here do, at least twice a week--once up and once back \nfrom my home district in my State.\n  I find that the space gets narrower and narrower. I think we ought to \nlet people know. Give them a choice. Give them a right to know. We are \nnot telling them the seat size. I don't want to do that.\n  I have found one thing. Sometimes if you offer enough carrots as an \nincentive, you wind up with carrot soup. You don't wind up with a \nsatisfied user. That is what we are talking about. The airlines have \nvoluntarily agreed to do some things; that is, if you can find out, and \nif you understand what they are talking about when they do it.\n  I see nothing wrong in the sense-of-the-Senate resolutions the \nSenator from Oregon is introducing. I think he is doing us all a favor, \nand that is highlighting what the problem is. It is not law that he is \nproposing. What he is suggesting is something for us to all think about \nas we consider legislation, or recommending rules to the FAA that the \nFAA ought to take up. We are focusing.\n  I must say this to the Senator from West Virginia. In my opening \nremarks and in the remarks of the chairman of the subcommittee, what we \nare talking about is the shortages that we are seeing in funding for \nFAA.\n  I know I heard it repeated by the distinguished Senator from Alabama. \nI said we are underfunding the FAA. That is because the whole \ntransportation budget is inadequate for the things we have to do. It \nshouldn't be. But the system is safe. People do get there most of the \ntime now--late. But the fact is we are concerned about funding the FAA \nand the overcrowding of the skies.\n  We want the air traffic control system to operate well.\n  I sit lots of times in the second seat in a small airplane. I hear \nwhat is going on. It is not always what you like to hear--that you have \nto wait a half hour to take off, that you have to wait a half hour or \ndivert to land because it is too crowded. We are concerned about that.\n\n  But also I make mention of a cause of mine--to make sure that we have \nhigh-speed rail in this country to take care of the 200-mile trip, or \nthe 250-mile trip from New York to Washington, or Boston to New York, \nor Boston to Washington--relatively short trips--to relieve some of the \npressure in the skies at the same time that we build the system.\n  I yield the time. I thank the Senator from Oregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 15 minutes 50 seconds.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, first, in the package of amendments with respect to \noverbooking and making sure the passenger has the lowest fare \navailable, that has nothing to do with seat size. I think all of our \ncolleagues know it.\n  The reason the Consumer Federation of America and Consumers Union put \non the floor for each Member of this body a strong endorsement letter \nfor these two amendments this morning is that they think the public has \na right to know this basic information. That is all these two \namendments are about.\n  The fact is that my good friend from West Virginia has a difference \nof opinion with respect to the airline industry voluntary pledges.\n  I agree with the General Accounting Office and the Congressional \nResearch Service. They came out with reports this week that essentially \nshowed that with respect to these voluntary industry pledges, there is \nno ``there'' there. These voluntary industry pledges either involve \nrights that the consumer already has, No. 1, rights that the airline \nindustry is unwilling to write into the contract between the airline \nand the consumer, known as contracts of carriage, or rights that are \nessentially ignored altogether, which are overbooking.\n  Nobody is talking about micromanagement or a constitutional right to \nfluffy pillows. We are talking about basic information for the public.\n  What has happened since the voluntary industry agreement of earlier \nthis summer is, two congressional reports have come out--a report by \nthe Congressional Research Service and a report by the General \nAccounting Office. Let me read from a portion of what the General \nAccounting Office has said. The General Accounting Office said with \nrespect to the key measures in the voluntary package--ensuring customer \nservice from an airline, cosharing partners, a refund provision, a \nspecial needs provision--these are already required.\n  The airline industry has tried, with a lot of hocus-pocus with the \nvoluntary pledges, to convince the Congress and the American people \nthat they really are responding substantively when in fact this is \nessentially old wine in new bottles.\n  That is why this morning the Consumers Union and the Consumer \nFederation have put on to the desks of each Member of this body a \nstrong endorsement letter. This is about the public's right to know, \nthe public's right to disclosure of information in two areas: The \nlowest fare; second, with respect to overbooking. That is what this \nissue is about.\n  Members can either be with the passengers or Members can be with the \nairline industry, which the General Accounting Office and the \nCongressional Research Service said this week has offered voluntary \npledges that are woefully deficient because they essentially do nothing \nother than restate current law.\n  I yield the floor, and I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I yield what time I have to the \ndistinguished Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Washington is \nrecognized for 1 minute 20 seconds.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this is another example of Members of the \nSenate attempting to say they know much more about a particular \nbusiness than do the people who run that business and depend upon \ncustomer satisfaction in order to run it profitably.\n  Fortunately, it is now only a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. \nHowever, it nonetheless, with respect to involuntary exclusion from \nplanes, applies to about 1 person in 10,000 and is therefore a \nsledgehammer used to crush a fly, and does it in a way which will be \neither ineffective because the information that passengers get will be \nof no\n\n[[Page S10879]]\n\nuse to them or will cut down on the number of tickets that are sold \nwhich will raise the prices passengers pay.\n  The provision about Internet pricing, if implemented, will simply \nmean there will be no lower prices offered on the Internet than there \nare elsewhere. That will also raise the prices some passengers pay.\n  The voluntary attitudes of the airlines are only beginning to go into \neffect. Even the GAO report quoted by the Senator from Oregon reads:\n\n       The real deal is what the individual airlines come out with \n     in the plans. Once they do, they can be held accountable.\n\n  We ought to leave this to that accountability and not decide we know \nthe airline business better than the airlines themselves.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time allotted to the distinguished Senator \nhas expired.\n  Does the Senator from Oregon yield time to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Montana?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I understand I have about 10 minutes remaining. Would my \ngood friend from Montana like 3 or 4 minutes?\n  Mr. BURNS. It will only take about a minute. I am opposing the \namendment, so the Senator may want to rethink the allotment of that \ntime.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Why don't I give 3 minutes to my good friend from Montana, \nand then I will use my remaining time to wrap up.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank my friend from Oregon. I will be very brief.\n  In the Commerce Committee, we struck a deal with the airlines. Today \nthey are going to the FAA with their plan. What we have seen to this \npoint is an outline of what they plan to do. What they plan to give to \nthe FAA, with the FAA exceptions, we should agree to and keep the word \nof the Commerce Committee that that is the way we are going to do \nbusiness.\n  I think we are trying to micromanage. I expect I am the only one who \nshould be concerned about seat width. I fly just as much as anyone \nelse. In fact, to go round trip between here and Montana, we probably \nhave more seat time than we really want.\n  The chairman of the Subcommittee on Aviation on the Commerce \nCommittee had a very successful hearing in Kalispell, MT. We ought to \nlook at the root of some of the problems, and that is pilot shortage. \nWe had an outstanding hearing on how it affects rural States such as my \nState of Montana.\n  I shall oppose these two amendments. I thank my good friend from \nOregon. He has been more than gracious with his time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I don't see any other speakers. I will be \nvery brief in wrapping up.\n  Again with respect to these voluntary pledges that have been made by \nthe airline industry, I think it is worth noting exactly what the \nGeneral Accounting Office said about this so-called customer service \nfirst program.\n  The General Accounting Office found that of the 16 pledges the \nairline industry made in their voluntary customer first package, 3 of \nthem are already required by Federal law, 4 of them are already \nrequired by what are known as the contracts of carriage, legal \ncontracts, and the vast majority of them aren't written in at all. They \nare not written in any way with respect to key areas such as making \nsure consumers are adequately informed about the lowest fares, making \nsure customers are informed about delays, cancellations, and \ndiversions, returning checked bags within 24 hours, credit card \nrefunds, informing passengers about restrictions on frequent flier \nrules, and having customer service representatives to actually help the \npublic.\n  That is what the General Accounting Office said.\n  I am very hopeful we will see some of the airlines individually go \nbeyond what is being proposed in their voluntary package.\n  In reading the General Accounting Office and the Congressional \nResearch Service reports that have come out since this voluntary \nagreement was entered into, anyone will see how woefully inadequate the \nconsumer protections are for the public in this country. In fact, these \ncontracts of carriage, which are legalese and technical lingo that \nspells out the contract between the consumer and the airline, the \nCongressional Research Service found most of the front-line airline \nstaff didn't even know what these contracts of carriage were. The \nconsumer would basically have to do somersaults to try to get \ninformation about them. It is largely not available, even at the ticket \ncounter in many instances. It shows again how reluctant these airlines \nare, in the vast majority of instances, to truly inform the public.\n\n  At the end of the day, passengers have three types of rights: Rights \nin effect they already have; rights that will not be spelled out in the \ncontract; and, finally, rights that are being ignored altogether. That \nis why the Consumers Union today is urging the Senate to adopt these \ntwo amendments. They are on the side of the passengers. They understand \nthe voluntary pledges that have been made by the airline industry lack \nteeth. They are gobbledegook.\n  I urge my colleagues to strongly support these two amendments, agree \nwith the Consumers Union rather than with the airline industry, and \nlet's ensure that at a time when complaints are at a record level, \nwhich is the situation we find ourselves in today, we are making sure \nthe passengers can get a fair shake when it comes to learning about the \nlowest fare available and learning about their rights when there has \nbeen an overbooking.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Oregon yield the \nremainder of his time? The Senator has 6 minutes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n1625, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 1625), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now is on agreeing to amendment \nNo. 1626, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 1626), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all first-\ndegree amendments to the Transportation appropriations bill must be \nfiled by 12 noon today, Wednesday, September 15, with the exception of \none amendment by each leader and a managers' package of amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/15/senate-section/article/S10879-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10879-S10892]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE ECONOMIC CONVULSION IN AGRICULTURE\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I was just at a gathering of family \nfarmers from the State of Minnesota. I want to give a report on what \nmany of these farmers from Minnesota had to say. I know the Chair has \nmet with farmers from his State and is well aware of the economic pain.\n  This was a gathering of the Farmers Union farmers, although I think \nas they have traveled from Senate office to Senate office and House \noffice to House office, they speak for many farmers in the country. \nTheir focus is on what can only be described as an economic convulsion \nin agriculture.\n  I know this is not only a crisis in the Midwest but it is also a \ncrisis in the South and throughout the entire nation. On present \ncourse, we are going to lose a generation of producers. Whether we are \ntalking about farmers in Minnesota or farmers in Arkansas, many very \nhard-working people are asking nothing more than a decent price for the \ncommodities they\n\n[[Page S10880]]\n\nproduce. These farmers, who want a decent price so they can have a \ndecent standard of living and so they can support their children, are \ngoing to go under.\n  I will talk a little bit about policy, but, most importantly, I want \nto talk about families. I think it is important to bring this to the \nattention of the Senate. On the policy part, I would prefer, if at all \npossible, to avoid a confrontation about the Freedom to Farm bill. I \nthought it was ``freedom to fail'' when the bill passed in 1996. I \nthought it was a terrible piece of legislation; other Senators at that \ntime thought differently. Part of the legislation gave producers more \nflexibility, which was good. However, the problem we are facing now is \nthe flexibility doesn't do any good because, across the board prices \nare low and farmers can't cash-flow.\n  I don't know whether the Chair has had this experience in Arkansas. \nHe probably has. Many farmers will come up to me, and often these \nfarmers will be in their 40's or 50's. They will say: Right now, I am \njust burning up my equity. I am digging into everything I have in order \nto keep going. I want to ask you a question: Should I continue to do \nthat? Do I have a future, or should I just get out of farming?\n  People don't want to get out of farming. They don't want to leave. \nThis is where they farm. This is where they live. This is where they \nwork. The farm has been in their family for four generations.\n  We have to make a major modification in our farm policy. The \nmodification has to deal with the problem of price. It is a price \ncrisis in rural America. We have to get this emergency assistance \npackage passed. Conferees must meet and report a bill to Congress so \nthat we can get assistance out to farmers now. I think the emergency \npackage must include a disaster relief piece. The Senate version \nincludes no funding for weather related disasters. Although I am \nsupportive of an emergency relief package, I still don't think the \nSenate-passed version targeted the assistance towards those people who \nneed the most help.\n  The point is, these producers want to know whether they have a future \nbeyond 1 year. They can't cash-flow on these prices, whether it be for \nwheat, for corn, for cotton, for rice, for peanuts, or whether it be \nfor livestock producers. They simply cannot cash-flow. They cannot make \nit. They can work 20 hours a day and be the best managers in the world, \nand they still won't make it.\n  I do think we have to raise the loan rate to get the price up. We \nhave to do that. We have to have some kind of a way that our producers \nhave some leverage in the marketplace to get a better price. I think we \nalso need to have a farmer-owned reserve. A farmer-owned reserve would \nenable our producers to hold on to their grain until they can get a \nbetter price from the grain companies.\n\n  Whatever the proposal is, I say to all of my colleagues, for our \nproducers--and I imagine it is the same in Arkansas--time is not \nneutral. It is not on their side. I don't think we can leave this fall \nwithout making a change. We have to pass the emergency assistance \npackage, and we have to deal with the price crisis. I have heard \ndiscussion about how we are going to leave early. We cannot leave \nearly.\n  I also want to talk about the whole problem of concentration of \npower. This is an unbelievable situation. What we have is a situation \nwhere our producers, such as our livestock producers, when negotiating \nto sell, only have three or four processors. They have the Smithfields, \nthe ConAgras, the IPBs, the Hormels and the Cargills. The point is, you \nhave two, three or four firms that control over 40 percent, over 50 \npercent, sometimes 70-80 percent of the market.\n  Pork producers are facing extinction, and the packers are in hog \nheaven. The mergers continue, and we have all of these acquisitions. We \nneed to put free enterprise back into the food industry.\n  I have had a chance to review the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act and \nthe work of Estes Kefauver and others. We have had two major public \nhearings, one in Minnesota and one in Iowa, with Joel Klein, who leads \nthe Antitrust Division of the Justice Department, and Mike Dunn, head \nof the Packers and Stockyards Administration within the Department of \nAgriculture. Our producers are asking the question: Why, with these \nlaws on the books, isn't there some protection for us? We have all \nsorts of examples of monopoly. We want to know where is the protection \nfor producers.\n  It is critical to pass some stronger antitrust legislation. I know \nSenator Leahy is doing a great job with his legislation. I am pleased \nto join with him. I know part of what the Leahy legislation is going to \nemphasize is that the U.S. Department of Agriculture can ask for a \nfamily farm rural community impact statement. It must address the \nimpact these acquisitions and mergers will have on communities. We want \nto see that USDA has the authority to review these mergers and \nacquisitions. We want to see that when people break the law and are \npracticing collusive activities, there are going to be very stiff \npenalties. We want to set up a separate division within the Justice \nDepartment that deals with agriculture and conducts an investigation \nand an impact study. Again, we need to have some strong antitrust \nlegislation on the books.\n  This ought to be a bipartisan issue. I think this is one issue on \nwhich all the farm organizations agree. We must have some antitrust \naction. We must have some bargaining power for the producers. We must \nput free enterprise back into the food industry.\n  Until we pass this legislation, I will have an amendment on the floor \ncalling for a moratorium on any further acquisitions or mergers for \nagribusinesses with over $50 million in revenue. We need to take a look \nat what is going on. We need to pass some legislation now or we need to \nhave a moratorium for one year until we pass legislation. I think there \nis going to be a considerable amount of support for this. The reason I \nthink there is going to be a lot of support is that I think many of my \ncolleagues have been back in their States, and for those of us who come \nfrom rural States, from agricultural States, you can't meet with people \nand not know we have to take some kind of action.\n  I want to bring to the attention of my colleagues just what this \ncrisis means in personal terms. I get nervous about the discussions we \nhave about statistics. We talk about loan rates, we talk about target \nprices, deficiency payments and LPDs. I want to put this crisis in \npersonal terms.\n  Let me talk, first of all, about the wonderful wisdom of a Kansas \nfarmer.\n  I want to share a conversation I had with a Kansas farmer, who \noffered a great analogy that goes right to the heart of what is \nhappening to our livestock producers, in particular, pork producers who \nare facing extinction while the packers are in hog heaven:\n\n       Hogs can be mean, nasty and greedy animals. When a hog \n     farmer raises hogs, he knows well enough to separate the big \n     boars from the little hogs. No hog producer would put a boar \n     in the same pen with small pigs. The boar would literally \n     attack and kill the smaller pigs.\n\n  Yet while no producer would make such an illogical decision, we as a \nnation have shamelessly allowed the big boars within our own market \npen. That is exactly what is happening. The large corporate ``pigs'' \nhave been attacking and killing the smaller producers.\n  Now, let me just recite a little bit of historical context. These are \nwords that were spoken on the floor. I read this piece and thought of \nthe latest Smithfield effort to gobble up another company. These words \nwere spoken on the floor of the Senate by Wyoming Senator John B. \nKendrick in 1921, in support of the Packers and Stockyards Act:\n\n       Nothing under the sun would do more to conduce to increase \n     production in this country and ultimately to cheapen food \n     products for the people of the Nation than a dependable \n     market, one wherein the producer would understand beyond a \n     shadow of doubt that he would not merely get what is called a \n     fair market, but would get the market for his products based \n     on the law of supply and demand. The average producer in this \n     country is a pretty good sport. He is not afraid to take his \n     chances, but he wants to know that he meets the other man on \n     the dead level and does not have to go against stacked cards.\n\n  That is exactly what is at issue. Everywhere the family farmers look, \nwhether it be on the input side, or to whom they sell, you have \nmonopolies. We have to, as Senators, be willing to be on the side of \nfamily farmers and take on these monopolies. Who do we\n\n[[Page S10881]]\n\nrepresent? Are we Senators from Smithfield, ConAgra or Cargill, which \nis a huge company in my State. Or, are we Senators who represent family \nfarmers in rural communities?\n  I had a meeting with about 35 small bankers, independent bankers, \ncommunity bankers, from rural Minnesota. It was unbelievable; all of \nthem were saying they have not seen anything such as this crisis in \ntheir lifetimes. They said if we continue the way we are going right \nnow, we are going to lose these farms. Our hospitals are going to shut \ndown, our businesses are in trouble, our dealers and banks are in \ntrouble. We are not going to be able to support our schools.\n  This is about the survival of many of our communities, and these \nbankers they are right. I would, in 1999, like to associate myself with \nthe remarks of Senator John B. Kendrick in 1921. He goes on to say:\n\n       It has been brought to such a high degree of concentration \n     that it is dominated by a few men. The big packers, so-\n     called, stand between hundreds of thousands of producers on \n     the one hand, and millions of consumers on the other. They \n     have their fingers on the pulse of both the producing and \n     consuming markets, and are in such a position of strategic \n     advantage; they have unrestrained powers to manipulate both \n     markets to their own advantage and to the disadvantage of \n     over 99 percent of the people of our country. Such power is \n     too great, Mr. President, to repose it to the hands of any \n     man.\n\n  I have been doing a lot of traveling during August meeting with \nfarmers. I have been, certainly, to every single rural community in \nMinnesota and to gatherings in South Dakota, Iowa, North Dakota, \nMissouri, and Texas. Each and every time, I will tell you, it is \nincredible when you speak to farmers. You have 700 or 800 pork \nproducers at a rally, for example, and they know from personal \nexperience who the enemy is. They can't believe that IBP is making \nrecord profits while they are going under. How can it be these packers \nmake all this money and the prices for our products don't go down in \nthe grocery stores? Meanwhile, our family farmers, our producers, are \nfacing extinction? What is going on?\n  When we passed the Sherman Act in late the 1800s, we did it, to \nprotect consumers; but, we also said we as a nation value competition. \nWe thought the food industry was important. We thought we ought to have \na lot of producers. We thought we ought to have a wide distribution of \nland ownership. We thought it was important to have rural communities. \nSomebody is going to farm land in America. When our family farmers in \nthe Midwest or the South are driven off the land, the mentality seems \nto be not to worry about it. The argument is made that somebody will \nfarm the land. Somebody will own the animals. But the problem is that \nit will be these big conglomerates owning the land and the animals. The \nhealth and vitality of rural America is not based upon the number of \nacres of land somebody owns or the number of animals; it is based upon \nthe number of family farmers who live in the community, buy in the \ncommunity, care about the community.\n  As far as our national interest is concerned, this is a food scarcity \nissue. When these big conglomerates finish muscling their way to the \ndinner table and driving these family farmers out, what will be the \nprice we pay for the food? Will it be safe? Will it be nutritious? Will \nthere be land stewardship? Will you have producers that care about the \nenvironment? I think the answer is no.\n  This is a transition that America will deeply regret. We in the \nSenate must take action. We must take action to deal with this crisis, \nand it is a crisis. It is a price crisis. We have to get the loan rate \nup to get the price up. We have to have a moratorium on all of these \nacquisitions and mergers.\n  Eunice Biel from Harmony, MN, a dairy farmer, said:\n\n       We currently milk 100 cows and just built a new milking \n     parlor. We will be milking 120 cows next year. Our 22-year-\n     old son would like to farm with us. But for us to do so he \n     must buy out my husband's mother (his grandmother) because my \n     husband and I who are 46-years-old, still are unable to take \n     over the family farm. Our son must acquire a beginning farmer \n     loan. But should he shoulder that debt if there is no stable \n     milk price? We continuously are told by bankers, \n     veterinarians and ag suppliers that we need to get bigger or \n     we will not survive. At 120 cows, we can manage our herd and \n     farm effectively and efficiently. We should not be forced to \n     expand in order to survive.\n\n  Lynn Jostock, a Waseca, MN, dairy farmer, said:\n\n       I have four children. My 11-year-old son Al helps my \n     husband and I by doing chores. But it often is too much to \n     expect of someone so young. For instance, one day our son \n     came home from school. His father asked Al for some help \n     driving the tractor to another farm about 3 miles away. Al \n     was going to come home right afterward. But he wound up \n     helping his father cut hay. Then he helped rake hay. Then he \n     helped bale hay. My son did not return home until 9:30 p.m. \n     He had not yet eaten supper. He had not yet done his \n     schoolwork. We don't have other help. The price we get at the \n     farm gate isn't enough to allow us to hire any farmhands or \n     to help our community by providing more jobs. And it isn't \n     fair to ask your 11-year-old son to work so hard to keep the \n     family going. When will he burn out? How will he ever want to \n     farm?\n\n  Above and beyond that, I will just tell you that there is a lot of \nstrain in the families. Families are under tremendous economic \npressure, and they are under tremendous personal pressure.\n  As long as I am talking about families, I want to tell you that in my \nState of Minnesota there are farmers who talk about taking their lives. \nThere are a number of people who are involved in the social services \nwho are doing an awful lot of visits now to farms. And an awful lot of \nfarmers are right on the edge. Do you want to know something? Their \nsuffering is needless and unnecessary. This is not the result of Adam \nSmith's ``invisible hand.'' This is not some inexorable economic law. \nIt is not the law of physics. It is not gravity that dictates that \nfamily farmers must fall.\n  We have it within our power to change farm policy and to give these \nproducers a chance. We should not leave. We should not go home until we \nwrite some new agricultural policy, a new farm policy that will really \nmake a difference for people.\n  I am open to all suggestions. I am not arrogant about this. But I \nwill tell you one thing I am insistent upon. I am going to be out on \nthe floor talking about this issue. I am insistent that we take some \naction. We can't just turn our gaze away from this and act as if it is \nnot happening.\n  Jan Lundebrek from Benson, a Minnesota bank loan officer:\n\n       As a loan officer at a small town bank, I received a check \n     for $19 for the sale of a 240-pound hog. I immediately went \n     across the street to the grocery store and looked at the \n     price of ham. The store was selling hams for $49. I wrote \n     down that price and showed it to the producer. Then we \n     decided to ask the grocer about the difference. Where does it \n     go? Somebody is getting it, but it isn't the farmer.\n\n  We have policies to keep our country safe. We have a defense policy, \nwe have an education policy, but we don't have a policy to protect our \nstrength. We don't have a food policy that protects our farm \ncommunities and consumers who spend $49 for a 10-pound ham that the \nfarmer can't even buy through the sale of a 240-pound hog.\n  Now we have Smithfield that says it wants to buy Murphy. A merger of \nyet two more of these large packers is just outrageous. I want a \nmoratorium on these mergers and acquisitions. I don't want these big \nlivestock packers to be pushing around family farmers and driving them \noff the land.\n  Jan Lundebrek, this is a brilliant example. I want to speak for you, \nJan, on the floor of the Senate--A Benson, MN, bank loan officer:\n\n       As a loan officer at a small town bank, I received a check \n     for $19 for the sale of a 240-pound hog. I immediately went \n     across the street to the grocery store and looked at the \n     price of hams. The store was selling hams for $49. I wrote \n     down that price and showed it to the producer. Then we \n     decided to ask the grocer about the difference. Where does it \n     go? Somebody is getting it, but it isn't the farmer.\n\n  Let me again point this out. You spend $49 for a 10-pound ham, and \nthis farmer is getting $19 for a 240-pound hog.\n  I mentioned the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act. I feel as if I am \nspeaking on the floor of the Senate in the late 1800s. Where is the \ncall for antitrust action? Teddy Roosevelt, where are you when we need \nyou?\n  We have to get serious about this.\n  Richard Berg, Clements farmer:\n\n       My dad died when I was 9-years-old. Two years later, when I \n     turned 11, I began to farm full time with my older brother. \n     He and I still farm together. This year I will bring in my \n     48th crop. The farm we own has been in the Berg family for \n     more than 112 years.\n       When we began farming we would get up at 4 a.m. to do \n     chores. Then we would go to\n\n[[Page S10882]]\n\n     school. During the evening, after we returned from school, we \n     went back to work farming.\n       My brother and I each own 360 acres. I never had a line of \n     credit until the past five years. We always made enough to \n     save some and buy machinery when we needed it. Now I have a \n     line of credit against the land that I own that I am always \n     using.\n       I invested in a hog co-op a few years ago and a corn \n     processing facility. I have a lot of equity tied up there. \n     Neither venture is making money. They're losing money.\n       There's no one after me who is going to farm.\n\n  Les Kyllo, Goodhue dairy farmer:\n\n       My grandfather milked 15 cows. My dad milked 26. I have \n     milked as many as 100 cows, and I'm going broke. They made a \n     living out here and I didn't. Since my son went away to \n     college, my farmhands are my 73-year-old father and my 77-\n     year-old father-in-law who has an artificial hip.\n       I have a barn that needs repairs and updates that I can't \n     afford. I have two children that don't want to farm. At one \n     point, in a 30-mile radius, there were 15 Kyllos farming. Now \n     there are three. And now I'm selling my cows. My family has \n     farmed since my ancestors emigrated to the United States.\n       When I leave farming, my community will lose the $15,000 I \n     spend locally each year for cattle feed; the $3,000 I spend \n     at the veterinarian; the $3,600 I spend for electricity; or \n     the money I spend for fuel, cattle insemination and other \n     farm needs.\n\n  By the way, I would like to thank these farmers. I don't know whether \nother Senators realize this. I am sure they do. I am sure that people \nlistening to our discussion on the floor realize this. But you know, \nwhen people tell you the story of their lives and allow you to talk \nabout them and their strains, they do not do that except if they hope \nthat if enough of us realize what is really going on, we will make the \nchange. That is what they are hoping for. That is what they are hoping \nfor, and that is what we should do.\n  Alphonse Mathiowetz, Comfrey farmer:\n\n       ``We were there 43 years and it took 43 seconds to take it \n     all away.'' Alphonse and LaDonna, his spouse, farmed the same \n     land in Comfrey for 43 years. In the spring of 1998 a tornado \n     tore through their community taking with it the work of their \n     lifetime, their farm machinery, their buildings, their trees, \n     their corn bins and their retirement. The Mathiowetz family \n     lost more than $200,000 of equity to the tornado, none of \n     which will be recovered.\n       Alphonse and LaDonna chose to rebuild their home on the \n     farmstead. Not because they wanted to, but because if they \n     did otherwise the reimbursement they received from their \n     insurance company would have been highly taxed. It was the \n     only financial decision available to the couple.\n       ``I guess it's a blessing to retire, but not this way, \n     watching the farm go away in bulk on an iron truck.''\n\n  Steve Cattnach, Luverne small businessperson (insurance agent):\n\n       Two local farmers who raise hogs came in both in the same \n     week to withdraw money from their Individual Retirement \n     Accounts. During the course of 10 days the time it takes for \n     the money to arrive both were in twice asking about when \n     their checks would arrive.\n       A local farmer who has 2 1,200-hog finishing facilities \n     wanted to help his cash-flow by reducing the insurance \n     coverage on his hog buildings from $180,000 each to $165,000 \n     each. The terms of the policy allowed the coverage to be \n     reduced, but the farmer's lender wouldn't allow the \n     coverage to be reduced because the farmer, after 3 years \n     of finishing hogs in those buildings, still owed $180,000 \n     on each building. During those 3 years, he had only paid \n     interest on the money he had borrowed.\n  Laura Resler, Owatonna farmer:\n\n       I have farmed with my husband for 20 years. When we \n     started, we raised two breeds of purebred hogs and sold their \n     offspring as breeding stock. Each animal sold for $300 to \n     $500 per animal. But the increase in size of hog operations \n     made our small breeding stock operation a money-losing \n     venture. Also milked cows to produce manufacturing grade \n     (Grade B) milk. But $10 per hundredweight is not enough to \n     pay the bills, so we had to give up the cows. From the time \n     my husband, Todd, was 18 until now, when he's 41, he's worked \n     for absolutely nothing. Now he works at a job in town so we \n     have funds on which to retire. Our hope is to give our son \n     the farm that's been in the family for generations and let \n     our daughter have the house. But you can't cash-flow a 4-H \n     livestock project. How can he cash-flow the farm?\n\n  Many of these youngsters growing up on these farms are not going to \nbe able to farm because these farmers are going to be gone. I have \nheard people say: Senator Wellstone, you come out here and talk about \nthis. What is to be done? Raise the loan rate; get the price up.\n  If Members don't want to do that, come out here and talk about other \nways we can change policy in order to make it work.\n  Is there any Senator who wants to come to the floor of the Senate, \ngiven the economic pain, the economic convulsion, the broken dreams, \nthe broken lives and broken families in rural America, who wants to say \nstay the course? Is there any Senator who wants to do that? I don't \nknow of any Senator who thinks we should stay the course.\n  If that is the case, let's have an opportunity for those who have \nsome ideas about how to change this policy so people can get a decent \nprice and there can be some real competition. We want an opportunity to \nbe out here, to introduce those amendments, to introduce those bills, \nto have votes, and to try to change this. That is what I am talking \nabout.\n  Darrel Mosel has been farming for 18 years. When he started farming \nin Sibley County, which is one of Minnesota's largest agricultural \ncounties, there were four implement dealers in Gaylord, the county \nseat. Today there is none. There is not even an implement dealer in \nSibley County.\n  The same thing has happened to feedstores and grain elevators. Since \nthe farm policies of the 1980s and the resulting reduction in prices, \nfarmers don't buy any new equipment; they either use baling wire to \nhold things together or they quit. The farmhouses have people in them, \nbut they don't farm. There is something wrong with that.\n  Again, when he started farming in Sibley County there were four \nimplement dealers in Gaylord, the county seat. Today there is not one--\nnot one. This isn't just the family farmers going under, it is the \nimplement dealers, the businesses, our communities. This is all about \nwhether or not rural America will survive.\n  Ernie Anderson, a Benson farmer:\n\n       Crop insurance has and is ruining the farmer. Because \n     yields of disaster years are figured when calculating the \n     premiums costs, a farmer's yield on which he can buy \n     insurance decreases. As it decreases, it becomes apparent \n     that paying a crop insurance premium doesn't make financial \n     sense because when there is a loss, the claim amount of \n     damaged crops isn't enough to pay the price to put crops in \n     the ground. Crop insurance is supposed to help me. It's not \n     supposed to put me out of business.\n\n  Randy Olson, strong, articulate Randy Olson, a college student, \nbeginning farmer, comes home from college each weekend to help on the \nfarm. In March he came home from school and his parents looked like \nthey aged 5 years. The price of milk had dropped from $16.10 in \nFebruary to $12.10 in March. No business can afford a drop in price \nlike that over a short period of time.\n\n       You love your parents, you see them hurt, and it makes you \n     mad.\n\n  And prices are going up right now, but it is a heck of a dairy policy \nif, due to the drought in some areas of the country, Minnesota dairy \nfarmers can do better. That is not a dairy policy.\n  Gary Wilson, an Odin farmer, received the church newsletter in the \nmail. What is normally addressed to the entire congregation had been \naddressed only to farmers. The newsletter said farmers should quit \nfarming if it is not profitable. If larger, corporate-style farms were \nthe way to turn a profit, the independent farmer should let go and find \nsomething else to do.\n\n       What he doesn't understand is that farmers are his \n     congregation. If we go he won't have a church.\n\n  Not only that, Gary, but, again, I will just repeat it. The health \nand the vitality of our rural communities are not based upon how many \nacres of land someone owns or how many animals someone owns; it is how \nmany family farmers live and buy in the community. The health and the \nvitality and the national interests of our Nation are not having a few \nconglomerate exercising their power over producers, consumers and \ntaxpayers.\n  Testimony from Northwest Minnesota--this is more painful. John Doe 1 \nfrom East Ottertail, MN. Despite the ongoing difficulties, it is \namazing, the steadfast willingness of this family to try to hold things \ntogether. The farm is farmed by two families, a father and his son. \nSince dairy prices fell in the second quarter of 1999, there was not \nenough income for this family to make the loan payments and to provide \nfor family living and cover farm operating expenses. The farm credit \nservices would not release the loan for farm operating assistance, so \nthe family had to borrow money from the lender from\n\n[[Page S10883]]\n\nwhich they are already leasing their cows. They have not been able to \nfeed the cows properly because of the lack of funds. Because they \ncannot adequately feed their dairy herd, their milk production has \nfallen and is considerably lower than the herd's average production.\n  In addition, because there was no money for family living expenses, \nthe parents had to cash out what little retirement savings they had so \nthe two families had something to live on day to day. The son and wife \nhad to let their trailer house go since they could not make the \npayments, and they moved into a home owned by a relative for the \nwinter.\n  Most of their machinery is being liquidated. However, there are a few \npieces of machinery that go toward paying off their existing debt. The \nfamily will sell off 120 acres of land in their struggle to reduce \ntheir debt.\n  Recently, the father has been having serious back troubles and has \nbeen unable to help his son with the work. This is tremendous stress, \nboth physically and mentally, on the son. The son has decided he is \ngoing to have to sell part of the herd in order to reduce the herd to a \nnumber that is more manageable for one person. In addition, the money \nacquired from selling off part of the herd will be applied toward their \ndebt.\n  The son hopes these three items combined--selling machinery, land, \nand parts of the herd--can pay off enough of their debt that he might \nbe able to do some restructuring on the reminder of the farm and to \nreduce loan repayments to a manageable amount where there is something \nleft to live on after the payments are made. That is what they hope \nfor.\n  By the way, as long as we are talking about bad luck, in a very \nbitter, ironic way, at least for me, my travel in farm country in \nMinnesota and many other States in the country has made me acutely \naware of the fact that we are going to have to talk again. Senator Bob \nKerrey of Nebraska was eloquent when he mentioned we will have to talk \nabout health care that goes with health care coverage that comes with \nbeing a citizen in this country.\n  Do you know what is happening with our farmers? A lot of the farmers, \nbecause of this failed policy, because of these record low prices, \nbecause of record low income, because, financially, they have their \nbacks to the wall, what do they give up on? They give up on health \ninsurance coverage. So they do not even have any health insurance. Of \ncourse, for many of these producers, being able to afford this health \ninsurance coverage in the first place is very difficult. They don't get \nthe same deal that you get if you are working for a big employer. Now \nmany of them say: We cannot afford it. So they have given up on their \nhealth insurance coverage, hoping they and their loved ones will not be \nill. But you know what? The more stress there is, whether it is more \nmental stress or more physical stress, the more likely people will be \nstruggling with illness.\n  John Doe 2, from Goodridge, MN--I say John Doe 2 because these are \nfarmers who do not want their names used, and I respect that. This \nfamily has gone through a divorce. The father and three children are \noperating the farm. The farmer has taken an off-farm job to make \npayments to the bank and has his a 12-year-old son and 14-year-old \ndaughter operating the farming operation unassisted while he is away at \nwork. The neighbors have threatened to turn him in to Human Services \nfor child abandonment, so he had to have his 18-year-old daughter quit \nwork and stay home to watch the younger children. The 12-year-old boy \nis working heavy farm equipment, mostly alone. He is driving these big \nmachines and can hardly reach the clutch on the tractor. It is this or \nlose the farm.\n  This story really gets to me because this is really complicated. One \nmore time. The family has gone through a divorce and the father and \nthree children are operating the farm.\n  As long as I am going to take some time to talk about what is \nhappening to family farmers, this is unfortunately not uncommon. The \nstrain on families is unbelievable.\n  So the father, since he is alone, a single parent, was forced to take \nan off-farm job to make payments to the bank. His 12-year-old son and \n14-year-old daughter are operating the farming operation unassisted \nwhile he is at work.\n  I think a lot of us would say: Wait a minute. You cannot do this. The \nneighbors, thinking the same thing, have threatened to turn him in to \nHuman Services because they say this is not right.\n  He has an 18-year-old daughter. He says to her: You have to quit work \nand stay home to watch the two younger children. The 12-year-old boy is \nworking heavy farm equipment, mostly alone. He is driving these big \nmachines and he can hardly reach the clutch on the tractor. But it is \nthis or lose the farm. That is what is happening out there. This is a \nconvulsion.\n  I say to my colleague from North Dakota, who is on the floor, I have \nbeen saying the reason the farmers in Minnesota have given me their \nstories and the reason I want to take the time to focus on this is we \nwant an opportunity to change this policy. We want an opportunity to be \nout here with amendments and with legislation that will lead to some \nimprovement.\n  Mr. President, John Doe 3.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator from Minnesota will yield.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will not yield the floor but I will \nbe pleased to yield for a question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Minnesota \nyielding for a question. I suppose some people get irritated about \nthose of us, Senator Wellstone, myself, Senator Conrad, Senator Harkin, \nand others who come to the floor to talk so much about the plight of \nfamily farmers. But at a time when our newspapers trumpet the growing \neconomy and the good news on Wall Street with a stock market that keeps \ngoing up, at the same time we have a full-scale crisis in rural America \nwith grain prices for family farmers in constant dollars being about \nwhere they were in the Great Depression.\n\n  I held a meeting with Senator Wellstone in Minnesota. I held a \nhearing with Senator Harkin in Iowa. During the August break we held a \nhearing in North Dakota under the auspices of the Democratic Policy \nCommittee, and we heard the same thing we have been hearing; that is, \nwe have a serious problem with low prices. You cannot solve this \nwithout dealing with prices. Farmers are paying more for what they \npurchase and getting less for what they sell.\n  I wanted to just mention two items and then ask the Senator from \nMinnesota a question. We had a Unity Day rally in North Dakota; 1,600 \nfarmers came. The most memorable moment, I guess, was from a fellow \nnamed Arlo, who was an auctioneer. He told of doing an auction sale at \nthis family farm. A little boy came up to him at the end of the sale \nand grabbed him by the leg, and with tears in his eyes, shouted up at \nhim, he said: You sold my dad's tractor.\n  The auctioneer, named Arlo, he kind of put his hand on the boy's \nshoulder to calm him down a bit. The boy wasn't to be calmed. He had \ntears in his eyes. He said: I wanted to drive that tractor when I got \nbig.\n  That is what this is about. The mother who lost her farm, who wrote \nto me and said during the auction sale her 17-year-old son refused to \ncome out of the house to help with the auction sale, refused to come \nout of his bedroom. That was not because he is a bad kid, but because \nhe so desperately wanted to keep that family farm and was so absolutely \nheartbroken and could not bring himself to participate in the sale of \nthat farm. That is the human misery that exists on today's family \nfarms.\n  They are the canary in the mine shaft, with this kind of economic \ncircumstance. Somehow there is a suggestion that what matters in this \ncountry is the Dow Jones Industrial Average and not a beautiful wheat \nfield or cattle in the pasture or a hardware store on Main Street. \nSomehow it is just all numbers and it doesn't matter whether we have a \nlot of farmers or a couple of corporate farms.\n  I ask the Senator from Minnesota during his travels--I know Senator \nWellstone was not only in Minnesota but all around this country in \nAugust at farm unity rallies--if he heard anyone, anywhere, believing \nthe so-called Freedom to Farm bill made any sense at all? That is the \nFreedom to Farm bill that pulls the rug out from under family farmers \nand says it doesn't matter what the market price of grain is,\n\n[[Page S10884]]\n\nyou operate the market. You don't need a safety net. A lot of other \nfolks in the country have safety nets, but the farmers are told, no, \nyou don't need a safety net.\n  Did the Senator find anybody in this country who said: I wrote that \nbill, I stand behind that bill, that bill makes good sense, and that \nbill is working?\n  (Mr. BUNNING assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me give my colleague from North \nDakota kind of a two-part answer to that question; first of all, \nfarmers and citizens in the community are speaking out, because this is \nall about rural America. It is a strong and clear voice saying: You \nhave to change the policy. This is not working. We are going under. We \ncannot get a decent price for what we produce. We cannot cash-flow.\n  So I can very honestly, truthfully say not at one farm gathering \nanywhere in Minnesota, and I was at a lot of them that not just the \nfarmers showed up at these gatherings. It was farmers bankers, business \npeople, implement dealers, and clergy. It was the community. I promise \nyou, that in the parts of the State I visited approximately fifty \npercent of the crowd was Republican. But not one of them was defending \nthis farm policy, this Freedom to Farm or ``freedom to fail.''\n  The second thing I said on the floor of the Senate, and my colleague \nmight want to ask me a follow-up question, I do not see how anybody in \nthe Senate or House of Representatives who has been out there with \npeople can say stay the course. You cannot. We have to change the \ncourse. There is just no question about it.\n  I do not care if we call it a modification. You know what I mean. We \ncan go over it. People can talk about a modification; they can talk \nabout a correction.\n  I used to hear people on the floor of the Senate say ``stay the \ncourse.'' I do not hear them saying ``stay the course'' anymore.\n  I say to my colleague from North Dakota, the reason I am out here for \na while is because I want to make it clear that we want an opportunity \nto be on this floor with legislation that will make a difference, that \nwill raise the loan rate, get the price up, deal with the problems of \nall the acquisitions and mergers, and try to put free enterprise back \ninto the food industry. We want to make a difference in order to get \nthis emergency financial assistance package passed. We want to be out \nhere, and we want that opportunity.\n  The second thing I was saying is that in no way, shape, or form \nshould we adjourn without addressing this crisis. I cannot believe when \nI read in the papers there is this discussion about leaving. I cannot \nbelieve there are people who are saying let's get out of here as soon \nas possible. No, we have work to do. We should not leave until we take \nthe responsibility as legislators, as Senators who represent our \nStates, to write a new farm bill or make the corrections or \nmodifications that will deal with the price; that will give people a \nchance to farm and stay on their land. My colleague is absolutely right \nwith his question. He is right on the mark.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If I can further inquire of the Senator from Minnesota, \nhe is going to be joined and is joined by a number of our colleagues \nwho insist we do something about this farm problem. It is not \nsatisfactory to watch the auction sales occur across the heartland of \nthis country. If you take a look at what is going on in our country and \nevaluate where we are losing population--I have a map I have shown many \ntimes on the floor of the Senate where I have outlined in red all of \nthe counties that have lost more than 10 percent of its population, and \nwe have a huge red circle in the middle of America. Those counties are \nlosing population.\n  We are depopulating the farm belt in this country because somehow we \nare told the future of agriculture is the future of corporate \nagriculture, corporate agrifactories. We can raise hogs by the \nthousands; we can raise chickens by the millions; we do not need real \npeople driving tractors; we do not need real people living on the land; \ncorporations can farm America from California to Maine.\n  When that happens, if that happens, this country will have lost \nsomething very important. I do not know whether the Senator from \nMinnesota has read Richard Critchfield. He is an author who has passed \naway. He was from Fargo, ND, originally. He went on to become a world-\nrenowned author. He wrote a lot of books about rural America. One of \nthe things he wrote about was the refreshment of family values in this \ncountry always rolled from family farms to small towns to big cities. \nThe seedbed of family values was always coming from America's family \nfarms--raising a barn after a disaster, the pie socials, the gatherings \non Saturday in the small town to celebrate the harvest, the family \nvalues that come from living on the land, raising food for a hungry \nnation, raising children in a crime-free environment, building a \nschool, building communities, building churches, building a way of \nlife.\n  Somehow we are told those are values that do not matter. What matters \nis the marketplace, the market system, so if huge grain companies \ndecide when a farmer plants a crop and harvests a crop and takes it to \nthe market that the crop is not worth anything, that is the way life \nis.\n  At the same time that farmer is driving a crop to the elevator and \ntold the food does not have any value, we have old women climbing trees \nin the Sudan foraging for leaves to eat because they are desperately on \nthe verge of starvation. There is something broken about this system. \nFamily farmers are told with the Freedom to Farm they are free. Are you \nfree from monopolistic railroads that overcharge? They do. In our North \nDakota, our Public Service Commission said they overcharge over $100 \nmillion just in our State, and most of that is from farmers.\n\n  Are you free of grain trade monopolies that choke the economic life \nout of farmers? They are not free from that.\n  Are you free from mergers and concentrations so that in every \ndirection a farmer looks they find two or three firms controlling it \nall? Do you want to fatten up a steer and ship the steer to a packing \nplant? Good for you because you have three choices that slaughter 80 \npercent of the steers in America.\n  Do you think that is a deck that is stacked against you? Or how about \nthis, free from trade agreements that stack the deck against family \nfarmers? Try to take a load of durum wheat into Canada. I did once. We \nhad millions--12 million bushels--of Canadian durum wheat shipped into \nthis country undermining our market in the first 6 months of this year \nalone.\n  I went up with a man named Earl in a 12-year-old orange truck with \n200 bushels of durum. All the way to the border, we found these trucks \nwith millions of bushels of wheat coming south. I know I have told the \nstory before. If people are tired of hearing it, it does not matter to \nme a bit. I will continue talking about it because it talks about the \nfundamental unfairness of our trade.\n  We got to the border with Earl's orange truck and 200 bushels. We \nwere stopped at the border because you cannot get that American durum \ninto Canada. Why? Because our trade agreements that have been made by \ntrade negotiators who have forgotten who they work for are incompetent \ntrade agreements that sold out the interests of family farmers in this \ncountry. Farmers have every right to be very angry about it and ought \nto demand it changes.\n  Those are a few areas--mergers and concentration, grain trade, \nrailroads, bad trade agreement, and a Freedom to Farm bill that says \nprice support for farmers do not matter much. We know how wrong that \nis.\n  The question for this country of ours is this: We ramped up as a \nnation a few years ago to save Mexico in times of serious financial \ncrisis. Will a country that is willing to ramp up its effort to save a \nneighbor, will a country that is willing to commit $50 billion to save \nMexico decide that it is worth saving family farmers in times of \ncrisis? We have people who say it is not worth that, we ought not take \nthe time, we do not have the ability, we do not have the money, we do \nnot have the ideas, they say.\n  This is not rocket science. It is easy. I say, change the Freedom to \nFarm bill to a bill that says how about freedom to make a decent \nliving. If you grow food and are good at it, there ought to be a \nconnection between efforts and reward. We ought not have the notion \nthere are minimum wages and minimum opportunities and all kinds of\n\n[[Page S10885]]\n\nother safety nets across the country, but for families who stay on \nAmerican farms and raise their kids and support small towns, there is \nnothing but a bleak future because corporations are taking over what \nthey do, and that is just fine for the future, some will say.\n  It is not fine for the future. This is about who we are as a country, \nwho we want to be. It is about the soul of this country, and if this \ncountry, as Thomas Jefferson used to say, does not care about broad-\nbased economic ownership and opportunity for the American people, then \nit will quickly lose its political freedoms as well.\n  Political freedom relates to economic freedom. Economic freedom comes \nfrom broad-based economic ownership, and nowhere is that more important \nand more evident than in the production of this country's food.\n  I ask the Senator from Minnesota one question: Isn't it the case that \nthere are 7 million people in Europe farming who get a decent price for \ntheir farm product because the countries of Europe have been hungry and \nhave decided, as a matter of national security and economic and social \npolicy, they want families living on the farm operating European farms? \nIsn't it the case that is the policy in Europe--and God bless them and \ngood for them--and that policy is contrasted with folks, some in this \nChamber, who say that ought not be the policy? Our policy ought to be \nto say whatever happens happen; if corporations farm America, that is \nfine. Isn't that the case? Isn't that the dichotomy of the two \npolicies?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota \nfor his question. I appreciate it.\n  First of all, let me go back to a comment I made earlier, as long as \nthe Senator from North Dakota brings up the example of Europe. I am \ngoing to continue to give other examples and talk about what is \nhappening to other farmers in my State of Minnesota in a moment. I \nintend to stay out on the floor of the Senate and talk about farm \nprices for a while. I have a ruptured disk in my back, and as long as I \ncan stand, which maybe not be that much longer but a while, I will \ncontinue to speak.\n  What is happening is this pain is not Adam Smith's invisible hand. It \nis not the law of physics. It is not gravity that farmers must fall \ndown. The only inevitability to what is happening to our producers is \nthe inevitability of a stacked deck, a stacked deck which basically \nripped away in the ``freedom to fail'' bill any kind of safety net, a \nstacked deck that does not give our farmers any kind of leverage in the \nmarketplace.\n  Whatever happened to farmer-owned reserves? Whatever happened to \nraising the loan rate to give people better targeting power, a better \ntarget price vis-a-vis the grain companies? And what in the world are \nwe doing about three and four packers who dominate 60 to 70 percent of \nthe market vis-a-vis our livestock producers?\n\n  So I say to my colleague from North Dakota, yes, the Europeans have \ndecided, given their experience in two wars, food is precious. They do \nnot want people going hungry. They value family farmers, and they think \nit is in their national interest to support family farmers, and \ntherefore the Europeans have a policy that protects that. I completely \nagree with my colleague who says we ought to also care as much about \nfamily farmers as the Europeans do.\n  When some of my colleagues say, let's rely on the market, farmers \nkind of smile and say: Free enterprise? Where is it? We want free \nenterprise. We want competition. But please explain to your colleagues \nin the Senate that a few packers dominate the market. They are making \nrecord profits while we're facing extinction.\n  One example that I think says it all is an example I read earlier, \nwhich I cannot find right now. I will have to come back to it. It is \nabout the economics of this.\n  I will talk about John Doe 3 from Euclid, MN, a farmer waiting for a \nforeclosure of his real estate. But first, I ask my staff to find the \nexample of a grocery store and what farmers are being paid for hogs.\n  Here is the example: Again, Jan Lundebrek of Benson, MN, a loan \nofficer at a small town bank, received a check for $19 from the sale of \na 240-pound hog: ``I immediately went across the street to the grocery \nstore and looked at the price of hams. The store was selling hams for \n$49. I wrote down that price and showed it to the producer. Then we \ndecided to go ask the grocer about the difference.''\n  She is the loan officer. ``Where does it go? Somebody's getting it, \nbut it isn't the farmer,'' says this Minnesota bank loan officer, Jan \nLundebrek of Benson. ``We have policies to keep our country safe. We \nhave a defense policy. We have an education policy. But we don't have a \npolicy to protect our strength. We don't have a food policy to protect \nour farms, communities, and consumers who spend $49 for a 10-pound ham \nthat the farmers can't even buy through the sale of a 240-pound hog.''\n  So $49 for a 10-pound ham, and this farmer gets $19 for a 240-pound \nhog.\n  I am going to go back to the stories of farmers in my State, but as \nlong as I am taking some time on the floor of the Senate seeing Senator \nDorgan out here triggered another thought. He was saying the other \nnight, at a Farmers Union gathering, that his parents were Farmers \nUnion members, and he went to many blessed Farmers Union picnics and \ngatherings. And then he went on to say: My parents would never have \nbelieved that. Senator Dorgan, his roots are rural America. He said: My \nparents would have never believed I would have had a chance to be a \nSenator. They certainly would not believe that I would be getting an \naward from the Farmers Union.\n  The only thing I could think of saying at this gathering to the pork \nproducers that were there was: I'm more committed to you than any other \nSenator, which catches people's attention. I heard Senator Dorgan talk \nabout his background and I thought of my own. The reason why I bring up \nthis story is every time I am at a gathering of pork producers, I am \nthinking of my mother, Minnie Wellstone, who is up there in Heaven, \nsmiling, I am sure, and saying: Paul, good Jewish boy that you are, \nwhat are you doing speaking at all these gatherings of pork producers \nand organizing with these farmers?\n  So I said at this gathering to Senator Dorgan: If you think your \nparents would be surprised, believe me, my mother and father would be \nvery surprised. My mother, Minnie Wellstone, was a cafeteria worker. \nThis was her life. Her philosophy was that people should get a decent \nwage for their work.\n  In many ways, this is what we are talking about. We are saying, if we \nbelieve as a country that a person who works hard, 40-hours a week, \nalmost 52 weeks a year, ought to make a living wage and be able to \nsupport his or her family, then shouldn't the men and women who provide \nthe food and fiber for our nation make at least a living wage?\n  I think the vast majority of the people agree they should. The vast \nmajority of people believe they should get a decent price. But that is \nnot what is happening right now. This is a crisis. This is a crisis in \nrural America: Broken dreams and broken lives and broken families, all \nof it unnecessary.\n  Here is an example: This farmer, John Doe 3, is waiting for a \nforeclosure on his real estate in northwest Minnesota. He is waiting to \nsee whether FSA can help him.\n  By the way, the Farm Services Administration in Minnesota is doing an \nexcellent job. I say to Tracy Beckman, the director, thank you for your \nwork. But you know what? The Farm Service Administration in Minnesota, \nand this may very well be the same in the State of Washington and the \nState of Montana, the FSA local offices are severely understaffed. They \ncannot even begin to deal with the number of people who are knocking at \ntheir door for emergency loans. They are under incredible tension, \nincredible stress.\n  As a Senator from Minnesota, I would like to thank all of the FSA \npeople for all of their work. It is incredible. We are getting pretty \nclose in Minnesota to asking for an emergency declaration by the \nPresident. We are not asking for the declaration because of a tornado, \nnot because of a flood, not because of a hurricane, but because of \nrecord low prices that are driving people out. We are arguing that this \nis a food scarcity crisis for our country.\n  A case worker in northwest Minnesota is working to strike a deal with \nFSA to take a mortgage on a 16-acre building site, which is all these \nfolks\n\n[[Page S10886]]\n\nhave left. By doing this, she was hoping to encumber the land so the \nIRS couldn't force these folks to take out a loan against their home.\n  Since the family did not complete FSA forms in a timely manner, they \nno longer qualify for any kind of servicing action with FSA except for \na straight cash settlement. According to the case worker, since the \nfamily filed bankruptcy 2 years ago, no bank will touch them. So they \ncouldn't borrow against their home if they decided on this option. As \nthings stand now, foreclosure on the land is proceeding; and debt \nsettlement proceedings are continuing with the IRS, and at a very slow \nand difficult pace.\n  It appears this family's only hope is at the mercy of the IRS and to \nlet the IRS do whatever they want to them for another 4 years. Their \nwages are already being garnished while judgment on the home site is \npending, until they can file bankruptcy again to get rid of the huge \nIRS tax debt. In the meantime, they work for $8 an hour, out of which \nthey lose 25 percent on the IRS garnishment. They live in their home \nthat the IRS values at $30,000, and this includes the 16-acre building \nsite. They drive vehicles that are in such poor condition it is a daily \nquestion of whether they will even make it out of the driveway.\n  This is what is happening to people.\n  This year Minnesota ranks the highest in the Nation in understaffed \nFSA employees. Around 6,000 and I have seen more; this is the most \nconservative estimate, farms are predicted to go out of existence this \nyear. About 10 percent of farmers are predicted to go out in Minnesota \nthis year, and the number of farmers going out in northwest Minnesota \nwill be much higher. People are going to go under if we continue this \nfailed policy. I don't even see any opportunities. I see a game plan to \nbring to the floor legislation on which we can't offer amendments. That \nwould basically block us from being able to come to the floor and say: \nWe have some ideas about how we could change farm policy so people \ncould get a decent price, so they and their families can earn a decent \nliving.\n\n  The reason I am on the floor today and I know this is inconvenient to \nother Senators, is because it is my job to fight for people in my \nState. All of us do that. I am saying I want some assurance that we \nwill have the opportunity to come out with amendments on legislation to \nchange farm policy. All of us. That is point 1.\n  The second point is, I certainly want to sound the alarm. I want to \nsay to farmers and rural citizens in our States that are agriculture \nStates: Put the pressure on. Don't let the Senate adjourn without \ntaking action.\n  Don't let people say: We will do these appropriations bills; and we \nare out of here. That is not acceptable given what is happening to \npeople. That would be the height of irresponsibility.\n  John Doe 4 from Thief River Falls, MN, this is another story of a \nfather and his son. The bank forced the liquidation last year and there \nwas not enough collateral to cover old loans. The father had never \nmortgaged the home quarter, thinking that if nothing else, they would \nalways have a place to live. As it turns out, the liquidation has \ncaused a major tax liability which they cannot pay. The father is ill \nand in his 70s, surviving on Social Security payments. The son is \nworking at an $8-an-hour job that leaves little left to pay bills. \nCurrently, the IRS and the bank are fighting it out to see who gets to \nput a lien on the father's home quarter and his home. This man was once \na respected leader in his community. After all that has happened now, \nthere isn't much left but bitterness in his heart and a future of \npoverty and destitution.\n  I can see the reaction of some people saying: Well, isn't this so \nsad.\n  Don't be so callous. Let's not be so generous with other people's \nsuffering. I do not believe we should ignore these families, these \nstories, these lives, this crisis.\n  One more time, I think the end is really rather important. Currently, \nthe IRS and the bank are fighting it out to see who gets to put a lien \non the father's home quarter and his home. This man was once a \nrespected leader in the community. After all that has happened now, \nthere isn't much left but bitterness in his heart and a future of \npoverty and destitution.\n  John Doe 5. For anyone who might be watching right now, as opposed to \nbefore, the ``John Doe'' is because I am not using the names of \nfamilies. These are people who have given me stories of their lives, \nwhat is happening to them, because they hope that if we can talk about \nthis in the Senate and make it clear that we will fight for people, \nthat it will make a difference. It is hard for people to have somebody \ntalking about them in public.\n  Here is another story of two families trying to hold on to the farm, \nstill clinging to hope as their farm crumbles. They applied for an FSA \nloan guarantee, and FSA managed to process the loan for the bank. They \nare now proceeding with restructuring. However, some of the family \nmembers have become very nervous about the large debt that needs to be \nrefinanced and things have begun to fall apart.\n  As it stands now, the two families have decided to abandon the FSA \nloan and have laid out a partial liquidation plan with the bank. The \nbank wants the families to sign a plan, agreeing to a formal and \ninflexible liquidation schedule. The family was hoping to work things \nout more informally to accommodate tax consequences and adjust for \nseasonal livestock prices, as their assets are sold. At this point, the \nfamilies are not sure the bank will agree and are waiting, hoping, and \npraying that they will make it through.\n\n  Again, the problem with this particular situation, as in all these \nstories, is these are people who can't cash-flow. They are just trying \nto hold on. That is what this is all about.\n  Farmer suicides are one of the deepest tragedies of our Nation's farm \ncrisis. For many men and women, the grueling daily battle against \ncircumstances beyond their control rips away at their spirits. They are \nhaunted that they may be the ones who lose possession of the lands that \ntheir great, great grandparents homesteaded and that their grandparents \nheld on to during the darkest days of the Great Depression. That is \nwhat people feel. This tragedy is made all the more haunting and real \nin this letter left by a young farmer, the father of a 6-year-old and a \n3-year-old. He committed suicide July 26.\n  After 6 years of hard work and heroic efforts, he knew that \nbankruptcy was inevitable. He listened to the failing crop prices on \nthe radio report one last time, and he killed himself. His widow made \nparts of the suicide letter public in an attempt to show the \ndesperation that is gripping farmers throughout rural America. In \nreleasing the letter, she explained that the farm had been in the \nfamily for over 100 years. It was the land where her husband was born, \nworked, dreamed, and died. From the letter:\n\n       Farming has brought me a lot of memories, some happy but \n     most of all grief. The grief has finally won out, the low \n     prices, bills piling up, just everything. The kids deserve \n     better and so do you. All I ever wanted was to farm since I \n     was a little kid and especially this place. I know now that \n     it's never going to happen. I don't blame anybody but myself \n     for sticking around farming for as long as I have. That's why \n     you have to get away with the kids from this and me. I'm just \n     a failure at everything it seems like. They finally won.\n\n  I think it is worth reading again. There are some people in northwest \nMinnesota, Willard Brunelle and others, who are involved in what \nbasically they call Suicide Watch. I think in the last month, Willard \nsaid they have paid something like 30 or 40 visits over a month or the \nlast 2 months, if one can imagine. So the letter that the husband \nleaves to the wife:\n\n       Farming has brought me a lot of memories, some happy but \n     most of all grief. The grief has finally won out, the low \n     prices, bills piling up, just everything. The kids deserve \n     better and so do you. All I ever wanted was to farm since I \n     was a little kid and especially this place. I know now that \n     it's never going to happen. I don't blame anybody but myself \n     for sticking around farming as long as I have. That's why you \n     have to get away with the kids from this and me. I'm just a \n     failure at everything it seems like. They finally won.\n\n  By way of apology to my colleagues for, in a way, bringing the Senate \nto a standstill for a little while, one of the reasons I do so, in \naddition to the reasons I have mentioned, is that when I was a college \nteacher in Northfield, MN, I became involved with a lot of the farmers, \nI guess in the early 1970s, but in the mid-1980s, I did a lot of work \nwith farmers, a lot of organizing with farmers.\n\n[[Page S10887]]\n\n  (Mr. BURNS assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. There are several friends of mine who took their \nlives. There were a number of suicides. We had all of these \nforeclosures, and I used to sit in with farmers and block those \nforeclosures. It was always done with nonviolence and dignity.\n  I am emotional about what is now going on. I probably need to go back \nand forth between serious and not so serious, since I am taking some \ntime to talk. I remember that in the mid-1980s, in the State of \nMinnesota, many people were losing their farms. This is where they not \nonly lived but where they worked. These farmers didn't have much hope \nand didn't have any empowering explanation as to what was happening to \nthem or how they could fight this. It became fertile ground for the \npolitics of hatred.\n  The Chair and I don't agree on issues, but I respect the Chair. I \ndon't think we engage in this type of politics. But that was really \nvicious politics of hatred, of scapegoating. When I say \n``scapegoating,'' it was anti-Semitic, and all the rest. I am Jewish. I \nam the son of a Jewish immigrant who fled persecution in Russia. My \ngood friends told me one story about Minnesota and that I should stop \norganizing because these groups were kind of precursors to an armed \nmilitia. When you are five-five-and-a-half, you don't listen to that. I \nwent out and spoke at a gathering in a town we call Alexandria, MN. The \nChair knows our State. I finished speaking at this farm gathering, and \nthis big guy came up to me and he said, ``What nationality are you?'' I \nsaid, ``American.'' I thought, what is going on here? I hadn't \nmentioned being Jewish in this talk.\n  He said, ``Where are your parents from?'' No, he said, ``Where were \nyou born?'' I said, ``Washington, DC.'' He said, ``Where are your \nparents from?'' I said, ``My father was born in the Ukraine and fled \npersecution. My mother's family was from the Ukraine, but she was born \nand raised on the Lower East Side of New York City.'' He said, ``Then \nyou are a Jew.''\n  I tensed up. I mean, I was ready for whatever was going to come next. \nI said, ``Yes, I am.'' He stuck out this big hand and he said, ``Buddy, \nI am a Finn, and we minorities have to struggle together.'' That is one \nof the many reasons I have come to love Minnesota.\n  I think what is happening right now in our farm communities and in \nour rural communities is far more serious than in the mid-1980s. This \nis an economic convulsion. We are acting in the Senate and House as if \nit is business as usual.\n  Greenbush, MN, Jane Doe 6. Here is another problem case where there \nis not enough collateral to cover all creditors. In a usual situation, \nFSA has a first mortgage and the bank is in a second position. A good \nportion of the land is going into CRP, but FSA, or the bank, will not \nlend the family money to get it established. Even with the CRP \npayments, there will not be enough money to pay off all the debt by the \nend of contract. The family is looking to liquidate the farm now and \ntake their licking up front. If they do this, the bank will lose more \nmoney than if the family decided to keep the land and CRP. The bank is \nthreatening to try to get the family's truck, their only source of \nincome and equity.\n  These folks are in their sixties and would like to get the matter \nbehind them. They still hope to build up some retirement where they \nstill have their health and they can work. They are not building up any \nretirement.\n  The toughest question for me to answer is when farmers say: I am \nburning up all my equity. I am literally burning up my equity to try to \nkeep going. I have a question for you, Senator Wellstone, or it could \nbe for any of us. A farmer states, ``I am willing to do this. I have \nnothing in my savings, no retirement. I have nothing. Do I have any \nfuture? Am I going to get a decent price? Because if I don't have any \nfuture, I should get out now. But I want to have a future; I want to \nfarm. The farm has been in my family for generations. I want my \nchildren to have a chance to farm.''\n\n  Well, you know, I want to be able to answer yes. But I think the \nSenate and the House of Representatives, are going to have to take some \naction. As it currently looks, we will have a financial assistance \npackage that doesn't do the job. It has to be better. We certainly have \nto have disaster relief in it, and I will insist on the floor of the \nSenate again.\n  As I look to some of these AMTA payments, too much of it is going to \ngo to people who don't need it that much. Not enough will go to people \nwho do need the assistance. But we have to get this out to people. That \nonly enables people to live in order to farm another day. But it \ndoesn't tell people where they are the following year, and years to \nfollow. The farmers in Minnesota, in the heartland, the farmers in the \nSouth, the farmers in our country are not interested in, year after \nyear after year, hanging on the question of whether there is going to \nbe some emergency assistance for them. They are interested in getting \nsome more power as producers so they can have some leverage in the \nmarketplace; so they can have a decent price; so they can earn a decent \nliving; so they can give their children the care they need and deserve. \nThat is not too much to ask for.\n  When I talk about raising the loan rate for a decent price, we must \nalso tie a safety net piece with antitrust legislation. We need both \npolicies. One of the amendments I will bring to the floor is that we \nshould have a moratorium on these acquisitions and mergers. We must \ncall for a moratorium right now on these big companies until we take a \nserious look at real antitrust action. Now, it is true that the \nCargills, the ConAgras, the IBPs, the ADMs and all the rest are the big \nplayers, the heavy hitters. They are the investors. They make big \ncontributions. A lot of these family farmers who I am talking about in \nMinnesota, and in the other States I visited, are certainly in no \nposition to make big contributions. So to whom does the Senate belong? \nDoes it belong to these big packers? Are we the Senate for ADM, or for \nConAgra, or for Cargill? Or are we a Senate that still belongs to \nfamily farmers and rural people?\n  In this particular case and I am sorry to have to formulate it this \nway, but do you know what? It is an accurate formulation. Some people \nwho benefit might like low prices for family farmers. But those are not \nfamily farmers. We have to take some action.\n  This is Jane Doe 7, from Thief River Falls, MN. Northwest Minnesota \nhas been hit by too much rain. Farmers were not even able to put in \nmuch of their crop. We have had crop disease and record low prices. We \ncan't do anything about the weather, but we can do something about \nrecord low prices, can we not, colleagues? Does anybody think we should \nstay the course any longer? How many farmers have to go under? How many \nsmall businesses in our rural communities have to go under? How much \nmore pain does there have to be?\n  What are we waiting for?\n  My State of northwest Minnesota is really hard hit. I have been to so \nmany gatherings. I started out the August break in northwest Minnesota \nwith Congressman Collin Peterson. Congressman Peterson is from the \nSeventh Congressional District. During that time touring farms in \nnorthwest Minnesota, in spite of all that farmers are going through, \ngave me hope, and gave me fight. This is the way in which the farmers \nkeep me going because I thought to myself: I am going to go out there \nand Paul, even if you are full of indignation, and you think what is \nhappening to the producers is just unconscionable, if we have these \ngatherings at Thief River Falls, Crookston, or wherever, and only 10 \nfarmers show up, then what that means is a lot of people just want to \nthrow in the towel.\n  We had these gatherings. Congressman Peterson and I had these \ngatherings together. I am telling you that anywhere from 125 to maybe \n400 farmers showed up at a time. They were showing up not because I was \nthere. It had nothing to do with me. It had to do with the reality of \ntheir lives. It is the desperation of their lives. They came to make a \nplea and to say: Please change the farm policy. We can't cash-flow with \nthese prices. Please do something.\n  But the really good part is they came because they still had some \nfight in them.\n  Then we built up and organized in Minnesota to the Rural Crisis Unity \nDay; didn't we, Jodi? Jodi Niehoff was there with me from Melrose, MN. \nShe is the daughter of a dairy farmer. We\n\n[[Page S10888]]\n\ntraveled around the State. We had a Rural Crisis Unity Day. I do not \nknow how many people were there, but it was just a huge gathering at \nthe Carver County Fairground. It was great.\n  What was great about it was we had half the Minnesota delegation \nthere. That is a start.\n  What these farmers were saying, what these bankers were saying, and \nwhat these business people were saying is: We don't want you to stay \nthe course. We want you to change the course because on present course \nwe are going to lose our farms and lose our businesses. That is going \nto affect our schools and our hospitals. We want you to be sensitive to \nwhat is going on.\n  Why are we in the Senate so generous with the pain of other people? \nWhy do we think we have so many other things to do that are more \nimportant than changing farm policy for these family farmers so these \nfamily farmers can survive?\n  What these farmers are now saying is: Can we have a rally?\n  What next? The reason I am taking some time on the floor of the \nSenate right now is to say what next? We demand the opportunity to be \nable to bring legislation to the floor to change this policy. That is \nwhat I am fighting for. That is what is next.\n  Emergency financial assistance has to be passed. But then there is \ngetting the loan rate up for the price. Then there will be the \nmoratorium proposal on these acquisitions and mergers, Smithfield and \nMurphy being the latest. It is unbelievable. It is an insult.\n  When I took economics classes, I was taught when you had four firms \nthat dominated over 50 percent of the market, it was an oligarchy at \nbest, and a monopoly at worst.\n  But I will tell you something. I will keep talking about these \nfarmers and what is happening to them. But I will tell you this: It is \na matter of needing to take some action now. I am going to do \neverything I know how as a United States Senator, and everything I know \nhow to do, to make sure before we leave that we have an honest and a \nthorough debate about agricultural policy. I intend a debate with \nSenators coming to the floor and bringing forth proposals as to how we \ncan improve this policy so that the family farmers in my State of \nMinnesota have a chance. But also let's not sound like a speech on the \nfloor of the Senate. I don't have any illusions that it is a tough \nfight. I said it earlier.\n  In all due respect, a few of these grain companies and a few of these \npackers are the giants. These are the heavy hitters. These are the \npeople who seem to count today in politics. The sooner we change this \nrotten system of financing campaigns, the better off we will all be.\n  But what I am picking up on is I think we will be back. First, we \nwill have this vote. We all are accountable. If we change things for \nthe better, great.\n  Senators, do you want to raise the loan rate to get prices up? Do you \nwant to pass antitrust action to give our producers and consumers some \nprotections? Great. But we will have a debate, and we will have a vote.\n  If you vote against it, and you do not have proposals that make any \ndifference, then I will just say this: I think you will see farmers and \nrural people back in your State. They will put the pressure on. If \nnothing changes in the next month or so, I hope, frankly, in my State \nof Minnesota that I will see after harvest and after Thanksgiving \ndebate. Thanksgiving would be a good time to do it, before Hanukkah and \nChristmas. That would be a good time to talk about the moral dimensions \nof this crisis.\n  I see the religious community across the board in our metropolitan \nareas bringing family farmers to our urban communities to meet with \npeople who do not live in rural America to have a dialog, with plenty \nof media coverage, to again bring to the attention of the Nation what \nis happening. Because I think one of our challenges is people sort of \nfind it hard to believe. They say: Well, Senator Wellstone, you are out \nhere on the floor, and you all are talking about this crisis, but the \neconomy is booming while we have this depression in agriculture.\n  We need to talk about the depth of the crisis, and also all the ways \nin which this affects America. We don't want a few people to own all \nthe land. We don't want these conglomerates to muscle their way to the \ndinner table and control our whole food industry, all the way from the \nseed to the grocery shelf. We don't want to have these big factory farm \noperations. You can see it in some of these huge hog feed lot \noperations right now, which are so polluting and so disrespectful of \nthe land and the air and the water. As a Catholic bishop said 15 years \nago, ``We are all but strangers and guests in this land.'' We are here \nto make a better, maybe not Heaven on Earth, but a better Earth on \nEarth.\n  Do you think that these conglomerates, when they become farmers and \nmake all the decisions, that they will have any respect for the \ncommunities? Do you think they are going to buy in the communities? Do \nyou think they are going to have any respect for the land, the water, \nand for the environment? Do we really want, with such a precious item \nas food, to see this kind of concentration of power? It is absolutely \nfrightening.\n\n  I am a Midwesterner though born in Washington, DC, and attended \nschool at the University of North Carolina, but we have lived in \nMinnesota and our children have grown up there, as have our \ngrandchildren. I have had a chance to do some travel in the South. It \nis the same. I remember going to Lubbock, TX. At farms down there, we \nheard the producers speak. It is different crops, but everything else \nis the same. They are talking about cotton, rice, peanuts. It is the \nsame thing; they can't make a living.\n  Everywhere I go, I get a chance to speak and meet with farmers and \ntheir families. People come up to speak; I hear a voice that says: \nThanks for coming, Senator; thank you for sharing. I turn around to \nshake hands and see whoever made those remarks crying. I see people \nwith tears in their eyes.\n  How would you feel if you were going to lose everything? How would \nyou feel if this were where you lived, this were where you worked, this \nwere a farm that had been in your family for generations? It is so \npainful. It is so painful.\n  Maybe this is the definition of being a bleeding-heart liberal. Maybe \nthat is what I epitomize here. But I don't think so. I am a liberal, \nbut that has nothing to do with bleeding-heart liberal. It does have to \ndo with me being a Senator from the State of Minnesota. I am a Senator \nfrom an agricultural State. I am a Senator who comes from a State with \na thriving metropolitan area, Minneapolis-St. Paul and suburbs--a great \nplace to live. I am a Senator from Minnesota, and the other part of our \nState is in economic pain. I am not going to be in the Senate while so \nmany of these farmers go under, are spat out of the economy, chopped \ninto pieces, without fighting like heck.\n  I have some leverage as a Senator that I can exert, I can focus on. I \ncan call for a debate and insist on a debate. I have so many colleagues \nwho care so much about this. I wish I knew agriculture as well as some \nof them. I know it pretty well. Some of the Senators are immersed in \nit. Senator Daschle, our leader--I hear him speak all the time because \nhe is a leader of the Democrats. When he talks about agriculture, it is \ncompletely different. We can see it is from the heart and soul. Senator \nHarkin, ranking minority member of the Senate Agriculture Committee--\nnobody cares more; no one is tougher; no one is more of a fighter. Both \nSenators from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan and Senator Conrad--Senator \nConrad always has graphs, charts, and figures; he is just great with \nnumbers. He knows this quantitatively and knows it every other way. \nSenator Dorgan is on the floor all the time. Senator Johnson from South \nDakota is unpretentious. He cares for people. It is great to have a \nMember like that in the Senate.\n  I get sick of the bashing of public service. There are so many good \npeople. Senator Grassley from Iowa--we don't agree on everything, but \nwe had a hearing, that Senator Grassley and Senator Harkin were kind \nenough to invite me to in Iowa, dealing with the whole question of \nconcentration of power. Senator Grassley asked a lot of tough questions \nabout what is going on with all the mergers and acquisitions. There is \nSenator Blanche Lincoln. When she speaks abut agriculture, it is \nunbelievable. It is her life, her farm, her family. There is nothing \nabstract about this to\n\n[[Page S10889]]\n\nher. Or Senator Landrieu who was at our gathering today.\n  It is Midwest; it is South.\n  Senator Roberts from Kansas--I don't agree with him, but he cares. He \nis a capable Senator. Senator Lugar, who I think is one of the Senators \nwho knows the most about foreign affairs, I do not agree with him on \nthis policy question, but you can't find a better Senator.\n  I am not here to bash Senators; I am out here to say that I think \nthis institution, the Senate, is on trial in rural America. This \ninstitution cannot afford to turn its gaze away from what is happening \nin rural America, to put family farmers and rural people in parentheses \nand act as if that isn't happening. We can't afford to do this.\n\n  I come to the floor of the Senate today to make a plea for action. I \ncome to the floor of the Senate today to say I am going to be coming to \nthe floor of the Senate in these mini filibusters. I call it a ``mini'' \nfilibuster because I don't have that good of a back. If I had a good \nback, I could go for many more hours. I cannot stand for that long. As \nsoon as I sit down, I lose the privilege to speak. However, I can come \nto the floor of the Senate several long hours at a time and keep \ninsisting that, A, we have the opportunity to be out here with \nlegislation to address this crisis in agriculture--that is not an \nunreasonable request, I say to the majority leader--and, B, to make it \ncrystal clear that I will do everything I can to prevent the Senate \nfrom adjourning. I say this to my legislative director. We should not \nadjourn until we take this action.\n  Jane Doe, Thief River Falls, MN: Multiple years of bad weather and \npoor prices have destroyed the cash flow in this farming operation. The \nfamily put much of the land into CRP--the Conservation Reserve \nProgram--to make payment to creditors. A couple of years ago, the hay \nmarket was good and the family decided to put the balance into alfalfa. \nSince then, prices for hay have fallen substantially and again bad \ngrain greatly reduced the quality of the hay produced, thereby making \nit more difficult to sell. The family is hoping for some relief through \ntheir crop insurance. If their crop insurance fails, they will have to \nsell some of the land to pay down debt before the entire farm is lost.\n  This is a case of an older couple trying to help their son continue \nthe farming operation and it slipped away from them. The father \nborrowed on his real estate to help his son get established and used \nhis pension as collateral. He needed additional funds, so he borrowed \nagain on the real estate and used his Social Security check as \ncollateral. Bad weather and poor prices again took their toll. This \ntime he borrowed on his cattle and machinery, using it to refinance the \nfarming operation. In the meantime, with no income left on which to \nlive, the parents were forced to use credit cards to finance their \nfamily living. The amount accumulated to about $25,000 on a number of \ncredit cards. The family is no longer able to keep up with the payments \nto the card companies. They have gotten together and decided that \nliquidation is the only solution.\n  Some of the land has been sold and they are working with the two \nbanks to reduce payments to free up some money on which to live day to \nday until the remaining land can be sold. The cattle and machinery will \nbe sold next year. In the meantime, the parents, who are well in their \n70s, are having some health problems. Steps are being taken to get the \ncounty nursing services involved to address their medical needs.\n  I will make a couple of different points, as long as we are talking \nabout nursing homes. This is a slight deviation, but I think it is all \ninterrelated when we are talking about rural America. Because of this \nBudget Act that we passed 2 years ago, with these caps, we are now in a \nsituation where the Medicare reimbursement is so low that it is \nliterally going to shut down many of our rural hospitals, including \nthose in my State of Minnesota. I did not vote for it. I am glad I did \nnot. But the point is, it does not matter.\n  As long as we are talking about a family with this kind of pain, here \nis another thing that hasn't been mentioned. The home health care \nservices and the hospitals in our rural communities, especially in \nthose States that kept costs down, such as Minnesota, are now being \npenalized for having kept costs down. Because we don't have any fat in \nour system, the Medicare reimbursement is way below the cost of \nproviding care, and guess what, you don't have to be a rocket scientist \nto know that many of the citizens in our rural communities are elderly, \nespecially since fewer and fewer of our young people can farm and live \nin the communities.\n  I was at a meeting yesterday with Senator Moynihan in his office. He \nbrought together a number of Senators to talk about this. From teaching \nhospitals to nursing homes to our rural hospitals to home health care, \nwe have seen the equivalent of Draconian cuts in reimbursement, and \nthey cannot go on. What a bitter irony. We have young people in our \nrural communities who cannot look to a future as family farmers \nbecause, one, they cannot afford to farm because of this failed policy, \nwhat many farmers call not Freedom to Farm but ``farming for free.'' \nTwo, as they think about whether they want to live in our rural \ncommunities, the second question besides ``Can I afford to?'' is ``Do I \nwant to?'' When there isn't good health care and hospitals shut down \nand there isn't a good school system and there aren't small businesses, \nyou don't want to live in the community. That is what is going on.\n  Why am I out here? Why am I engaged in a filibuster right now? \nBecause a lot of the small towns in my State of Minnesota are going to \nbecome ghost towns if something isn't done. That is a fact. They are \ngoing to become ghost towns. So it seems to me it is important for the \nSenate to address this question.\n  Jane Doe 8, from Greenbush, MN: I say to my colleague, the Senator \nfrom Kentucky, I say Jane Doe and John Doe because people don't want \ntheir names being used. I don't blame them. We are talking about \npeople's lives. But these people did want others to know what is \nhappening to them because these farm families in my State of Minnesota \nbelieve if Senators know what is happening to them, understand the \ndimensions of this crisis, that the Senate will take action to change \nthings for the better. You know what? Some people will have a cynical \nsmile on their face and say: How naive. I say: Good for the people. \nThey should continue to believe if we only understand what is happening \nto them we will make things better. That is what citizens should \nbelieve. That is what citizens should believe. My only prayer is that \nwe do make things better.\n\n  Jane Doe 8, Greenbush, MN: This family tried to split its farming \noperation from the locker plant business because both were going under. \nHowever, the family did not qualify for a rural development loan and \nthe bank was not willing to wait to see if the Small Business \nAdministration could be brought into the picture. The bank is currently \nworking on the liquidation, and the family is trying to salvage what \nthey can of their home and building site.\n  I have, in addition to Minnesota, some Farm Aid stories as well. Jane \nDoe 9, from Felton, MN: This is a farmer who is voluntarily liquidating \nhis grain and sugar beet operation. He sold off much of his beet stock \nto reduce debt but was hoping to get lenders to hold off on a machinery \nauction until next year because of the taxes he will have to pay on the \nsugar beet stock. The lenders are refusing, citing concerns of \ndecreasing machinery values due to all the auction sales in that area. \nUnless he can find another lender to pay off the current nervous \nlender, this farmer will incur a major tax problem and may be forced to \nsell some of his land in order to pay the taxes he owes from other \nforced sales he has had to make.\n  This is a father and son operation in which they are trying to \ntransfer the farm to the son at market value and leave the remaining \ndebt with the father. This is a situation where there is more debt than \nthe farm is worth. In addition, the father's spouse has Alzheimer's \ndisease and is currently in a nursing home. If the farm can be \ntransferred to the son at market value, there is hope to make the \noperation viable and he could thereby support his parents as best he \ncould. The father would be destitute and would have to try to work some \nkind of debt settlement out with FSA and other lenders.\n\n[[Page S10890]]\n\n  This is a simple case of voluntary liquidation. This is a story of a \nfairly new farm couple who was farming in partnership with the \nhusband's uncle. The husband suffered a farm accident which has \nrendered his right arm useless. The couple recently went through a \nliquidation plan. Fortunately, the couple had not acquired much debt \nand they will get out. In this situation, the couple was determining \noptions toward liquidation on their farm because they could see no way \nto continue farming their operation.\n  The primary concern of the couple was to be able to keep their home \nand building site. The couple has a number of outstanding bills from \ncreditors yet to be paid one of the companies has filed a lien as well \nas debt with FSA and a local bank. Only about a third of the cropland \nwas planted this spring due to wet conditions. The current plan is to \nwait until October to take any further servicing action. What little \ncrop the couple harvests will go toward paying off the debt.\n  Both the wife and husband are working other jobs off the farm, as \nwell as doing the existing farm operations after their work. They also \nfarm the husband's parents' land. Should they decide to quit, this \ncreates questions as to how his parents are going to make their debt \npayments and have any income to live on. This couple will have to wait \nuntil October and then assess the situation after the harvest.\n  Jane Doe 10 from Thief River Falls, MN. The farm is already \nliquidated and, in doing so, created a serious tax consequence with \nwhich she is now trying to deal. She used the farm wrap program to help \ncover CPA work as she negotiates with IRS and the State of Minnesota. \nAt this moment, there is not much to do except wait and let the chips \nfall where they may.\n  (Mr. VOINOVICH assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have some letters. We had Farm Aid \nthis weekend in Manassas. There were a number of people there. Willie \nNelson, of course, has been doing this for years. He was joined by Neil \nYoung and John Mellencamp and many other artists and many other \nfarmers. The most important thing about this, and I give them all the \ncredit in the world, is not only the money they raised to help farmers, \nbut this time they really put a focus on this crisis. They are not \nJohnny-come-lately. They have been at this for any number of years. \nThey were talking about the need to change farm policy:\n\n       Dear Willie Nelson and Farm Aid: My father has been a \n     rancher and farmer all his life.\n\n  Before I do this, let me say, again, these are going to be letters \nfrom all around the country that go to the heart of what is going on, \nbut, because of a bad back, I probably will be finishing up relatively \nsoon. Hopefully, this is just the beginning of pushing as hard as I \ncan.\n  My wife Sheila and I were at the Farm Aid. It was very moving because \none can only really appreciate it when musicians and artists care about \npeople and are willing to donate their talents. Also, there were a lot \nof farmers there. Again, I will tell you this is the most emotional \nthing for me since I have been in the Senate. This is the most \nemotional experience I have had, seeing what people have been going \nthrough.\n  I say to the Chair now, the Senator from Ohio, for the last several \nhours I have been going through stories of families, many who want to \nbe anonymous, but it is their economic situation. They cannot cash-flow \non these prices. They cannot. What I have been saying each time there \nis a new Presiding Officer--I get to make a plea to the new Presiding \nOfficer--what I have been saying is that I am not arrogant, and there \ncan be different proposals, but we cannot leave here without having the \ndebate and some amendments and legislation that hopefully will pass \nwhich will change the course, which will make the difference.\n  The status quo is unacceptable because, under status quo, we are \ngoing to have a whole generation of producers that are going to be \ngone. That is all there is to it. This will be the death knell for our \nrural communities, and I think it will be, as I have said more than \nonce in the last several hours, this will be a transition that our \nNation will deeply regret because the last thing in the world a good \nconservative Republican wants is for a few people to own all the land.\n  We want competition. We want to see our producers have some leverage \nin the marketplace so they can get a decent price. That is what this is \nall about.\n  We need antitrust action. It is interesting. I am really surprised, \nfrankly, more hasn't been made of Viacom wanting to buy CBS. That is \noverflow of information in a democracy. It is scary to have a few \ncompanies control so much.\n  Food is very precious, and we do not want a few conglomerates \nbasically controlling all of this.\n  I am moving from Minnesota to a letter to Farm Aid requesting help. \nNames are withheld:\n\n       Dear Mr. Willie Nelson and Farm Aid:\n       My father has been a rancher and a farmer all of his life. \n     He started as a teenager on his father's sheep and cattle \n     ranch in Eastern Nevada and over the years has had his share \n     of hard work and battles with drought, poor stock and crop \n     prices, bad neighbors who have tried to run him out of \n     business, the IRS, the Forest Service, the BLM (Bureau of \n     Land Management) the FHA (now FSA), etc. Those who have \n     contributed the most to his demise have been the IRS, the \n     BLM and the FSA. Drought and poor crop prices have also \n     contributed a significant blow, in the last several years, \n     to his hay farming operation which is located 50 miles \n     from Ely, Nevada, the closest town. He is single, he lives \n     alone with no family close by, he is 85 years old, his \n     health is failing, his knees are so bad he can hardly make \n     it to the mailbox which is 100 feet from the house. His \n     wife left him a few years ago, after 25 years of marriage \n     just for reasons associated with his prostate operation. \n     He was involved several years ago in a hay bailer accident \n     which rendered his left arm useless. He struggles to eke \n     out a meager living from a 600-acre alfalfa hay farm with \n     the help of two Mexicans, which now he no longer can pay \n     and had to let go. Without their help he cannot harvest \n     his hay. He used to own 750 acres of alfalfa, but the \n     FSA--\n\n  By the way, these are letters, not positions I am taking. This is \nwhat people are saying--\n\n     left him with 600 acres and without justification would not \n     loan him the funds to replace a caved in water well which \n     feeds 160 acres of the 600 left. Last year the bottom fell \n     out of the hay market and he was forced to sell his hay at an \n     enormous loss. This left him with no funds to grow or harvest \n     the hay this year or pay all of his bills. He gets $500 a \n     month from Social Security, most of which goes for drugs and \n     medical care and has been forced to borrow money from family \n     to feed himself.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent the testimony from this concert be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          Letters to Farm Aid\n\n                                               September 10, 1999.\n       Dear Mr. Willie Nelson and Farm Aid: My father * * * has \n     been a rancher and farmer all of his life. He started as a \n     teenager on his fathers sheep and cattle ranch in Eastern, \n     Nevada and over the years has had his share of hard work and \n     battles with drought, poor stock and crop prices, bad \n     neighbors who have tried to run him out of business, the IRS, \n     the Forest Service, the BLM (Bureau of Land Management), the \n     FHA (now the FSA), etc. Those who have contributed the most \n     to his demise have been the IRS, the BLM and the FSA.

($110/ton hay for \n     $40/ton). This left him with no funds to grow or harvest the \n     hay this year or pay all of his bills. He gets $500 a month \n     from Social Security, most of which goes for drugs and \n     medical care and has been forced to borrow money from family \n     to feed himself.\n       Day by day he sits at home waiting and hoping for a lucky \n     break while the US Government (FSA) prepares to repossess all \n     that he has left in life. Interestingly enough, it was US \n     Government agricultural policies and the Federal Bureau of \n     Land Management\n\n[[Page S10891]]\n\n     that put him where he is today, like hundreds of other \n     farmers.\n       He suffers from depression (I wonder why), but will not \n     leave the farm and refuses to declare bankruptcy because he \n     believes that money will come from somewhere to help him get \n     back on his feet.\n       Frankly, he needs to retire, but he has no other place he \n     wants to go. We have been hoping that he could find a buyer \n     for the place who would pay off the debts and allow him to \n     stay on the place as long as he wants, as a caretaker. In \n     fact, if he could get his debts paid off, he could lease the \n     land to neighboring farmers for enough to survive on.\n       Please consider his case and help him anyway you can. We \n     have done as much for him as our finances will allow.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Help for him is urgent. He was told by the FSA that he had \n     until the end of August, 1999, last month before they would \n     take any action. The absolute deadline, I presume is October \n     31st of this year. He is currently seeking help from an \n     accountant and consultant (whom he cannot afford). If you \n     like you may contact * * *. In fact, it may be to my father's \n     advantage for you to channel any financial aid you can give, \n     through * * *. * * * could give you the most accurate and up \n     to date appraisal of his circumstances and debt load.\n       Thank you for listening. Please help.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Farm Aid: My name is * * * and I am writing to request \n     help for my Father's Farm. My Father is a Vietnam Era Veteran \n     and a corn/soybean/livestock farmer in dire need of \n     assistance. After years of poor prices, the farm economy has \n     finally caught up to him. My Father is too proud to ask for \n     assistance from an organization like Farm Aid, but I thought \n     I would send a note in hopes someone may be able to give him \n     some help or guidance.\n       My Father was a member of the Illinois National Guard from \n     1965-1971. He was not sent to Vietnam, however, his ``Unit'' \n     (I may be using the wrong terminology.) was in a group \n     destined for Vietnam had the War gone on longer. (Much like \n     the guard troops sent to Desert Storm.) He was Honorably \n     Discharged.\n       My family farm is located in Central Illinois in a small \n     town called Chatsworth, Illinois. My family has owned the \n     farm my Father currently farms for approximately 80 years. My \n     Dad is fourth generation, so that takes it back to my great-\n     grandfather. We farm approximately 650 acres tillable and \n     plant corn and soybeans. (250 from the family farm, 250 \n     rented, 150 recently purchased. Note: My uncle also farms a \n     portion of the old family place.)\n       In addition to the tillable acreage, we have approximately \n     175 acres of pasture land. We graze approximately 125 head of \n     beef cattle. We also have 50-100 feeder pigs at any one time \n     during the year.\n       My Dad has been running the farm for the past eighteen \n     years. Like most other farmers, he works 365 days a year. He \n     has taken 2 vacation days in the past 18 years and has maybe \n     had 1 sick day. He loves what he does, although you would \n     never hear him say it that way. I love what he does and what \n     he stands for and what the family farming way of life is \n     about.\n       He's a strong man, so outwardly he doesn't let it show when \n     times get tough. I'm not so strong, and it tears me up inside \n     to see how hard he and other farmers work and then lose \n     everything. This way of life is so grand, so important to the \n     fabric of our great nation, that we can't let it die.\n       Everyone knows the hardships farmers have endured in recent \n     years. My Father's story is no different than many, I \n     suppose. Bottom line is, he doesn't receive a fair price for \n     his product and he can't pay his operating costs/land \n     payments. Not unlike almost all other family farmers, he \n     makes it year by year with loans from the local banks. This \n     year may be different, however. The banks have not said they \n     will foreclose, but they are leaning heavily in that \n     direction.\n       It is at this point that I swallow my pride and ask for \n     assistance. I don't know what anyone can do for us. We follow \n     Farm Aid. We contribute to Farm Aid. We know Farm Aid and \n     people like yourself are there for family farmers. We aren't \n     quite sure how to access the help network though. I know \n     though I can't bear to see my Father's livelihood go by the \n     wayside.\n       So, if you could, either send me some information regarding \n     possible assistance or give us some direction in our time of \n     need I would sincerely appreciate it.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               September 11, 1999.\n       Dear Farm Aid: We are a dairy farm in Pennsylvania who \n     really needs your help. We tried to get your help years ago, \n     but it seems that no one in our area has ever received help \n     from your organization. We have had a serious drought here \n     this year and we have no idea how we are going to feed our \n     herd of dairy cows, let alone us getting paid. We are also \n     losing our farm to the Farm Credit mortgage company.\n       We had a sickness that affected our herd several years ago \n     and we lost a lot of our cows. When you pay $1,200-$1,500 for \n     one cow and only get $200.00 for her at the auction house, \n     you can't very well replace them when you've lost about 100 \n     of them. Then we had a drought several years back and again \n     last year and we lost about half of our crop and had to buy \n     feed again this year.\n       We are broke! And now we've had a very serious drought here \n     this year. We are in one of the hardest hit counties in \n     Pennsylvania for shortage of rain. We are still on water \n     restrictions. If you can help us in any small way, we would \n     be eternally grateful! We don't want to lose our farm.\n       My husband is 62 years old and has worked so hard all of \n     his life. This farm is our retirement. We have no pension or \n     savings or 401K or anything. We feel desperate.\n       Thank you for listening. God bless.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               September 11, 1999.\n     Re losing our farm in Idaho.\n\n       Dear Farm Aid: We got notice yesterday that the bank is \n     going to auction our 400 acre farm, including our house and \n     other buildings on Sept. 29 to get the money we still owe \n     them, which is about 140,000 dollars by the time attorney \n     fees, etc. are added in. We will lose the 267,000 dollars we \n     have already paid into this farm. Our attorney said he would \n     go to the auction to let them know that we will be exercising \n     our right of redemption. Then we are supposed to have up to a \n     year to try to get the funds to buy back our farm. In the \n     meantime, whoever buys the farm can force us to move or can \n     ask us to pay rent if we want to stay.\n       I have a couple questions I am hoping you can answer for \n     us.\n       First, we tried to get refinanced and even with our equity \n     we weren't able to because we were behind on some other bills \n     including a couple of years back property taxes. We put up \n     160 acres for sale hoping to get it sold to pay the bank but \n     it appears it is now too late for that. Do you know of anyone \n     who would be willing to talk to us about financing us or at \n     least give us some advice? Our attorney isn't very helpful \n     along those lines.\n       Second, if we have up to a year to try to get the funds \n     necessary to buy the farm back, can they actually make us \n     move off the property or do they have to wait until the year \n     is up. Our attorney says they can force us to move but \n     someone else told us about a couple of old laws that are \n     still in effect that say we can still live here. I haven't \n     researched them yet but two have to do with homestead acts \n     and another is called the Farm Husbandry Act of 1938. Do you \n     know anything about these and if they would help us at all?\n       I don't know if you can help us or if you even give out \n     advice but we are desperate to save our farm and will not \n     stop fighting until it is over. Thank you for listening.\n                                                September 8, 1999.\n       Dear Farm Aid: Hello--I am (was) a small organic farmer in \n     Southeast PA. Between developers after our land, wholesalers \n     who pay late and vandals, we had to give up. My wife and \n     parents are too ill to continue.\n       I believe in what I do but around here the financial \n     institutions favor development. I do not need financial aid \n     for survival or anything but I would like to find a lendor \n     who has faith in farmers so I can return to the land. I could \n     use some counseling. The stress of the last three years has \n     affected me a little.\n       Any advice would be helpful. Keep up the good work.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                September 8, 1999.\n       Dear Farm Aid: Hi. I am a farmers wife from the Shenandoah \n     Valley of VA. As if we had not had a bad enough year. Now we \n     are out of hay, out of water. Our spring, creek and pond have \n     dried up, and we are being forced to sell off our herd which \n     sustains us from year to year just to keep going a little \n     longer. We have gone for help like, for example, to Farm \n     Service, which we have never wanted to do before. Now we feel \n     we have no choice.\n       You know, just like the Indians were, we are a proud \n     people. Anyway, they will pay to put a well in if we come up \n     with half the cost, which only means to us that some more of \n     our cattle will have to be sold to come up with that. In \n     other words, what do we do? We need advice and we need a huge \n     miracle and I am usually the positive one.\n       Right beside us a farm was sold out from underneath us all \n     to a landdeveloper and we fought tooth and nail to keep the \n     subdivision out and yet here we are fighting again just to \n     stay afloat. Please help give us advice or whatever.\n       There is this concert this coming Sunday and I have watched \n     it on TV from the start and thought how commendable it all is \n     and now we are in the very same position as the other farmers \n     Willie and his friends have helped through the years.\n       I have written a song about us, the farmers and our plight, \n     and I want Mr. Nelson to hear it. But, more important, I want \n     to hear him and see him in person . . . how can we get in if \n     we raise the money to get there? What do we have to do? We \n     need a lift of our spirits, some reason to keep us going or \n     trying to go forward. I am sorry if I am bringing you down by \n     reading this. I did not mean to pour this all out. I guess I \n     needed to and hoped someone would understand.\n       Farming is all we know and all we want to do. Like the \n     Indians, it is coming to the point that we are being drivven \n     off our own land for the sake of so called progress. I call \n     it decay of the American way of life. I call it an American \n     tragedy of the like that has not been seen since the war \n     against the Indians of which I have a strong heritage from.\n       God help us to survive the best we know how and how to \n     think with our heart first then our head. My head tells me to \n     quit. My heart says we cannot.\n       Please let me hear from you. Please give us hope. And God \n     bless you richly for your part\n\n[[Page S10892]]\n\n     in helping the American farmer to survive another year.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                September 8, 1999.\n       Dear Farm Aid: How can I go about contacting the people who \n     help the farmers with money? I would like to get my brother-\n     in-law on the list to be helped. The drought the past 2 years \n     has killed his soybean crop and he cannot afford crop \n     insurance. He is just a small time North Mississippi farmer, \n     a former sharecropper. He is 56 and has just a 8th grade \n     education. He lives with his parents who live on social \n     security. He rents his land each year, about 50-100 acres. \n     Please let me know.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    June 24, 1999.\n       Dear Sir: My mother and father-in-law saved and borrowed \n     enough money in 1945 to buy an 80 acre farm between Fowler \n     and Quincy, ILL. They farmed with horses, milked cows, raised \n     hogs in the timbered creek bed and raised 2 children. My \n     husband has now had the farm turned over to him since his \n     parents have passed away and his sister was killed in a car \n     accident 2 years ago.\n       My husband is and has always been a very hard worker. We \n     both work at jobs full time in Quincy and farm besides. We \n     were both raised on a farm and both love farm life. We cash \n     rent 3 other farms close by to go along with ours--but we are \n     still having an awful time. If it wasn't for our jobs in town \n     we would have lost everything his parents worked so hard for \n     several years ago. We are doing all we can but just can't get \n     out of debt--in fact we are going deeper and deeper every \n     year.\n       My husband and I have shed many tears and many sleepless \n     nights trying to figure out just what to do to save our \n     family farm. We do not want to lose it.\n       Do you have any help for us or anything else we can do? We \n     lost over $20,000 again last year. It breaks my heart to see \n     my husband work so hard and get so tired working 2 jobs and \n     still not making it.\n       Please help us. If we could just break even one year things \n     would be so good. Someone surely knows a way to help us.\n       We need someone to help us with some money soon or we will \n     lose everything.\n       Thank you for listening to me and hopefully for helping my \n     husband save his deeply loved family farm.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, in the remaining time I have left--and \nI am not going to take much more time. I characterize this, as I said, \nas sort of a mini-filibuster or, in any case, it is all I can do in \nseveral hours. I can talk about this all day and all night. It is not \nthat I am at a loss of words. But physically I will not be able to go \non much longer. The best way to do this is to print in the Record this \nvery poignant testimony from Farm Aid.\n  I will jump from the last part of my presentation to a few facts and \nfigures. Maybe I will finish up on this. I will talk about market \nconcentration.\n  Four firms control 83 percent of all beef slaughter, four firms \ncontrol 73 percent of sheep slaughter, four firms control 62 percent of \nflour milling, four firms control 57 percent of pork slaughter. This is \nfrom the work of Bill Hefrin, from the University of Missouri, who does \nsuperb work.\n  This concentration will result in four or five food and fiber \nclusters that control production from the gene to the store shelf. Is \nthat what the American people want? When we get these alliances of \nMonsanto, Cargill, and all the rest, they will reduce market \nconcentration to farmers. These clusters will eliminate independent \nfarmers and businessowners. These clusters will make it difficult for \nnew firms to start. And these clusters will prevent consumers from \nrealizing lower prices.\n  Listen to this, consumer America: Since 1984, real consumer food \nprices have increased by 2.8 percent, while producer prices for that \nfood have fallen 35.7 percent. Do any of the consumers in America, do \nany families in America, feel a 35-percent drop in food prices? Of \ncourse not.\n  The farm retail spread grows wider and wider. This concentration \nthreatens global security. A few dominant multinational firms are going \nto control information, markets, decisionmaking, and seed packets. \nThere is a new technology. It is incredible when you hear about this \nterminator technology which is inserting a gene to prevent the next \ngeneration of seed from germinating which, again, threatens economic \nviability, sustainability.\n  We are talking about livestock confinement, huge feeding operations, \nwith all of the environmental challenges. We are talking about \nmultinational firms that remove profits from local communities. As I \nsaid, we have talked about this huge concentration of power.\n  For example, four of every five beef cattle are slaughtered by the \nfour largest firms: IBP; ConAgra; Excel, owned by Cargill; and Farmland \nNational Beef.\n  Three of every five hogs are slaughtered by the four largest firms. \nThe top four include Murphy, Carroll's Foods, Continental Grain, and \nSmithfield. And now Smithfield wants to buy up Murphy.\n  Half of all the broilers are slaughtered by the largest four firms. \nThe six largest are: Tyson, Gold Kist, Perdue Farms, Pilgrim's Pride, \nConAgra, and Wayne.\n  Listen, when you look at the grain industry, you have the same \nsituation where, when farmers look to whom they sell the grain, it is a \nfew large companies that dominate.\n  Let me conclude.\n  I say to my colleagues, I have come to the floor of the Senate and \nhave spoken for several hours to make a plea and to make a demand. I \nhave tried to put this farm crisis in personal terms. I thank the \nfarmers in Minnesota for letting me speak about their lives.\n  I have said that the status quo is unconscionable, it is \nunacceptable. I have said we have to change the policy. We have to give \npeople a decent price. That we can do. I have said that the reason I \nhave come to the floor of the Senate is to make the demand that: \nYesterday, if not tomorrow, if not next week, we have the opportunity \nto bring legislation to the floor to deal with this crisis.\n  I have come to the floor of the Senate to say that we cannot \nadjourn--it would not be responsible, it would not be right--without \ntaking action to help improve the situation for farmers. Why else are \nwe here but to try to do better for people? What could be more \nimportant than for us, the Senate, as an institution--Democrats and \nRepublicans--to pass legislation that would correct these problems and \nhelp alleviate this suffering and pain and make such a positive \ndifference in the lives of so many people in Minnesota that I love--so \nmany farmers in so many rural communities?\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title III, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 3____. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING CAFE STANDARDS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) law, codified \n     at chapter 329 of title 49, United States Code, is critical \n     to reducing the dependence of the United States on foreign \n     oil, reducing air pollution and carbon dioxide, and saving \n     consumers money at the gas pump;\n       (2) the cars and light trucks of the United States are \n     responsible for 20 percent of the carbon dioxide pollution \n     generated in the United States;\n       (3) the average fuel economy of all new passenger vehicles \n     is at its lowest point since 1980, while fuel consumption is \n     at its highest;\n       (4) since 1995, a provision in the transportation \n     appropriations Acts has prohibited the Department of \n     Transportation from examining the need to raise CAFE \n     standards\n\n[[Page S10893]]\n\n     for sport utility vehicles and other light trucks;\n       (5) that provision denies purchasers of new sport utility \n     vehicles and other light trucks the benefits of available \n     fuel saving technologies;\n       (6) the current CAFE standards save more than 3,000,000 \n     barrels of oil per day;\n       (7)(A) the current CAFE standards have remained the same \n     for nearly a decade;\n       (B) the CAFE standard for sport utility vehicles and other \n     light trucks is \\3/4\\ the standard for automobiles; and\n       (C) the CAFE standard for sport utility vehicles and other \n     light trucks is 20.7 miles per gallon and the standard for \n     automobiles is 27.5 miles per gallon;\n       (8) because of CAFE standards, the average sport utility \n     vehicle emits about 75 tons of carbon dioxide over the life \n     of the vehicle while the average car emits about 45 tons of \n     carbon dioxide;\n       (9) the technology exists to cost effectively and safely \n     make vehicles go further on a gallon of gasoline; and\n       (10) improving light truck fuel economy would not only cut \n     pollution but also save oil and save owners of new sport \n     utility vehicles and other light trucks money at the gas \n     pump.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the issue of CAFE standards should be permitted to be \n     examined by the Department of Transportation, so that \n     consumers may benefit from any resulting increase in the \n     standards as soon as possible; and\n       (2) the Senate should not recede to section 320 of this \n     bill, as passed by the House of Representatives, which \n     prevents an increase in CAFE standards.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this amendment is offered on behalf of \nmyself, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Bryan, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Reed of Rhode \nIsland, Mr. Moynihan, and Mr. Chafee. I ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Boxer be added as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this is an amendment that has been widely \ndiscussed relating to CAFE standards; that is to say, the fuel \nefficiency standards of automobiles and small trucks sold in the United \nStates. Now, I want to quote an argument against this proposal made in \na committee hearing on CAFE standards.\n\n       In effect, this bill would outlaw a number of engine lines \n     and car models, including most full-size sedans and station \n     wagons. It would restrict the industry from producing \n     subcompact-size cars or even smaller ones.\n\n  Mr. President, you may well ask me when that hearing took place \nbecause you were unaware that hearings on this subject had taken place. \nThat question would be well put because that hearing took place in \n1974, 25 years ago. That statement was made by automobile manufacturers \nin connection with the fuel efficiency standards that were discussed \nduring that year and were implemented. As a result of the \nimplementation of those standards, we are saving 3 million barrels of \noil per day in the United States as compared with the 17 million \ngallons per day that cars and trucks, in fact, use.\n  In other words, even from the point of view of a relatively \nconservative Senator, as I consider myself, we have an example of a \nhighly successful regulatory action on the part of the Government of \nthe United States, a regulatory action that took place 25 years ago and \nwas, for all practical purposes, fully implemented within 6 years of \nthe time of its implementation. That is the first notable point about \nthe subject we are discussing today.\n  The second is that the argument I quoted turned out to be wholly \ninaccurate. The evidence of that inaccuracy, of course, is on every \nstreet, road, and highway in the United States. The genius of American \nmanufacturers created an automobile that met all of the fuel efficiency \nstandards that were implemented a quarter of a century ago without a \nsubstantial downsizing of our automobiles' weight, with a tremendous \ncontribution to cleaner air, and with the contribution of saving 3 \nmillion gallons of gasoline each and every day of each and every year, \nevery single gallon of which, where we are using it, would come from \nimports and from overseas, further exacerbating our trade deficits.\n  I find it particularly curious that we should look back at an \nexperiment so totally successful in every respect, in cleaning up our \nair, in reducing our use of petroleum products, in reducing our trade \ndeficits, and in saving money for the American people, and say: Not \nonly are we not going to repeat that experiment, we are not even going \nto study whether we ought to repeat that experiment. What we have done \nin the Congress is to tell our Federal agencies that they may not \npursue studies and come up with rules and regulations and \nrecommendations as to a second round of improving our automobile fuel \nefficiency either for regular passenger automobiles or for small trucks \nor for SUVs.\n  The status, in connection with this bill, of course, is relatively \nsimple. This Senate bill does not prevent the Federal Government from \ngoing ahead with such studies and making such recommendations. The \nHouse bill does, once again, as we have for the last several years, \nprohibit even these studies.\n  The amendment before us now is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that \nthe Senate should not accept that House provision. It is neither more \nnor less than that. Every one of the 98 Senators, in addition to you \nand me, has been deluged by statements from opponents to this modest \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution, stating, first, that it would make our \nhighways less safe, even though our death rate on our highways is \nremarkably lower now--I think three times lower than it was before \nwe went through this experiment the first time--that there is no way \nthe automobile manufacturers can meet the requirements that would be \nimposed if we allowed these studies to go forward without going back to \nsub-subcompacts--an argument that was shown to be totally fallacious \nand without reason some 25 years ago.\n\n  In short, there is not a single argument being presented against this \namendment that was not presented 25 years ago to this body and to the \nother body and to the people of the United States and proven to be \nwithout merit.\n  Can we learn nothing from the past? Are we so frightened, as Members \nof the Senate, that we are not even going to try to determine in an \norderly fashion whether or not we can do better with respect to the \nfuel efficiency of the internal combustion engine? The proposition, I \nthink, is bizarre, that we should prohibit even a study and a set of \nproposed regulations on this subject.\n  There could possibly be more bite to this argument if what we were \nfaced with was the imminent imposition of new requirements that were \nhighly unreasonable in nature and about which it might be argued that \nthey were impossible to attain. If we were faced with a proposed \namendment that said the Federal Government could use no part of this \nappropriation to enforce such standards, that would be one thing. But \nwhat the opponents to this sense-of-the-Senate resolution are saying \nis: Don't even look into the question. Don't do anything. Don't try to \nlearn whether or not we can come up with more efficient internal \ncombustion engines. Let's just ignore it.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Will the Senator from Washington yield for a question on \nthat point?\n  Mr. GORTON. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Do I understand the thrust of the Senator's argument is \nnot to advocate some new standards for CAFE but simply to permit those \nwho are charged with that responsibility to make a basic inquiry as to \nwhether or not there is room, based upon science, safety, and other \nconsiderations, to consider an increase in fuel economy standards?\n  Mr. GORTON. My dear friend from Nevada is entirely correct, as, of \ncourse, he knows, having been a cosponsor of this amendment and a \ncompanion with the Senator from Washington in this cause for many years \nin the past.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. GORTON. I was about to say, for the benefit of my friend from \nNevada, isn't it fortunate that the Congress of the United States, in \nthe first decade of the 19th century, didn't prohibit the development \nof a steam engine because it might explode?\n  That is basically what the arguments against the amendment the \nSenator from Nevada and I have proposed amount to. My gosh, something \nbad might happen if you did something. But, of course, the argument \nagainst the steam engine in 1810, or 1812, or 1814 would have been \nstronger because they knew nothing about it. We have gone through this \nprocess before, and it was a complete success. But we are now told, not \nonly should we not go through the experiment again, we should not even \nstudy it; we should not even try\n\n[[Page S10894]]\n\nto come up with facts that would justify it or--and I think it is very \nunlikely--perhaps not justify making any change in the present system.\n  Now, I think both the Senator from Nevada and I believe such a study \nwould come up with more significant CAFE standards. But I don't think \nthe Senator from Nevada, even more than I, has any idea what they would \nbe, how far they would go, what we would find to be totally successful \nor not. We just want to find out whether or not we can't do something \nthat would reduce our dependence on foreign oil, help clean up our air, \nand save money for the American purchaser of automobiles, small trucks \nand, of course, the fuel required to run them. That is all.\n  Mr. BRYAN. It strikes the Senator from Nevada that the argument the \nSenator is making is a win-win. It is a win for the consumer, for the \nenvironment, and in terms of the trade imbalance we currently face in \nthis country.\n  Would the Senator not agree with the proposition that everybody comes \nout a winner if the Senator's resolution would simply ask that an \ninquiry be made into the practicality of increasing fuel efficiency \nstandards?\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator from Nevada is entirely correct. If we can \nonly take a quick vote on it with the Senators on the floor now, we \nwould probably succeed. Unfortunately, we have yet to persuade all of \nour colleagues of this matter. The question the Senator puts--and he \nknows the answer--is a very profound and a very serious question.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I enjoyed the Senator's reference to the steam engine in \nthe 19th century. The younger members of my staff say they are not \nfamiliar with this reference, but as the Senator from Washington will \nrecall, the Industrial Revolution was born in Great Britain. Just as \nthen, seemingly now, there are those fearful of progress.\n  The first manifestation of the Industrial Revolution was when we \nchanged the textile production from a cottage industry to the floors of \nthe factory, and machinery and technology made that possible. I know \nthe Senator from Washington State, who is in my generation, will recall \nthis reference. But a group of people called Luddites went about the \ncountry breaking up the machines, trying to prevent progress, fearful \nof the consequences. It seems to me--perhaps the Senator might want to \ncomment--that in a very modern-day sense, we have neo-Luddites who are \nfearful of the consequences of what new technology might make possible, \nand in my view, the improvement of technology throughout the vast \nexpanse of history has improved a lot for mankind. Does the Senator \nagree with that observation?\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator from Nevada is as learned as he is wise, and \nhis reference to Luddites in the late 18th and early 19th century \nEngland is entirely correct. The word has come down to us today, \nreferring to those who are so fearful of changes in our technology that \nin one way or another they would prevent it.\n  The point he makes is particularly important, and it is one that I \nwant to continue to emphasize to Members. We are not debating a law \nthat will mandate a specific new set of fuel economy standards for \nautomobiles and small trucks. We are not even debating whether or not a \nspecific set of standards should be imposed after a study of their \nfeasibility and desirability is completed. We are debating a \nproposition that says we should go forward in an orderly fashion, have \nthis determination made by people who are expert in the field and who \nstudy it carefully and must follow all of the procedural requirements \nfor setting rules and regulations, all of which will be vulnerable to \nfuture debates in the Senate should proposals be made that seem somehow \nor another unreasonable.\n  There is not a single Member of the Senate, from the most \nconservative to the most liberal, who has not at one time or another \nbeen critical of some rule or regulation imposed by some agency of the \nFederal Government. Every Member of the Senate--and for that matter, \nthe House of Representatives--knows how to bring up debate on that \nsubject, the debate over this appropriations bill, or some other bill \nrelating to transportation. But what we have today from the opponents \nto this sense-of-the-Senate resolution is a statement that we are \nignorant of what might happen if we engage in another round of fuel \nefficiency standards and we want to remain ignorant. That is \nessentially what they are talking about.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, if the recollection of the Senator from \nNevada is correct, in the mid-1970s, the distinguished Senator from \nWashington was the attorney general of that State. As the attorney \ngeneral, he was a leading advocate on behalf of consumer issues in his \nState. Perhaps the Senator will recall when the legislation, referred \nto as CAFE, the corporate average fuel economy standard, was offered on \nthe floor of the Senate and in the other body. Those from the \nautomobile industry said at the time: if these CAFE standards are \nimposed upon us, everybody in America will be driving an automobile \nsmaller than a Pinto or a subsized Maverick.\n  That was at a time when fuel economy for passenger vehicles averaged \nless than 14 miles per gallon. As a result of the Congress taking that \naction, fuel economy, from 1973 to 1989, doubled.\n  Does the Senator recall the essence of the testimony offered by one \nof the automotive manufacturers? I wonder if he might want to comment \non what actually occurred over those intervening 16 years when we were \nsupposed to be driving around in Pintos and subsize Maverick \nautomobiles.\n  Mr. GORTON. Just before my friend from Nevada came to the floor, I \nbegan my remarks with a quotation, which sounded so remarkably similar \nto what we have heard in the last few days about this amendment, and it \nis particularly appropriate. For the Senator's benefit and for others, \nI will repeat it:\n\n       In effect, this bill would outlaw a number of engine lines \n     and car models, including most full-size sedans and station \n     wagons. It would restrict the industry to producing \n     subcompact sized cars, or even smaller ones.\n\n  That was a statement by the duly authorized representative of the \nFord Motor Company in 1974 in the hearings on the bill that allowed for \nthe first corporate average fuel economy standards to take place. Now \nthe Ford Motor Company, of course, was far more resourceful in its \ntechnology than it was in its language. And when these requirements \nwere imposed, the Ford Motor Company, General Motors, Chrysler, and the \nrest of the manufacturers met them, and they met them gratefully to the \nadvantage of the people of the United States, who ended up with far \ncleaner air. It is impossible to imagine what our air would be like \ntoday if we were all driving 1974 model automobiles--saving billions of \ndollars in fuel costs, saving the economy of the United States all of \nthe costs of that extra fuel, all of which would have ended up coming \nfrom overseas, given our dependence on foreign oil at the time.\n  One of the interesting things as we go into this debate right now, I \ntell my friend, is that a recent issue of the Wall Street Journal \nreported that the same company, the Ford Motor Company, is currently \ndeveloping technology to increase fuel economy of its truck fleet by as \nmuch as 15 percent.\n  The article in the Wall Street Journal said that internal documents \nposted on the world wide web show--I am quoting now:\n\n       Ford could significantly increase its fuel economy on some \n     of its biggest and most popular trucks without losing the \n     things people buy trucks for, horsepower and pulling power.\n\n  That is another illustration of the fact that an argument which was \nutterly invalid in 1974 is utterly invalid in 1999.\n  Members of this body 25 years ago might have been excused for giving \ngreat credence to that argument. After all, we didn't know what was \ngoing to happen. It is very difficult to give credence to that argument \ngiven the tremendously positive results of the regulations which were \nadopted in 1974.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, may I inquire further of the distinguished \nSenator, my friend from Washington, with another question.\n  Has the Senator had an opportunity to see this morning's issue of \nCongress Daily? On the back, there is an ad designed to uphold the \nthoughtful and well-considered resolution which the Senator from \nWashington, and our able\n\n[[Page S10895]]\n\ncolleague, the distinguished Senator from California, I, and others are \ngoing to be offering for consideration. But the text of the ad says:\n\n       We work hard all year so our family can go fishing and \n     camping together. We couldn't do it without our SUV--\n\n  Sport utility vehicle. It shows the man leaning on the hood of the \nSUV.\n  I guess my questions to the Senator would be twofold: No. 1, before \nthe automobile manufacturers developed the sport utility vehicles, was \nit not possible for families in America to enjoy fishing and camping? \nPerhaps the Senator might be able to respond to that question.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the question, of course, answers itself. \nIt was.\n  Americans have acquired far greater choice today after the \nimplementation of those fuel efficiency standards than they had \npreviously. The interesting part of the ad, which was just handed to \nme--I had not previously seen it--says: Say yes to consumer choice and \nsay no to a CAFE increase. In fact, the consumer can't choose a fuel \nefficient SUV at the present time. There isn't any consumer choice \nthere. They are not competing over that proposition, though we may hope \nthat someday in the future the Ford Motor Company, if it is thought \ncorrect, will do so. But as consumer choice increased after the last \nCAFE standards were imposed, so am I confident they will increase the \nnext time around.\n  I greatly enjoyed this conversation with my friend from Nevada. I \nsuspect he has more to say on the subject. I know the Senator from \nCalifornia wishes to speak on this subject. I don't want to monopolize \nthe conversation, even on the pro side, and we will have opponents.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I first began to believe that global \nwarming was a major threat in 1998 when a 92-mile long and 30-mile wide \niceberg broke loose from the Antarctic Ice Shelf. It was 1\\1/2\\ times \nthe size of Delaware. NOAA said it was a possible indicator of global \nwarming.\n  I began to take a look at some of the other things that have happened \nin the last few years. I find that we have the first species extinction \nin Costa Rica because of it. I find that it now has an impact on the El \nNino cycle in the Pacific Ocean. I find that there is a serious \ndegradation of coral reefs in the Indian Ocean, and 70 percent of the \nexisting coral reefs are affected.\n  I am a SUV owner. I own three jeeps. I love my jeeps. I have no \ndoubt, though, that my jeeps can have the same kind of fuel efficiency \nstandards as my automobile.\n  Then you have to look and say, well, if my three jeeps have the same \nkind of fuel efficiency, what would that do for global warming?\n  Carbon dioxide is the main culprit in global warming. Our country is \nthe largest emitter and producer of carbon dioxide in the world. The \nUnited States saves 3 million barrels of oil because of fuel efficiency \nstandards. If SUVs, similar to my jeeps, had fuel efficiency standards \nequal to those of automobiles, we would save another 1 million barrels \nof oil a day. If the 8 million or so of the other SUVs around the \nUnited States and the light trucks had these same standards, it would \neliminate 187 million tons of CO2 from the air. The experts have said \nit is the largest single thing, bar none, that we can do to influence \nglobal warming in a positive way.\n  It seems so easy to do it. We know it can be done. We know it need \nnot influence the efficiency of the engines. And we know there is \ntechnology that can make it so.\n  So raising these so-called CAFE standards or fuel efficiency \nstandards so the SUVs are equal to other passenger automobiles at about \n27 miles per gallon instead of 20 miles per gallon does not seem to me \nto be an unrealistic thing to ask Detroit to do. But instead, since \n1995, there has been a rider in this bill which says to the Government \nthat we can't even look, we can't even study, and we can't even make \nany findings to see whether, in fact, it is possible to bring SUVs up \nto automobile standards with respect to fuel efficiency.\n  I believe very strongly that this is the largest single positive \nenvironmental step this Congress can take to reduce carbon dioxide \nemissions in the atmosphere. To have a rider in a bill which says you \ncan't even study it, you can't even see if what I am saying is true, I \nthink makes no sense whatsoever.\n  As I say, I love my three jeeps. But I will tell you, I am going to \nlook for a sports utility vehicle that has equal fuel efficiency \nstandards in the future.\n  Additionally, what would this do for the consumer? It is estimated \nthat by simply requiring SUVs to meet the same average CAFE \nrequirements as automobiles would save the consumer more than $2,000 in \nfuel costs over the life of each vehicle. It seems to me that is a \npretty easy way to give people almost a kind of tax rebate. You save \nmoney buying fuel for your car because you buy less of it over the life \nof the car. And it is estimated those savings are $2,000 per vehicle.\n  More importantly, 117 million Americans live where smog sometimes \nmakes the air unsafe to breathe where asthma is on the increase and \nwhere respiratory problems are developing. Almost one-half of this \npollution is caused by so-called nonpoint sources. That means the \nautomobile. Attempting to improve the efficiency of vehicles we drive \nhelps address this problem as well.\n  There is no substantive evidence to support the fact that this would \nprovide technological problems that Detroit cannot meet.\n  I hasten to point out, we do not include in this amendment, and the \nintent of this amendment is not to include, agricultural equipment that \nworks on agricultural products in fields. However, with this amendment \nwe would learn a couple of things. One, the air would be cleaner. \nConsumers would save significant money in fuel costs--$2,000 over the \nlife of each vehicle--and we would go a long way to address the problem \nof global warming.\n  I am hopeful that this measure will pass today.\n  I view with some surprise the degree to which this measure is being \nlobbied by automobile interests in this country. As an SUV car owner, \nas a jeep lover, as someone who would like to buy additional cars, this \nis an important point to me. It seems to me some automobile company \nought to be willing to address it, to bring these SUVs up to automobile \nstandards.\n  I stand strongly in support of the amendment. I thank my colleagues, \nSenator Bryan, Senator Gorton, and others, who also support the \namendment. I am hopeful there will be enough Senators to say: Let's not \ngo about this with blinders; let's take one good look and see if this \nis really possible; let's do the necessary studies; let's work together \nto do the largest single thing we can do, relatively painlessly, to \nreduce global warming.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I thank my able colleague from California \nfor her thoughtful and well-considered statement. I associate myself \nwith her observations and the conclusions she makes.\n  This issue has been framed on a false premise, that somehow Members, \nincluding the able Senators from California and Washington who support \nthis amendment, are interested in depriving the American public of \ntheir choice of automobiles.\n  I know firsthand, having seen the vehicles of my colleague from \nCalifornia--she is the proud owner of a sport utility vehicle--she \nwould defend as vigorously as would I her right to own such a vehicle.\n  This has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not the American \npublic chooses to purchase a minivan, a light truck, or a sport utility \nvehicle. My son and his wife and our first grandchild are in the \nNation's Capital today. As a family, they have chosen a sport utility \nvehicle. I defend his right as vigorously as I defend the right of my \ncolleague from California.\n  This is not what this debate is all about. That is a false premise. I \nthink some Members are not only offended by the intellectual dishonesty \nof this kind of advertising that suggests the senior Senator from \nCalifornia and I somehow seek to deprive American families of their \nopportunity to go fishing and camping. That is just ludicrous. That \ndefies any kind of rational argument.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BRYAN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n\n[[Page S10896]]\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I have not seen that particular ad. I am most \ninterested. Would the Senator read it?\n  Mr. BRYAN. It shows two angelic children sitting on the hood of a \nsport utility vehicle. Strapped to the top of that vehicle looks to be \na canoe, a boat of some type. Now we see a gentleman, perhaps the \nfather of these two children, leaning on the hood. He is saying to \nthem, ``You know, we work hard all year as a family so our family can \ngo fishing and camping together. We couldn't do it without our sport \nutility vehicle.'' Then the tag line is: ``Say yes to consumer choice. \nSay no to a CAFE increase.''\n  I was explaining before my colleague's thoughtful question, the \nimplication is that those who advocate simply taking a look at the \nstandards, simply allowing those within the Department of \nTransportation to take a look at the standards--and I will comment \nlater in my remarks as to the criteria involved--that somehow we are \nopposed to this family's right to camp and to go fishing. That is \noutrageous. It is not true. This Senator is greatly offended by the \ntext of that ad.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BRYAN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. One of the things I have found is the use of ``CAFE'' \nwhich we bandy around so much--most people don't know exactly what that \nmeans. We are really talking about the efficiency of a gallon of gas to \ngo farther. Therefore, the efficiency of a gallon of gas is what we are \ntalking about and applying those standards to SUVs as you would to \npassenger sedans.\n  Mr. BRYAN. The Senator from California is absolutely correct. She has \nthe clarity of expression that sometimes escapes those who had the \nmisfortune to go to law school. We get caught up with acronyms. CAFE \nmeans nothing to the average person. We are trying to get greater fuel \nefficiency.\n  In my colloquy with our colleague from Washington State, it was \npointed out that this is a win-win-win for the American public.\n  The Senator from California and I represent two States that currently \nare experiencing enormous increases in the cost of gas. That takes \nmoney out of the pocket of America's families. That means less \ndiscretionary income. In the Senator's State as well as my own, an \nautomobile is virtually a necessity to move from one place to another, \nto go to work, to enjoy the recreational opportunities we want to have \nwith our family, to do the sort of thing that is part of our lifestyle \nin America.\n  If we can improve the CAFE standards for jeeps, sport utilities, \nminivans, and light trucks, we put more dollars in that family's \npocket; we clean up the air, as the Senator from California pointed \nout; we reduce our dependence on foreign oil--it currently is about 50 \npercent; it drives some of the geopolitical policy debates in which the \ngood Senator from California has taken a lead--and we help to reduce \nthe trade deficit.\n  Our economy is performing magnificently, but one of the areas of \nconcern to everyone is the mounting trade deficit. About $50 billion of \nthat annual trade deficit is attributed to what we as Americans pay for \noil that we import from around the world to fuel our economy, a good \nsegment of which is transportation.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BRYAN. The Senator from Nevada is always pleased to yield to the \nsenior Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. One of the things that I think is particularly \ndisingenuous about the opposition is that if SUVs and light trucks had \nthe same fuel efficiency or even an increased fuel efficiency, it would \nimpair the functioning of the car and the vehicle would not be able to \nfunction at optimal standards.\n  Would the Senator reflect on this for the Senate?\n  Mr. BRYAN. That is, as the Senator from California knows, an argument \nthat has been raised. It is a specious argument.\n  The Senator from California hails from a jurisdiction which has been \non the cutting edge of so much of the technology of the post-World War \nII era. Because of the Senator's own interest in technology and moving \nher own economy forward in California, I know she is deeply committed \nto that.\n  The Senator from California and many of our colleagues reflect that \ngreat confidence that the ingenuity and the entrepreneurial spirit of \nthe American business community responds to challenges. But now there \nis a disconnect. The automobile industry didn't think they could ever \ndo anything to improve economy. We couldn't suggest they look at that--\nsomehow that would deprive us of our choice.\n  As the Senator from Washington responded to my question, these \narguments were made back in 1974 when a representative at that time \nfrom the Ford Motor Company, testifying in opposition to the first fuel \neconomy standards, said--without in any way belying the Senator's own \nyouthful appearance, I think she may recall 1974, as the Senator from \nNevada does. At that time, one of the leading automobiles that Ford \nproduced was what I call a pint-sized Pinto. The Senator I am sure will \nrecall that.\n  This is what the auto industry was arguing in 1974, should the first \nCAFE standards be enacted:\n\n       That the product line [referring to the product line for \n     automobile manufacturers in America] would consist of either \n     all sub Pinto sized vehicles or some mix of vehicles ranging \n     from a sub sub compact to perhaps a Maverick.\n\n  That statement was made in this century--in fact, the latter quarter \nof the 20th century.\n  This is a tribute to the industry and its ingenuity. The Lincoln Town \nCar, if not the largest automobile produced by the Ford Motor Company, \ngets better fuel economy today than the Pinto did in 1974. That is \ntechnology. It does not deprive one of choice. It seems to me for some \nreason the industry has created this facade that they cannot do these \nsorts of things.\n  We are saying--and I believe the Senator from California would \nagree--let's just take a look and see if we can't achieve these \nbenefits we have just talked about.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I commend and thank the Senator for answering my \nquestions. I appreciate it very much. If he would allow me one brief \ncomment.\n  I think one of the reasons that for awhile the American automobile \nhad lost the cutting edge was the reluctance to do research and \ndevelopment to develop those kinds of automobile products that became \nvery popular, that were produced by the Japanese marketplace. Since \nthen, the American automotive companies have changed dramatically. The \nvery kind of innovation that was absent for so long has now been \nrestored. So it would seem to me any innovation in weight or size or \nengine capacity could very easily overcome these problems and that \nthese vehicles could function as efficiently. I will point out it is \nthe largest single thing we could do to alleviate global warming. So I \nthank the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the senior Senator from California for her very \nthoughtful comments and excellent presentation.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the Gorton-Feinstein-Bryan \namendment that would permit the Department of Transportation to \nconsider whether fuel efficiency for SUVs and light trucks should be \nimproved. The vote on this amendment will be one of the key \nenvironmental votes of this Congress. I think it is helpful for our \ncolleagues to understand the context in which this debate occurs.\n  In 1995, the House of Representatives inserted an antienvironmental \nrider in the Department of Transportation appropriations bill that \nprohibited, that is precluded, the Department of Transportation from \neven considering whether an increase in automobile fuel efficiency made \nsense. That environmental rider has been added to each of the \nappropriations in years 1996, 1997, 1998, and currently we face the \nsame situation.\n  I think the important thing to emphasize is that those of us who \nsupport the resolution are not arguing for a specific numerical \nstandard. We are simply saying shouldn't the people who have the \nability to make these judgments, under very carefully considered \ncircumstances, have the opportunity to even inquire? In effect, what \nthe rider accomplishes is a technology gag rule. It precludes \nconsideration. So our amendment is an effort to show there is \nsubstantial support in this body that we should not prejudge the issue \nand,\n\n[[Page S10897]]\n\ninstead, let the experts study the issue and decide what is in the \nNation's best interests.\n  A bit of history may be instructive. Fuel efficiency standards are \nknown, in the jargon of the Congressional and Federal professional \nbureaucracy, as CAFE standards, the acronym standing for corporate \naverage fuel economy. Those standards have been on the decline in \nrecent years, as automakers build bigger and bigger gas guzzlers.\n  This chart will be instructive. Prior to the enactment in 1974 of the \nfuel economy standards, the average fuel economy for a passenger \nvehicle in America was slightly less than 14 miles per gallon. As a \nresult of the enactment of that legislation, over the intervening 15 \nyears, fuel economy doubled to 27.5 miles per gallon. This chart \nreflects that.\n  What has occurred, in the late 1980s and 1990s, is the vehicle mix \nhas shifted dramatically. We have seen a decline in overall fuel \neconomy. Not that the vehicles referred to as ``passenger vehicles'' \nare less fuel efficient, but the American public, by choice, has \nincluded in its purchase agenda light trucks, sport utility vehicles, \nand minivans. These were not terms that were familiar in America in \n1974, and millions of families have chosen light trucks or sport \nutility vehicles and minivans. As I indicated in my colloquy with the \ndistinguished Senator from California, my own son and his family have \nsuch a vehicle in Nevada. A daughter and a son-in-law have such a \nvehicle in upstate New York. So nothing in this debate is in any way \nabout limiting choice. But we cannot ignore the reality that the fleet \nmix has changed.\n  Today, nearly 50 percent of the vehicles sold in America for family \nuse are sport utility, minivans, or light trucks. That reflects the \npercentage. If the chart went 1 more year, they would reflect basically \nabout 50 percent of the vehicle mix.\n  When the legislation was enacted in 1974, there was a different \nstandard for light trucks, which included minivans and the sport \nutility vehicle. So what this debate is all about is simply \npermitting--it is permissive. It in no way mandates, dictates, directs, \ncommands; it simply is permissive. I think it may be helpful to read \nthe language of the resolution itself. This is a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution. The resolved paragraph says:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that,\n       (1) the issue of CAFE standards should be permitted to be \n     examined by the Department of Transportation, so that \n     consumers may benefit from any resulting increase in the \n     standards as soon as possible.\n\n  Let me repeat.\n\n       The issue of CAFE standards should be permitted to be \n     examined by the Department of Transportation. . ..\n\n  There is no attempt to fix a precise numerical standard. This simply \nwould permit an inquiry by the Department of Transportation. The effect \nof this would be to override the technology gag rule that has been \nimposed by the House since 1995 that prohibits or precludes its \nconsideration.\n  Part 2 of the resolution simply says that:\n\n       The Senate should not recede to section 320 of this bill, \n     as passed by the House of Representatives.\n\n  That is the technology gag rule.\n  As fuel efficiency declines, oil consumption, trade deficits, and air \npollution go up. Few actions have as many beneficial effects on our \neconomy as improving fuel efficiency standards. As I said before, the \namendment in no way seeks to restrict choice. For millions of \nAmericans, that is their vehicle of choice and in some geographical \nclimes it would be the only sensible choice.\n  We recognize, fully respect, and endorse the concept of choice. \nContrary to all the foreboding in the 1974 testimony before the \nCongress, in point of fact, as my colleague from Washington State \npointed out, we had greater choice in America after the fuel economy \nlegislation was enacted a quarter of a century ago by the Congress.\n  So the real question is not whether Americans want and need a larger \nfour-wheel-drive vehicle but whether these vehicles can be made more \nfuel efficient. That is what the amendment is attempting to find out. \nMany of us believe that answer will be yes. Others disagree. But all we \nare asking is to allow the experts to make that determination.\n  The current law provides a strict criteria to the Department of \nTransportation in considering what process needs to be involved before \na CAFE standard could be increased. It requires the DOT to consider \nfour factors:\n  First, the technical feasibility. My friend and colleague from \nWashington State mentioned an article in the Wall Street Journal and \ncited one of the automakers on the technology they currently have \navailable. There are many of us who believe technology is there but \nthat is not for us to determine. That is for the experts in the \nDepartment of Transportation, the technical feasibility.\n  Second, the economic practicability.\n  Third, the effect of other motor vehicle standards on fuel economy.\n  Finally, the need of the Nation to conserve energy.\n  These are four criteria, each of which must be found before the \nDepartment could be authorized to go forward with second fuel economy \nstandards that build upon the 1974 legislation.\n  The auto industry, for all of its achievements in recent years--and I \napplaud them for this--for some reason has this myopic view of the \nfuture. Whereas most Americans are confident about the future, we \nrecognize that changes in technology that are sweeping across the \ncountry are more vast and more pervasive than anything in the history \nof civilization, and there is no reason to believe the auto industry \nitself would be immune from these current changes, and that new \ntechnology will make it possible to do things more efficiently than we \nhave in the past.\n  For some reason--and I do not understand the corporate mentality--\nthere is this knee-jerk reaction: We don't want anybody to take a look \nat it; we couldn't possibly do it.\n  That was reflected in the debate the Congress had for a quarter of a \ncentury.\n  Who would be the beneficiaries? What public policy would be served \nif, indeed, the Department took a look at the evidence and concluded \nthat some increase was warranted?\n  I can speak of my own State of Nevada, having spent 26 days in rural \nNevada. If there was one question that came up in every townhall \nmeeting, it was the price of gas. For reasons that are not altogether \nclear to me, and I have not been persuaded as to those that have been \nasserted to be the cause of it, gas prices in the West have \nskyrocketed. In central Nevada, gasoline prices are approaching $2 a \ngallon. I realize that is not the situation of my colleagues from the \nEast and other parts of the country.\n  Who would be an immediate beneficiary of improved fuel economy \nstandards? Those individuals who currently own sport utility vehicles \nwould be purchasing another vehicle that would be more fuel efficient. \nThat would put dollars back in the pockets of America's families. \nAmerica's families would benefit.\n  What does the public think about this? In a recent poll conducted by \nthe Mellman Group, nearly three out of four drivers who own minivans, \npickup trucks, or sport utility vehicles think the automobile \nmanufacturers should be required to make cleaner, less polluting \nvehicles, and more than two-thirds say they would be willing to pay a \nsignificant amount more for their next sport utility vehicle if it \npolluted less.\n  Opponents of our amendment will cry wolf and say our amendment will \ncause people to drive around in tiny subcompacts. This is kind of deja \nvu. We have been there before. We have heard that, and an earlier \nCongress had the courage to go forward. As a result, we save 3 million \nbarrels of oil each day that we otherwise would be consuming as a \nresult of those fuel efficiency standards that were first enacted.\n  To give perhaps the most graphic and encapsulated insight into the \ncorporate culture that seems to pervade the automobile industry, the \n1974 testimony before the Congress is the milestone.\n  As my colleagues will recall, the Congress was being asked for the \nfirst time to consider these fuel economy standards, and the auto \nindustry, as one, came forward with this dire projection of doom and \ngloom. As I was saying earlier in a colloquy with the distinguished \nsenior Senator from California, the Pinto was one of the smallest, if \nnot the smallest, products the Ford Motor Company produced that year.\n\n[[Page S10898]]\n\n The testimony offered by the representative from Ford concluded that \nthe ``product line consisting of either all sub-Pinto-sized vehicles or \nsome mix of vehicles ranging from a sub-subcompact to perhaps a \nMaverick'' would be the consequence of that action.\n\n  That is absolutely unbelievable, but that was the testimony. Indeed, \nthe refutation of that is today fuel economy has doubled as a result of \nthis legislation, and the largest automobile the Ford Motor Company \nmakes, the Lincoln Town Car, gets better mileage than the smallest car \nthat Ford manufactured in 1974. That is efficiency. That is technology.\n  Indeed, 86 percent of the increases in fuel efficiency came from \nimproved technology. And why not? This is the country that believes in \ntechnology. It has fueled our economy. It has made us the most \nproductive society in the history of civilization and has produced the \nhighest standard of living known in the history of the world.\n  The Union of Concerned Scientists estimates that using off-the-shelf \ntechnologies--that is, existing technology--that SUVs, or sport utility \nvehicles, could improve fuel efficiency by 50 percent to 28.5 miles per \ngallon.\n  The authors of this resolution do not ask you to believe that. That \nis a responsible assessment. This group of scientists may be right and \nthey may be wrong, so this debate is not about whether they are correct \nin their conclusion. This debate is about whether or not the Department \nof Transportation should be allowed to consider that testimony, that \nevidence, and any other evidence that bears on point in making a \ndetermination as to whether or not improved fuel efficiency standards \ncan be achieved. This can be done without shrinking the vehicle size or \nsacrificing safety.\n  I invite my colleagues' attention to this chart because safety does \nsometimes get into this debate. This chart depicts two trend lines: One \nis fuel economy, which has increased dramatically, as you see, from the \n1970s, and the fatality rate. This is the rate of automobile deaths \nbased on the vehicle miles traveled each year. We all know, without \nbeing a statistician or having a masters or Ph.D. in statistics, that \nthere are more people in America today than in the 1970s, many more \nmillion automobiles and sport utilities and light trucks and minivans \non the market, and today the average motorist travels further each year \nin his or her vehicle. But notwithstanding that enormous increase in \ntraffic, vehicles, and further driving, the fatality rate has dropped \nprecipitously, and that is a good news story.\n  The bottom line of that story is it came about because of technology \nimprovements, and the auto industry has always reluctantly, for some \nreason, done a marvelous job with respect to improved safety standards. \nThose over at NHTSA have done a wonderful job in making sure we have \nsidebar protection and rollover standards and a whole host of other \nthings, including seatbelt technology and airbags that today make our \ncars the safest in the world and traveling by vehicle safer today than \nat any time in our history. And that comes a quarter of a century after \nthese dire prophecies of the consequences of enacting a CAFE standard.\n  What other benefits do we get? By raising the CAFE or the fuel \nefficiency standards for sport utility vehicles, we save up to 1 \nmillion barrels of oil a day, and that will save consumers money at the \ngas pump, as we just discussed, and reduce annually by 240 million tons \nthe amount of carbon dioxide that is produced each year.\n  Carbon dioxide is the main culprit involved in what many may believe \nto be global warming. One does not have to embrace the concept of \nglobal warming. I know not everybody agrees. But virtually everyone \nagrees we ought to try to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide going \ninto the atmosphere.\n  I had the privilege a couple of years ago of being in London and \nmeeting with some of my colleagues with British Petroleum, one of the \nlarge petroleum producers in the world. They have come around to \nrecognize that the role of carbon dioxide and a potential impact on \nglobal warming is something that they as a company, as part of its \ncorporate responsibilities, need to address.\n  I know not all oil companies agree, but the vast majority of \nscientists would tell you that it is clearly in our best interest to \nreduce the amount of carbon dioxide emitted and going into the \natmosphere. And most of them--not all--would draw that link between \ncarbon dioxide and global warming and some of the implications it has \nfor us in the future. But, again, you do not have to embrace the \nconcept of global warming to agree with the vast majority, virtually \nall the scientific community, that it makes sense, as a matter of \npublic policy, to reduce or to curtail the amount of carbon dioxide \ngoing into the atmosphere.\n  Finally, the good news on the economy continues: As inflation remains \nunder control, the economy expands, unemployment is low. The stock \nmarket has been a little skiddy the last few days, but, by and large, \nthe stock market has performed extraordinarily well. That is a good \nnews story for the American people.\n  The only cloud on the horizon, the only shadow that may be casting a \ndarker light on the economic future for us in America, is the trade \ndeficit. We are importing far more than we are exporting, and \nultimately there reaches a point in time in which we have to atone for \nthat enormous imbalance.\n  Fuel economy standards play a part in that debate as well because \npart of that trade deficit--about $50 billion a year, a very \nsubstantial part--is attributed to what we in America pay those foreign \ncountries that produce the oil we import into the United States. We \nwould be reducing our dependency on that. That is why I conclude, as I \nsaid in my opening colloquy with the distinguished able Senator from \nthe State of Washington, this legislation is a win-win-win for \neveryone.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. It does not, as I \nhave observed, require radical change. It simply permits the experts to \nlook at what can be done and to make adjustments, if feasible, after \nengaging in a thorough and well considered rulemaking process in which \nall sides are able to be heard.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to end the technology gag rule \nthat has ensnarled this piece of legislation since 1995.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded so I can speak on the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Gorton-\nBryan-Feinstein-Reed sense-of-the-Senate resolution that is being \nconsidered today.\n  As my colleagues have stated, our resolution calls on the House of \nRepresentatives to drop a rider which they have incorporated in the \nTransportation appropriations bill that effectively blocks the \nDepartment of Transportation from studying ways to improve the \ncorporate average fuel economy standards for vehicles in the United \nStates. These standards are currently referred to as the CAFE \nstandards.\n  The current CAFE standard for passenger cars is 27.5 miles per \ngallon, while the standard for the so-called light trucks is just 20.7 \nmiles per gallon.\n  A few years ago, this lower standard for trucks might have been less \ncritical, but what we have seen over the last several years has been an \nexplosion in the popularity of SUVs, sport utility vehicles. They are \nseen in places that are more akin to shopping malls than the rugged \nterrain for which originally they were designed. SUVs and minivans are \neverywhere.\n  As a result, we have to take a serious look at whether this light \ntruck exemption makes sense, given the current marketplace. Their \nimpact--these SUVs and minivans--on the air we breathe and on the \namount of gasoline we consume, including increasing amounts of imported \ngasoline, cannot be ignored.\n\n  We know this is a simple law of supply and demand. When you have many \nmore vehicles subject to lower CAFE standards on the road, the demand \nfor gasoline goes up, the price of gasoline\n\n[[Page S10899]]\n\ngoes up, and the amount of gasoline that is consumed goes up, all of \nwhich ultimately affects our atmosphere.\n  In my State of Rhode Island alone, it is estimated that consumers \nface about $39 million in excess annual fuel costs because of this \nlight truck loophole. Nevertheless, the CAFE freeze rider has been \ninserted into the House DOT spending bill every year for the past 4 \nyears. Each time that happens, Congress denies the American people the \nbenefits of fuel-saving technologies that already exist, technologies \nthat the auto industry could implement with no reduction in safety, \npower, or performance.\n  The existing CAFE standards save more than 3 million barrels of oil \nevery day. If we did not have these standards, we would be paying much \nmore for oil and strategically we would be much more vulnerable in \nterms of our oil supply from around the world. Each year, these CAFE \nstandards reduce pollution by keeping millions of tons of carbon \ndioxide out of our atmosphere.\n  Shouldn't we at least give the Department of Transportation the \nchance to study this issue? That is at the essence of our request--not \nthat we should move immediately or precipitously to the adoption of new \nstandards but at least give the Department of Transportation the \nopportunity to study particularly this light truck loophole.\n  The House version wrongly precludes any consideration, study, or \nanalysis. That, to me, is the wrong way to approach a public policy \nissue. Let's at least study it. It is time we lift this somewhat gag \norder that has been placed on our ability to consider the costs and \nbenefits of higher CAFE standards. I believe, by readjusting the CAFE \nstandards particularly in terms of these light trucks we can make \nsignificant progress in terms of fuel oil economy and also \nenvironmental quality. But at least we have to begin this analysis.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment. I commend \nthe sponsors for their work and hope it will be incorporated in this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to deliver a short statement, \nbecause I know there are other matters pending that we would like to \nhear fairly promptly. While on the subject of the CAFE standards, I \nwill register my support for the position outlined by the senior \nSenator from California and the Senator from Washington.\n  For the last 4 years, the Senate has accepted the House's CAFE freeze \nrider. The result has been serious consequences for the environment, \nfor employment and for the health of people across the country.\n  There is a myth floating around that CAFE standards hurt consumers. \nThe truth is, good CAFE standards help consumers. It's a simple \nconcept. If your car or SUV uses less gas, you save money. Between 1975 \nand 1980, when the fuel economy of cars doubled, consumers with fuel-\nefficient cars saved $3,000 over the lifetime of the car. And that \ntranslated into $30 billion of savings in annual consumer spending.\n  Another benefit of CAFE standards is reduced pollution. Air pollution \nfrom cars has been a major environmental problem.\n  In fact, gas-guzzling cars and light trucks are responsible for 25 \npercent of this country's output of emissions that cause global climate \nchange.\n  Few can hear those words, ``climate change,'' and not be concerned \nabout the impact of the severity of storms and poor air quality we are \nseeing, such as the current hurricane threat, one of massive \nproportions, which seems to have mitigated a little bit. The fact is, \nthere is concern that changes in our climate, changes that are created \nin the atmosphere as a result of pollution, are in some way \nresponsible. We have to take a serious look at this, as we consider the \nquestion in front of us at the moment.\n  A Congressional study by the House Government Reform minority staff \nfound that, from 1995 to 1998, exposure to the hazardous air pollutants \nmeasured in Los Angeles' air quality caused as many as 426 additional \ncancer cases per million exposed individuals.\n  When CAFE standards were first passed in the late 1970s, light trucks \nmade up only 20 percent of the market. Back then, light trucks were \nused mainly for hauling. They didn't often travel through congested \nurban and suburban areas.\n  All that has changed. Today, light trucks--a category that includes \nSUV's and minivans--represent half of all vehicles sold. They produce \n47 percent more smog-forming exhaust and 43 percent more global-warming \npollution than cars. And each light truck goes through an average of \n702 gallons of gas per year. Compare that to 492 gallons per year for \ncars, more than 200 gallons per year.\n  Mr. President, if CAFE standards for light trucks were increased from \n20.5 miles per gallon to 27.5 miles per gallon--the standard for cars--\nthen carbon dioxide emissions would drop by 200 million tons by the \nyear 2010.\n  Jobs are also an important part of this discussion. The other side \nkeeps insisting that CAFE standards will hurt employment, especially in \nthe auto industry.\n  However, a study by the American Council for an Energy Efficient \nEconomy says that money saved at the gas pump, and reinvested \nthroughout the economy, would create 244,000 jobs in this country--that \nincludes 47,000 in the automobile industry.\n  These statistics support the Feinstein-Gorton amendment. I think in \nthe interest of our society, the one thing we can do is make sure we \nare treating the environment for human habitation in as friendly a \nfashion as we can. We know it is an accomplishable feat, and we ought \nto get on with it.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in favor of this sense of the Senate \nresolution.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am extremely concerned about a provision \nin the Shelby amendment to H.R. 2084, the so-called Department of \nTransportation appropriations bill. This provision I am referring to is \nlocated on page 21, line 1, through page 22, line 11, of the committee-\nreported bill. It would reopen the distribution of funds agreed to in \nthe Transportation Equity Act for the 21st century, which is the so-\ncalled TEA 21.\n  TEA 21 provides a process for distributing any additional gas tax \nreceipts beyond those that were projected to be received when TEA 21 \nwas passed. In other words, we made an estimate of what the funds would \nbe, but we expected we might receive less than our anticipated \nreceipts. The appropriations bill, as it stands, would change that \nprocess--in other words, the way the anticipated surplus or losses \nwould be distributed. It is my view that the distribution of the \nhighway trust fund moneys should not be revisited in annual \nappropriations bills.\n  As Members know, the dollars affected by this amendment are those \nthat have come in because, as I said, gas tax receipts were higher than \nprojected when we passed TEA 21. How much higher were they? They were \nabout $1.5 billion higher than projected.\n  We anticipated that actual receipts might be different--as I said \nbefore, higher or lower than projected receipts. Therefore, TEA 21 says \nthat a surplus, or a shortfall, should be distributed evenly across all \nthe programs funded by TEA 21; in other words, in accordance with the \nformulas that existed in TEA 21. It is good news that receipts are \nahead of projections and that we have a surplus rather than a shortfall \nto distribute.\n\n  But our colleagues should remember that when the administration \ndiscovered--who am I referring to? I am talking about the \nadministration--there was a surplus, the administration tried to set \naside the TEA 21 formula, as is being attempted under this \nappropriations bill, except that when the administration was dealing \nwith it, the list of\n\n[[Page S10900]]\n\nprograms which would have benefited from the end run that President \nClinton proposed in his budget is quite different. The President wanted \nto increase the moneys for transit and to spend more money fighting \nenvironmental problems such as air pollution and urban sprawl. In other \nwords, he got way out beyond what we were thinking about.\n  The day President Clinton's budget proposal came to Congress, I \njoined with Congressman Bud Shuster, who chairs the House \nTransportation Committee, in strong objection to any change in the TEA \n21 formula. I would like to personally spend more money on transit and \nair quality and other items that would have benefitted from the \nPresident's proposal. As my colleagues can easily understand, these \nthings are more important to Rhode Island than more dollars for highway \nconstruction. But I went on record the very day the President made his \nproposal strongly opposing any change in the TEA 21 formula.\n  Senator Shelby is proposing to ignore TEA 21 in the same way, but his \npriorities are quite different. He wants all the money to go to the \nStates for highway construction.\n  This is my point. Both the appropriations subcommittee and the \nPresident wanted to do different things with this money. When this bill \nleaves here, we have to remember that it will go to conference. I \npresume there will be some dickering between some members of the \nconference and the administration to produce a bill the President can \nsign. If the Senate endorses this proposed change to the formula, we \nwill be opening the door to a deal on the allocation of this money--\nsome of it for the President's priorities, some for the appropriators' \npriorities.\n  We can't really know what is going to come out of the conference once \nwe get into that kind of action. If you vote with the appropriations \nsubcommittee, you are giving them permission to ignore the TEA 21 \nformula. But that is not the end of the story. Your vote will merely \ntrigger a real struggle between the conference committee and the White \nHouse, the administration, on the reallocation of these funds.\n  Let's suppose you are a Senator from a Western State that benefits \nfrom the public lands highway programs, which we have taken care of as \nwe have in the past. That is in the original TEA 21 bill. These are \nprograms that might very well be shortchanged if we set aside the \nformula. The programs that provide additional funds to States with \nlarge amounts of Federal land--and there are three or four of them--\nwould get their fair share of the surplus if we stick with TEA 21. But \nthese programs weren't on the list of programs that would have been \nwinners under the President's end run. There are 100 percent losers \nunder the proposal presented by the appropriations subcommittee.\n  So if the Federal lands highway programs are important to your State, \nwhere do you stand? If you vote with the appropriations subcommittee to \nset aside TEA 21, you have no idea how your State will fare until the \nconference people come back from the meeting at the White House that \nproduces an agreement on this bill. That agreement will reallocate this \n$1.5 billion, in part, to meet the priorities of the President and, in \npart, to address the priorities of the appropriators. If their actions \nto date are any guide, the Federal lands programs will not get a dollar \nof this surplus.\n\n  I can make the same point about any number of other programs. By the \nway, let me read off a list of the programs that have been eliminated \nunder the appropriations subcommittee, and that is from the additional \nmoneys that come in. In all fairness, they haven't touched the moneys \nthat are there. They have left those alone. The additional $1.5 billion \nI previously referred to would be chopped up, and about $150 million of \nthat would have gone for these programs that are on this list, which \nare totally eliminated from the additional receipts: Indian reservation \nroads; public lands; park roads; refuge roads; national corridor \nplanning and border infrastructure, which would be principally along \nthe Mexico-Texas border; ferry boats and terminals, principally for \nAlaska.\n  Now, if you think TEA 21 is grossly unfair and ignores the special \nneeds, such as Federal lands that affect your State, I suppose it makes \nsense to take a chance that the President and the appropriators will do \na better job.\n  But you have another choice. You can support the allocation made in \nTEA 21. If you stick with TEA 21, you know exactly what to expect. \nThese surplus dollars will be allocated across the entire \ntransportation program in the same proportion as enacted by TEA 21. The \nspecial programs that benefit your State will get their fair share of \nthe surplus, just as they get a fair share of the base authorization \nunder TEA 21.\n  Let me discuss the particulars of why I believe this provision is \nlegislation on an appropriations bill and should not be included in an \nappropriations act.\n  The provision in question begins with the phrase: ``Notwithstanding \nPublic Law 105-178, or any other provision of law. . . .''\n  That phrase has long been recognized as legislative in nature. The \neffect of this provision is to overturn section 110 of title 23, which \nprovides for the apportionment of contract authority from the highway \ntrust fund.\n  Now, the Committee on Environment and Public Works has jurisdiction \nover the apportionment of contract authority from the highway trust \nfund. The Committee on Appropriations only has jurisdiction to impose \nan obligation limitation on the total amount of funds used. In other \nwords, they have a role to play and we have a role to play--we being \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  In the House appropriations bill, there is no similar provision \napportioning contract authority from the highway trust fund. Therefore, \nthe Senate provision in question is not germane to the House \nappropriations bill. I realize the Committee on Appropriations will \nlikely raise the defense of germaneness to my point of order, which I \nintend to propose.\n  Although the Appropriations subcommittee may be successful in \nidentifying some provisions to which this provision could conceivably \nbe germane, I can assure my colleagues that there is no similar \nprovision in the House bill that changes the distribution of these \nadditional gas tax receipts. If the Senate agrees with the defense of \ngermaneness, it will be saying that almost anything is germane to an \nappropriations bill, thereby undercutting the intent of rule XVI to \nlimit legislation on appropriations bills.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no against the defense of germaneness \nshould the managers raise this as a defense against the point of order \nwhich it is my intent to propose.\n  Mr. President, I have to say that I am disturbed. As you can tell \nfrom my description, this is clearly an authorizing provision. It was \nless than 2 months ago that the majority of this body came together and \nsaid the time had come to stop including authorization language on \nappropriations bills. The ink has barely dried on that resolution, and \nhere we are rewriting the rules of the Senate.\n  So at the proper time it is my intent to raise a point of order that \nthe provision which begins on page 21, line 1, through page 22, line \n11, of the committee-reported bill is legislation on an appropriations \nbill in violation of rule XVI.\n  I ask my colleagues to stand with me and put a stop to the \ndestructive practice of including legislation on appropriations \nmeasures.\n  That will be my intent. Of course, I don't make that proposal right \nnow because there are others who are prepared to speak. I look forward \nto hearing their comments.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my distinguished \ncolleague, the esteemed Senator from Rhode Island, Senator Chafee, to \nsafeguard the funding allocation of the Transportation Equity Act for \nthe 21st Century. We call it TEA 21, the Transportation Efficiency Act \nfor the 21st Century.\n  What is it? It is a very large, massive transportation bill that this \nCongress passed a couple of years ago--about $217 billion over 6 years \nin highway funds and transit funds for the States. It is very important \nlegislation to address this country's infrastructure needs.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island will soon raise a point of order under \nrule\n\n[[Page S10901]]\n\nXVI against a provision in that bill; that is, against a provision in \nthis bill before us, the Transportation appropriations bill, the \nprovision which rewrites a section of TEA 21, known as RABA. What in \nthe world is RABA? RABA is the ``revenue aligned budget authority.'' I \nwill explain that in just a second.\n  This section, the RABA section, is totally within the jurisdiction of \none committee, the Environment and Public Works Committee, the \nauthorizing committee, and thus the provision in this appropriations \nbill constitutes legislation on an appropriations bill in clear \nviolation of rule XVI.\n  Let me briefly explain how we got to this point.\n  Last week, many of us--49 of us--stood together against another \nproposal in this bill to rewrite the TEA 21 formula when this case was \nfor transit. Even though the proposed change would have reduced funds \nfor only California and New York--that is, the transit provision that \nwas earlier proposed by the Appropriations Committee--that provision \nwould have increased funds for the remaining 48 States.\n  I was pleased that my colleagues supported the provision to not \ninclude that because it was the right thing to do.\n  The transit formula agreed to in TEA 21, along with other provisions \nin TEA 21, particularly the highway provision, was part of a grand \nbargain on which we worked together so hard to write last year. Even \nthough most States would have benefited somewhat from the proposed \nchange in this bill--that is, the transit provision I mentioned--we \nstuck together to preserve the original intent of TEA 21. We voted to \nprotect the integrity of TEA 21; that is, the highway bill. We voted \nfor the program as it exists and against the Transportation Committee \nrewrite of the bill.\n  The chairman of the subcommittee then removed that provision from the \nbill. I commend him for that. It was the right action to take. I \ncompliment him for it. But, unfortunately, he solved only part of the \nproblem; that is, the transit piece. I say ``unfortunately'' because \nthe reported bill before us from the Appropriations Committee also \ncontained a provision that redistributes a portion of the highway funds \nas well.\n  These funds are known as RABA, as I mentioned earlier--revenue \naligned budget authority--that result from the greater than expected \nrevenues coming into the highway trust fund because the economy is \ndoing quite well; that is, more people are driving. The economy is \ndoing well. That means more gasoline tax revenues. The RABA provision \nanticipated that. It explained how those increased funds should be \ndealt with. This year that increases because the economy is doing well. \nIt amounts to about $1.45 billion again for the year.\n  The highway bill stakes out new ground by putting into law the \nrequirement that all gas tax revenues coming into the highway trust \nfund--that is, about $28 billion for this year--should be spent on \nhighways. That is, all gasoline tax revenue should be spent on highways \nand a portion for mass transit but not for other purposes.\n  A number of Members of this body worked very hard to achieve that \ngoal--Senators Byrd, Warner, Gramm, Lott, and many others --to say \nnothing at all about the House Members in the other body who worked \nequally hard. It is a landmark achievement. It restored some measure of \ntrust to the highway trust fund.\n  TEA 21 provided that if gas tax receipts are greater than originally \nestimated--this is the RABA provision--the increased revenue will also \ngo into the trust fund. That is what TEA 21 provides. And it will be \ndistributed in a very specific way. Again, that is what TEA 21 \nspecifically provides.\n  What did it provide? Approximately 90 percent would go to States by \nformula--that is, the core programs--and about 10 percent to a variety \nof smaller but equally important programs that were not tied to \nindividual States.\n  The chart I have now before us shows that these include--that is, \nthese other programs, the 10 percent include programs to fund roads on \nnational parks. For example, it includes Federal lands highway programs \nand Indian reservation roads.\n  Just think about all of us who have Indian reservation roads in our \nStates. The provision of the Transportation Subcommittee would say none \nof the increase would go to Indian reservation roads.\n  Public lands highways are very important to many Senators, \nparticularly their States.\n  I mention the national parks and refuge roads.\n  What about the border infrastructure program? Many Senators, when \nwriting the highway bill, came to us and said: We need a particular \nprovision in the highway bill--that is, TEA 21--to address border \ninfrastructure needs. We agreed. We put in that provision. But the \nAppropriations Committee said none of the increased funds will go to \nthat.\n  What about the national scenic byways program? It is very important \nto many States so that the picturesque highways in our States have \nfunds equally allocated as all other needs and will receive funds in \nthe event of additional dollars.\n  Ferry boats and terminals: Yes, ferry boats and terminals would get \nnone of the increase under the Transportation Committee bill--none. \nThat is wrong because it was contemplated, when we wrote this bill \ntogether, they would get that.\n  Then I mention transportation and community preservation.\n  The main point is that these were bargained-for and fought-for \nprovisions in TEA 21, the highway bill, and everyone assumed, because \nthat was the provision in the highway bill, that if there were \nadditional funds, they, too, would get their fair share of the \nincrease.\n  It is very important for Members to realize that these are provisions \nwhich have not just increased dollars because of the provisions that \nare in the Appropriations Committee bill.\n  I don't have to remind you of the difficult debates we had over \nfunding formulas among the Northeast States, the donor States, and the \nWestern States. I have to tell you that it was not easy. There were \nmany meetings. They were tough meetings. But in the end we achieved a \nbill--the TEA 21 bill--that was supported by 88 Senators. It was \nbipartisan. It was supported by Senators on both sides of the aisle.\n  It was not just a distribution of money among the States that \ngenerated so much support for TEA 21. It also is the host of the \nsmaller programs I just mentioned. They are called the allocated \nprograms or the discretionary programs in which individual Senators had \nvery specific interests.\n  Senators from Alaska, Hawaii, and New Jersey came to support \nprovisions such as ferry boats. Likewise, Senators from the public land \nStates--from Idaho, Wyoming, New Mexico, and Nevada--wanted help in \nmeeting unique needs in their States. These are the provisions we have \nwritten into the bill, the so-called allocated discretionary provisions \nthat are not included in their fair share of the increase of highway \nfunds in the bill provided for the forests.\n  Senators from border States--Texas, Arizona, New York, and \nCalifornia--needed special attention on the dilapidated border \ncrossings impeding trade and economic development in their States.\n  In the same vein, Members along potential trade corridors through the \nMidwest had individual interests they wanted to include in the bill, \nbut the provision before the Senate will not allow those provisions to \nget their fair share.\n  I mentioned Senators seeking help for scenic byways and communities \nacross our country.\n  TEA 21 was not just about funding State highway programs; it was also \nabout a broad range of transportation needs identified not just by \nStates but by individual Senators.\n  Earlier, I mentioned gas tax revenues were flowing to the trust fund \nfaster than expected, to the tune of $1.45 billion in fiscal year 2000. \nTEA 21 provided for a fair distribution of that revenue growth. Again, \nunfortunately, the Transportation appropriations bill prevents the \nallocated programs--the discretionary programs--from sharing in this \ngrowth.\n  The bill before the Senate zeros out about $120 million in funding \nfor public lands, the border crossings, ferry boats, Indian \nreservations, research, and other allocated programs, and instead \ndistributes that increase to the States\n\n[[Page S10902]]\n\nonly through the core highway programs. I am not against the core \nhighway programs. I strongly support them. But that is not the issue. \nWhat is at issue is the protection of the integrity of TEA 21 and fair \ntreatment for these allocated programs I have just mentioned.\n  Why did the appropriations bill change this part of TEA 21? Is there \na problem with the TEA 21 distribution? Is there anything wrong with \nthese programs? If there is, it is news to me. I have not heard it. \nNobody has mentioned it. More importantly, if something is flawed with \nthe distribution of these programs, let's have a hearing, get the \nfacts, and find out what is going on before we run off and start \nchanging things for no good reason. Let's do it in the committee with \njurisdiction of the highway bill, the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee.\n  Some might ask, what is all this fuss over such a small amount of \nmoney? After all, this bill redistributes only about $120 million, an \naverage increase of just one-third of 1 percent of the State's highway \ndollars. It is because I see this as a start of a very dangerous \nprocess. Highway bills are 6-year authorizations for a very good \nreason. Highways take time to plan, to design, to build. Our State \nhighway departments need some level of certainty about future funding \nlevels to plan properly.\n\n  I followed closely what my State of Montana is doing for planning \nthese projects. Stable funding is absolutely vital; stability in \nhighway spending is absolutely vital so States can plan. Without \nstability, highway and transit projects will proceed more slowly. As \nhighway construction slows down, fewer jobs will be created, economic \nactivity is reduced, working men and women--many with families to be \nsupported--will be hurt.\n  Furthermore, once we send the signal that it is open season for \nhighway funding in appropriations bills, whose ox will be gored next? \nToday it is the allocated programs, the discretionary programs, scenic \nroads, ferry boats, border crossings, park roads; today only $120 \nmillion. Tomorrow, who knows. I know Senator Chafee and I have a tough \nsell here. All 50 States will get a little more money under this bill \nthan under TEA 21. Normally, around here that is called a no brainer. \nIf it is more money, Members vote for it.\n  Look where the money comes from, and I ask if you still support this \nprovision. Tell the tribal leader the Indian road program doesn't need \nanymore money. Tell the economic development leaders in your \ncommunities that border crossings, trade corridors, don't deserve \nanymore funding. Or tell the mayors that scenic byways and ferry boats \nhave to get by with a little less than we promised last year, while \nothers get a little more than we promised.\n  Let's treat all programs fairly, let them all share in the revenue \ngrowth, not just a few.\n  This is what our Governors, highway officials, and others say about \nthe TEA 21 promises. This chart includes quotes from letters from key \nhighway user groups.\n  Trust Coalition, the main coalition that worked so hard with us as we \nput together the highway bill:\n\n       . . . remind Congress of the importance of keeping its \n     proposition in TEA 21 in the annual budgeting and \n     appropriations process.\n\n  Another letter from the American Association of State Highway and \nTransportation Officials:\n\n       Expend additional. . . annual [highway trust fund] revenues \n     . . ., and allocate them as provided under TEA 21.\n\n  From the National Governors' Association, a group this body listens \nto quite frequently and faithfully:\n\n       Ensure that all increases in revenue in the Highway Trust \n     Fund are directed to their intended purposes as outlined in \n     TEA 21.\n\n  I ask my colleagues to think very carefully about this issue. To say \nthis vote is about a few more dollars for your State on top of the \nhundreds of millions received under TEA 21 is to miss the point. Do not \npit the interests of State against the interests of public lands or \nferry boats or trade corridors or border crossings. Do not start down \nthe path of turning highway funding into a political grab bag each \nyear.\n  Unless someone can show me how the distribution formula of TEA 21 is \nbroken and needs to be fixed, I am prepared to stick with the highway \nbill.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me, Senator Chafee, and Senator Warner \nand reaffirm our support for TEA 21 and reject the redistribution \ncontained in this bill.\n  A final point: When we raise this point of order, we mean no \ndisrespect to the Appropriations Committee or its leaders. They have a \nvery difficult job to do. They have a difficult job to do in the best \nyears. This, I might add, is not the best of years with the problems \nthey are facing with the budget caps and allocations. It is a very \ndifficult problem. I understand that. I deeply respect that. They have \ntheir responsibilities and I respect that. But the authorizing \ncommittees also have their responsibilities. I hope the appropriators \nin the Senate respect that, too. That is why I supported the \nreimposition of rule XVI earlier this year. It is a matter of respect. \nThe appropriations subcommittees do their work; we respect their work. \nThe authorizing committees do their work, and we hope that work can be \nrespected, as well. That is what this issue is about. It restores the \nwill of order around here and allows the appropriations and authorizing \ncommittees to concentrate on what they know best. Let's keep it that \nway.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I pick up on the concluding note of my \ngood friend, the ranking member of our committee.\n  We marked up the bill barely 30 days ago and pledged our allegiance \nto rule XVI. Now, the essence of what this debate is all about: Are we \ngoing to do a 180 and all run downhill? What is the public going to \nthink of the Senate and how it conducts itself and how it observes its \nrules? That should be foremost in the mind of every Senator as that \nvote bell rings, hopefully, in but a few minutes, as this debate \nconcludes.\n  As our distinguished chairman and ranking member have clearly said, \nour committee worked hard, not for a month, not for 2 months. I was \nsubcommittee chairman of the subcommittee that did the initial draft of \nTEA 21.\n  It was a 2-year task, 2 years carefully going out amongst the 50 \nStates and evaluating proposals of the various Governors, of the \norganizations that devote full time to America's transportation needs \nand they came forth with a variety of proposals. We worked very \ndiligently to take all of that into consideration, and over a 2-year \nperiod we had many, many subcommittee hearings, and, indeed, hearings \nof the full committee, and crafted this legislation with the intent of \nseeking equity and fairness among the 50 States, of correcting what \nmany of us viewed as an inequity between the donor States, of which \nmine was one, and the donee States. Therein was the most difficult \nbattle. Two years' work stands on the brink of being disassembled on \nthis vote. The precedent of rule XVI stands to be stripped down \nmomentarily on this vote.\n  As my colleague from Montana stated, if this provision regarding the \nsurplus is changed, what is next year? Is it the donee-donor fight? \nDoes that become the next debate within the appropriations cycle? It \nwas for the very reason this institution has regarded this legislation \nas law it should remain intact for 6 years. This is not a 1-year bill \nor a 2-year bill; this is a 6-year bill, a formula to remain in place \nto provide equity among the States for 6 years. Momentarily, the vote \nwill be taken to make the first break, barely after 1 year of operation \nof this bill.\n  There is a tradition in this great body not to personalize anything, \nbut I just happened to observe there were 70 Senators who sought the \nexact provision that is the subject of this amendment, and that was a \n10-percent set-aside for Federal programs. Seventy Senators came to our \ncommittee with a wide range of programs they felt were essential for \ntheir States which would not be covered in the general disbursal of the \nbalance of the 90 percent. How interesting, the State of New Jersey \nfought hard for the Intelligent Transportation Systems funds, ITS; the \nState of Alabama fought hard for new corridor programs and ARC, just \ntwo little footnotes.\n  I urge Senators to go back--we have it here in the correspondence--\nand have the staffs advise their Senators what they asked of the \nEnvironment\n\n[[Page S10903]]\n\nand Public Works Committee, and what was included in this bill in \ndirect recognition of their needs, 70 colleagues. That is the reason \nfor the creation of this provision.\n  Our chairman mentioned the House. The House appropriations bill, I \nsay to the chairman, as he well knows, had a number of provisions in \nthere which his counterpart, Congressman Shuster, recognized as \nlegislation on an appropriations bill. He went to the floor of the \nHouse, and in 18 consecutive instances the House backed up their \nchairman and struck those provisions, one by one, from that bill.\n  I daresay, should this provision survive, regrettably, that same \nchairman will see in conference that it is removed. That is why I think \nit is incumbent on our body to likewise remove this legislation, and at \nthe same time uphold the credibility of our action some 30 days ago and \nreaffirm rule XVI. This is equity. This is legislative process to \nachieve that equity.\n  We put in place a magnificent piece of legislation, accepted all \nacross America. As I traveled my State this summer, I saw instance \nafter instance of construction on our roads. I said to myself: There is \nthe taxpayers' money coming back from the highway trust fund, going \nstraight to the States, and now being used to improve our system. It is \nworking. TEA 21 is working. That is why we are here today, to ask our \ncolleagues to let it remain intact because it is serving the purpose \nfor which this body adopted it but a year ago.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I believe it is important that all Members \nof the Senate clearly understand the distribution of revenue aligned \nbudget authority--that we called RABA--which the subcommittee \nintegrated into this bill.\n  The philosophy of the Transportation Act for the 21st century was \nthat highway funding is intrinsically linked to receipts to the highway \naccount of the highway trust fund, and that increased gas tax receipts \nshould be passed along to the States for highway construction and \nimprovement projects.\n  The provision in TEA 21 that I described is a mechanism to guarantee \nadditional revenue in the trust fund from greater than anticipated gas \ntax receipts would be spent for that purpose. The Transportation \nAppropriations Subcommittee's provision, which we have been talking \nabout, ensures this intent is met and it is completely consistent with \nthe spirit of TEA 21.\n  The President's budget submission, however, requested to divert a \nthird of these funds away from the Federal aid highway program to fund \nother programs and their initiatives. The subcommittee rejected this \napproach. Instead, we adopted one that honors the commitment Congress \nmade to the States when it passed TEA 21, which I supported along with \nothers.\n  Our bill sends the funds directly to the States in order to maximize \nthe Federal resources flowing to each State. I want to be clear this \nafternoon. This does not alter the TEA 21 formula. It, in fact, \nembraces the formula by strictly adhering to each State's individual \nguaranteed share under section 1105 of TEA 21.\n  This is one of those rare instances where Congress is able to put \nforward a proposal that benefits every Member in every State in the \nUnion. Within a constrained Federal budget, it is an approach which \nincreases the amount that is available to the States for highway \nconstruction. I believe it makes sense and at the proper time I believe \nmy colleagues--I hope, at least, they will support it.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the chairman yield for a question?\n  Mr. SHELBY. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. He says it does not change the formula. But, if he had \nnothing in his legislation, these funds would flow in accordance with \nTEA 21. He is putting a switch in the track that diverts that 10 \npercent. I say to my good friend, that is clear documentation of a \nchange to the formula.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I will answer that. It says in the bill:\n\n       Provided further, That notwithstanding Public Law 105-178 \n     as amended, or any other provision of law, funds authorized \n     under section 110 of title 23, United States Code, for the \n     fiscal year 2000 shall be apportioned based on each State's \n     percentage share of funding provided for under section 105 of \n     title 23, United States Code, for fiscal year 2000.\n\n  That is the formula of TEA 21.\n  Mr. WARNER. If I may say, Mr. President, it is that first word, \n``notwithstanding''--one of those magical words that resonates in this \nChamber to signal this law is being changed, this formula is being \nchanged. If you did not have this provision in there, these funds would \nflow precisely as this Chamber directed those funds to flow when they \noverwhelmingly adopted TEA 21.\n  I say to my good friend, it is clear as the light of this given day \nwhat is taking place.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Who has the floor?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I want to point out the provision referred to by the \ndistinguished chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on \nTransportation in his own bill says clearly ``notwithstanding Public \nLaw 105-178.'' Even though the law says differently, this is what the \ncommittee is going to find. The committee's own language indicates that \nit is a change because the committee's language says, as just reported \nby the chairman of the committee, notwithstanding the ISTEA bill; that \nis, in spite of the ISTEA bill, this is the change we are going to \nmake.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, my colleague from Montana is correct. I \nsee my good friend from New Jersey standing. Why don't I ask him: Would \nnot the result of what you are requesting be simply asking the Senate \nto go up the hill on rule XVI, turn around, and run down the hill?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, in deference to my friend and \ncolleague from Virginia, I am going to decline to answer the question \nthat he puts to frame my speech. After I deliver my message, then I \nwill be happy to respond. Perhaps I will have covered the turnaround \nthe Senator describes. I will wait until I get the floor before I take \na question.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am happy to yield the floor and await with eagerness \nfor a reply to my question.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I hope the Senator has a glass of water there. I am \ngoing to deliver my missive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, what we are seeing is much more a \nquestion of interpretation rather than a violation of the rule. Because \nthe distinguished Senator from Virginia says we had agreed to a \nspecific 10 percent, I think more accurately, in all due respect, is \nthat we agreed to sums of money that added up to approximately 10 \npercent of the total funding. The programs that were detailed in the \nlist that was going to be supported have grown, by the way. They have \ngrown as the appropriations have grown for highway funding.\n  The one thing to which I want to return, and I am sorry our colleague \nfrom Alabama is not here because I want him to know I agree fully with \nwhat he has said thus far and the proposition that we are considering, \nand that is extra moneys that are found in the surplus go directly to \nthe States to finance their programs as they see them.\n  It is funny because so often we have a debate about States rights and \nBig Brother Government and that kind of thing. But here we are, some of \nus find ourselves on opposite sides of the debate. The fact of the \nmatter is that each State--and I want my colleagues to know this--is \ngoing to get more money. They are going to decide where the highway \nneeds are in their States. They are going to decide what is critical, \nand they are going to decide it in a year in which the whole country is \nburdened with congestion. Those States will have those moneys to use \nfor highway construction or as they see fit under their programs.\n  The fact we agreed to a series of programs at the time TEA 21 was \ndeveloped, and though there was a lot of hard work--and I respect the \nwork the Senator from Rhode Island and the Senator from Montana did on \nTEA 21--I disagreed with them. They knew it. I voted finally for the \nbill because they had some compromises thrown in. My State went from \none level of funding in the formula to a lower level, when my State \nsends more money to this Federal Government than any State in the\n\n[[Page S10904]]\n\ncountry. They said: Frank, agree with us because we will take care of \nyou in this program or that program to try to get a compromise.\n  Believe me, if I had the 50 other votes, I would not have agreed, but \nI did not have them. So I went along. It was not a happy day. It wasn't \na happy day for New Jersey or this Senator who serves, by the way, on \nboth the EPW Committee as well as the Appropriations Committee.\n  What we are seeing is a nuclear explosion in the middle of a chance \nto dynamite a new hole for a new road. I understand how jurisdictions \nwant to be preserved, and I support that. But the fact is, I agree with \nthe chairman of the subcommittee that this is our interpretation of how \nthat money, how that surplus should be spent.\n  I point out to our colleagues who may be listening who are going to \nvote on this, every one of your States get more money directly for the \nprograms on what your transportation commissioners, your Governors want \nto spend money. I do not know that we have heard from any Governors who \nhave called up and said: Listen, don't give us that extra money, put it \ninto those Federal programs. I do not think that message goes \nparticularly well out there.\n  The message that does go well out there is your States get more \nmoney. All of the programs that were detailed in TEA 21 are fully \nfinanced as outlined in the original TEA 21 legislation, and each one \nof them has gotten more money as a result of the expanded funding \navailable. So we are not cheating anybody. What we are saying is that \nas we see it, these funds should be distributed directly to the States, \nsimplify it rather than winding up with I do not know how small the \nsmallest change would be on the list of programs, but it would get down \nto relatively tiny sums of money. We give it to the States. It is done \nclearly and everybody understands it.\n\n  My friend from Virginia--this is my closing remark--talked about the \nITS program that I worked so hard on, intelligent vehicles. Notice I \nnever said intelligent drivers. Intelligent vehicles was a program I \nworked very hard to get.\n  New Jersey, I am told, gets $5 million, I say to the Senator from \nVirginia, out of that $211 million that we are devoting to intelligent \ntransportation systems. New Jersey, though it deserves far more, only \nhas a very small percentage of that. It was not New Jersey based. That \nwas a program I felt strongly about for my country and for the benefit \nof those who drive across the highways and the byways of this great \nNation, including reducing congestion wherever we can and expediting \ntraffic flow. That is what that was. That was not a ``New Jersey \nspecial,'' I can assure the Senator.\n  I hope when all is said and done, and very often more is said than is \ndone, we will have our colleagues' support and carry this bill. Let's \nget done with it. Yes, the debate was worthwhile having because our \ncolleagues wanted it and we respect our colleagues, the Senator from \nRhode Island, the Senator from Virginia, the Senator from Montana, but \nwe differ with them. We have a job of getting this bill out and into \nthe hands of those who are going to be using it for their construction \nneeds in the next year, and we ought to move along with it as quickly \nas we can.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I want to talk about germaneness for just \na minute. I know the point of order has not been made yet, but I want \nmy colleagues to know that the Senators who could raise the rule XVI \npoint of order are trying to characterize the bill's RABA provision as \nnot germane to this bill. But before bringing this provision to the \nfloor, we checked again with the Parliamentarian, and he indicated the \ndefense of germaneness did, in fact, exist on this provision by virtue \nof legislative language in the House-passed text.\n  This language was not drafted with the goal of creating germane \nlanguage. If my colleagues will recall, the rule XVI point of order was \nreestablished after this bill had been reported from committee and we \ndid not need to modify the provision in order to make it germane. It is \ngermane because it is germane, and it is consistent with rule XVI.\n  What my colleagues are asking--if they do this--is to rule against a \nprovision that is clearly germane pursuant to existing Senate rules \nunder rule XVI. I urge my colleagues to reject at that time, if that is \ndone, that proposition and uphold the germaneness of this provision.\n  My colleagues have probably thrown a lot of smoke at you as to why \nyou should not support the existing Senate appropriations provision, \nthings such as preserving the genius of TEA 21. Some Western or public \nland States may get hurt under this provision, but do not let this \nconfuse you.\n  Be careful, I would suggest, when Members argue jurisdiction and in \nthe same breath claim that your State might--yes, I repeat, might--be \ndisadvantaged by a provision, and then raise a point of order--if they \ndo--rather than voting on the merits of the issue.\n  Why? Because what the Appropriations Committee has done is simple and \nstraightforward and directly benefits every State. Let me be clear \nagain. Every State will receive more money because of this provision \nbecause all the money will go directly to the States with fewer strings \nattached than it would otherwise.\n  In addition, the money will get to the States sooner, so they can \ntackle the most critical transportation problems without having to wait \non some Washington bureaucrats to deem their problems worthy of Federal \nfunding.\n  I believe it is clear that we cannot--yes, we cannot--always count on \nthe Washington bureaucrats to be fair and impartial when making \ndecisions about these discretionary highway funding issues.\n  In fact, I have here a General Accounting Office study--a copy of the \nstudy is on the desk--that shows that the Department of Transportation \ndoes not always follow its own policies when distributing discretionary \nhighway funds and that the distribution process can be highly \npoliticized.\n  The Appropriations Committee provision does not hurt Western or \npublic land States in any way. Each of these States will have a \nguaranteed increase in highway funds, and they will get their money \nearlier. They can use these additional resources on public lands \nprojects or whatever they want.\n  So why raise a point of order--if, in fact, they do--as I anticipate, \ninstead of voting on the provision? Because the opponents know they are \nasking Members to vote against their own States' interests. They are \nhoping you will not see that if the vote is on the point of order.\n  What the Members objecting to the appropriations provision are asking \nyou to do is forgo two birds in the hand, we might say, on the off \nchance that there might be a smaller bird in the bush somewhere else. \nThink about it. Not a very good deal, in this Senator's estimation, and \nnot one which is in the best interests of any Senator's State. If you \nthink so, check with your Governor in your State.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SHELBY. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senator says this legislation on his \nappropriations bill is germane because he says in the House bill there \nis language which redistributes the funds. Therefore, he says it is \ngermane.\n  I ask the Senator if he could point out to me where that language is \nin the House bill. And let me say, before the Senator answers the \nquestion, that it is highly unlikely, as all Members of this body know, \nthat such language exists, because the chairman of the Transportation \nCommittee in the House, Mr. Shuster, would not stand for it.\n  So I would like, if the Senator could, for him to show me in his bill \nwhere----\n  Mr. SHELBY. Reclaiming my time, I want to answer that, if I may.\n  We have checked with the Parliamentarian. That is why we have a \nParliamentarian here, among other things, for guidance at times. We \nhave been told that the affirmative defense of germaneness would lie \nhere because of the legislation.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Could the Senator point out the language?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Because of H.R. 2084, the House bill, on page 15.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Could the Senator cite the language?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Page 15. I will read it to you, the language, on page 15, \nwhere\n\n[[Page S10905]]\n\nit says: ``Federal-Aid Highways, (Liquidation of Contract \nAuthorization), Highway Trust Fund).''\n\n       For carrying out the provisions of title 23, United States \n     Code, that are attributable to Federal-aid highways, \n     including the National Scenic and Recreational Highway as \n     authorized by 23 U.S.C. 148, not otherwise provided, \n     including reimbursement for sums expended pursuant to the \n     provisions of 23 U.S.C. 308, $26,125,000,000 or so much \n     thereof as may be available in and derived from the Highway \n     Trust Fund, to remain available until expended.\n\n  That is the provision.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I say, with all respect to my very good \nfriend and colleague, that language refers to just spending the money \nthat must be spent under ISTEA. There is no language there which \naddresses a reallocation of additional dollars. I must very \nrespectfully say to my good friend, the language he cited does not in \nany way purport to do what he likes to say it does.\n  I just follow up by saying that what this comes down to is respect. \nWe in the authorizing committee respect the job of the Appropriations \nCommittee. They have a very difficult job. They do their work very \nwell. I just hope the Appropriations Committee members will respect the \nwork of the authorizing committee.\n  As the Senator from Virginia pointed out, there is a reason that this \nis a 6-year bill, that every year we do not come back and try to pass a \nhighway bill. It is because of the nature of the beast. Highway \nlegislation requires long-term planning. It does not make sense for \nthis body to start going down the road--no pun intended--of starting to \nrewrite the highway bill every year in the Transportation \nAppropriations Committee. That is just bad public policy. It is the \nwrong thing to do. I think every Member knows it is the wrong thing to \ndo, if he or she just stops to think about it.\n  I thank the Chair and my colleague very much, and particularly I \nthank my friend and colleague from Rhode Island, the leader of our \ncommittee, who is bringing this issue to our attention.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, in light of the discussion today about \nweather, indeed, the Appropriations Committee has gotten into the \nauthorization area, let's just take a look at what has happened to this \nbill, what the major changes are.\n  There are some very substantial changes in this bill to TEA 21. What \nwe are talking about is the additional money that is coming in. In that \ncase, the additional money totals $1.5 billion. About $150 million of \nthat has been set aside--has been in the past and would be, but for \nthis legislation--for a series of programs that we thought were \nnecessary--indeed, the whole Senate did, and the Congress did--for the \ngood of our Nation.\n  So what are we talking about? We are talking about is that Indian \nreservation roads don't get a nickel. They don't get a nickel from the \nadditional moneys under the proposal of the Appropriations Subcommittee \non Transportation: Public land roads, not a nickel; park roads, not a \nnickel; refuge roads in our wildlife refuges, where we have had \ntestimony that the roads are just in atrocious condition, desperately \nneed money; the national corridor planning of the border \ninfrastructure, where there is a lineup of trucks under NAFTA trying to \ncome into the country, and we set aside money to give them some \nassistance; ferry boats and terminals, $2 million they would get from \nthe funds but for the amendment of the Subcommittee on Transportation.\n  So there is no question but that there are major changes in this \nlegislation by the Appropriations Committee, getting deeply into the \nterritory where we spent months trying to work out a compromise in the \nauthorization committee.\n  It is my understanding that all who wished to speak have spoken on \nthis.\n  I now raise a point of order that the provision which begins on page \n21, line 1, through line 11 on page 22, of the language added by the \ncommittee-reported bill is legislation on an appropriations bill in \nviolation of rule XVI.\n  I ask my colleagues to stand with me and put a stop to the \ndestructive practice of including legislation on appropriations \nmeasures.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Rule XVI \nmotion offered by my colleagues, Senators Baucus and Chafee.\n  The changes to the TEA 21 funding formulas included in the \ntransportation appropriations bill are unacceptable. They will have a \nsevere impact on the ability of the National Park Service, the Fish and \nWildlife Service, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs to meet their \nresponsibilities in managing our nation's public land trust.\n  The question we face today on this appropriations bill is one of many \nthat will determine the answer to the larger question, can we live up \nto the legacy of our forefathers and protect our federal land trust?\n  We are beginning the third century of our nation's history. The first \nand second were highlighted by activism on public lands issues.\n  The first century was marked by the Louisiana Purchase, and added \nalmost 530 million acres to the United States, which changed America \nfrom an eastern, coastal nation to one covering the entire continent.\n  The second century was marked by additions to the public land trust, \nled by President Theodore Roosevelt.\n  While in White House between 1901 and 1909, he designated 150 \nNational Forests; the first 51 Federal Bird Reservations; 5 National \nParks; the first 18 National Monuments; the first 4 National Game \nPreserves; and the first 21 Reclamation Projects.\n  He also established the National Wildlife refuge System, beginning \nwith the Pelican Island National Wildlife Refuge in Florida in 1903.\n  Together, these projects equated to federal protection for almost 230 \nmillion acres, a land area equivalent to that of all the East coast \nstates from Maine to Florida and just under one-half of the area \npurchased in the Louisiana purchase.\n  Roosevelt said, ``We must ask ourselves if we are leaving for future \ngenerations an environment that is as good, or better, than what we \nfound.''\n  As we enter the third century of our history, we must again ask \nourselves this question and take action to meet this challenge.\n  The action taken with the language in the Transportation \nAppropriations bill does not meet this challenge.\n  In 1916, Congress created the National Park Service:\n\n       . . . To conserve the scenery and the natural and historic \n     objects and the wildlife therein and to provide for the \n     enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as \n     will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future \n     generations.\n\n  The ``unimpaired'' status of our national parks and our refuges is \nat-risk. The language in the Transportation Appropriations amendment \nwould reduce funds in the Federal Lands Highways Program by $1 million \nfor the Fish and Wildlife Service; $12 million for the National Park \nService; and $14 million for the Bureau of Indian Affairs.\n  The National Park System and the Fish and Wildlife Service have \nextreme needs for these funds. We are all aware of the infrastructure \nneeds for transportation faced by Grand Canyon National Park that were \nhighlighted in the August 20 USA Today. I ask unanimous consent that \nthis article be inserted into the Congressional Record.\n  The Fish and Wildlife Service has similar needs within the National \nWildlife Refuge System. Last year, in the state of Florida, the \nWildlife Drive at the J.N. Ding Darling National Wildlife Refuge \nlocated on Sanibel Island, Florida was closed for over 2 weeks when one \nof the seven water control structures under the road was washed out by \nheavy rains.\n  After this incident, the Ft. Myers Daily editorialized on this \nsubject, stating:\n\n       The Wildlife Drive is a huge success, a blessing to the old \n     and infirm who can comfortably enjoy great recreation from \n     their cars. It's a place where countless curious novices and \n     bored children have been bitten by the bug of bird watching . \n     . .

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. ____. (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) The survival of American culture is dependent upon the \n     survival of the sacred institution of marriage.\n       (2) The decennial census is required by section 2 of \n     article 1 of the Constitution of the United States, and has \n     been conducted in every decade since 1790.\n       (3) The decennial census has included marital status among \n     the information sought from every American household since \n     1880.\n       (4) The 2000 decennial census will mark the first decennial \n     census since 1880 in which marital status will not be a \n     question included on the census questionnaire distributed to \n     the majority of American households.\n       (5) The United States Census Bureau has removed marital \n     status from the short form census questionnaire to be \n     distributed to the majority of American households in the \n     2000 decennial census and placed that category of information \n     on the long form census questionnaire to be distributed only \n     to a sample of the population in that decennial census.\n       (6) Every year more than $100,000,000,000 in Federal funds \n     are allocated based on the data collected by the Census \n     Bureau.\n       (7) Recorded data on marital status provides a basic \n     foundation for the development of Federal policy.\n       (8) Census data showing an exact account of the numbers of \n     persons who are married, single, or divorced provides \n     critical information which serves as an indicator on the \n     prevalence of marriage in society.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     the United States Census Bureau--\n       (1) has wrongfully decided not to include marital status on \n     the census questionnaire to be distributed to the majority of \n     Americans for the 2000 decennial census; and\n       (2) should include marital status on the short form census \n     questionnaire to be distributed to the majority of American \n     households for the 2000 decennial census.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, Americans should be disturbed that the U.S. \nCensus Bureau obviously no longer regards marriage as having any \nimportance.\n  When the Census Bureau compiled its list of questions to be included \nin the 2000 decennial survey, the decision was obvious that it would be \nunnecessary and burdensome for the Bureau to include marital status in \nthe census forms sent to the majority of American households.\n  So the Census Bureau decided to delete the marital status question \nfrom the census ``short form'' which it is called--which goes to \napproximately 83 percent of the American population--but continue to \nuse the question on the ``long form''--which goes only to approximately \n17 percent of the American population.\n  This will mark the first time since 1880 that the decennial census \nwill not gather from the majority of the U.S. population, a count of \nthose who are single, married, divorced, or widowed. This is especially \ndisturbing, at least to this Senator, when one considers that the \nsurvival of the American culture is dependent upon the survival of the \nsacred institution of marriage. Moreover, marital status has heretofore \nregularly been viewed as vital information because there has always \nbeen great value placed in the institution of marriage.\n  It is irresponsible for the U.S. Government to suggest or imply that \nmarriage is no longer significant or important, but that is precisely \nthe message that will go out if marital status is eliminated from the \nshort form by the Census Bureau.\n  However, Mr. President, the Census Bureau feels far differently when \nit comes to compiling statistics on various other things including \nrace. The Census Bureau made it a top priority to learn the race of the \nmajority of Americans; therefore the agency is asking, not one, but two \nquestions relating to racial identity.\n  One can only speculate the reasoning behind this bizarre maneuver \nremoving marital status from the short form, while asking two questions \nabout race. It's important to remember that every year, more than $100 \nbillion in Federal funding is awarded based on the data collected by \nthe Census Bureau. Considering that American people will foot the bill \non the Census Bureau's strange inclinations, should not Congress remind \nthe U.S. Census Bureau that its job is not to seek out information to \npromote a social agenda.\n  For this reason, Mr. President, I am offering a sense-of-the-Senate \namendment to the Transportation appropriations bill, expressing that \nthe U.S. Census Bureau was wrong to eliminate\n\n[[Page S10907]]\n\nmarital status from the census short form. The U.S. Census Bureau \nshould include marital status on the short form census questionnaire--\nthe one going out to the vast majority of Americans for the 2000 \ndecennial census.\n  Unfortunately, most of the census short form questionnaires have \nalready been printed without the important marital status question \nbeing included. Notwithstanding that, does not Congress have a moral \nobligation, as caretaker of America's culture, to set the record \nstraight in emphasizing that marriage is still at the forefront of \nAmerica's national survey?\n  I believe this sense-of-the-Senate resolution deserves careful \nconsideration of all Senators, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I yield the floor. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Helms \namendment, which I understand is the pending business, be temporarily \nset aside.

Mr. President, I ask the Chair to lay before the Senate \namendment No. 1661.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama (Mr. Shelby), for Mr. Daschle, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1661.\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following \n     new section:\n\n     SEC. ____.

I inquire of the Chair what the pending business before \nthe Senate is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two amendments have been set aside to the \nTransportation appropriations bill. Therefore, an amendment is \nappropriate at this time.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I am not here to present an amendment. I am interested \nin knowing if the pending amendment is the Gorton amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Gorton amendment was the first amendment \nset aside.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I am interested in speaking on that amendment at this \npoint, if that is in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1677\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, there are a number of us on the floor who \nwant to speak about this issue. Earlier we heard from the proponents of \nthe amendment. They brought it to the floor at a time when those of us \nwho opposed the amendment were not in position to respond. I know there \nis a desire, and we certainly are amenable, to get to a vote in the \nnext hour and a half, or so. We would like to have an opportunity to \npresent our side of this debate, at least for a reasonable period of \ntime, and if there needs to be a further time agreement, then we will \nbe able to enter into one.\n  I see Senator Levin on the floor and Senator Ashcroft. I know they \nwould like to follow. I ask unanimous consent that following my \nremarks, Senators Ashcroft and Levin be permitted to speak prior to any \nother speakers on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment offered by Senators \nGorton, Feinstein, and Bryan.\n  I oppose this amendment because it will impose an unnecessary and \nunacceptable burden on the working men and women of this country, and \nof my state in particular.\n  Throughout Michigan, men and women are working hard every day to \nproduce the cars that make our economy and our nation move. They and \ntheir families depend on the jobs produced by our automobile \nmanufacturing industry, just as the rest of us depend on the cars they \nproduce.\n\n[[Page S10908]]\n\n  But those jobs and Michigan's economy are jeopardized by efforts to \nincrease standards for corporate average fuel economy or CAFE.\n  I have come to the floor because I want to make certain that my \ncolleagues are aware of the extremely serious impact of increased CAFE \nstandards, not just on Michigan, but on every state in the union. And \nmake no mistake, increased CAFE standards are the intention of the \namendment we are debating today, and will be the result should it be \nadopted.\n  The Federal Government currently mandates that auto manufacturers \nmaintain an average fuel economy of 27.5 miles per gallon for cars, and \n20.7 miles per gallon for sport utility vehicles and light trucks.\n  Since 1995 Congress has prohibited federal transportation funds from \nbeing used to unilaterally increase these standards. We have recognized \nthat it is our duty, as legislators, to make policy in this important \narea of economic and environmental concern.\n  Now, however, a number of my colleagues are calling for an end to \nthis congressional authority. This sense-of-the-Senate urges the Senate \nconferees to the Transportation appropriation bill to reject the House \nfunding prohibition on raising CAFE standards.\n  It does not call for the Department of Transportation to study the \nbenefits and costs of raising CAFE standards, as some proponents of \nthis amendment have suggested. Rather, the amendment states: ``The \nSenate should not recede to section 320 of this bill, as passed by the \nHouse of Representatives, which prevents an increase in CAFE \nstandards.''\n  Make no mistake and I reiterate this, if the House funding \nprohibition is stripped from this bill, the Department of \nTransportation will raise CAFE standards. Current law requires D.O.T. \nto set CAFE standards each year at the ``maximum feasible fuel economy \nlevel.'' And the Secretary is not authorized to just ``study'' CAFE. He \nmust act by regulation to set new CAFE standards each year.\n  In 1994, the last year prior to the CAFE freeze, the administration \nbegan rulemaking on new CAFE standards. Department of Transportation's \nApril 6, 1994 proposal referenced feasible higher CAFE levels for \ntrucks of 15 to 35 percent above the current standard.\n  So let us be clear, this is not and never has been about a study. \nThis proposed sense-of-the-Senate amendment is a precursor to higher \nCAFE standards on Sport Utility Vehicles and light trucks.\n  Mr. President, this action is misguided. It will hurt the working \nfamilies of Michigan. It will undermine American competitiveness. And \nit will reduce passenger safety.\n  Higher CAFE requirements cost jobs. It really is that simple. Let me \nexplain what I mean.\n  To meet increased CAFE requirements, automakers must make design and \nmaterial changes to their cars. Those changes cost money, and force \nAmerican manufacturers to build cars that are smaller, less powerful \nand less popular with consumers.\n  In addition, the National Academy of Sciences found that raising CAFE \nrequirements to 35 mpg would increase the average vehicle's cost by \nabout $2,500. And that is just a low-end estimate.\n  Japanese automakers have escaped these costs because sky-high \ngasoline prices in their home markets forced them to make smaller, \nlighter cars years ago. Increased CAFE requirements will continue to \nfavor Japanese auto makers. And that means they will continue to place \nan uneven burden on American automobile workers.\n  Increased CAFE standards also reduce consumer choice, contrary to the \nassertions made in the earlier debate.\n  For example, the principal reason full sized station wagons have \ndisappeared from the market is the need to meet fleet mileage \nrequirements under the CAFE program.\n  Full-size station wagons, long popular with the American public, \nsimply cannot be engineered economically to achieve high enough gas \nmileage to make them worth selling.\n  Consumers suffer when their choices are narrowed. and auto makers and \ntheir employees suffer when they are forced to make cars the public \nsimply does not want.\n  In a statement before the Consumer Subcommittee of the Senate \nCommerce Committee, Dr. Marina Whitman of General Motors notes that in \n1982:\n\n       We were forced to close two assembly plants which had been \n     fully converted to produce our new, highly fuel-efficient \n     compact and mid-size cars. The cost of these conversions was \n     $130 million, but the plants were closed because demand for \n     those cars did not develop during a period of sharply \n     declining gasoline prices.\n\n  This story could be repeated for every major American automaker, Mr. \nPresident. And the effects on our overall economy have been \ndevastating.\n  The American auto industry accounts for one in seven U.S. jobs. \nSteel, transportation, electronics, literally dozens of industries \nemploying thousands upon thousands of American depend on the health of \nour auto industry.\n  Our automakers simply cannot afford to pay the fines imposed on them \nif they fail to reach CAFE standards, or to build cars that Americans \nwill not buy. In either case the real victims are American workers and \nconsumers.\n  Nor should we forget, that American automakers are investing almost \n$1 billion every year in research to develop more fuel efficient \nvehicles.\n  Indeed, we do not need to turn to the punitive, disruptive methods of \nCAFE standards to increase fuel economy for American vehicles.\n  Since 1993, the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles has \nbrought together government agencies and the auto industries to conduct \njoint research--research that is making significant progress and will \nbridge the gap to real world applications after 2000.\n  By enhancing research cooperation, the Partnership for a New \nGeneration of Vehicles will help our auto industry develop vehicles \nthat are more easily recyclable, have lower emissions, and can achieve \nup to triple the fuel efficiency of today's midsize family sedans. All \nthis while producing cars that retain performance, utility, safety, and \neconomy.\n  We have made solid progress toward making vehicles that achieve \ngreater fuel economy without sacrificing the qualities consumers \ndemand.\n  Finally, I wish to address the issue of vehicle safety. For a number \nof years now, the federal government has taken the lead in mandating \nadditional safety features on automobiles in an attempt to reduce the \nnumber of lives lost in auto accidents.\n  How ironic to learn that federal CAFE requirements have been costing \nlives all this time.\n  The Competitive Enterprise Institute recently estimated that between \n2,600 and 4,500 drivers and passengers die every year as a result of \nCAFE-induced auto downsizing.\n  USA Today, in a special section devoted to the issue of CAFE \nstandards and auto safety, calculated CAFE's cumulative death toll at \n46,000.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the July 2, 1999, USA Today series on \nCAFE be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From USA TODAY, July 2, 1999]\n\n                          Death by the Gallon\n\n                          (By James R. Healey)\n\n       A USA TODAY analysis of previously unpublished fatality \n     statistics discovers that 46,000 people have died because of \n     a 1970s-era push for greater fuel efficiency that has led to \n     smaller cars.\n       Californian James Bragg, who helps other people buy cars, \n     knows he'll squirm when his daughter turns 16.\n       ``She's going to want a little Chevy Cavalier or something. \n     I'd rather take the same 10 to 12 thousand bucks and put it \n     into a 3-year-old (full-size Mercury) Grand Marquis, for \n     safety.\n       ``I want to go to her high school graduation, not her \n     funeral.''\n       Hundreds of people are killed in small-car wrecks each year \n     who would survive in just slightly bigger, heavier vehicles, \n     government and insurance industry research shows.\n       More broadly, in the 24 years since a landmark law to \n     conserve fuel, bug cars have shrunk to less-safe sizes and \n     small cars have poured onto roads. As a result, 46,000 people \n     have died in crashes they would have survived in bigger, \n     heavier cars, according to USA TODAY's analysis of crash data \n     since 1975, when the Energy Policy and Conservation Act was \n     passed.\n       The law and the corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) \n     standards it imposed have improved fuel efficiency. The \n     average of passenger vehicles on U.S. roads is 20 miles per \n     gallon vs. 14 mpg in 1975.\n       But the cost has been roughly 7,700 deaths for every mile \n     per gallon gained, the analysis shows.\n\n[[Page S10909]]\n\n       Small cars--those no bigger or heavier than Chevrolet \n     Cavalier or Dodge Neon--comprise 18% of all vehicles on the \n     road, according to an analysis of R.L. Polk registration \n     data. Yet they accounted for 37% of vehicle deaths in 1997--\n     12,144 people--according to latest available government \n     figures. That's about twice the death rate in big cars, such \n     as Dodge Intrepid, Chevrolet Impala, Ford Crown Victoria\n       ``We have a small-car problem. If you want to solve the \n     safety puzzle, get rid of small cars,'' says Brian O'Neill, \n     president of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The \n     institute, supported by auto insurers, crash-tests more \n     vehicles, more violently, than all but the federal \n     government.\n       Little cars have big disadvantages in crashes. They have \n     less space to absorb crash forces. The less the car absorbs, \n     the more the people inside have to.\n       And small cars don't have the weight to protect themselves \n     in crashes with other vehicles. When a small car and a larger \n     one collide, the bigger car stops abruptly; that's bad \n     enough. But the little one slams to a stop, then instantly \n     and violently accelerates backward as the heavier car's \n     momentum powers into it. People inside the lighter car \n     experience body-smashing levels of force in two directions, \n     first as their car stops moving forward, then as it reverses. \n     In the heavier car, bodies are subjected to less destructive \n     deceleration and no ``bounce-back.''\n       The regulations don't mandate small cars. but small, \n     lightweight vehicles that can perform satisfactorily using \n     low-power , fuel-efficient engines are the only affordable \n     way automakers have found to meet the CAFE (pronounced ka-FE) \n     standards.\n       Some automakers acknowledge the danger.\n       ``A small car, even with the best engineering available-- \n     physics says a large car will win,'' says Jack Collins, \n     Nissan's U.S. marketing chief.\n       Tellingly, most small-car crash deaths involve only small \n     cars--56% in 1997, from the latest government data. They run \n     into something else, such as a tree, or into one another.\n       In contrast, just 1% of small-car deaths--136 people--\n     occurred in crashes with midsize or big sport-utility \n     vehicles in '97, according to statistics from the National \n     Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the agency that \n     enforces safety and fuel-efficiency rules. NHTSA does not \n     routinely publish that information. It performed special data \n     calculations at USA TODAY's request.\n       Champions of small cars like to point out that even when \n     the SUV threat is unmasked, other big trucks remain a \n     nemesis. NHTSA data shows, however, that while crashes with \n     pickups, vans and commercial trucks accounted for 28% of \n     small-car deaths in '97, such crashes also accounted for 36% \n     of large-car deaths.\n       Others argue that small cars attract young, inexperienced \n     drivers. There's some truth there, but not enough to explain \n     small cars' out-of-proportion deaths. About 36% of small-car \n     drivers involved in fatal crashes in 1997 were younger than \n     25; and 25% of the drivers of all vehicles involved in fatal \n     wrecks were that age, according to NHTSA data.\n\n\n                          gas shortage worries\n\n       U.S. motorists have flirted with small cars for years, \n     attracted, in small numbers, to nimble handling, high fuel \n     economy and low prices that make them the only new cars some \n     people can afford.\n       ``Small cars fit best into some consumers' pocketbooks and \n     drive-ways,'' says Clarence Ditlow, head of the Center for \n     Auto Safety, a consumer-activist organization in Washington.\n       Engineer and construction manager Kirk Sandvoss of \n     Springfield, Ohio, who helped two family members shop for \n     subcompacts recently, says that's all the car needed.\n       ``We built three houses with a VW bug and a utility \n     trailer. We made more trips to the lumber yard than a guy \n     with a pickup truck would, but we got by. Small cars will \n     always be around.''\n       But small cars have an erratic history in the USA. They \n     made the mainstream only when the nation panicked over fuel \n     shortages and high prices starting in 1973. The 1975 energy \n     act and fuel efficiency standards were the government \n     response to that panic.\n       Under current CAFE standards, the fuel economy of all new \n     cars an automaker sells in the USA must average at least 27.5 \n     mpg. New light trucks--pickups, vans and sport-utility \n     vehicles--must average 20.7 mpg. Automakers who fall short \n     are fined.\n       In return, ``CAFE has an almost lethal effect on auto \n     safety,'' says Rep. Joe Knollenberg, R-Mich., who sides with \n     the anti-CAFE sentiments of his home-state auto industry. \n     Each year, starting with fiscal 1996, he has successfully \n     inserted language into spending authorization bills that \n     prohibits using federal transportation money to tighten fuel \n     standards.\n       Even if small cars were safe, there are reasons to wonder \n     about fuel-economy rules:\n       Questionable results. CAFE and its small cars have not \n     reduced overall U.S. gasoline and diesel fuel consumption as \n     hoped. A strong economy and growing population have increased \n     consumption. The U.S. imports more oil now than when the \n     standards were imposed.\n       Irrelevance. Emerging fuel technologies could make the \n     original intent obsolete, not only by making it easier to \n     recover oil from remote places, but also by converting \n     plentiful fuels, such as natural gas, into clean-burning \n     competitively priced fuel.\n       And new technology is making bigger, safer cars more fuel \n     efficient. The full-size Dodge Intrepid, with V-6 engine, \n     automatic transmission, air conditioning and power \n     accessories, hits the average 27.5 mpg.\n       ``Improving fuel economy doesn't necessarily mean lighter, \n     inherently less-safe vehicles,'' says Robert Shelton, \n     associate administrator of NHTSA.\n       Cost. Developing and marketing small cars siphons billions \n     of dollars from the auto industry. Small cars don't cost \n     automakers much less to design, develop and manufacture than \n     bigger, more-profitable vehicles. But U.S. buyers won't pay \n     much for small cars, often demanding rebates that wipe out \n     the $500 to $1,000 profit.\n       Consumers pay, too. Though small cars cost less, they also \n     depreciate faster, so are worth relatively less at trade-in \n     time. And collision insurance is more expensive. State Farm, \n     the biggest auto insurer, charges small-car owners 10% to 45% \n     more than average for collision and damage coverage. Owners \n     of big cars and SUVs get discounts up to 45%. ``It's based on \n     experience,'' spokesman Dave Hurst says.\n       CAFE has been ``a bad mistake, one really bad mistake. It \n     didn't meet any of the goals, and it distorted the hell out \n     of the (new-car) market,'' says Jim Johnston, fellow at the \n     American Enterprise Institute in Washington and retired \n     General Motors vice president who lobbied against the 1975 \n     law.\n\n\n                              here to stay\n\n       CAFE is resilient, although concern over its effect on \n     small-car safety is neither new nor narrow.\n       A 1992 report by the National Research Council, an arm of \n     the National Academy of Sciences, that while better fuel \n     economy generally is good, ``the undesirable attributes of \n     the CAFE system are significant,'' and CAFE deserves \n     reconsideration.\n       A NHTSA study completed in 1995 notes: ``During the past 18 \n     years, the Office of Technology Assessment of the United \n     States Congress, the National Safety Council, the Brookings \n     Institution, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the \n     General Motors Research Laboratories and the National Academy \n     of Sciences all agreed that reductions in the size and weight \n     of passenger cars pose a safety threat.''\n       Yet there's no serious move to kill CAFE standards.\n       Automakers can't lobby too loudly for fear of branding \n     their small cars unsafe, inviting negative publicity and \n     lawsuits. And Congress doesn't want to offend certain \n     factions by appearing too cavalier about fuel economy. Nor, \n     understandably, does it want to acknowledge its law has been \n     deadly.\n       ``I'm concerned about those statistics about small cars, \n     but I don't think we should blame that on the CAFE \n     standards,'' says Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., who supported \n     CAFE and remains a proponent.\n       Pressure, in fact, is for tougher standards.\n       Thirty-one senators, mainly Democrats, signed a letter \n     earlier this year urging President Clinton to back higher \n     CAFE standards. And environmental lobbyists favor small cars \n     as a way to inhibit global warming.\n       Although federal anti-pollution regulations require that \n     big cars emit no more pollution per mile than small cars, \n     environmental activists seize on this: Small engines typical \n     of small cars burn less fuel, so they emit less carbon \n     dioxide.\n       Carbon dioxide, or CO2, is a naturally occurring \n     gas that's not considered a pollutant by the Environmental \n     Protection Agency, which regulates auto pollution.\n       But those worried about global warming say CO2 \n     is a culprit and should be regulated via tougher CAFE rules.\n       Activists especially fume that trucks, though used like \n     cars, have a more lenient CAFE requirement, resulting in more \n     CO2.\n       ``People would be much safer in bigger cars. In fact, \n     they'd be very safe in Ford Excursions,'' says Jim Motavalli, \n     editor of E: The Environmental Magazine, referring to a large \n     sport-utility vehicle Ford Motor plans to introduce in \n     September. ``But are we all supposed to drive around in \n     tanks? You'd be creating that much more global-warming gas. I \n     demonize sport utilities,'' says Motavalli, also a car \n     enthusiast and author of the upcoming book Forward Drive: The \n     Race to Build the Car of the Future.\n       Not all scientists agree that CO2 causes global \n     warming or that warming is occurring.\n\n\n                          Seeking alternatives\n\n       Worldwide, the market is big enough to keep small cars in \n     business, despite the meager U.S. small-car market of 2 \n     million a year. Outside the USA, roads are narrow and gas is \n     $5 a gallon, so Europeans buy 5 million small cars a year; \n     Asians, 2.6 million.\n       Automakers are working on lightweight bigger cars that \n     could use small engines, fuel-cell electric vehicles and \n     diesel-electric hybrid power plants that could run big cars \n     using little fuel.\n       But marketable U.S. versions are five, or more likely 10, \n     years off. That's assuming development continues, \n     breakthroughs occur and air-pollution rules aren't tightened \n     so much they eliminate diesels.\n       Even those dreamboats won't resolve the conflict between \n     fuel economy and safety. Their light weight means they'll \n     have the same sudden-stop and bounce-back problems as small \n     cars. Improved safety belts and air bags that could help have \n     not been developed.\n\n[[Page S10910]]\n\n       IIHS researchers Adrian Lund and Janella Chapline reported \n     at the Society of Automotive Engineers' convention in Detroit \n     in March that it would be safer to get rid of the smallest \n     vehicles, not the largest.\n       Drawing on crash research from eight countries, Lund and \n     Chapline predicted that if all cars and trucks weighing less \n     than 2,500 pounds were replaced by slightly larger ones \n     weighing 2,500 to 2,600 pounds, there would be ``nearly 3% \n     fewer fatalities, or an estimated savings of more than 700 \n     lives'' a year. That's like trading a 1989 Honda Civic, which \n     weights 2,000 pounds, for a '99 Civic, at 2,500 pounds.\n       Conversely, the researches conclude, eliminating the \n     largest cars, SUVs and pickups, and putting their occupants \n     into the next-size-smaller cars, SUVs and pickups would kill \n     about 300 more people a year.\n\n\n                           market skepticism\n\n       U.S. consumers, culturally prejudiced in favor of bigness, \n     aren't generally interested in small cars these days:\n       Car-buying expert Bragg--author of Car Buyer's and Leaser's \n     Negotiating Bible--says few customers even ask about small \n     cars.\n       Small-car sales are half what they were in their mid-'80s \n     heyday. Just 7% of new-vehicle shoppers say they'll consider \n     a small car, according to a 1999 study be California-based \n     auto industry consultant AutoPacific. That would cut small-\n     car sales in half. Those who have small cars want out: 82% \n     won't buy another.\n       To Bragg, the reasons are obvious: ``People need a back \n     seat that holds more than a six-pack and a pizza. And, \n     there's the safety issue.''\n       That hits home with Tennessee dad George Poe. He went car \n     shopping with teenage daughter Bethanie recently and, at her \n     insistence, came home with a 1999 Honda Civic.\n       ``If it would have been entirely up to me, I'd have put her \n     into a used Volvo or, thinking strictly as a parent, a \n     Humvee.''\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, even the National Highway Traffic and \nSafety Administration, which runs the CAFE program, has recognized the \ndeadly effects of CAFE standards.\n  In its publication ``Small Car Safety in the 1980's,'' NHTSA explains \nthat smaller cars are less crash worthy than large ones, even in \nsingle-vehicle accidents. Small cars have twice the death rate of \ndrivers and passengers in crashes as larger cars.\n  And smaller light trucks will mean even more fatalities. These trucks \nand SUV's have higher centers of gravity and so are more prone to \nrollovers. If SUV and truck weights are reduced, thousands could die.\n  I believe it is crucial that we get the facts straight on the true \neffects of CAFE standards so that we can come to the only rational \nconclusion available: safe, economically sensible increases in gas \nmileage require cooperation and research and technology, not Federal \nmandates.\n  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to oppose the Gorton-Feinstein-Bryan \namendment.\n  Mr. President, it is very simple. When Washington makes these \ndictates, when unelected bureaucrats make these decisions and impose \nthem on an industry, the ramifications can and will be serious. We have \nseen that before in the auto industry. If this were to go forward, we \nwould see it again. The autoworkers in my State and around this \ncountry, and the people who work in other industries that are related \nto the sale of automobiles, will have their lives in jeopardy, as well \nas their jobs in jeopardy, if we move in this direction.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Will the Senator yield for a UC request?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Let me conclude in 10 seconds.\n  For those reasons, I urge opposition to the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SHELBY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I ask unanimous consent that the vote occur on or in \nrelation to the pending amendment at 6:40 p.m. with the time allocated \nas follows: 30 minutes under the control of Senator Gorton, 40 minutes \nunder the control of Senator Abraham, and 10 minutes under the control \nof Senator Levin. I further ask that no other amendments be in order \nprior to the 6:40 vote. I also ask that immediately following that \nvote, a vote occur on amendment No. 1658, with 2 minutes for \nexplanation prior to the vote. I understand this request has been \ncleared.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Therefore, it is my understanding the next two votes will \noccur on a back-to-back basis at 6:40 p.m. this evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield for an inquiry?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I certainly will.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not been ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Senator from Michigan and the Chair. I also \nthank the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Abraham, for his enlightening \nremarks about this important challenge we face --a challenge which \nwould seriously undermine and erode America's competitive position in \nthe production of automobiles.\n  I want to focus on a different aspect of the corporate average fuel \neconomy debate.\n  Most Americans, if you talk about CAFE standards, think you will be \ntalking about health standards in a restaurant or cleanliness in \ncorporate a local coffee shop. In this particular setting, CAFE means \naverage fuel economy. Basically, it is the average fuel economy of the \ncar produced by a particular company. A company that had a car that had \na very high corporate average fuel economy also would have to build \nvery small vehicles because it takes less fuel to run a small vehicle \nthan it does a large vehicle.\n  The concept of a corporate average fuel economy standard was \ndeveloped during the oil crisis of the 1970s. It required automobile \nmanufacturers to develop vehicles that could travel further with less \ngas. This was due to the shortage of the gasoline that had been imposed \nby the oil industry cartel which had curtailed the availability of \nenergy resources to this country.\n  The CAFE standards at that time required automakers to maintain, \nfleetwide, an average fuel efficiency of 27.5 miles per gallon for cars \nand 20.7 miles per gallon for trucks.\n  This is how the CAFE standards got started. It was to try to help the \nUnited States get past the energy embargo imposed in the 1970s. It was \nnot instituted--I repeat--it was not instituted for clean air purposes. \nRather, it was adopted to conserve gasoline.\n  In fact, Federal regulations require that big cars emit no more \npollution per mile than small cars. I have to confess, with all \nAmericans, that our air is cleaner today than it was 5 years ago or 10 \nyears ago, and we are pleased that we continue to make progress. The \nair continues to get cleaner and that is a good thing.\n  I will focus on the safety impact of increasing CAFE standards. In \ndoing so, I will talk about the consequences of imposing CAFE \nstandards--but not in terms of making sure we have enough gas to burn \nin the country because the embargo was lifted decades ago.\n  I want to focus on the safety aspects of what happens when you demand \nthat cars get more and more efficient--that somehow they must be able \nto go farther and farther on a gallon of gas. It does not take any \nspecial level of intelligence, you do not have to be a rocket scientist \nto understand that in order to meet fuel economy standards, cars and \ntrucks have to be made lighter. So in an effort to make cars go further \non a gallon of gas, the cars and trucks had to be made lighter and \nlighter. Common sense tells us when a lighter and smaller vehicle is \ninvolved in an accident, passenger injuries will be more severe.\n  Since CAFE standards were enacted in the 1970s, the average weight of \na new car has dropped by about 1,000 pounds. So if you look at the \nweight of a car as being protection--the protective barrier that \nsurrounds a passenger--there is 1,000 pounds less of protection in the \nnew car than in the cars prior to CAFE standards.\n  A recent study from the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration, the agency that administers CAFE standards, found that \nincreasing the average weight of each passenger car on the road by 100 \npounds would save over 300 lives annually. So if instead of decreasing \nthe weight of cars\n\n[[Page S10911]]\n\nin order to reach higher levels of fuel economy we were to add 100 \npounds to the weight of cars, we would save 300 lives every year.\n  We are really not debating whether or not we are going to add weight \nto cars; however, this is a debate over whether we are going to mandate \nthat car manufacturers make cars out of lighter and lighter materials. \nWhen you do that, it has a cost in terms of the relatives of the \nMembers of this body, our families and our constituents and our \nconstituents families.\n  A number of studies have been conducted to determine the actual \neffect that the CAFE standards have had on highway safety. I want to \nemphasize that these studies are conducted by very credible agencies--\nagencies that would not be anticipated to try and develop information \nthat would somehow support the car industry. The National Highway \nTraffic Safety Administration is a Federal agency that administers the \nCAFE standards. This agency is talking about the standards, which are \nits job to administer, when it says that if we could increase the \nweight instead of decrease the weight and we did so only by 100 pounds \nper vehicle, we would save 300 lives a year. One person a day, roughly, \nwould be saved in America if we had slightly heavier cars. The \nCompetitiveness Enterprise Institute found that of the 21,000 car-\noccupant deaths that occurred last year, between 2,600 and 4,500 of \nthem were attributable to the Federal Government's new car fuel economy \nstandards. We have between 2,500 and 4,500 people who don't exist \nanymore, who died because we have demanded lighter and lighter cars in \norder to meet the so-called CAFE standards, just last year.\n\n  That is from the Competitiveness Enterprise Institute. This is not \nfrom the car manufacturers. This is from an independent think tank.\n  A 1989 Harvard University-Brookings Institution study determined that \nthe current CAFE standard of 27.5 miles per gallon is responsible for a \n14- to 27-percent increase in annual traffic deaths. These are deaths--\nthey argue that would not have happened but for the fact that the new \ncar fleet must be downsized in order to meet the stricter standards. As \nlong as 10 years ago, researchers at Harvard University and the \nBrookings Institution determined that the CAFE standards and the \nimposition of the CAFE standards then extant were responsible for \nbetween 1/7 and 2/7 of the increase in the annual traffic deaths--just \nthat much of a reduction in the weight of cars.\n  So we have the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, we \nhave the Competitiveness Enterprise Institute, the Harvard University-\nBrookings Institution study. We have the National Academy of Sciences \nin this decade. This is not a wholly-owned subsidiary of GM, Ford, or \nDaimler-Chrysler.\n  The National Academy of Sciences 1992 study concluded that the \ndownsizing of automobiles due to fuel economy requirements has a direct \nimpact on passenger safety. That study found:\n\n       Safety and fuel economy are linked, because one of the most \n     direct methods manufacturers can use to improve fuel economy \n     is to reduce vehicle size and weight.\n\n  I really don't want to pick at the National Academy of Sciences. It \nis not just one of the most direct methods used to boost fuel economy; \nit is a very important method.\n  The most troubling conclusion from the National Academy of Sciences \nstudy was:\n\n       It may be inevitable that significant increases in fuel \n     economy can occur only with some negative safety \n     consequences.\n\n  We could go over the litany again: The National Highway \nTransportation Safety Administration, the Harvard University/Brookings \nInstitution study, the Competitiveness Enterprise Institute, and the \nNational Academy of Sciences--all of these organizations understand \nthat it is not a cost-free operation to say we will save a few gallons \nof gas and sacrifice our citizens and their safety on the highways.\n  Continuing to quote the National Academy of Sciences:\n\n       The CAFE approach to achieving automotive fuel economy has \n     defects that are sufficiently grievous to warrant careful \n     reconsideration of the approach.\n\n  I personally say we ought to carefully reconsider this approach. One \nstudy said in 1 year between 2,600 and 4,500 individuals died because \nwe have mandated that car manufacturers lighten automobiles so \nsubstantially that they become death traps for the occupants. I think \nsafety ought to be foremost in our consideration. When the National \nAcademy of Sciences says we ought to reconsider the approach of \nlightening these cars by demanding more and more fuel economy, I think \nwe ought to take that particular admonition seriously.\n\n       The CAFE approach to achieving automotive fuel economy has \n     defects that are sufficiently grievous to warrant \n     careful reconsideration of the approach.\n\n  It is with that in mind that when the National Academy of Sciences \nsays we ought to carefully reconsider this approach, I think we ought \nto reject attempts by Members of this body to extend this approach.\n  What is at the core of the National Academy of Sciences argument is \nthis: They care about these lives that are lost on our highways, people \nwho are riding in cars without adequate protection.\n  The proponents of this measure dismiss the safety considerations as \nif they are an aside. Frankly, in a setting where our environment \ncontinues to improve, where our air continues to get cleaner and \ncleaner, we ought to be careful about the number of people we are \nwilling to put in jeopardy and at risk. We are not talking about risk \nof a stubbed toe or a hangnail; we are talking about situations where \nindividuals lose their lives.\n  These standards, according to these studies--whether it is Harvard-\nBrookings, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, the National Highway \nTransportation Safety Administration, the National Academy of \nSciences--are responsible for Americans losing their lives.\n  There are those in this body who want to make these standards even \ntougher, in the face of very clear predictions and a conceded \nunderstanding that to make these standards tougher means more and more \npeople die on the highway. Based on experience and research, increasing \nCAFE standards to 40 miles per gallon--that is less than proposals \nsupported by the President and Vice President of the country; they want \nto take the standards even higher than that--would cost up to 5,700 \npeople their lives every year.\n  I am not even beginning to address the aspect of the government \ntelling its citizens what kind of cars they should be driving. This is \nto say that we won't let people buy safe cars, we will make them \nunavailable, and 5,700 a year will lose their lives because we have \ndecided that we know better what kind of car people should drive than \npeople could know by making their choices in the marketplace.\n  I want you to know that this isn't all. I am pleased that Senator \nAbraham submitted for the Record this particular item, which was a \nreprint from the USA Today: ``Death by the Gallon.'' I brought this \nparticular chart to show that a USA Today analysis of previously \nunpublished fatality statistics that 46,000 people have died because of \na 1970s-era push for greater fuel efficiency that has led to smaller \ncars.\n  As far as I am concerned 46,000 is 46,000 too many. But to think that \nwe want to extend this so as to invite the deaths of as many as 5,700 \nmore people a year by downsizing this container in which people travel \ncalled an automobile and lightening it to the extent that it provides \nno cushion of safety for people, or an inadequate cushion of safety, is \na very serious proposal.\n  Forty-six thousand people have died due to the implementation of CAFE \nstandards. Is it time to reexamine those standards, or is it time to \nexpand those standards? Forty-six thousand angels looking at the Senate \nshould be telling us: Reexamine; do not extend those. Forty-six \nthousand people is the equivalent in my State to Joplin, MO. The deaths \nof 46,000 people in my State would wipe out the entire town of Blue \nSprings, MO, or all of Johnson or Christian Counties.\n  The average passenger vehicle in 1975 was 14 miles per gallon; today \nit is 20 miles per gallon. That averages 7,700 lost lives for every \ngallon of increased fuel efficiency. I don't think 46,000 lives are \nworth it. I know they are worth more than that. I mean that is not \nworth the 46,000 lives.\n  I asked the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety to give me an \nopinion on raising CAFE standards and on the\n\n[[Page S10912]]\n\nimpact it would have on highway safety. I will insert their response in \nthe Record.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print this correspondence with the \nInsurance Institute for Highway Safety in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                               Insurance Institute\n\n\n                                           for Highway Safety,\n\n                                   Arlington, VA, August 27, 1999.\n     Hon. John Ashcroft,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Ashcroft: This is in response to your letter \n     of August 20 requesting information from the Institute about \n     relationships between Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) \n     standards and vehicle safety.\n       Although the relationships between CAFE standards and \n     vehicle safety are difficult to quantify precisely, there is \n     no question that the two are related because smaller/lighter \n     vehicles have much higher occupant fatality rates than \n     larger/heavier vehicles. But the safer larger/heavier \n     vehicles consume more fuel, so the more ``safer'' vehicles a \n     manufacturer sells the more difficult it becomes to meet the \n     CAFE standards.\n       Institute analyses of occupant fatality rates in 1990-95 \n     model passenger vehicles show that cars weighing less than \n     2,500 pounds had 214 deaths per million registered vehicles \n     per year, almost double the rate of 111 deaths per million \n     for cars weighing 4,000 pounds or more. Among utility \n     vehicles the differences are even more pronounced: Those \n     weighing less than 2,500 pounds had an occupant death rate of \n     330, more than three times the rate of 101 for utility \n     vehicles weighing 4,000 pounds or more.\n       It is important to recognize that these differences are due \n     to factors in addition to the greater risks to occupants of \n     lighter vehicles in collisions with heavier ones. Even in \n     single-vehicle crashes, which account for about half of all \n     passenger vehicle occupant deaths, people in lighter vehicles \n     are at greater risk. The occupant death rate in single-\n     vehicle crashes of cars weighing less than 2,500 pounds was \n     83, almost double the rate of 44 for cars weighing 4,000 \n     pounds or more. In the lightest utility vehicles the occupant \n     death rate was 199, again more than three times the rate of \n     65 for utility vehicles weighing 4,000 pounds or more.\n       The key question concerning the influence of CAFE standards \n     on occupant safety is the extent to which these standards \n     distort the marketplace by promoting additional sales of \n     lighter, more fuel efficient vehicles that would not occur if \n     CAFE constraints weren't in effect. Because CAFE standards \n     are set for a manufacturer's fleet sales, it seems likely \n     that raising these requirements for cars and/or light trucks \n     would encourage a full-line manufacturer to further subsidize \n     the sale of its smaller/lighter vehicles that have higher \n     fuel economy ratings. This would help meet the new \n     requirements while continuing to meet the marketplace demand \n     for the manufacturer's much more profitable larger/heavier \n     vehicles. Obviously the potential purchasers of the larger/\n     heavier vehicles are unlikely to be influenced to purchase \n     subsidized small/light vehicles, but at the lower ends of the \n     vehicle size/weight spectrum these subsidies likely would \n     produce a shift in sales towards the lightest and least safe \n     vehicles. The net result would be more occupant deaths than \n     would have occurred if the market were not distorted by CAFE \n     standards.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Brian O'Neill,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. The institute found that even in single-vehicle \ncrashes, which account for about half of all passenger vehicle occupant \ndeaths, single-car crashes, people in lighter vehicles are at greater \nrisk. I think we could have figured that out. It is pretty clear from \n46,000 deaths that that is understandable.\n  The letter also stated:\n\n       . . . the more ``safer'' vehicles a manufacturer sells, the \n     more difficult it becomes to meet the CAFE standards.\n\nSo if a manufacturer tries to sell safer, heavier vehicles, it makes it \nimpossible for them to meet the Federal standards.\n  I want to make one thing very clear. I believe in promoting cleaner \nair. I believe we should be environmentally responsible, and we are \ngetting there. I don't believe we should do it at the risk of human \nlives. CAFE standards have killed people. They will continue to kill \npeople because cars have been lightened to the extent that they don't \nprotect individuals.\n  Consumers are not choosing small cars. They look at convenience and \nsafety, and then they buy a larger automobile. According to a national \npoll, safety is one of the three main reasons for the popularity of \nsport utility vehicles. Small cars are only 18 percent of all vehicles \nthat are on the road, yet they accounted for 37 percent of all the \ndeaths in 1997. They are one out of every six vehicles on the road, and \nthey are involved in more than one out of every three deaths on the \nhighways.\n  Some argue these numbers are so high because the small cars are \ngetting into accidents with the bigger SUVs. The data does not support \nthat. Based on figures from the National Highway Transportation Safety \nAdministration, only 1 percent of all small-car deaths involve \ncollisions with midsize or large SUVs--1 percent. The real tragedy is \nthat these cars are unsafe in one-car accidents or in accidents with \neach other.\n  Car-buying experts have said that only 7 percent of new vehicle \nshoppers say they will consider buying a small car. And according to \nthat same source, 82 percent who have purchased small cars say they \nwould not buy another. Safety-conscious consumers, whether they are my \nconstituents in Missouri, or others, are purchasing larger automobiles, \nor sports utility vehicles. But now Washington wants to tell them what \nkind of car to buy, to disregard a value which they place on their own \nsafety. We spend millions of dollars a year trying to make our highways \nsafer: We fight drunk driving; we mandate seatbelt use; we require auto \nmanufacturers to install airbags. Yet today we are being asked to \nsupport a policy to make our highways more dangerous and more deadly \nthan ever before.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this attempt to impose higher and \nhigher CAFE standards. The attempt to impose higher and higher CAFE \nstandards is clearly headed for a consequence of higher and higher \nlevels of fatalities. We have seen data from the National Highway \nTransportation Safety Administration. We have seen data from the \nHarvard/Brookings Institution. We have seen data from the National \nAcademy of Sciences. We have seen the kind of comprehensive review of \ndata published in the USA Today. It is pretty clear, as the Competitive \nEnterprise Institute chimes in, that lightening cars--taking the strong \nsubstances out of the vehicle so that it goes farther for marginal \ngains in economy, results in more and more people dying.\n  I urge my colleagues to be sensitive to the fact that America can ill \nafford to elevate the carnage on our highways by eliminating the kind \nof substance in our vehicles that would be required if we were to adopt \nthe amendment that is pending. So I urge them to reject the attempt to \nelevate CAFE standards and, in so doing, protect the lives of \nthemselves and their families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the purpose of the amendment before us is \nvery simply to increase CAFE, despite all the flaws with the CAFE \nsystem. This is not just a study as is being suggested. The purpose of \nthis amendment is very clear from the wording of every single whereas \nclause and every resolve clause: it is to increase CAFE, despite the \nmany flaws in the current CAFE system.\n  If anybody has any doubt about what the purpose of this amendment is, \nI urge them to read it, and particularly the last paragraph which urges \nthe Senate not to recede to section 320 of the bill as passed by the \nHouse of Representatives, which prevents an increase in CAFE standards.\n\n  Now, some have said all this amendment does is provide for a study. \nWell, this is a study whose results have been prejudged and \npreordained, by the authors of this amendment, because there is not one \nword in this amendment about safety concerns, as the Senator from \nMissouri and my colleague from Michigan have talked about, or about the \nincrease in the number of deaths which have resulted from CAFE. Those \nare not our allegations but safety experts' allegations. There is not \none word in this amendment about the loss of American jobs and the \ndiscriminatory impact of CAFE against domestic production. I will get \ninto that in a moment.\n  This isn't just a study we are talking about. The sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution specifically says that the Senate should not recede to a \nsection in the House bill which prevents an increase\n\n[[Page S10913]]\n\nin CAFE standards. It doesn't say anything about not receding to a \nsection which prevents a study. It doesn't talk about a study which \nlooks at highway safety, impact on domestic employment, favoritism \ntoward imports, discriminatory impacts on domestic manufacturers and \nworkers. It doesn't talk about that at all. There is not a word about \nany of these issues in this amendment--only about increasing the CAFE \nstandards.\n  There are many flaws in the CAFE approach. My colleagues have already \ngone into some of those flaws at length. But first I want to again \nquote, very briefly, from the National Academy of Sciences' automotive \nfuel economy study, so that people don't think opposition to this \namendment comes only from folks who have a lot of automobile production \nin their State--although we do and we are proud of it, and we are \ndetermined that it be treated fairly and sensibly. We surely stand for \nthat, and we do so proudly. But this is the National Academy of \nSciences speaking here. The National Academy of Sciences said the \nfollowing in this automotive fuel economy study:\n\n       The CAFE approach to achieving automotive fuel economy has \n     defects that are sufficiently grievous to warrant careful \n     reconsideration of the approach.\n\n  ``Defects that are sufficiently grievous.'' There is not a word about \nstudying those defects in this amendment. I have looked really hard \nthrough this amendment. I read it a couple of times this afternoon. I \ncan't find anything about studying those defects that are \n``sufficiently grievous,'' according to the National Academy of \nSciences--that they should be part of the study. The purpose of this \nresolution is to increase CAFE, to bring about the result that CAFE is \nincreased.\n  Now, why not do that? Why not increase CAFE? Sure, let's just \nincrease the number from 20 to 25, or 30 to 35, or 35 to 40. Why not? \nWe will save fuel. The answer is, because there are a number of other \nconsiderations that have to be looked at, which weren't looked at when \nthis CAFE system was put into place. CAFE has had a discriminatory \nimpact on the domestic industry and has had a horrendous effect on \nsafety and resulted in the loss of thousands of lives.\n  Now, the safety issue has been discussed this afternoon, but I want \nto just highlight one or two parts of it, although the Senator from \nMissouri has just spoken to it. There was a USA Today study. This isn't \nan auto industry study. This isn't an auto supplier study. This isn't \nthe UAW study. This is a study by USA Today looking at statistics on \nautomobile highway deaths.\n  Here is what the USA Today study found. They found that in the 24 \nyears since a landmark law to conserve fuel was passed, big cars have \nshrunk to less-safe sizes, and small cars have poured on the road, and, \nas a result, 46,000 people have died in crashes. They would have \nsurvived in bigger, heavier cars, according to the USA Today analysis \nof crash data since 1975 when the Energy Policy and Conservation Act \nwas passed. The law and the corporate average fuel economy standards it \nimposed have improved fuel efficiency. The average passenger vehicle on \nU.S. roads gets 20 miles per gallon versus 14 miles per gallon in 1975. \nBut the cost has been, roughly, 7,700 deaths for every mile per gallon \ngained, this analysis shows.\n  Is it worth looking at fuel economy? Of course it is. Is it worth \nlooking at 46,000 deaths? Is it worth putting that on the scale and at \nleast looking at it? It sure ought to be. There is not a word about \nthat in this resolution, nothing about safety. We are told this \namendment is only about a study. Well, if so, it is the most one-sided \nstudy I have ever seen.\n  Now, it has been argued: Wait a minute, aren't these deaths the \nresult of small cars running into big vehicles? Again, the study \nanswers that. Tellingly, it says most small-crash deaths involve only \nsmall cars--56 percent in 1997, from the latest Government data. They \nrun into something else, such as a tree, or into one another. In \ncontrast, just 1 percent--according to this article--of small-car \ndeaths occurred in crashes with midsize or big sport utility vehicles \nin 1997, according to statistics from the National Highway Traffic \nSafety Administration, according to the agency that enforces the safety \nrules.\n\n  That is one of the major problems with CAFE--the safety problem, the \nloss of life.\n  There are other problems as well. I would like to spend a few of the \nminutes allotted to me to talk about the discrimination of this system \nagainst domestic production. One of the many problems with CAFE is that \nit looks at the entire fleet. It looks at the average of the \nmanufacturers' fleet. That fleet could be predominantly small in size. \nIt could be predominantly medium in size. It could be predominantly \nlarge in size. It doesn't make any difference what your mix is; you \nmust meet the same corporate fleet average.\n  If you have produced, for instance, historically many small vehicles, \nthen because of the way the CAFE rules are jiggered, there are no \neffective limits on how many large vehicles you can sell. But if \nhistorically you have produced larger vehicles, then it has a \ntremendous impact on your production and a penalty for the production \nof more.\n  The result of this is that if, as in the case with the imports, you \nhave focused on lighter vehicles rather than the heavier vehicles, \nwhich are very much now in demand, CAFE has no effect whatsoever on \nyour production or on your sales. But if you are a domestic \nmanufacturer that has focused on the larger vehicles, it has a huge \neffect on you and on the number of jobs you might have.\n  There is no logic or fairness to that kind of approach. CAFE didn't \nsay you have to increase by 10 percent the efficiency of your light \nvehicles, or your medium-size vehicles, or your heavier vehicles. It \nsays: Take your whole fleet together and reach a certain standard.\n  Some people say: Well, aren't the imports more fuel efficient? The \nanswer is no. Pound for pound, there is no difference between an \nimported vehicle and a domestic vehicle. A domestic vehicle is probably \na little bit more fuel efficient.\n  Take two vehicles of the same size. Take a GM and Toyota pickup \ntruck--the GM Sierra, and the Toyota Tundra. They both weigh about the \nsame. These are their highway ratings: 18 miles per gallon for the GM \nvehicle, and 17 miles per gallon for the Toyota vehicle. The GM vehicle \nis more fuel efficient than the Toyota. These are the same size \nvehicles. Now we are comparing apples and apples--not fleet averages \nwhich are apples and oranges, but apples and apples. The city rating is \nthe same thing. The GM Sierra has a 15-miles-per-gallon rating. The \nToyota Tundra has a 14-miles-per-gallon rating.\n  So the discriminatory impact does not have anything to do with the \nefficiency of vehicles of the same size since, if anything, the \ndomestic vehicle is at least as efficient as the import when you \ncompare the same size vehicles.\n  Then where is the discriminatory impact? The discriminatory impact \narises because the import manufacturers have tended to focus on the \nsmaller vehicles instead of the larger vehicles. They have room to sell \nas many large vehicles as they want without any impact. CAFE does not \naffect them. Any manufacturer that has focused on the smaller vehicles \ninstead of the larger suffers no impact when CAFE goes up.\n  Let's go back to that Tundra and that Sierra. How many more vehicles \ncould General Motors sell? These are the same size vehicles. With the \nGM vehicle being slightly more fuel efficient than the Toyota vehicle, \nhow many more can GM sell under CAFE? None. How many more can Toyota \nsell? Over 300,000 more.\n  Does that do anything for the air? It is costing American jobs. It \ndoesn't do a thing for the air. All it does is tell people if they want \nto buy a vehicle, a large vehicle, they have to buy the imported \nvehicle, and not the domestic one. The domestic manufacturer is \npenalized if it is produced under the CAFE approach.\n  CAFE was designed in a way--I don't think intentionally, and I pray \nto God it wasn't--but it was designed in a way which has a \ndiscriminatory impact on the domestic producer because of the way in \nwhich their fleets happened to be designed historically--because of the \ntype of cars they sold historically--and not because the imported \nvehicle is more fuel efficient. It isn't.\n\n[[Page S10914]]\n\n  These numbers are typical. If you have two vehicles of equal size, \none import and one domestic, they are about the same in terms of fuel \nefficiency.\n  So when you increase CAFE, all you are saying is buy an import. That \nis what this thing drives people to do. The import manufacturer isn't \npenalized. There is no limit effectively on how many larger vehicles \nthe import manufacturers can sell. It bites on the domestic \nmanufacturers--not on the imports. That is a huge effect on jobs in \nAmerica, with no advantage to the air.\n  Do we think it does good to the air to tell people to buy yourself a \nTundra instead of a Sierra? Does that do anything for the air? Quite \nthe opposite. It hurts the air. The Tundra is not as fuel efficient as \nthe Sierra. Yet there is no penalty whatsoever under CAFE for the \nimport manufacturer selling basically an unlimited number of heavy \nvehicles.\n  We have a system in place now which has had a very negative effect on \nsafety and an increase in the number of highway deaths. These are not \nour figures but figures of people who are on the outside looking at the \nstatistics of the highway safety folks. It has had a negative effect in \nterms of domestic versus imports, which is discriminatory.\n  Again, I want to emphasize this. It is a very important point. Some \npeople think the imports are more fuel efficient. They are not.\n  It is the key point. They are not more fuel efficient--slightly less; \nif I had to characterize--there is no difference, basic difference, \npound for pound.\n  What does this amendment do? It expands the current system. We have \nCAFE; let's increase the CAFE standards. Let's not even look at impact \non safety, increased highway deaths, or discriminatory impact on \ndomestic production. That is not referred to in this amendment. Just \nfuel. That is it.\n  But CAFE's discriminatory impact takes such a narrow vision, a narrow \nview on jobs in America. I hope this amendment is defeated. It is \npointing in a very narrow direction, in a direction which ignores the \ndiscriminatory impact on jobs in America. It ignores safety issues and \nfocuses on one piece of an issue, ignoring totally the other parts.\n  Finally, the Government and the private sector or private industry \nhave put together a partnership for new vehicles. This partnership is \nfocusing on new technologies and new materials, trying to see if we \ncannot find ways to have larger vehicles with higher fuel economy. This \npartnership is looking at lightweight materials, advanced batteries, \nfuel cells, hybrid electric propulsion systems; experimental concepts \nsometimes, but things which will--in a cooperative way--achieve the \nkind of goal which CAFE theoretically was aimed at achieving.\n  This partnership approach for a new generation of vehicles is \nworking. It is in operation now. It is the right way to go. The \nGovernment contribution to this partnership has been about $220 million \na year. The private sector's annual contribution to this partnership \nhas been slightly under $1 billion a year. We have this investment in a \npartnership, in a new generation of vehicles which is aimed at \nachieving significant improvements in fuel efficiency without the \ndownsides, which have been described here--the negative safety impacts \nand the negative effects on domestic production. That partnership is \nnow in its fourth year. We should allow that partnership to proceed. It \nis on a cooperative track, aimed at achieving goals without such \nnegative side effects.\n  I hope the Senate will reject this resolution and will keep on the \npartnership track which is being so productively followed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the pending \nresolution that will give the Department of Transportation the green \nlight to raise CAFE standards. According to the proponents of the \nresolution, the amendment just lets DOT ``study'' the issue. I am \nconcerned that is not accurate. The DOT has already recommended up to a \n35 percent increase in light truck standards.\n  The CAFE program has been in place for 25 years. We know this program \ndoesn't work. We know this program has not reduced America's dependence \non foreign oil. In fact, America's dependence on foreign oil has \nincreased from 35 to 50 percent.\n  Pollution controls on today's automobiles have driven down pollution \nlevels in this nation. It's the older automobiles that have been \ntargeted--it's the folks who cannot afford to buy a new $30,000 fuel \nefficient car. Believe it or not Mr. President, but a 1982 Chevy pickup \nis a very popular vehicle on Montana's highways. We can't expect to \nmake new cars affordable if we make them more expensive by driving up \nthe cost of these new cars through increased government regulation.\n  Fuel economies in vehicles have been reduced as a result of \nmanufacturer efforts. Since 1980, light trucks fleet fuel economy has \nincreased by nearly 2.5 miles per gallon. Passenger car fleet fuel \neconomy has increased by nearly 4.5 miles per gallon.\n  In my state of Montana, we are very highway dependent. Our roadways \nare our only means of transportation. We cannot efficiently rely on \ntransit modes of transportation. Montana is also dependent on vehicles \nthat have adequate clearance and power for roads that are not up to the \nstandard of a paved highway. We have farmers, ranchers, outdoorsmen and \nsportsmen that use these roads often.\n  CAFE standards have failed to achieve their goals. Despite these \nstandards, oil imports are up and Americans continue to drive more \nmiles annually than they did in the 1970s. CAFE standards force \nautomakers to produce many smaller, lighter vehicles to increase fuel \neconomy. Studies have demonstrated an increase in highway injuries and \ndeaths as a result.\n  We know it's not government regulation that drives fuel economy. \nRather competition drives fuel economy. That is why I will not support \nthis amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I oppose the Gorton amendment on CAFE \nstandards. I oppose lifting the freeze on CAFE standards because it \nwould hurt American workers, American consumers and our economy.\n  First, if we raise CAFE standards--we lose American jobs. More and \nmore American workers are building larger cars and sport utility \nvehicles. That's because these are the cars that Americans want to buy. \nBut if we raise CAFE standards, U.S. car makers will be forced to build \nsmaller cars. That means higher costs--for new equipment, new product \nlines, new tests. I'd rather see these resources used to leapfrog to \nnew technologies that make cars safer and more efficient.\n  Meanwhile, our foreign competitors won't have to do anything. They \nwon't face new costs. So by raising CAFE standards, we'll put American \nworkers at a competitive disadvantage with their foreign competitors.\n  Second, raising the CAFE standards means fewer choices and higher \nprices for American consumers. Americans are buying larger cars and \nSUVs because they're safer and better fit their families' needs. So by \nraising CAFE standards, consumers will have fewer large cars to choose \nfrom. They'll also face higher prices--since manufacturers will pass on \ntheir higher costs.\n  Finally, we cannot forget the reason why so many Americans are buying \nlarger cars--because they are safer. If we have more small cars on the \nroad, we will likely have more injuries and fatalities that result from \ncar accidents.\n  We need to save America's economy, America's jobs and American lives. \nI urge my colleagues to join me in rejecting this effort to lift the \nfreeze on CAFE standards.\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, unfortunately I will not be present \nwhen the Senate votes on the amendment offered by Senators Gorton, \nBryan, and Feinstein. The amendment expresses the sense of the Senate \nthat it should not recede to the House position of prohibiting the \nDepartment of Transportation from preparing, proposing or promulgating \nany regulation regarding Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) \nstandards for vehicles.\n  As my colleagues know, I have been and will continue to be a \nproponent of the CAFE program. The fuel conservation goals embodied in \nthe original CAFE standards are still important. However, I would not \nsupport the amendment offered today. CAFE is an extremely complex \nissue. It involves a\n\n[[Page S10915]]\n\ndelicate balance between environmental, safety and economic concerns. \nCAFE standards need and deserve the full attention of the Congress.\n  The structure of the CAFE statute appears to no longer make sense in \nlight of the current auto market. For example, the statute draws a \ndistinction between non-passenger vehicles, essentially light trucks \nand sport utility vehicles (SUVs), and passenger vehicles. The statute \nestablishes a default standard for passenger vehicles and allows the \nDepartment of Transportation to adjust the level up or down based upon \ncertain criteria.\n  The statute does not establish a standard for light trucks. Instead, \nthe agency sets the standard at its discretion based upon criteria in \nthe statute. One of the reasons for the distinction was the size of the \nnon-passenger vehicle market. At the time the CAFE was enacted, light \ntrucks and SUVs represented approximately 15 percent of the market. \nNow, they are approximately 50 percent of the market. In some states \nlike my home state of Arizona they represent more than 54 percent of \nnew car sales. I question the wisdom of allowing an agency sole \ndiscretion over the fuel economy standards of 50 percent of the auto \nmarket without any guidance from Congress.\n  In 1992, the National Research Council conducted what is considered \nto be the most comprehensive study of the CAFE program. In the \nexecutive summary of that report, the study committee made the \nfollowing statement ``[I]n this committee's view, the determination of \nthe practically achievable levels of fuel economy is appropriately the \ndomain of the political process, not this committee.'' The Committee \nrightly concluded that many of the issues surrounding CAFE involve \ntradeoffs that are public policy decisions, not a simple scientific \nconclusion. It is my intent to follow this advice and bring this debate \nback to Congress to determine how we should approach fuel economy \nstandards as we enter the new millennium.\n  As chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, it is my intention to \nhold hearings on CAFE early next year to examine this structure. Over \nthe next few weeks, I will contact the Department of Transportation, \nthe General Accounting Office, environmental groups, the major \nautomobile manufacturers and the highway safety groups to solicit their \nviews and begin the process of examining the statute.\n  Some of my colleagues argue that we should allow the Department of \nTransportation to move forward on a parallel track with the legislative \nprocess. I disagree with this argument for two reasons. First, the rule \nmaking process will further polarize and distract all of the parties on \na specific proposal before consideration is complete on substantive \nchanges to the law. Second, should a legislative solution be crafted, \nthe agency, as well as interested members of the public will have \nwasted time and resources developing and responding to a standard, \nwhich will never be implemented.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to holding hearings on this matter and, \nI look forward to the participation of my colleagues on both sides of \nthis issue as we move forward.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I inquire how much time remains for the various sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, has 1 \nminute; the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Abraham, has 19 minutes and the \nSenator from Washington has 30 minutes.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I know there may be other speakers on our side. As I \nindicated earlier, the proponents of the amendment had over an hour to \ninitially make their case. We agreed to a time agreement that gives \nless than that in terms of bringing it up to balance. I don't want to \nrun any more time off of our clock at this stage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that time during a quorum call run off the \ntime of the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, it is often said, I think accurately, that \nwhat differentiates human beings from most other animals, most other \nmammals, is the extraordinary ability of human beings to learn from \nexperience. Yet on the floor of the Senate this afternoon we have heard \neloquent statements opposing this current amendment that indicate that \nexperience is of no value to some Members and to some of their \narguments.\n  Mr. President, 25 years ago the predecessors of the opponents to this \namendment repeatedly stated on the floor of the Senate, as well as in \nthe hearing rooms of the Senate, that to require more fuel-efficient \nautomobiles and small trucks was to endanger the safety and the lives \nof the American people and to sentence them to driving in subcompacts \nand sub-subcompacts.\n  There are only two differences between the circumstances of the \nargument in 1974 and the circumstances of the argument in 1999. The \nfirst of those differences is that all of the arguments of those who \nopposed setting higher fuel efficiency standards for automobiles and \nsmall trucks made in 1974 were proved dramatically to be in error. At \none level, the most important of those arguments was that people would \nno longer have choice; they would all be forced into smaller \nautomobiles. Here it is 25 years later. We know that is not the case. \nThe requirements imposed in 1974 were, for all practical purposes, \ncompletely met within a period of 6 years, and the course has been \nessentially flat since that day.\n  Every single day of the week, every year, 7 days a week, 365 days a \nyear, the people of the United States save 3 million gallons of \ngasoline. Multiply 3 million gallons by $1.50 a gallon. That is $4.5 \nmillion. They pollute the air less; they spend less money; they \ncontribute less to our international trade deficit that continues to \ngrow year after year. And, second, our highways are far safer now than \nthey were then. Traffic deaths per million miles driven have declined \nby more than 50 percent in the years since those fuel efficiency \nstandards were imposed on the American people. Yet we hear some of the \nsame arguments being made over and over again.\n\n  But there is another difference between the argument in 1999 and the \nargument in 1974. In 1974, the Senate was debating whether or not to \nallow specific new standards to go into effect. In 1999, we are arguing \nwhether or not to allow the Federal Government to engage in a \nproceeding that determines whether or not new and more fuel-efficient \nstandards are appropriate and achievable. So in addition to ignoring \nhistory and experience, the opponents have to say that they oppose \nknowledge, that they oppose even a vitally important study of if and \nhow much fuel efficiency standards can be improved, consistent with \nsafety and consistent with the economic well-being of the American \npeople.\n  While I have not heard every word that has been stated on this floor \nin opposition to this bill, it does seem to me there is at least a \nminor difference. There does not seem to have been a claim that more \nfuel-efficient cars will not benefit the environment that is to say, to \ncause us to have cleaner air and fewer emissions into our air. Whatever \nthe debate was in 1974, that is not a statement now. Nor has any one of \nour opponents stated that it is a poor idea to save the American people \nmillions of dollars a day in their bill for motor vehicle fuel. Nor \nhave they made any statement that somehow or another our huge trade \ndeficit, largely caused by imported petroleum products, is a matter to \nwhich we as Americans should be indifferent.\n  Almost all of their argument has been on the safety issue. But it has \nbeen on the safety issue in the teeth of the experience of the American \nsociety, and it has been on the safety issue in the teeth of the \nproposition that if we carry out the policies contained in this \namendment, this sense-of-the-Senate resolution, we are not \nautomatically going to impose new fuel efficiency standards. We are \nsimply going to go into an orderly process to determine whether or not \nnew standards are feasible and, if so, how strict they should be and, \nif so, how long it should take to implement them.\n\n[[Page S10916]]\n\n  I find it breathtaking that Members of the Senate should say, no, we \ndon't want that knowledge. We are not even willing to wait until some \nspecific standards are proposed and specific knowledge gained to debate \nwhether or not the imposition of those standards is worthwhile.\n  No, we want the Senate to vote to stay ignorant, not even to learn \nwhat good public policy might be and what any of the offsets to that \ngood public policy might be as well.\n  Mr. President, I am not a great fan of the current national \nadministration, but I do not think anything irrevocable is going to \ntake place in the next year, in any event, and certainly not over the \nobjections of the Congress of the United States. But I am not so \nmistrustful of a group of professionals that I am willing to say even \nto this administration we should not allow them to examine this issue. \nIncidentally, this freeze has gone through Republican administrations, \nas well as Democratic administrations, in any event.\n  No, there are only two arguments being made against this amendment. \nThe substantive argument is that we should ignore history and believe \narguments in 1999 that were made in 1974 and shown to be entirely \ninvalid in 1974; and second, the proposition that we should remain \nignorant, that this is not important enough, not significant enough to \nthe American people that we should even begin a process of determining \nwhether or not we can clean up our air, make our cars more fuel \nefficient, become less dependent on foreign oil, and at the same time, \nincrease the safety standards in our automobiles.\n  The debate is neither more complicated nor less complicated than just \nthat. It should be understood by everyone, and I plead with my \ncolleagues in this body to allow this process to go forward and to \ndebate a real proposal, not a theoretical set of objections that were \ninvalid in 1974 and are equally invalid in 1999.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise in support of the sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution on fuel economy standards. This resolution has been \ncontroversial in my state, and I believe its effect on automobile fuel \neconomy standards has been misunderstood by some. I want to make my \nposition clear: though I will vote in favor of this resolution, I have \nreservations about some of the language it contains, reservations I \nmade known to the amendment sponsors.\n  My vote today is about Congress getting out of the way and letting a \nfederal agency meet the requirements of federal law originally imposed \nby Congress. I will support this resolution because I am concerned that \nCongress has for 5 years now blocked the National Highway Traffic \nSafety Administration, NHTSA, part of the Federal Department of \nTransportation, from meeting its legal duty to evaluate whether there \nis a need to modify fuel economy standards by legislative rider since \nFiscal Year 1996. The resolution simply says the Senate should not \nrecede to Section 320 of the House bill.\n  I believe that the outcome of any assessment of fuel economy \nstandards needs should not be pre-judged. I am concerned that the \nwording of this resolution needlessly fails to be fully neutral. It \ntips too far toward saying that the result of an assessment should be a \nquote increase unquote in fuel economy standards. I have made no \ndetermination about what fuel economy standards should be. NHTSA is not \nrequired under the law to increase fuel economy standards, but it is \nrequired to examine on a regular basis whether there is a need for \nchanges to fuel economy standards. NHTSA has the authority to set new \nstandards for a given model year taking into account several factors: \ntechnological feasibility, economic practicability, other vehicle \nstandards such as those for safety and environmental performance, and \nthe need to conserve energy. I want NHTSA to fully and fairly evaluate \nall the criteria, and then make an objective recommendation on the \nbasis of those facts. I will expect them to do that, and I will respect \ntheir judgement. After NHTSA makes a recommendation, if it does so, I \nwill then consult with all interested parties--unions, environmental \ninterests, auto manufacturers, and other interested Wisconsin citizens \nabout their perspectives on NHTSA's recommendation.\n  However, just as the outcome of NHTSA's assessment should not be pre-\njudged, the language of the House rider certainly should not have so \nblatantly pre-judged and precluded any new objective assessment of fuel \neconomy standards. Section 320 of the House bill states:\n\n       None of the funds in this Act shall be available to \n     prepare, propose, or promulgate any regulations pursuant to \n     title V of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act \n     (49 U.S.C. 32901 et seq.) prescribing corporate average fuel \n     economy standards for automobiles, as defined in such title, \n     in any model year that differs from standards promulgated for \n     such automobiles prior to enactment of this section.\n\n  The House language effectively prevents NHTSA from collecting any \ninformation about the impact of changing the fuel economy standards in \nany way. Under the House language, not only would NHTSA be prohibited \nfrom collecting information or developing standards to raise fuel \neconomy standards, it couldn't collect information or develop standards \nto lower them either. The House language assumes that NHTSA has a \nparticular agenda, that NHTSA will recommend standards which can't be \nachieved without serious impacts, and uses an appropriations bill to \ncircumvent the law's requirements to evaluate fuel efficiency and \nmaintain the current standards again for another fiscal year. I cannot \nsupport retaining this rider in the law at this time.\n  The NHTSA should be allowed freely to provide Congress with \ninformation about whether fuel efficiency improvements are possible and \nadvisable. Congress needs to understand whether or not improvements in \nfuel economy can and should be made using existing technologies. \nCongress should also know which emerging technologies may have the \npotential to improve fuel economy. Congress also needs to know that if \nimprovements are technically feasible, what is the appropriate time \nframe in which to make such changes in order to avoid harm to our auto \nsector employment. I don't believe that Congress should confuse our \nrole as policymakers with our obligation to appropriate funds. Changes \nin fuel economy standards could have a variety of consequences. I seek \nto understand those consequences and to balance the concerns of those \ninterested in seeing improvements to fuel economy as a means of \nreducing gasoline consumption and associated pollution.\n  I deeply respect the views of those who are concerned that a change \nin fuel economy would threaten the economic prosperity of Wisconsin's \nautomobile industry. Earlier this year I visited Daimler Chrysler's \nKenosha Engine plant and I met with union representatives from the \nJanesville GM plant. In those meetings I heard significant concerns \nthat a sharp increase in fuel economy standards, implemented in the \nvery near term, will have serious consequences. I want to avoid \nconsequences that will unduly burden Wisconsin workers and their \nemployers. In the end, I would like to see that Wisconsin consumers \nhave a wide range of new automobiles, SUVs, and trucks available to \nthem that are as fuel efficient as can be achieved while balancing \nenergy concerns with technological and economic impacts. That balancing \nis required by the law. At its core this resolution does not disturb \nthat balance, but I wish the language had been more neutral, so that \nall concerned could be more confident that the process is neutral. In \nthat spirit, I fully expect NHTSA to proceed with the intent to fully \nconsider all those factors.\n  In supporting this resolution, I take the position that the agency \nresponsible for collecting information about fuel economy be allowed to \ndo its job, in order to help me do my job. I expect them to be fair and \nneutral in that process and I will work with interested Wisconsinites \nto ensure that their views are represented and the regulatory process \nproceeds in a fair and reasonable manner toward whatever conclusions \nthe merits will support.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join in support of the \nGorton-Feinstein sense-of-the-Senate resolution which would allow the \nDepartment of Transportation to evaluate and update the Corporate \nAverage Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards. For the past four legislative \nsessions, a rider has been attached to the transportation bills to \nprevent evaluations of CAFE. This year, 31 Senators signed a letter to \nPresident Clinton urging him\n\n[[Page S10917]]\n\nto support their efforts to increase CAFE standards. We are not here \ntoday to raise the standards but merely to allow the Department of \nTransportation to consider the potential benefits and costs of existing \nor future CAFE standards.\n  CAFE standards were originally enacted in response to the oil crisis \nof the 1970s and were adopted in 1975 to reduce oil consumption. \nCurrently the standard for new passenger cars is 27.5 miles per gallon \nand for light trucks is 20.7 miles per gallon. CAFE standards have had \nthe effect of making cars and trucks more energy efficient than they \nwould have been without the standards. As such, energy efficiency, \ndecreased oil consumption, and global climate change are intertwined.\n  Global climate change is an issue that has been quite contentious in \ninternational and domestic circles alike, however, the undeniable \nscientific truth exists that the burning of fossil fuels and emissions \nfrom mobile sources results in the emission of numerous greenhouse \ngases: the major contributor being carbon dioxide. A study on the \nimpacts of CAFE has the potential to lessen the impact of automobile \nemissions into the environment based on the directly proportional \nrelationship of a cars' miles per gallon and the amount of carbon \ndioxide emissions produced. The Department of Energy reported in 1997 \nthat transportation accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. oil \nconsumption and comprises about one-third of U.S. carbon dioxide \nemissions. The increase in sales of less fuel efficient SUVs and light \ntrucks has and will continue to result in growing energy consumption \nand related emissions in the transportation sector. CAFE standards are \nregarded by many as an effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions \nfrom automobiles.\n  The bottom line today is that the emissions of greenhouse gases must \nbe reduced. We must develop industrial practices and means of \ntransportation which are less dependent on fossile fuels. Allowing a \nreevaluation of CAFE standards is one way to start.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong support \nfor the bipartisan effort to remove yet another anti-environment rider \nfrom an important appropriations bill. This rider, which is attached to \nthe House Transportation Appropriations bill, would prohibit the \nDepartment of Transportation from even considering an increase in the \ncorporate average fuel economy standard (CAFE). This rider would \nprevent DOT from evaluating, in any way, the cost-effectiveness and \npollution-prevention dividends that could result from requiring greater \nfuel efficiency from cars and trucks.\n  I am particularly concerned with this anti-CAFE rider, in part, \nbecause it is another in a long line of riders designed to limit our \ngovernment's ability to consider meaningful, appropriate, effective, \nand economical strategies to combat local and regional air pollution as \nwell as global climate change.\n  More than 117 million Americans live in places where smog makes their \nair unsafe to breathe. Nearly one-third of this pollution, which \naggravates respiratory diseases, especially among vulnerable groups \nsuch as children, asthmatics, and the elderly, is emitted from car and \ntruck tailpipes.\n  Cost-effectively protecting people's health by improving local air \nquality requires that we consider each of the sources that contribute \nto the pollution problem. It just makes sense that any efficient, fair, \nand reasonable pollution prevention strategy should consider all \nsources of pollution, including vehicles.\n  There are many ways to address pollution from cars and trucks. For \nexample, more rigorous emissions limits are currently being proposed by \nthe Environmental Protection Agency. Efficiency standards represent \nanother approach. The original CAFE standards have helped keep fuel \nconsumption nearly 30 percent lower than if CAFE had not been \nimplemented. Efficiency standards led to dramatic improvements in other \nsectors as well, such as major appliances. The purpose of the clean air \nresolution is not to mandate one approach over another but to allow the \nAdministration to explore the benefits and costs of all the options.\n  From a global perspective, there is a growing scientific and \ninternational consensus that air pollution, largely caused by burning \nfuels such as coal and oil, is causing changes in the earth's climate. \nI believe that America has a moral obligation to meet the tremendous \nchallenge of climate change head on rather than leaving a bigger \nproblem for our children and grandchildren.\n  As the world's biggest emitter of the pollution that contributes to \nclimate change, the United States has the responsibility to lead the \ninternational community toward a solution. And because our cars and \ntrucks currently represent nearly one-third of America's greenhouse gas \nemissions, and projections suggest that our miles driven will increase \nby roughly 2% a year through the next decade, vehicle emissions are a \nbig part of a giant challenge.\n  A recent report by the Alliance to Save Energy, the American Council \nfor an Energy Efficient Economy, and several other groups, found \nenhanced CAFE standards to be an essential part of a comprehensive \nstrategy to address global climate change. The study found that \nincreased CAFE standards could be part of a plan to achieve a 10% \nreduction in carbon dioxide emissions while creating 800,000 jobs and \nsaving $21 billion annually in reduced oil imports.\n  Improving the gas mileage of the cars and trucks we drive would \nprovide many other benefits to both the consumer and the country. \nWhereas less money spent at the pump means more money in Americans' \npockets, less money spent at the pump also means less dependence on \nunpredictable imported oil.\n  Unfortunately, there is an active misinformation campaign underway \nopposing the clean air resolution and CAFE standards. Chief among the \nclaims is that the CAFE standards we have had for the last 25 years \nkill people. This is a ludicrous argument underpinned by contorted \nmisinterpretations of long-since refuted assumptions. One simple \nobservation puts CAFE opponents faulty logic to rest: since CAFE \nstandards were adopted in 1973, the number of deaths per mile driven \nhave been cut in half. The increased safety of our vehicles is largely \nattributable to material and design improvements that increase fuel \nefficiency at the same time they improve acceleration, braking, \nhandling, durability and crashworthiness.\n  Finally, I would alert my colleagues to a poll released yesterday \nregarding fuel efficiency standards. The poll, which was conducted by \nthe Mellman Group for the World Wildlife Fund, indicates that 72% of \nsport utility vehicle (SUVs) owners believe that minivans and trucks \nshould be held to the same efficiency standards as passenger cars. In \naddition, nearly two-thirds SUV owners support Congressional action to \nrequire equitable emissions requirements for cars and light trucks.\n  The clean air resolution introduced today by Senators Gorton, \nFeinstein, Bryan, and Reed ensures that enhanced CAFE standards are on \nthe menu of options when the Department of Transportation considers the \nimplications of vehicle efficiency for local, regional, and global air \npollution, consumer protection and satisfaction, and energy security. I \nencourage my colleagues to support the clean air resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I will be happy to yield to the \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan if he wants to make a response to \nmy friend from Washington, and then I would like to ask the Senator \nfrom Washington after such time as the Senator from Michigan speaks \nthat I might be reserved a little time.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I have been informed we have Members on \nour side who still want to speak, so I have been holding our remaining \ntime for them. I do not want to put the Senator from Washington and the \nSenator from Nevada in the position of exhausting all of their time \nbefore we have rebuttal. I inquire as to how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 19 minutes and the Senator \nfrom Washington has 11 minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. BRYAN. May I inquire, if the Senator is not going to go forward, \nas I understand the unanimous consent\n\n[[Page S10918]]\n\nagreement, when we are in a quorum call, all of the time is charged to \nour side. I certainly am not trying in any way to preempt the comments \nthe Senator wants to make, but if we go back into the quorum call, it \nseems we will have it charged to our side.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, rather than sitting here doing nothing, \nwill the Senator from Michigan allow the Senator from Nevada to speak \nand it be charged against the time both are not using equally?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I will make some comments then. I wanted to clarify the \namount of time we have, and we will see if other Members come down. Let \nme do the following: I will suggest the absence of a quorum and suggest \nthe time be taken off my time while I prepare to make these comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I will make some brief remarks in \nresponse to some of the comments that have been made by the Senator \nfrom Washington and others, as well as to elaborate on some of my \nearlier remarks today.\n  First, I point out that with respect to the safety issues, the \nquestion is not whether on a cumulative basis there have been fewer \nfatalities since the implementation of CAFE standards. The question is \nwhat the consequence is or the correlation is between fatalities and \nCAFE standards.\n  Since 1975, on a variety of fronts, safety efforts have gone forward \nto protect passengers and drivers in motor vehicles ranging from the \nintroduction of airbags to State laws which require the use of \nseatbelts, primary laws that require the use of seatbelts to the \nintroduction of countless child safety and passenger protection \nactivities and child safety seats. One cannot draw that correlation.\n  What one can, of course, do is follow the studies of USA Today and \nthe National Academy of Sciences that try to determine what the direct \neffects of CAFE have been, and those effects are quite clear. As the \nSenator from Missouri and my counterpart, my colleague from Michigan, \nhave indicated, the conclusion is the direct consequence of CAFE \nstandards has been an increase in fatalities since 1975 of an estimated \n46,000 people who lost their lives as a consequence of CAFE standards \nbecause of the lighter vehicles and the less safe vehicles that CAFE \nhas fostered.\n  Mr. President, I note the Senator from Ohio is here. He wishes to \nspeak, and I yield up to 5 minutes to him.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Michigan. I join \nin his comments. We have heard talk on the floor about the environment. \nI want to talk, though, about another aspect of this, and it is the \naspect my friend from Michigan has just been talking about. That is the \nquestion of highway safety.\n  I vehemently oppose this amendment. We are dealing with a question of \nlives. The basic facts are that heavier cars, heavier vehicles are \nsafer, and the statistics are absolutely abundantly clear.\n  I will share some statistics with the Members of the Senate so \neveryone knows exactly on what we are voting.\n  An analysis by the Insurance Institute shows that cars weighing less \nthan 2,500 pounds had 214 deaths per million vehicles per year. That is \nalmost double the rate of vehicles that weigh 4,000 pounds or more. For \nvehicles that weigh 4,000 pounds or more, the death rate was 111 per \nmillion. For cars weighing less than 2,500 pounds, that was 214 deaths \nper million. It is double, absolutely double the figure.\n  The reality is that the majority of car fatalities in this country \ntoday occur in single vehicle crashes. To determine what costs lives \nand what does not, it is essential and important to look at single car \nweights and death rates.\n  I share another statistic with my colleagues, again, to emphasize \nwhat we are saying.\n  This is not just an ``environmental issue.'' This is not just an \n``easy environmental vote.'' This is a question of life and death that \nwe can measure.\n  Among utility vehicles, the results are even more pronounced. For \nthose weighing less than 2,500 pounds, the death rate per million was \n83. That was almost double the rate of 44 for cars weighing 4,000 \npounds or more. So again, under 2,500 pounds for utility vehicles, the \ndeath rate was 83 per million; but for cars weighing 4,000 pounds or \nmore, it was only 44 per million. Again, it is double the rate.\n  In the lightest utility vehicles, the occupant death rate was 199; \nagain, in this case, more than 3 times the rate of 65 for utility \nvehicles weighing 4,000 pounds or more.\n  In conclusion, I join my colleague from Michigan. He is absolutely \ncorrect. This vote is about a lot of different things. I am sure we can \ntalk about the environment, we can talk about many things, but the one \nthing we know is that lighter vehicles mean more people die; heavier \nvehicles mean more people live. It is as simple as that.\n  So if the Congress makes this decision and says we should \nartificially mandate and tell the American consumer, you need to be \ndriving in lighter cars because Washington knows best, when we do that, \nwhen the arm of the Federal Government comes in and does that, it is \nnot an academic exercise. It is not just the freedom to choose a car or \na vehicle that people lose; what we lose are human beings.\n  Make no mistake about it. If this resolution prevails, ultimately, \nthrough the Congress, more people will die. The statistics are \nabsolutely abundantly clear. And that is exactly what this vote is \nabout. It is not an academic exercise. It is not an academic vote. It \nis not a free environmental vote one way or the other. This is about \npeople living. This is about people dying.\n  I thank my colleague from Michigan and yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. I ask unanimous consent that Arthur Menna, a \ncongressional fellow on my staff, be given floor privileges for the \nremainder of the debate on the Transportation appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I yield to the Senator from Oklahoma such time as he may \nconsume on this issue.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Michigan, \nSenator Abraham, as well as Senator DeWine from Ohio, for their \nstatements. They are exactly right. I do not need to repeat their \nstatements, but I think it is vitally important that they prevail in \nbeating this amendment.\n  I hope my colleagues will pay attention. This is not an esoteric \namendment. As the Senator from Ohio said, there are lives at stake. Do \nwe really think we can have a big increase in the corporate average \nfuel economy standards mandated on sport utility vehicles without \nhaving economic consequences?\n  There are going to be consequences. Vehicles may cost more. It is \nquite likely they will have to reduce the weight of the vehicles. The \nvehicles will not be as safe.\n  We are superimposing Government wisdom on manufacturers and on \nconsumers. The sales of these vehicles are going quite well because \nconsumers want them. Nobody is forcing them to buy them. Yet if we come \nup with a Government-mandated higher fuel economy standard, presumably \nwith the idea that this is going to be more fuel efficient, it may make \nthe vehicles more expensive. It may make the vehicles more unsafe. It \nmay cost lives. It\n\n[[Page S10919]]\n\nhas significant economic consequences on families.\n  So I urge my colleagues to defeat the amendment that is pending. I \nagain compliment my friends and colleagues, including Senator Levin, as \nwell as Senator Abraham and Senator DeWine, for their excellent \nstatements.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, if I might inquire of the Chair, how much \ntime remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's side has 11 minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. BRYAN. If I might inquire of the Senator who controls the time--\nwe have approximately 11 minutes left--would the Senator from \nWashington be amenable to allowing the Senator from Nevada to use, say, \n6 minutes?\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes. The Senator from Washington will be delighted if the \nSenator takes that time.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. President, I understand that in the most famous debating \ninstitution in the world, and in the history of civilization, \ndifferences of opinion can arise on matters of public policy. That is \nwhat this place is all about. But I have to tell you, I find the amount \nof hysteria engendered by this issue to be absolutely astonishing.\n  In a series of ads put out by the industry, we have one now that \ntalks about: ``Farming's tough enough with healthy-size pickups. \nImagine hauling feed barrels around in a subcompact.'' That implies \nthat this amendment we are proposing will be antithetical to the best \ninterests of America's farmers.\n  We have an ad involving the soccer moms and dads: ``This picture is \nbrought to you by a fantastic soccer team and a minivan just big enough \nto handle them.'' The clear inference is, if we allow the Department of \nTransportation to examine these standards, some soccer moms are not \ngoing to be able to take their kids to soccer games.\n  Then we have an ad: ``As a small business owner, my truck and I are \njoined at the hip. An increase in CAFE would put both of us out of \nbusiness.''\n  May I say, with great respect to our friends on the other side of the \naisle, many of whom are good friends I greatly respect, this is utter \nnonsense. This is just plain nonsense.\n  I will repeat, as I did earlier, the thrust of what this resolution \ndoes. It mandates no standard, no increase. The resolution simply says \nthe issue of CAFE standards should be permitted to be examined by the \nDepartment of Transportation so that consumers may benefit from any \nresulting increase in the standards as soon as possible. It is \npermissive only; it mandates nothing.\n  During the time 1989 to 1995, when this technology gag rule was not \nin effect, during those 6 years, there was no increase in CAFE \nstandards for automobiles, and with respect to light trucks it was 1 \npercent. So I think that is a pretty clear indication that nobody is \ngoing to rush to judgment.\n  The other thing that needs to be understood, it seems to me, is the \nDepartment of Transportation has some very comprehensive guidelines \nthey must consider in any review. Among those factors are: Is it \ntechnically feasible? Is the technology there? The economic \npracticability, the effect of other Federal motor vehicle standards on \nfuel economy, and the need of the Nation to conserve, all of which \nwould be open to the rulemaking process in which the industry and their \nsupporters would have an ample opportunity to respond.\n  Let me try to respond briefly to the safety issue. And my friend from \nMichigan has indicated to me he would allow me to engage him in a \ncolloquy for a couple questions. I appreciate his courtesy, as always.\n  From 1970 through 1999, the highway fatality rate in America has gone \ndown. At the same time, fuel economy is up. That is at the same time \nthat many more vehicles are on the highway, with a great amount of \nadditional traffic congestion. The average motorist is driving more \neach year.\n  So the notion that somehow this is anathema to health and safety \nstandards simply, in my judgment, does not bear out scrutiny. Indeed, \nan objective study by the General Accounting Office concluded that the \nunprecedented increase in the proportion of light cars on the roads \nsince the 1970s has not increased the total highway fatality rate.\n\n  I think the safety issue is somewhat of a red herring. We are all \nconcerned about safety. Nobody on the floor is going to advocate that \nthe industry make and sell a product which is unsafe, and one would \nhave to assume that the industry itself would not put such a product on \nthe market.\n  Let me also point out that with respect to the fuel achievements we \nhave had in terms of increased efficiency from 1974 to the 1989 \ntimeframe, 86 percent of those improvements were as a result of new \ntechnology. This information comes to us from the Center for Auto \nSafety. It seems to me the clear and compelling evidence is that safety \nand fuel economy standards are not mutually exclusive. We can do both.\n  All we are saying is that those who choose to purchase sport utility \nvehicles, my son and daughter-in-law being two, should have the same \nright as other motorists who select other passenger vehicles to derive \nthe benefits of improved technology. I have great confidence in what \nthe industry can do, notwithstanding the prophecy of doom they forecast \nin 1974 that everybody would be driving around in a sub-subcompact or a \nvehicle the size of a Maverick or a Pinto. Indeed, the industry did \nsome astonishing things and doubled the fuel economy. Today's Lincoln \nTown Car gets better fuel economy than the smallest product that the \nFord Motor Company manufactured in 1974.\n  If I could engage my friend from Michigan in a couple of questions. \nHe is a distinguished lawyer, a graduate of Harvard Law School. I ask \nhim: Is there anything in this resolution, in the opinion of the \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan, that in any way mandates an \nincrease in these standards. We may disagree in terms of whether the \ntechnology is available.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Nevada has \nexpired.\n  Mr. GORTON. I yield the Senator 2 more minutes.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the Senator from Nevada for his confidence in my \nlegal skills. As I read the sense-of-the-Senate resolution which has \nbeen proposed, it says, in its concluding section, the resolution \nsection:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the issue of CAFE \n     standards should be permitted to be examined by the \n     Department of Transportation.\n\n  And then in subsection (2):\n\n       The Senate should not recede to section 320 of this bill, \n     as passed by the House of Representatives, which prevents an \n     increase in CAFE standards.\n\n  Now, if we do not include that provision, if the sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution were to prevail and that were to be the ultimate outcome and \nsection 320 as contained in the House version of the legislation were \nto not survive the conference and the final resolution of the \nlegislation, it is my understanding that we would then revert back to \nthe process which is in the law otherwise, which, by my understanding \nof it, mandates that the Department of Transportation, under 49 USC \nsubtitle 5 part (c) section 32902, required that the Department of \nTransportation set CAFE standards each year at ``the maximum feasible \naverage fuel economy level.''\n  I believe that is what would happen at the Department of \nTransportation. The Secretary of Transportation is not authorized to \njust study CAFE. He must act by regulation to set new CAFE standards \neach year. That has not happened because of the moratorium which has \nbeen imposed over recent years, since 1995. Prior to the CAFE freeze in \n1994, the administration began rulemaking on new CAFE standards. On \nApril 6 of 1994, again, in the last year--I don't want to take all the \nSenator's time; I will try to be quick--the proposal referenced \nfeasible higher CAFE levels for trucks of 15 to 35 percent above the \ncurrent standard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. My sense, reading the history of this, is that is where \nthe starting point would be. I believe, in effect, if we do not have \nthis, if this is not in place, that that would be the mandated effect.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Will the Senator from Michigan yield a few minutes of his \ntime so I may follow up with a question?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. How much time do we have?\n\n[[Page S10920]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has 5 minutes. The \nSenators from Washington and Nevada have 3.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. What I would propose is that by unanimous consent, the \nSenator from Nevada be able to make further inquiry without reducing \nhis time below 3 minutes or my time below 5 minutes, a reasonable \namount of time.\n  Mr. BRYAN. If the Senator from Washington is agreeable, I think that \nis fair.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. That would leave 5 minutes and 3 minutes for summation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Would the Senator not agree that before any increase could \nbe effected by the Department, that the Department is, under the \ncurrent law, required to consider four factors: the technical \nfeasibility, the economic practicability, the effect of other motor \nvehicle standards on fuel economy, and the need of the Nation to \nconserve energy? Would not the Senator agree that that is part of the \nlaw as well?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Obviously, the law sets forth criteria that are to be \nemployed. I don't have those in front of me. I will accept the \ncontention of the Senator from Nevada that those are the criteria. The \nquestion is whether a prejudgment as to the outcome is already \nordained. In my judgment, the positions that were already in process in \n1994, prior to the implementation of the moratorium, suggest that those \ndecisions 5 years ago had already essentially resulted in a preliminary \ndecision to increase the standards by 15 to 35 percent. If, in effect, \nthe moratorium does not go forward, I believe we would, indeed, be \nmoving a process that will mandate this kind of increase.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Senator for his answer. We obviously have \nreached a different conclusion.\n  I point out to my friend and colleague from Michigan that we had \nprecisely the situation in 1989 to 1995. The technology gag rule was \nnot in effect and, indeed, no increase was made during that period of \ntime with respect to automobile standards. And only a very modest \nincrease was made with respect to the light truck standards.\n  I hope that will give some comfort to him and to those who have \nraised some concerns that this is not a mandate but simply permissive \nin nature.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Michigan and yield the floor but \nreserve the remainder of the time that is allocated to our side.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Does this Senator from Michigan have any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has 1 minute.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Let me quickly comment on the question of highway deaths. The study \nof USA Today is that 46,000 people have died in crashes that would have \nsurvived in larger cars. I have not heard that fact disputed. We have \nseen a chart which shows that there are fewer highway deaths and that \nwe have better fuel economy, but that chart doesn't show the two are \ncausally connected.\n  Indeed, the fewer highway deaths may come from seatbelts, a greater \neffort on the anti-alcoholism campaign, Mothers Against Drunk Drivers, \na number of other causes. But the outside figure, not the auto \nindustry, not the unions, not the supplier, not the insurance industry, \nwhich opposes this amendment, the outside survey done by USA Today says \n46,000 people lost their lives who would not have lost their lives but \nfor this CAFE approach.\n  When we look at the resolution, we don't see any reference to safety. \nWe don't see any reference to the discriminatory impact on domestics \nthat have a different mix in their fleets. We only see a reference to \nfuel. That is the one factor at which this resolution looks.\n  Then at the end it makes it very clear what it is driving at--talking \nabout driving. This resolution is aimed at one thing: to increase CAFE \nstandards. This isn't just ``let's have a study, look at the impact on \nsafety, look at the discriminatory impact on domestic production.'' \nThis isn't just let's have a study. This is the sense of the Senate \nthat the Senate should not recede to a House provision which prevents \nan increase in CAFE standards, not which prevents a study. This \nresolution, by every single provision in its whereas clauses, is \ndriving us towards an increase in CAFE standards, without consideration \nof safety impacts or the discriminatory impact on domestic production.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I believe I have 5 minutes remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. There are other opponents on my side who wish to speak. \nLet me summarize with a few concluding remarks.\n  I want to first reiterate what my colleague from Michigan, Senator \nLevin, has said. A chart that shows the correlation between increases \nin CAFE and decreases in fatalities is not based on a study that \nrelates the two. The studies that do relate the two, particularly as he \nsaid, the outside study by the National Academy of Sciences, suggest a \ncontrary finding. In fact, the implementation of CAFE standards has led \nto approximately 46,000 lost lives as a consequence of the lighter \nvehicles being in our fleets.\n\n  The second point I make relates to the broader point that also was \nmade earlier by my colleague from Michigan. Higher CAFE standards are \ngoing to affect American manufactured products, but not necessarily the \nproducts of our competitors from overseas. Hence, the same kind of \nvehicles, with virtually the same types of fuel efficiency levels, as \nwell as the same types of emission levels, will be purchased by the \nsame market that wants and craves these vehicles today. The only \ndifference will be the kind of difference we saw back in the late 1970s \nand early 1980s and throughout much of the decade of the 1980s when we \nfound the foreign imports' share of the American market continuing to \ngo up, at the expense of American domestically manufactured products, \nand ultimately at the expense of American autoworker jobs.\n  In summation, this is simple to me: Do we want to put at risk the \nsafety of people who will be purchasing sports utility vehicles, light \ntrucks, and others by making a change in CAFE standards? I hope the \nanswer is no. Do we want to risk the jobs of American autoworkers? I \nspeak not just for those autoworkers in Michigan, who tend to be on the \nfront lines, but many other people in this country who are working in \nrelated industries and whose jobs are affected by the sale of \ndomestically manufactured automobiles. Do we want to put at risk all of \nthese jobs? I don't think so. Do we want to risk the investments made \nby the auto companies in new, more fuel-efficient vehicles, and the \nsignificant investments that we have made in the partnership for a new \ngeneration of vehicles? Do we want to derail those efforts as a result \nof this type of action?\n  In my judgment, we should say yes to more safe vehicles; we should \nsay yes to American autoworkers; we should say yes to the technological \nadvances that have been and are continuing to be made. That is \nultimately how we are going to have more fuel-efficient vehicles. If we \nsay yes to all of those, then, in my judgment, we must say no to this \namendment because to have a Washington bureaucracy made up of unelected \nindividuals who impose upon this very significant sector of our economy \nthese kinds of standards, the likely outcome will be exactly the \nopposite of what I have proposed today. I think it will hurt our \neconomy and the American automobile industry, although it may help the \nautomobile industries of other countries. I think it will make the \nvehicles that come about as a result of higher standards less safe, as \nthe studies that we have cited here today demonstrate.\n  So for those reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote against the \nGorton-Bryan-Feinstein amendment.\n  Before I conclude, I ask that a letter produced by the United Auto \nWorkers be printed in the Record at this point as an expression of \ntheir views on this issue, which are consistent with those my \ncolleagues and I on this side of the issue have been offering here \ntoday.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S10921]]\n\n\n         United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement \n           Workers of America,\n                                    Washington, DC, June 30, 1999.\n       Dear Senator: When the Senate considers the FY 2000 \n     Transportation Appropriations bill, we understand that \n     amendments may be offered to eliminate or modify the current \n     moratorium on increases in fuel economy standards for autos \n     and trucks (commonly known as CAFE, the Corporate Average \n     Fuel Economy standards). The UAW strongly opposes such \n     amendments and urges you to vote against them.\n       The UAW supported the CAFE standards when they were \n     originally enacted. We believe these standards have helped to \n     improve the fuel economy achieved by motor vehicles (which \n     has doubled since 1974). This improvement in fuel economy has \n     saved money for consumers and reduced oil consumption by our \n     nation.\n       However, for a number of reasons the UAW believes it would \n     be unwise to increase the fuel economy standards at this \n     time. First, any increase in the CAFE standard for sport \n     utility vehicles (SUVs) and light trucks would have a \n     disproportionately negative impact on the Big Three \n     automakers because their fleets contain a much higher \n     percentage of these vehicles than other manufacturers. \n     Second, any increases in CAFE standards for cars or trucks \n     would also discriminate against full line producers like the \n     Big Three automakers because their fleets contain a higher \n     percentage of full size automobiles and larger SUVs and light \n     trucks. The current fuel economy standards are based on a \n     flat miles per gallon number, rather than a percentage \n     increase formula, and are therefore more difficult to achieve \n     for full line producers. Taking these two factors together, \n     the net result is that further increases in CAFE could lead \n     to the loss of thousands of jobs at automotive plants across \n     this country that are associated with the production of SUVs, \n     light trucks and full size automobiles.\n       The UAW believes that additional gains in fuel economy can \n     and should be achieved through the cooperative research and \n     development programs currently being undertaken by the U.S. \n     government and the Big Three automakers in the ``Partnership \n     for a New Generation of Vehicles''. This approach can help to \n     produce the breakthrough technologies that will achieve \n     significant advances in fuel economy, without the adverse \n     jobs impact that could be created by further increases in \n     CAFE standards.\n       Accordingly, the UAW urges you to oppose any amendments \n     that seek to eliminate or modify the current freeze on \n     increases in motor vehicle fuel economy standards. Thank you \n     for considering our views on this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Alan Reuther,\n                                             Legislative Director.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, first point. I regret that the Senators \nfrom Michigan believe that the automobile industry located in that \nState and the magnificent workers who are employed there are unable to \ncompete with foreign automobile companies when we try to make our \nautomobiles more fuel efficient. In fact, they have shown their \nmagnificent ability to compete, and to compete very well, in the past \ndecade. I am certain that they would continue to do so.\n  Second, this sense-of-the-Senate resolution simply asks the \nconference committee members from the Senate to reject a House \nprovision that says that nothing can take place. It certainly does not \nsay that the conference committee cannot condition the moving forward \nof the Department of Transportation on future CAFE standards in any way \nit would like to do so. But the net effect, as I have said before, of \nthe House position, supported by the opponents of this amendment, is \nthat we need to put our heads in the sand; we don't need to study--as a \nmatter of fact, we should be prohibited from studying whether or not we \ncan improve the fuel efficiency of our automobiles and small trucks, \nimprove the quality of our air, reduce the cost of fuel to the average \nAmerican consumer, reduce our trade deficit, all consistent with the \nsafety of our drivers and of the passengers in our automobiles.\n  I, for one, am convinced that we can do so. But more than that, I am \nconvinced that we ought to determine whether or not we can do so, and \nthe opponents of this amendment simply say we should not even try.\n  Mr. President, that is a terribly pessimistic attitude toward the \ntechnological ability of the people in the industries of the United \nStates, and one that I don't think the Senate of the United States \nshould accept.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, during this discussion of the \nTransportation appropriations bill, I've been reminded of a piece of \nSenate history--the push to break the railroad companies' iron grip on \nrailroad rates by setting up the Interstate Commerce Commission. It was \na fierce battle that pitted the public's interest against the economic \nand political might of the railroads, a clash that was ultimately won \nby those favoring regulation, resulting in the passage of the Hepburn \nAct in 1906.\n  One powerful voice for consumer interests in those days belonged to \nSenator Robert M. La Follette, Sr., of my home state of Wisconsin, one \nof the greatest Senators ever to hold the office. It's fitting that his \nportrait now hangs in the Senate Reception Room outside of this chamber \nalong with four other legendary Senators--Daniel Webster, Henry Clay, \nJohn C. Calhoun, and Robert Taft.\n  A fearless champion of the American people in the face of the \npowerful influence of special interests, La Follette did not hesitate \nto speak out against the railroad companies. In fact, he did so during \nhis first speech in the U.S. Senate in April of 1906, when La Follette \nbroke the unwritten rule that freshman Senators did not make floor \nspeeches.\n  And La Follette didn't just make any floor speech--he delivered an \noration that lasted several days and covered 148 pages in the \nCongressional Record.\n  During those remarks, La Follette addressed the power of the railroad \nmonopolies and declared:\n\n       At no time in the history of any nation has it been so \n     difficult to withstand these forces as it is right here in \n     America today. Their power is acknowledged in every community \n     and manifest in every lawmaking body.\n\n  La Follette's battle with the railroad industry came to a head in the \nsummer of 1906, when he embarked on a speaking tour around the country. \nWhen visiting the states of his colleagues, he took the unprecedented \nstep of reading the roll call, name by name, of votes on amendments he \nhad proposed earlier that year to make railroad regulation more \nresponsive to consumer interests. This ``Calling of the Roll'' became a \ntrademark of La Follette's speeches, and its effect on his audiences \nwas powerful. When these constituents discovered that their \nrepresentatives were voting against their interests as consumers and in \nfavor of the railroads, they were outraged. According to the New York \nTimes,\n\n       The devastation created by La Follette last summer and in \n     the early fall was much greater than had been supposed. He \n     carried senatorial discourtesy so far that he has actually \n     imperiled the reelection of some of the gentlemen who hazed \n     him last winter.\n\n  In 1906, La Follette Called the Roll on amendments affecting the \nrailroad industry, and today, in the spirit of that effort, I'd like to \nCall the Bankroll on the railroad industry, which today is composed of \na handful of companies that monopolize the various regions of the U.S. \nrail system.\n  In 1906, Congress saw the need to regulate the railroad monopoly. \nToday, rapid consolidation in the industry has left us with four Class \nI railroads, two in the East and two in the West. This merger mania has \nresulted in reduced competition and another virtual monopoly for the \nrailroad companies. For rail customers and consumers today, this is \nsure to lead to higher costs and less attention to providing good \nservice, just as it did at the turn of the century. But the railroad \ncompanies are resisting any change, and backing up their point of view \nwith almost $4 million dollars in PAC and soft money contributions in \nthe last election cycle alone.\n  During 1997 and 1998, the four Class I railroads gave the following \nto political parties and candidates:\n  CSX Corporation gave more than $600,000 in unregulated soft money to \nthe parties and nearly $275,000 in PAC money to federal candidates;\n  Union Pacific gave more than $600,000 in soft money and more than \n$830,000 in PAC money;\n  Norfolk Southern gave more than $240,000 in unregulated money to the \nparties and almost a quarter million to candidates;\n  Burlington Northern Sante Fe gave more than $445,000 in soft money \nand nearly $210,000 in PAC money.\n  Mr. President, I Call the Bankroll on the railroad industry today \nbecause I'm deeply concerned about how little has changed since La \nFollette called the roll so many years ago. In 1907, a year after the \npassage of the Hepburn Act, Congress passed the Tillman Act, finally \nenacting campaign finance legislation that had been under consideration \nsince an investigation a few years earlier of insurance industry \ncontributions to the political parties. The Tillman Act banned \ncorporations from making political contributions in connection with \nfederal elections, and yet today the railroad companies and thousands \nof other corporations are giving millions of dollars--totally \nunregulated--to the political parties.\n  At the beginning of the century, we banned corporate spending in \nconnection with federal elections, but today that spending is rampant, \nruling our political system and ravaging our democracy. At the \nbeginning of the century, special interests used money as leverage to \nwin legislation in their favor. Today, with all the historic changes \nthis century has brought, this fact is more true, and more destructive \nto the people's confidence in our government, than ever.\n  But just as Congress had the power to pass the Tillman Act in 1907, \nCongress has the power today to pass legislation to curb the influence \nof money in politics by shutting down the soft money loophole. It's \ntime to put an end to the unregulated contributions that were outlawed \nnearly 100 years ago. It's time to pass McCain-Feingold and consign \nsoft money to the dustbin of history.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                            pipeline safety\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to request a colloquy with my \ncolleague from Washington state, Senator Gorton.\n  On June 10, 1999, 277,000 gallons of gasoline leaked from an \nunderground pipeline in Bellingham, Washington. It ignited and \nexploded. Three people were killed: an 18-year-old young man and two \n10-year old boys. This is a tragedy.\n  The Office of Pipeline Safety, the National Transportation Safety \nBoard, the FBI, the EPA and state agencies have spent the last four \nmonths trying to determine why this happened. We still don't know the \ndirect cause and may not know for some time.\n  I wish I could say this was an isolated instance, but I can't. Recent \npipeline accidents have occurred in other places. In Edison, New \nJersey, one person died when a natural gas pipe exploded. In Texas, two \npeople lost their lives when a butane release ignited. In fact, last \nNovember the owner of the pipeline that exploded in Bellingham had an \naccident in another part of my state that took six lives.\n  These pipelines are potential threats. There are some 160,000 miles \nof pipelines in the U.S. carrying hazardous materials. Many of these \npipes run\n\n[[Page S10923]]\n\nunder some of our most densely populated areas; under our schools, our \nhomes, and our businesses.\n  I am disappointed that this year the Transportation Appropriations \nSubcommittee did not adequately fund the Office of Pipeline Safety, the \nauthority governing interstate pipelines. I tried to get the \nappropriations in this year's bill to the level requested by the \nPresident. Unfortunately, we were unable to do so. It is my hope we can \nincrease funding in next year's appropriations.\n  I am also committed to strengthening OPS's oversight of pipelines and \ncommitment to community safety in next year's reauthorization of OPS.\n  I will be working with Senator Gorton, who is on the committee, to \nensure greater OPS effectiveness and oversight of the industry.\n  I also want to point out U.S. Transportation Secretary Rodney \nSlater's prompt attention to this issue. Immediately following the \naccident, he met with me and granted my request to have a full-time OPS \ninspector stationed in Washington State. He has also been very helpful \nand informative as we've progressed through the investigation phase. I \nthank him. I know he will continue to work with us in the future on \nOPS's appropriations and next year's authorization.\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank my colleague from Washington state. She has been \nout front on this issue, and I commend her for her persistence.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Murray during the \nreauthorization of the federal Office of Pipeline Safety, a piece of \nlegislation in which I will fully engage when it comes before the \nSenate Commerce Committee next year. While the interstate \ntransportation of hazardous materials in above and underground \npipelines has proven to be the safest and most cost-effective means to \ntransport these materials, the Bellingham tragedy has once again \nalerted us to its tragic potential. During the OPS reauthorization \nprocess I intend to ensure that the federal law and the federal agency \nare performing their jobs of ensuring that tragedies like the one in \nBillingham are not repeated. I will work closely with Chairman McCain, \nthe majority leader, and my Democratic colleagues to make this a top \npriority next year.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank my colleague. I will also continue to push for \nreform. We must take a long hard look at the effectiveness of OPS's \noversight activities; review ways to develop new technologies for \ndetecting pipeline defects; consider the effect of aging pipelines on \nsafety; review industry's influence on the regulation of pipelines; and \nfocus on our training and testing procedures for inspectors and \nmaintenance workers. I also intend to look at ways to treat \nenvironmentally sensitive and highly populated areas, recognizing the \nmultitude of safety and ecological problems operating pipelines in \nthese places can create.\n  Finally, I will work to strengthen communities' ``right to know,'' so \npeople are aware when there are problems with the pipelines that \nthreaten their neighborhoods.\n  Mr. GORTON. I share the Senator's concerns and I am certain we will \ndeal with those questions and ideas in the context of reauthorization \nlegislation.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to comment on an aspect of \nthe Transportation appropriations bill that I think deserves mention \nduring this debate. It's a factor that influences legislative debate, \nbut one that we consistently sidestep in our discussions on this \nfloor--money in politics.\n  Well, Mr. President, I'm trying to change that with what I call the \nCalling of the Bankroll. When I Call the Bankroll on this floor, I \ndescribe how much money the various interests that lobby us on a \nparticular bill have spent on campaign contributions to influence our \ndecisions here in this chamber. I have already Called the Bankroll on \nseveral bills; for instance, when I discussed the contributions of the \nhigh tech industry and the trial lawyers during debate on the Y2K bill, \nand, more recently, when I pointed out the contributions of the managed \ncare companies and the pharmaceutical industry, among others, during \nthe debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  And now, we come to the fiscal year 2000 Transportation \nappropriations bill, as it relates to the airline industry, which has \nbeen battling against another bill of rights. While in June the airline \nindustry unveiled its own Passengers' Bill of Rights, it falls far \nshort of what was outlined in other pending Senate legislation, \nincluding the Airline Passenger Fairness Act, of which I am a proud \ncosponsor. I want to take this opportunity to thank my colleague, \nSenator Wyden, for his leadership on this issue, and his commitment to \ngiving airline passengers across the country a real bill of rights. I \nam proud to be a co-sponsor of both amendments offered by my friend \nfrom Oregon.\n  The Airline Passenger Fairness Act establishes a national policy to \nprovide consumers with a basic expectation of fair treatment by \nairlines and to encourage airlines to provide better customer service \nby outlining minimum standards. The Airline Passenger Fairness Act \nwould ensure that passengers have the information that they need to \nmake informed choices in their air travel plans.\n  But, Mr. President, there is a serious obstacle facing supporters of \na comprehensive Passengers' Bill of Rights--the PAC and soft money \ncontributions of the airline industry.\n  The six largest airlines in the United States--American, Continental, \nDelta, Northwest, United and US Airways--and their lobbying \nassociation, the Air Transport Association of America, gave a total of \nmore than $2 million dollars in soft money and more than $1 million \ndollars in PAC money in the last election cycle alone.\n  Northwest was the largest soft money giver among these donors, giving \nwell over half a million dollars to the political parties in 1997 and \n1998. Mr. President, you may remember that Northwest Airlines made \nheadlines across the country earlier this year when they left thousands \nof passengers stranded on snow-clogged runways in Detroit, leaving some \nof their customers without food, water or working toilets for more than \neight hours.\n  Mr. President, according to the Department of Transportation, \nconsumer complaints about air travel shot up by more than 25 percent \nlast year. Those complaints run the gamut from erratic and unfair \nticket pricing; being sold a ticket on already oversold flights; lost \nluggage; and flight delays, changes, and cancellations.\n  We can and should address these problems, Mr. President. The American \npeople are demanding change; as legislators, we should respond.\n  But we have yet to do anything concrete in this Congress to guarantee \nairline passengers the rights they deserve.\n  The American people can't help wondering why, Mr. President, so today \nI offer this campaign finance information to my colleagues and the \npublic to help to present a clearer picture of the influences \nsurrounding this aspect of the Transportation appropriations bill, and \nthe influence of those with a stake in the debate on a comprehensive \nPassengers' Bill of Rights.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be allowed \nto proceed as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/15/senate-section/article/S10923-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10923-S10925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE TRUTH ABOUT BUDGET SURPLUSES\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, now that the tax cut bill will \nassuredly be vetoed, it is time to turn our attention to passing a \nbudget that will respond to the needs of our citizens, keep our \nspending under control, maintain the integrity of the Social Security \ntrust funds, and not increase our terrible national debt.\n  When I was back in Ohio during the August break, almost everybody I \ntalked to said they were glad that I opposed the tax cut that was based \non the 10-year rosy projections, which I referred to as a mirage. Every \nexpert in America said that to base tax cuts or new spending on such \nprojections was fiscally irresponsible.\n  The people who I spoke with told me that if it was not a mirage, then \nCongress should use the money to pay down the $5.6 trillion national \ndebt and get out of dealing with the problems of Social Security and \nMedicare.\n  They also said if we got to a point down the road where we got real \nmoney for a tax cut, we should do it when the\n\n[[Page S10924]]\n\neconomy needs stimulation and not right now.\n  Quite a few of these same Ohioans said to me: For goodness sakes, \nCongress should not sit down with President Clinton and negotiate a tax \nreduction for spending increases--just pass an honest budget.\n  As my colleagues know, the President has hinted that he may be \nwilling to strike a deal for small tax cuts in exchange for a few \nspending increases. That would be an absolute disaster for our \ncountry's financial health, and I am pleased the majority leader has \nfirmly rejected this approach.\n  I have no doubt that the President will promise future tax cuts while \ninsisting on immediate spending. The problem will be, I fear, that the \ntax cuts will never materialize, and the spending will fund programs \nthat will become entrenched. And what's worse, he will use the so-\ncalled surplus to pay for this new spending.\n  Let's get back to basics: There is no surplus. I have said it before \nand I will say it again: The only surplus we have is made up of Social \nSecurity funds.\n  Let me just say right here that I really wish the President, the \nCongress, and the media would start giving an accurate portrayal of the \nsurplus and call it what it is--either the ``Social Security'' surplus \nor the ``on-budget'' surplus. And right now, the only surplus we have \nis a Social Security surplus.\n  I want to show a chart I have used in other speeches on the floor. It \nbasically shows that even in 1999, when we are talking about a surplus, \nwe are actually running a budget deficit of some $4 billion. The first \ntime we are going to have the real on-budget surplus in approximately \n30 years is next year, as projected by CBO. We have not yet \naccumulated, this year, all of the tax revenues necessary to meet and \nexceed our spending in fiscal year 1999.\n  The only way we can claim a budget surplus today is by taking the \nsurplus that is accumulating in the Social Security trust fund and \nusing it to mask the deficit, just as has been done in previous years. \nThe $14 billion projected ``on-budget\" surplus for next year--which \nwould be the first on-budget surplus, as I said, in over 30 years--is \nby no means secure.\n  In fact, CBO Director Dan Crippen has already warned us that if we \nstay on the current path with the appropriations bills, we could turn \nthe $14 billion projected ``on-budget'' surplus into an $11 billion \ndeficit. And by doing so, we would be breaking our word with the \nAmerican people to never again raid the Social Security trust funds. \nThat would be outrageous given all the promises we have made to them \nand given all the debate I have heard on the Senate floor over Social \nSecurity lockbox legislation.\n  Right now, our primary responsibility is to be as conscientious as \npossible and come up with the best budget plan for fiscal year 2000.\n  We also need to resist the President's push to expand current \nprograms and to create new entitlements. The President has consistently \nbeen bringing his case directly to the American people, proposing new \nspending programs wherever he goes.\n  At the same time, he says he is for debt reduction and saving Social \nSecurity. That is plain hogwash. What most people don't know is the \nPresident's latest budget proposal would boost spending in 81 \nGovernment programs, create budget deficits, and as a result, raid \nbillions of dollars from the Social Security trust funds over the next \n10 years.\n  This year, in accordance with the 1997 Balanced Budget Act, which \nCongress passed and President Clinton signed, we are supposed to spend \n$27 billion less than last year. In other words, when the budget \nagreement was put together by Congress, they anticipated we would spend \n$27 billion less this year than last year.\n  Let's face the facts. The only way we are going to deal with the \nbudget and handle all of these items that need to be addressed is one \nof four ways:\n  One, we can tighten our belts by finding places to cut spending in \ncurrent Federal programs and reallocate those resources; two, we can \nraise taxes in order to provide services --a course of action I don't \nfavor; three, we can use whatever on-budget surplus we may have next \nyear, although in all likelihood it has already been spoken for; four, \nwe can use the Social Security surpluses by raiding the trust funds.\n  Those are the alternatives. All in all, these are four difficult \nchoices, but I think most Americans would agree that the most \nresponsible choice is to cut unnecessary spending.\n  For example, we could start by eliminating the Welfare-to-Work \nProgram. This program, which was initiated by the President, has had a \ntotal of $3 billion appropriated to it over the last 2 years. However, \nin the same period, the States and territories that chose to \nparticipate--and not all of them did--have only spent $182 million of \nthose funds. That's because the money comes with too many strings \nattached for States and because it is a complete duplication of the \nTemporary Assistance for Needy Families program, or, TANF.\n\n  Last year when I was governor, Ohio and five other States didn't even \napply for the money under Welfare-to-Work. In Ohio, we rejected $88 \nmillion. I believed that Ohio and the Federal Government had made a \ndeal; that we were going to take care of our responsibilities under the \nnew welfare law with the money that Congress allocated to us in the \nwelfare reform legislation.\n  After Welfare-to-Work, we should take the time, do the hard work and \nmake the tough choices by determining what other Federal programs and \npork-barrel spending we can trim in order to find the money necessary \nto meet our Nation's priorities.\n  We should be just as enthusiastic, in my opinion, in terms of \nreducing taxes as we are just as conscientious in terms of finding ways \nwe can cut funding.\n  Most importantly, we need to instill truth-in-budgeting. The last \nthing we want to do is ruin our credibility by being dishonest. We need \nto end all the accounting gimmicks, such as extending the calendar to \n13 months in order to accommodate excess spending, or ``forward \nfunding'' certain programs to avoid having to pay for them this year. \nIn fact, as I understand from Senator Domenici, Chairman of the Senate \nBudget Committee, the President has $19 billion in his budget that \nencompasses forward funding.\n  We should let the American people know that we're doing such things. \nIt's their money; they have a right to know. But, we should strive at \nall times not to use ``smoke and mirrors'' to make the debt look \nsmaller or the budget appear balanced on paper when in reality, it is \nnot. They are onto it.\n  We shouldn't be ``mixing and matching'' to give us the numbers that \nwill give us the best budget results. We need to agree on a set of \nnumbers exclusively. If we're going to use CBO numbers, then we should \nconsistently use CBO's numbers. Same thing with OMB. It is \nintellectually dishonest to constantly change numbers --picking and \nchoosing as we go along.\n  Well, we will use CBO's numbers and next we will use OMB's figures.\n  When I was Governor of Ohio, the first thing we did was sit down with \nthe legislature and we said let's agree on the numbers. We agreed on \nthe numbers. That is what we dealt with.\n  In addition, if we want to avoid dipping into Social Security, then \nwe should be prepared to make the hard choices and not declare \neverything an emergency. As every Member of this body knows, ever since \nthe statutory spending caps were first enacted in 1990 to rein in \nrunaway discretionary spending, Congress has used the ``emergency'' \nloophole to get around them.\n  Mr. President, we have to stop these gimmicks! It's game playing! \nIt's smoke and mirrors! And our constituents know it and they want us \nto put an end to it.\n  It's high time we start to give serious consideration to a two year \nbudget cycle like many states have, including Ohio. It doesn't make \nsense that we go through this budget exercise each year; a process that \njust exhausts this body and prevents us from being able to work towards \ndown-sizing government and lowering our expenses.\n  If we had 2-year budgets, we could spend some time on the oversight \nthat this body has a responsibility to be doing.\n  Until then, if something is truly an emergency, then Congress should \nbe more than willing to come up with the money to pay for it. Only in \ntimes of war or severe economic crisis should we even be talking about \ndipping into Social Security. As I have said before, Social Security is \nthe Nation's pension\n\n[[Page S10925]]\n\nfund, and no responsible citizen would tap into their retirement fund \nunless it was an absolute last resort--and they would certainly look to \npay it back. Congress must act accordingly.\n  Mr. President, all of us in Congress should take the equivalent of a \nblood oath that we are not going to touch Social Security. Period. It \nwould be the most important thing we could possibly do to bring fiscal \naccountability to this country because we've been using the social \nsecurity trust funds and public borrowing to fund tax reductions and \nspending for the last 30 years and in that same period of time, we've \nseen our national debt increase over 1,300 percent.\n  Think of that--1,300 percent.\n  We have to remember that there is no such thing as a free lunch, but \nthere are such things as hard choices. That is what we should be \nabout--making the hard choices.\n  I know that first hand because as Governor, I have been there; I had \nto make the $750 million in spending cuts, but because of the fiscally \nresponsible choices we made, we had the lowest growth in 30 years and \nhad 17% fewer employees--excluding prison workers.\n  In addition, we ultimately gave Ohio a general revenue rainy day fund \nof over $935 million--after it had been depleted to 14 cents.\n  Think of that. It was at 14 cents--a Medicaid rainy day fund of $100 \nmillion and real tax cuts. I am talking about real tax cuts for the \nlast 3 years, including last year for all Ohioans who had an across-\nthe-board reduction in their State income tax of almost 10 percent.\n  That is why I came to Washington--to try and bring fiscal \nresponsibility to our nation and this Congress so that my children and \nmy grandchildren as well as all children and grandchildren are not \nsaddled with the cost of those things that my generation did not want \nto pay for, and guarantee our covenant to the American people in regard \nto Social Security and Medicare.\n  I would like to remind my colleagues that with each passing day, \nwe're paying $600 million in interest payments just to service the \nnational debt--a national debt that is $5.6 trillion.\n  Most Americans do not realize that 14 percent of their tax dollar \ngoes to pay off the interest on the debt. Fifteen percent goes for \nnational defense. Seventeen percent goes to non-defense discretionary \nspending. And 54 percent goes for entitlement spending.\n  So how much is our interest payment in comparison to other federal \nspending? It is more than we spend on Medicare. It's five times more \nthan the federal dollars we spend on education. And it's 15 times more \nthan we spend on medical research at NIH.\n  If we are fortunate enough that the projections of an on-budget \nsurplus actually occurs--I would like to see that --the best possible \ncourse of action that we could take is to use those funds and pay down \nthe debt. With debt reduction you get lower interest rates, a continued \nstrong economy and lower government interest costs.\n  Indeed, as Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan testified before the \nHouse Ways and Means Committee ``(T)he advantages that I perceive that \nwould accrue to this economy from a significant decline in the \noutstanding debt to the public and its virtuous cycle on the total \nbudget process is a value which I think far exceeds anything else we \ncould do with the money.''\n  Mr. President, we must avoid using Social Security to meet our \nfinancial obligations. Instead, we should greet the millennium with a \npromise to our citizens that we will engage in truth-in-budgeting, not \nuse gimmicks and re-order our spending to reflect our national \npriorities.\n  Mr. President, I believe that a statement I made in my 1991 Inaugural \nAddress as Governor of Ohio is relevant today:\n\n       Gone are the days when public officials are measured by how \n     much they spend on a problem. The new realities dictate that \n     public officials are now judged on whether they can work \n     harder and smarter, and do more with less.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I commend my good friend and colleague, \nSenator Voinovich from Ohio, who I think has brought to the attention \nof this body in a timely manner a very appropriate and important issue; \nthat is, the realization that the President is going to reject any \nproposal for a tax cut--and bring to the attention of this body the \nrealization that, indeed, that accumulated debt of $5.6 trillion, which \nthe Senator from Ohio referred to, is costing us interest.\n  As the Senator from Ohio is well aware, I was in the banking business \nfor about 25 years. People do not recognize the carrying charge. I \nthink the figure that was used was $600 million per day.\n  Interest is like the old saying of having a horse that eats while you \nsleep. It is ongoing. It doesn't take Saturdays or Sundays off.\n  If one considers the significance of, I think the figure was 14 cents \nout of every dollar going for interest, one can quickly comprehend what \nwe could do if we were free of that heavy obligation.\n  I commend the Senator for bringing this matter to the attention of \nthis body and assure him of my eagerness to work with him to bring \nabout and resolve in a responsible manner a program to address the \naccumulated debt.\n  As he has pointed out, there is an awful lot of procedure around here \nrelative to the bookkeeping method of the Federal Government, which few \npeople understand.\n  Nevertheless, there is a harsh reality that we have a hard debt of \n$5.6 billion. We have an opportunity now with the Social Security \nsurplus to address that debt. I agree with the Senator and his efforts \nto try to bring a consensus on this issue. I commend him highly. Let me \nassure the Senator of my willingness to work in that regard.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Murkowski pertaining to the introduction of S. \n1591 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/15/senate-section/article/S10925-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SHELBY.

Mr. President, yesterday my colleagues, Senator Enzi and \nSenator Gorton, discussed the importance of a proposed new clean coal \ninitiative that offers the opportunity to create a new type of cleaner-\nburning coal that will help to meet our nation's energy needs and the \nrequirements of the Clean Air Act. I want to lend my strong support to \nthis initiative, and express my hope that the Department of Energy and \nCongress can work together to find a way to fund this important \nproject.\n  Under this initiative, the Black Hills Corporation of Rapid City, \nSouth Dakota, would work with the Department of Energy to test a new \nmethod of processing sub-bituminous coal to remove its moisture content \nand increase its heat-value. This new technology is much less capital \nintensive than any other coal enhancement technology known to exist \ntoday and has the real potential of becoming the first such process to \nbe commercially feasible. It is my understanding that the upgraded coal \nwhich would be produced by this new process would be environmentally \nsuperior to current sub-bituminous coal and less expensive to ship, \nallowing coal users across the country to benefit from it.\n  There are extensive reserves of sub-bituminous coal in the Powder \nRiver basin, and particularly on the reservation of the Crow Indian \nTribe. By expanding the market for coal from this area, we can help to \npromote economic development across the west. At the same time, we can \nprovide coal users throughout the United States with cleaner-burning \ncoal, and help to improve our air quality.\n  It is my hope that we can move forward with this project as quickly \nas possible.

Mr. President, I rise to thank Senator Slade Gorton, \nChairman of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, for his, as well \nas his staff's, efforts to work with me and my staff to address \nconcerns regarding\n\n[[Page S10926]]\n\na potential funding freeze for the Weatherization Assistance Program. I \nam very pleased that the Chairman was able to obtain an additional $2 \nmillion, at my urging, for the Weatherization Assistance Program, \nincreasing the FY 2000 funding level to $135 million.\n  Weatherization is an especially critical program to the Northeast-\nMidwest region. It increases energy efficiency in low-income homes, \nreducing energy use by up to one-third. More than four and a half \nmillion households have been weatherized through this program over the \npast twenty years. Weatherization returns $1.80 in energy savings for \nevery dollar spent; and provides an additional $0.60 in employment and \nenvironmental benefits.\n  This year, 31 Senators voiced support for an increase in \nweatherization funding. In light of recent forecasts of rising fuel \ncosts, weatherization funding has never been more critical. By \nproviding targeted support in anticipation of extreme weather \nconditions, we can ensure the health, safety, and well-being of \nmillions of low-income families, including the especially vulnerable \npopulations of low-income children and elderly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/15/senate-section/article/S10926-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          BRYAN AMENDMENT OF THE INTERIOR APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to state my \nviews on the Bryan amendment regarding the Timber Sales Management \nprogram within the National Forest Service. I am concerned about \nenvironmental protection and safeguarding our Nation's Forests, \nproviding that there is an appropriate balance for economic development \nand job opportunities.\n  My state of Pennsylvania has one of the best run National Forests in \nthe country. The Allegheny National Forest has some of the most \nvaluable timber in the world, particularly its black cherry, which is \nused internationally for fine furniture and veneers. As an above cost \nforest, the Allegheny returns approximately $10 million to the Treasury \nannually and generates $44 million in total income and an estimated 732 \njobs. The rural Pennsylvania counties that surround the Allegheny \nNational Forest substantially rely on these revenues to fund their \nlocal school systems.\n  The Bryan amendment would provide the Timber Sales Management Program \nwith the level of funding requested by the Administration. This is the \nprogram that funds the important work that is done to ensure that all \ntimber cutting in our National Forests is done in an environmentally \nappropriate manner. The program is vital to restoring, improving and \nmaintaining the health of our National Forests and it ensures that \nforests fully comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). \nFurther, the amendment would take the $32 million dollars that was \nadded to this program by the Senate Interior Appropriations \nSubcommittee and would use the money to continue road maintenance and \nto conduct biological surveys of the National Forests.\n  I am convinced that we must continue to manage our National Forest \nsystem in a fiscal and environmental responsible manner. On final \nconsideration, I believe this amendment strikes a fair balance between \nthe efficient use of our National Forests and the funding of \nenvironmental programs that are vital to enhance the public's use and \nenjoyment of our national forests for many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/15/senate-section/article/S10926-2", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COLD WATER FISH HABITAT\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I thank Senators Gorton and Byrd for \ninclusion of an amendment to provide funding for a voluntary \nenrollment, cold water fish habitat conservation plan (HCP) in the \nStates of Idaho and Montana. This project is already authorized under \nthe Endangered Species Act (ESA). Habitat Conservation Plans (HCPs) \nwere authorized in 1982 to allow private landowners where endangered \nspecies are found a chance to write site-specific management plans and, \nin some cases, allow other activity to continue on those lands. A \nproject similar to this involving the Karner Blue Butterfly in \nWisconsin is considered an HCP success story.\n  In Idaho alone, of the 2,639,633 acres of State-owned endowment land, \nover half is bull trout habitat. Wise and productive use of state \nendowment land is essential to the funding of education in Idaho and \nthis use could be jeopardized should it be called into question as a \n``take'' under Section 9 of the ESA. The large area comprising bull \ntrout habitat complicates not only natural resource uses of the land, \nbut the management strategy of involved agencies in addressing habitat \nfor the bull trout. With the huge land area involved, the U.S. Fish and \nWildlife Service in Idaho concurs that a cooperative effort will be \nnecessary to effect management practices to benefit the bull trout. The \nStates of Idaho and Montana have already been active in addressing bull \ntrout habitat needs--last year, they spent nearly $1 million \ncollectively to promote bull trout recovery.\n  It is clear that a cooperative effort, involving the States of Idaho \nand Montana, the USFWS, and private forest owners will be necessary to \naddress the challenge of providing clean, cold water for bull trout \nhabitat. The formulation of a voluntary enrollment, state-wide HCP will \nprovide the structure for this cooperation. HCPs have a proven record \nof creating tangible benefits that aid in species protection and this \nHCP would both protect bull trout habitat and responsible land use. For \nan HCP to be approved, the Secretary must find that those party to the \nagreement will ``to the maximum extent possible, minimize and mitigate \nthe impacts of * * * taking'' of the species in question.\n  In recent hearings that I have held on HCPs in my subcommittee, \nnumerous scientists have testified to the effectiveness of HCPs in \nfurthering on the ground improvements to the habitat of threatened and \nendangered species. The funds provided for in this amendment will be \nused to fund data collection an organization for the States to come \ntogether and negotiate the HCP. The negotiated HCP would include state-\nowned endowment lands and private lands enrolled voluntarily by the \nlandowner. To arrive at the specific terms of such an agreement, a \nconcerted effort will be needed to accumulate data and facilitate \ndiscussions that can lead to a consensus-based solution supported by \nall interested parties.\n  The States of Idaho and Montana, nor the USFWS, cannot shoulder this \nfunding burden alone. The funds provided for in this amendment are \nurgently needed. In addition to the overwhelming task of addressing \nbull trout habitat issues, the USFWS has been petitioned to list the \nwest-slope cutthroat trout and the Yellowstone cutthroat trout. We \nseek, in partnership with the USFWS and the private sector, funding to \ndevelop an innovative HCP that can be a ``win'' for kids, for species, \nand for responsible land use.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/15/senate-section/article/S10926-3", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10926-S10927]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               OEHS WEEK\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, the first Occupational and Environmental \nHealth and Safety, OEHS Week, August 30 through September 3, 1999, is a \nreminder that while workers are safer than they used to be, injury, \nillness--even death--in the workplace is still an unfortunate reality.\n  The American Industrial Hygiene Association, a not-for-profit society \nof professionals in the field of occupational and environmental health \nand safety, sponsors OEHS Week and plans for it to become an annual \nevent. The goal is to bring a greater awareness of workplace and \ncommunity health issues to the public. The theme, ``Protecting Your \nFuture . . . Today,'' highlights the far-reaching nature of \noccupational and environmental safety's impact on the public.\n  ``We chose Labor Day weekend as the perfect time to remind workers, \nmanagement and the community at large that workplace safety affects \neveryone. Even one fatality on the job is one fatality too much,'' says \nAIHA President James R. Thornton.\n  ``But beyond that, we are concerned with overall safety. We want all \nemployees to consider their workplace environment, even in offices that \notherwise may seem extremely safe. For instance, is your workstation \nergonomically sound? Is your chair comfortable? Do you take occasional \nbreaks to stretch? Is your computer monitor at the proper angle? All of \nthese things can add up to the difference between working safely and a \nwork-related injury or illness.\n\n[[Page S10927]]\n\n  ``We've made great strides in the last few years,'' he said, ``but \nthere's still room for improvement.''\n  As Thornton noted, if you've been working in the United States for \nthe last decade, chances are that you're feeling safer on the job today \nthan you did 10 years ago. That's because overall rates of worker \nillnesses and injuries have fallen dramatically since 1993, according \nto the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In fact, in 1997 (the most recent \nyear tallied by the BLS), the case rate dropped to 7.1 percent of all \nworkers, despite a total of 3 percent more hours worked by the nation's \nemployees. This translates to nearly 50,000 fewer reported injuries or \nillnesses compared to the previous year, despite the larger number of \nstaff-hours--the continuation of a trend that began in 1993. Still, \neven with fewer reported illnesses, injuries and fatalities on the job, \nworkers suffered 2.9 million injuries that resulted in lost workdays, \nrestricted duties or both.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, the construction trades in particular are quite \ndangerous. Secretary of Labor Alexis Herman reported recently that \n``injuries and illnesses for construction laborers, carpenters, and \nwelders and cutters increased by a total of 8,000 cases.'' Truck \ndrivers, too, suffer more than their share of injuries, incurring \napproximately 145,000 work-related injuries or illnesses each year.\n  For the average worker, backs take the brunt of the injuries. About 4 \nout of 10 injuries involve strains and sprains, most of them back-\nrelated. Women are more susceptible than men to repetitive motion \nillnesses from jobs such as keyboarding, data entry, cashier work and \nscanning. These musculoskeletal disorders, known as MSDs, include \ncarpal-tunnel syndrome and tendinitis. Many are caused by faulty \nergonomic conditions in the workplace, such as poorly placed furniture \nand improper counter heights, say industrial hygiene, IH, \nprofessionals, experts in occupational and environmental health and \nsafety.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, although workplace injury is a primary focus \nfor IH professionals, they like to point out that safety issues don't \ndisappear in the company parking lot. This awareness gives OEHS Week \nits second important emphasis--safety in the community and home.\n  Thornton noted that in addition to its focus on workplace safety, \nOEHS Week is designed to heighten awareness about several vital \ncommunity health concerns, including carbon monoxide poisoning, indoor \nair quality and noise exposure.\n  ``Just as in the workplace, paying attention to seemingly small \nthings can reduce injuries in the home. There are lots of things the \naverage person can do,'' said Thornton. ``Reducing noise pollution and \nhearing loss by lowering the volume on stereos or wearing earplugs when \nmowing the lawn, for instance.\n  ``We also recommend installing a couple of inexpensive carbon \nmonoxide detectors in your home. They could save your life--and your \nfamily's lives as well.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/15/senate-section/article/S10927-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10927]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            NGAWANG CHOEPHEL\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it was 4 years ago that Nagwang Choephel, a \nTibetan who studied ethnomusicology at Middlebury College in Vermont on \na Fulbright Scholarship, was arrested in Tibet in 1995.\n  After imprisoning him incommunicado for 15 months, on December 26, \n1996, Chinese officials sentenced Mr. Choephel to 18 years in prison on \ncharges of espionage.\n  Four years have passed and despite high level discussions about this \ncase between the administration and Chinese officials, resolutions \npassed in both the Senate and the House on Mr. Choephel's behalf, and a \nnumber of worldwide letter writing campaigns, he remains incarcerated \nin a remote corner of Tibet for a crime he did not commit.\n  The Chinese Government has never provided evidence to support their \nallegations that Mr. Choephel was sent by the Dalai Lama to gather \nintelligence and engage in separatist activities.\n  The State Department has no evidence that he participated in any \nillegal or political activity.\n  What is indisputable, however, is that Mr. Choephel traveled to Tibet \nwith a donated video camera and recording equipment to document Tibetan \nmusic and dance--subjects he studied as a young man in India and as a \nFulbright Scholar in Vermont.\n  The sixteen hours of footage that Mr. Choephel sent out of Tibet \nbefore his arrest affirm this fact. It simply shows the traditional \ndancing and singing that is an integral part of Tibet's rich cultural \nheritage.\n  I have spoken out many times about this tragic miscarriage of \njustice.\n  I have twice discussed my concerns with Chinese President Jiang, once \nin Beijing and again in Washington. I and other Members of Congress \nhave written letter after letter to the Chinese Ambassador in \nWashington and other Chinese officials seeking information about Mr. \nChoephel's whereabouts and his well-being. I have tried to arrange \nmeetings with Chinese authorities here, to no avail.\n  As we commemorate this sad anniversary, we know no more about Mr. \nChoephel's condition than we did 4 years ago.\n  His mother, who has repeatedly sought permission from the Chinese \nGovernment to visit her only child, has not given up. She continues her \ntireless campaign for his freedom on the streets of New Delhi.\n  I had hoped that Chinese authorities would have recognized by now the \ngrave mistake they made in sentencing Mr. Choephel. International \noutrage over this case mounts with each additional year he spends in \njail.\n  Congress, the administration, and the international community must \ncontinue to do whatever it can to ensure that next year at this time we \nare celebrating this young man's release, and the release of the many \nother political prisoners who are being unfairly detained in Tibet and \nChina.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/15/senate-section/article/S10927-2", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10927]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to convert two temporary Federal judgeships in the \ncentral and southern districts of Illinois to permanent judgeships, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                       The Illinois Judgeship Act\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today joined by colleague Senator \nFitzgerald, I am introducing a bill that will make two temporary \nfederal judgeships in Illinois permanent. The Southern District of \nIllinois, and the Central District of Illinois each have 3 permanent \njudgeships and one temporary judgeship.\n  The Judicial Improvement Act of 1990 created these temporary \njudgeships to respond to a sharply increasing caseload, especially in \nthe area of drug related crimes. President Bush appointed Judge Joe \nBilly McDade to fill the temporary judgeship in the Central District of \nIllinois and he was confirmed by the Senate in November of 1991. In \nSeptember of 1992 the Senate confirmed another Bush nominee, Judge \nJ.Phil Gilbert to fill the temporary judgeship in the Southern District \nof Illinois.\n  In 1997, Congress extended the temporary judgeships until 10 years \nafter the confirmation of the judge appointed to fill the vacancy. As a \nresult, the temporary judgeship in the Central District is due to \nexpire in November of 2001 and the temporary judgeship in the Southern \nDistrict will expire in September of 2002. Since the judges that serve \nin these positions are Article III judges with lifetime appointments, \nthey will not be affected, but the next vacancy within each district \nafter the expiration date will not be filled.\n  The Central District and the Southern District of Illinois are small \ncourts and the loss of even one judgeship will have a dramatic impact \non the caseload of the remaining judges. The statistics on this issue \nare compelling.\n  The Administrative Office of the United States Courts keeps \nstatistics on the average amount of time that it takes a civil case to \ncome to trial. Even with 4 judgeships, the Central District of Illinois \nhas a substantial wait for civil litigants--24 months, which is five \nmonths longer than the national average. In the Southern District of \nIllinois, the numbers are equally convincing--22 months on average for \na civil case to go to trial, which is three months longer than the \nnational average.\n  If these courts lose one judgeship, which is the equivalent of 25% of \ntheir judges, justice for federal court litigants will be substantially \ndelayed. This delay will be felt most by civil litigants because judges \nwill give priority to criminal cases. At a time when Congress is \nseeking to expand Federal court jurisdiction, a loss of judgeships, \neven temporary ones is a step in the wrong direction.\n  Again, the numbers tell the story. Assuming court filings remain at \nthe 1998 level, the number of cases per judge in the Central District \nwould increase by 33% from 383 to 511. In the\n\n[[Page S10930]]\n\n Southern District, the remaining judges would be expected to take on \nan extra 135 cases a year, an increase of 33% from 406 cases per judge \nto 541 cases per judge.\n  The two temporary judgeships in the Central and Southern Districts of \nIllinois must be converted into permanent positions. This measure will \nprevent judicial overload and ensure the continued smooth functioning \nof the federal court system in Illinois.\n  Our independent judiciary is the envy of the rest of the world. The \nstrength of our judiciary is a unique and distinctive characteristic of \nour government. We must ensure that our courts have the judges they \nneed to perform their vital functions.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support me in this effort and ask that \nthe Senate consider this bill without further delay.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1583\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish the Schuylkill River Valley National \nHeritage Area in the State of Pennsylvania; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/15/senate-section/article/S10930-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10930-S10944]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                SCHUYLKILL RIVER NATIONAL HERITAGE AREA\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \nwould establish the Schuylkill River National Heritage Area. This \nlegislation recognizes the significance of the Schuylkill River Valley \nin Pennsylvania, and the role it played in the nation's economic \nexpansion during the nineteenth century.\n  The Schuylkill River, and later the railroads, moved anthracite coal \nthrough the river valley to Philadelphia and beyond, fueling the \nindustrial revolution that made this country great. It is important \nthat we endeavor to preserve the historical and cultural contribution \nthat the anthracite and related industries have made to our nation. The \nlabor movement of the region played a significant role in crucial \nstruggles to improve wages and working conditions for America's \nworkers. The first national labor union was organized in this region \nand was the forerunner to the United Mine Workers of America.\n  In 1995, under the management of the Schuylkill River Greenway \nAssociation (SRGA), the Schuylkill River Corridor was recognized as a \nstate heritage park by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Since that \ntime, the SRGA has dedicated itself to restoring and preserving the \nhistoric Schuylkill River Corridor by encouraging enhancement and \nmaintenance of the historic qualities of the river from its headwaters \nin Schuylkill County to its mouth at the confluence of the Delaware \nRiver.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today, with the support of \nSenator Specter, will enable communities to conserve their heritage \nwhile continuing to create economic opportunities. It encourages the \ncontinuation of local interest by demonstrating the federal \ngovernment's commitment to preserving the unique heritage of the \nSchuylkill River Heritage Corridor. This bill will require the \nSchuylkill River Greenway Association to enter into a cooperative \nagreement with the Secretary of the Interior to establish Heritage Area \nboundaries, and to prepare and implement a management plan within three \nyears. This plan would inventory resources and recommend policies for \nresource management interpretation. Further, based on the criteria of \nother Heritage Areas established by the Omnibus Parks and Public Lands \nManagement Act of 1996, this bill requires that federal funds provided \nunder this bill do not exceed 50 percent of the total cost of the \nprogram.\n  Mr. President, the anthracite coal fields of the Schuylkill River \nCorridor, and the people who mined them, were crucial to the industrial \ndevelopment of this nation. Through public and private partnership, \nthis legislation will allow for the conservation, enhancement, and \ninterpretation of the historical, cultural, and natural resources of \nthe Schuylkill River Valley for present and future generations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1584\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Schuylkill River Valley \n     National Heritage Area Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to establish a Congressional Trade Office; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                 congressional trade office legislation\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am introducing today a bill to create a \nnew Congressional Trade Office that will provide the Congress with \nadditional trade expertise--independent, non-partisan, and neutral \nexpertise.\n  Over the past 25 years that I have served in the Congress, I have \nwatched a continuing transfer of authority and responsibility for trade \npolicy from the Congress to the Executive Branch. The trend has been \nsubtle, but it has been clear and constant. We need to reverse this \ntrend. Congress has the Constitutional authority to provide more \neffective and active oversight of our nation's trade policy, and we \nshould use it. Congress should be more active in setting the direction \nfor the Executive Branch in its formulation of trade policy. I believe \nstrongly that we must re-assert Congress' constitutionally defined \nresponsibility for international commerce.\n  The Congressional Trade Office will provide the entire Congress, \nthrough the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means \nCommittee, with this additional trade expertise.\n  I am proposing that the Congressional Trade Office have three sets of \nresponsibilities.\n  First, it will monitor compliance with major bilateral, regional, and \nmultilateral trade agreements. It will analyze the success of those \nagreements based on commercial results, and it will do this in close \nconsultation with the affected industries. It will recommend actions \nnecessary to ensure that those countries that have made commitments to \nthe United States fully abide by those commitments. It will also \nprovide annual assessments of the extent to which current agreements \ncomply with labor goals and with environmental goals in those \nagreements.\n  Second, the Congressional Trade Office will have an analytic \nfunction. For example, after the Administration delivers its National \nTrade Estimates report to the Congress each year, it will analyze the \nmajor outstanding trade barriers based on the cost to the U.S. economy. \nAfter the Administration delivers its Trade Policy Agenda to the \nCongress each year, it will provide an analysis of that agenda, \nincluding alternative goals, strategies, and tactics.\n  The Congressional Trade Office will analyze proposed trade \nagreements, including agreements that do not require legislation to \nenter into effect. It will analyze the impact of Administration trade \npolicy actions, including an assessment of the Administration's \nargument for not accepting an unfair trade practices case. And it will \nanalyze the trade accounts every quarter, including the global current \naccount, the global trade account, and key bilateral trade accounts.\n  Third, the Congressional Trade Office will be active in dispute \nsettlement deliberations. It will evaluate each WTO decision where the \nU.S. is a participant. In the case of a U.S. loss, it will explain why \nit lost. In the case of a U.S. win, it will measure the commercial \nresults from that decision. It will do a similar evaluation for NAFTA \ndisputes. Congressional Trade Office staff will participate as \nobservers on the U.S. delegation at dispute settlement panel meetings \nat the WTO.\n  The Congressional Trade Office is designed to service the Congress. \nIts Director will report to the Senate Finance Committee and the House \nWays and Means Committee. It will also advise other committees on the \nimpact of trade negotiations and the Administration's trade policy on \nthose committees' areas of jurisdiction.\n\n  The staff will include a group of professionals with a mix of \nexpertise in economics and trade law, plus in various industries and \ngeographic regions. My expectation is that staff members will see this \nas a career position, thus, providing the Congress with long-term \ninstitutional memory.\n  The Congressional Trade Office will work closely with other \ngovernment entities involved in trade policy assessment, including the \nCongressional Research Service, the General Accounting Office, and the \nInternational Trade Commission. The Congressional Trade Office will not \nreplace those agencies. Rather, the Congressional Trade Office will \nsupplement their work, and leverage the work of those entities to \nprovide the Congress with timely analysis, information, and advice.\n  The areas of dispute resolution and compliance with trade agreements \nare central. The credibility of the global trading system, and the \nintegrity of American trade law, depend on the belief, held by trade \nprofessionals, political leaders, industry representatives, workers, \nfarmers, and the public at large, that agreements made are agreements \nfollowed. They must be fully implemented. There must be effective \nenforcement. Dispute settlement must be rapid and effective.\n  Often more energy goes into negotiating new agreements than into \nensuring that existing agreements work. Of course, it is necessary to \ncontinue efforts at trade liberalization globally. But support for \nthose efforts is a direct function of the perception that agreements \nwork. The Administration has increased the resources it devotes to \ncompliance. But an independent and neutral assessment of compliance is \nnecessary. It is unrealistic to expect an agency that negotiated an \nagreement to provide a totally objective and dispassionate assessment \nof that agreement's success or failure.\n  The Congressional Trade Office will perform an annual evaluation of \nthe commercial results of selected major bilateral trade agreements. \nThe American Chamber of Commerce in Japan did this type of evaluation \nseveral years ago, examining in detail 45 bilateral agreements, and \ntheir conclusions were shocking. Fewer than one-third of those \nagreements were considered fully successful by the industries affected. \nThe Congressional Trade Office should do this evaluation with our major \ntrading partners. They will also recommend actions necessary to ensure \nthat these agreements are fully implemented.\n  Looking at the WTO dispute settlement process, I don't think we even \nknow whether it has been successful or not from the perspective of U.S. \ncommercial interests. A count of wins versus losses tells us nothing. \nThe Congressional Trade Office will give us the facts we need to \nevaluate this process properly.\n  Article I, Section 8, of the U.S. Constitution says: ``The Congress \nshall have power . . . To regulate commerce with foreign nations.'' It \nis our responsibility to provide oversight and direction on US trade \npolicy. The Congressional Trade Office, as I have outlined it today, \nwill provide us in the Congress with the means to do so.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1585\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Congress has responsibility under the Constitution for \n     international commerce.\n       (2) Congressional oversight of trade policy has often been \n     hampered by a lack of resources.\n       (3) The United States has entered into numerous trade \n     agreements with foreign trading partners, including \n     bilateral, regional, and multilateral agreements.\n       (4) The purposes of the trade agreements are--\n       (A) to achieve a more open world trading system which \n     provides mutually advantageous market opportunities for trade \n     between the United States and foreign countries;\n       (B) to facilitate the opening of foreign country markets to \n     exports of the United States and other countries by \n     eliminating trade barriers and increasing the access of \n     United States industry and the industry of other countries to \n     such markets; and\n       (C) to reduce diversion of third country exports to the \n     United States because of restricted market access in foreign \n     countries.\n\n[[Page S10933]]\n\n       (5) Foreign country performance under certain agreements \n     has been less than contemplated, and in some cases rises to \n     the level of noncompliance.\n       (6) The credibility of, and support for, the United States \n     Government's trade policy is, to a significant extent, a \n     function of the belief that trade agreements made are trade \n     agreements enforced.\n\n     SEC. 2. ESTABLISHMENT OF OFFICE.\n\n       (a) In General.--There is established an office in Congress \n     to be known as the Congressional Trade Office (in this Act \n     referred to as the ``Office'').\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of the Office are as follows:\n       (1) To reassert the constitutional responsibility of \n     Congress with respect to international trade.\n       (2) To provide Congress, through the Committee on Finance \n     of the Senate and the Committee on Ways and Means of the \n     House of Representatives with additional independent, \n     nonpartisan, neutral trade expertise.\n       (3) To assist Congress in providing more effective and \n     active oversight of trade policy.\n       (4) To assist Congress in providing to the executive branch \n     more effective direction on trade policy.\n       (5) To provide Congress with long-term, institutional \n     memory on trade issues.\n       (6) To provide Congress with more analytical capability on \n     trade issues.\n       (7) To advise relevant committees on the impact of trade \n     negotiations, including past, ongoing, and future \n     negotiations, with respect to the areas of jurisdiction of \n     the respective committees.\n       (c) Director and Staff.--\n       (1) Director.--\n       (A) In general.--The Office shall be headed by a Director. \n     The Director shall be appointed by the Speaker of the House \n     of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the \n     Senate after considering the recommendations of the Chairman \n     and Ranking Member of the Committee on Finance of the Senate \n     and the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Committee on Ways \n     and Means of the House of Representative.

A bill to reduce the fractionated ownership of Indian Lands, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n                Indian Land Consolidation Act Amendments\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill to amend the \nIndian Land Consolidation Act (ILCA) of 1983 to address the issue of \nIndian land fractionation: the underlying factor in the Indian trust \nreform effort. Under the 1871 Allotment Act, or ``Dawes'' act as it \nbecame known, the President was authorized to break up Indian \nreservations, allotting to each member of the tribe a tract of land. \nThe Act also directed the Secretary of Interior to acquire some of the \nremaining tribal lands; often for subsequent resale to non-Indians. The \nday the Allotment Act became law, this country probably violated more \ntreaties than in the hundred years before this Act or in the hundred \nyears since.\n  The negative effects of the Act continue to be felt even to this day. \nFor example, the existence of hundreds of thousands of small, undivided \nfractional interests in Indian lands has swamped the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs' ability to keep track of who owns these interests, who is \nleasing them, how much is owed, and who has a right to the revenues \nfrom these lands.\n  In 1934, Congress enacted the Indian Reorganization Act (IRA), ending \nthe allotment policy and everything that it stood for by providing that \nno new allotments would be mandated by the federal government.\n  The IRA authorized the Secretary of Interior to acquire lands for \ntribes, enabling Indian tribes to re-establish their land bases which \nhad been decimated by the allotment policy. Notwithstanding the IRA, \nthe ownership of individual allotments continued to fragment. For \nexample the four heirs of an Indian who died owning a 160 acre \nallotment would each receive a 25 percent interest in the entire \nallotment; not a 40 acre parcel. If all four of those heirs had four \nchildren, these 16 heirs would each receive only a 1.56 percent \ninterest, divided among 64 owners.\n  In such situations, even locating the individuals to obtain their \napproval for a lease is nearly impossible. Clearly, getting a handle on \nthe geometric rise in fractionated interests is necessary or the \nproblem will be beyond our efforts to improve the management of tribal \ntrust lands and funds.\n  Previous Congressional efforts to reverse fractionation were declared \nunconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court. This proposal makes use of \nthe lessons we have learned from those efforts.\n  In 1983, Congress enacted the Indian Land Consolidation Act (ILCA), \nauthorizing Indian tribes to enact land consolidation plans to sell or \nlease their lands to acquire fractional interests. The Act also allowed \ntribes to acquire, at fair market value, all of the interests in an \nallotment, and to enact probate codes to limit inheritance of allotted \nlands to Indians or tribal members.\n  The most controversial provision of the ILCA involved an escheat \nprovision preventing the inheritance of any interest in land that was 2 \npercent or less of an undivided ownership in an allotment if it \ngenerated less than $100 before returning to the tribe.\n  The Supreme Court found this section unconstitutional because it \nrestricted Indians' ability to pass their land interests to their \nheirs.\n  In 1984 Congress amended the ILCA to provide that undivided interests \nof 2 percent or less only returned to the tribe if they were incapable \nof earning $100 in any one of the five years from the date of its \nowner's death. In 1997, the Court once again ruled that the escheat \nprovision of the act was unconstitutional.\n  The bill I am introducing today makes use of nearly two decades of \nCongressional efforts to deal with the problem of land fractionation. \nWe have the benefit of two Supreme Court cases to guide our \ndeliberations. I am pleased to report that associations of individual \nallotment owners, in particular the Indian Land Working Group, have \nmade very constructive proposals and contributions to our understanding \nof how land consolidation legislation may affect their members. The \nbill also uses the Administration's proposed legislation as a framework \nfor reforming the ILCA.\n  This bill establishes a three-pronged approach to dealing with the \nproblems of fractionated ownership of allotted lands.\n  First, the bill provides desperately needed reform for the probate of \ninterests in allotted lands, including limitations on who may inherit \nthese interests.\n  Second, this bill would prohibit the inheritance of any interests \nthat represent 2 percent or less of the ownership of an allotment \nunless it is specifically provided for in a valid will. This provision \nwill be controversial, but the Administration insists that it is \nnecessary to address: ``one of the root causes of our trust asset \nmanagement difficulties.'' This provision will only apply in those \nsituations where Indian owners are notified in advance that their \ninterests could be lost unless they execute a will to address the 2 \npercent interest issues.\n  Finally, the bill establishes time-frames for BIA review of tribal \nprobate codes, and authorizes the Secretary to acquire fractional \ninterests on behalf of a tribe. The Secretary will apply the lease \nproceeds from these interests until the purchase price is recouped. \nIndian tribes with approved land consolidation plans may enter into \nagreements with the Secretary to use these funds for their acquisition \nprogram. In either case, the focus of this program will be \nconsolidating small fractional interests that are choking the system.\n  The bill takes some steps to encourage and assist part-owners of \nallotments who are trying to consolidate the ownership of their \nallotments, and makes it federal policy to assist with transactions, \nsuch as land exchanges between those owning comparable fractional \ninterests.\n  There is a demonstrable need for more resources to address the \nproblems associated with land fractionation, including the need to \neducate allotment owners about probate planning options and \nopportunities. Creative solutions to this issue should be pursued. For \nexample, some have proposed the use of federal income tax credits for \nthose individuals who convey their fractional interest to a tribe.\n  This bill does not please all parties to the debate, but it is a good \nfaith effort to achieve most of our shared goals. If these parties will \nwork in good faith, I will do my part as Chairman of the Indian Affairs \nCommittee to convene hearings and work with them through the \nlegislative process.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1586\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S10935]]\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Indian Land Consolidation \n     Act Amendments of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) in the 1800's and early 1900's, the United States \n     sought to assimilate Indian people into the surrounding non-\n     Indian culture by allotting tribal lands to individual \n     members of Indian tribes;\n       (2) many trust allotments were taken out of trust status \n     and sold by their Indian owners;\n       (3) the trust periods for trust allotments have been \n     extended indefinitely;\n       (4) because of the inheritance provisions in the original \n     treaties or allotment Acts, the ownership of many of the \n     trust allotments that have remained in trust status has \n     become fractionated into hundreds or thousands of interests, \n     many of which represent 2 percent or less of the total \n     interests;\n       (5) Congress has authorized the acquisition of lands in \n     trust for individual Indians, and many of those lands have \n     also become fractionated by subsequent inheritance;\n       (6) the acquisitions referred to in paragraph (5) continue \n     to be made;\n       (7) the fractional interests described in this section \n     provide little or no return to the beneficial owners of those \n     interests and the administrative costs borne by the United \n     States for those interests are inordinate;\n       (8) substantial numbers of fractional interests of 2 \n     percent or less of a total interest in trust or restricted \n     lands have escheated to Indian tribes under section 207 of \n     the Indian Land Consolidation Act (25 U.S.C. 2206), which was \n     enacted in 1983;\n       (9) in Babbit v. Youpee (117 S Ct. 727 (1997)), the United \n     States Supreme Court found that the application of section \n     207 of the Indian Land Consolidation Act to the facts \n     presented in that case to be unconstitutional;\n       (11) in the absence of remedial legislation, the number of \n     the fractional interests will continue to grow; and\n       (12) the problem of the fractionation of Indian lands \n     described in this section is the result of a policy of the \n     Federal Government, cannot be solved by Indian tribes, and \n     requires a solution under Federal law.\n\n     SEC. 3. DECLARATION OF POLICY.\n\n       It is the policy of the United States--\n       (1) to prevent the further fractionation of trust \n     allotments made to Indians;\n       (2) to consolidate fractional interests and ownership of \n     those interests into usable parcels;\n       (3) to consolidate fractional interests in a manner that \n     enhances tribal sovereignty; and\n       (4) to promote tribal self-sufficiency and self-\n     determination.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to amend the American Indian Trust Fund Management \nReform Act of 1994 to establish within the Department of the Interior \nan Office of Special Trustee for Data Cleanup and Internal Control; to \nthe Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n   Creation of Special Trustee for Data Cleanup and Internal Control\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, as many of my colleagues are aware, the \nAmerican Indian Trust Management Reform Act of 1994 established the \nOffice of Special Trustee within the Department of Interior. Many \nbelieve that the reform efforts initiated by the Act were dealt a \nserious set-back when the person confirmed by the Senate for this \nposition resigned in response to the Secretary's effort to re-organize \nthe Office of the Special Trustee without notifying the Special \nTrustee, the Congress, the Advisory Commission established by the 1994 \nAct, affected Indian tribes, or Indian account holders.\n  A number of concerns have been raised by the absence of a Special \nTrustee appointed and confirmed in a manner consistent with the Act. \nPerhaps the most important concern raised in hearings on the trust fund \ncrisis is the absence of a responsible official with either the \nindependence or the appearance of independence of an appointed Special \nTrustee. The Act was designed to allow the Special Trustee to act and \nadvise Congress in an independent manner. For example, the Act required \nthe Special Trustee to certify in writing of the adequacy of the budget \nrequests for those entities responsible for discharging the Secretary's \ntrust responsibility.\n  In light of the federal government's dismal history of its management \nof trust funds, it is not surprising that Indian tribes and Indian \naccount holders are concerned that the same institutions that produced \nthis crisis are in complete control of the efforts to reform it. In \naddition, trust management experts have testified before joint hearings \nof the Indian Affairs and the Energy and Natural Resources Committees \nthat it is simply naive to assume that comprehensive rethinking and \nreform will be carried out by the very institutions that are in \ndesperate need of reform.\n  In an effort to regain the independence needed to assure individual \nand tribal account holders, the legislation I introduce today will \nestablish the position of Special Trustee for Data Cleanup and Internal \nControl. Under this legislation, the person holding this position will \nbe appointed by the Inspector General of the Department of Interior to \nensure that the incumbent is not beholden to the entities responsible \nfor developing or implementing the Administration's High Level \nImplementation Plan. This bill would allow the Secretary to remove the \nincumbent only for good cause.\n  Under this bill, the Special Trustee for Data Cleanup and Internal \nControl is directed to contract out for the matters under his or her \ncontrol and to retain temporary employees to the greatest extent \nfeasible. This will ensure those cleaning up the system and designing \ninternal controls will not be subject to the criticism that they might \nbe tempted to gloss over past mistakes or develop internal controls \nthat can easily be fulfilled.\n  Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1587\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the awarding of grants to Indian tribes \nand tribal organizations, and to facilitate the recruitment of \ntemporary employees to improve Native American participation in and \nassist in the conduct of the 2000 decennial census of population, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n      native american census participation enhancement act of 1999\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nNative American Census Participation Enhancement Act of 1999.\n  Like all past censuses, the 2000 Decennial Census will play a vital \nrole in American society. By counting the population of the United \nStates, the decennial census serves as the statistical basis for \ndistributing federal funds, redistricting for political representation, \nand planning for future infrastructure development.\n  Participating in this ritual every ten years is important for all \nAmericans. But for Native Americans, this Federal tally is perhaps even \nmore important.\n  As we all know, Native Americans have been under-represented in past \ncensus counts. The most recent census, conducted in 1990, was extremely \ninaccurate in its count of American Indians and Alaskan Natives who \nwere living in rural reservation areas.\n  The effects of undercounting American Indians and Alaskan Natives \nhave real consequences for Native communities.\n  An undercount of Native Americans skews population statistics which \nare used to allocate and distribute federal funds and services to \ntribes. For example, funds made available under the Federal Welfare-to-\nWork Grant program and Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) are \nboth determined by reference to census statistics.\n  These key programs offer millions of dollars in Federal assistance to \nhelp low-income Americans make the transition from welfare to work and \nto build healthier and more productive communities.\n  This direct correlation between an accurate census and whether or not \nNative communities will be treated fairly and more than that, whether \nthey will be given the tools they need to strengthen their economies, \nis the reason for the bill I am introducing today.\n  There has been a lot of debate about the 2000 Census and whether the \ncount can be more accurately done through statistical sampling or other \nmethods.\n  In my opinion, article I of our Constitution is clear in requiring \nthat ``an actual enumeration'' be taken of the population every ten \nyears.\n  As chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs I have an obligation \nto see to it that Native Americans are treated fairly. At the same time \nI believe that Natives themselves bear a measure of responsibility for \ntheir destinies.\n  Just as the Census Bureau and the United States have a legal \nobligation to conduct an actual count, American Indians and Alaska \nNatives have a responsibility to answer the census and ensure that they \nare represented in the final tally.\n  This Congress and our nation can rightly demand that the United \nStates fulfill its obligations to the Constitution and to Native \nAmericans and achieve both a fair and complete count of American \nIndians and Alaskan Natives in Census 2000.\n  The bill I am introducing today will help ensure that Native \nAmericans achieve a higher level of participation in the Census and \nensure a more accurate count by authorizing the Secretary of Commerce \nto provide grants to Indian tribes and organizations to stimulate \nNative awareness of and participation in the 2000 Census.\n  It also provides incentives to help the Secretary and Indian tribes \nto recruit temporary employees and volunteer ``Census Assistants'' to \nwork in and with Native communities and encourage Natives to answer the \ncensus.\n  I am hopeful that as the Census Bureau continues to lay the \ngroundwork for the 2000 Census, it take into account the unique needs \nof the Native communities and the importance of getting an accurate \ncount of all Native Americans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the legislation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1588\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the Native American Census \n     Participation Enhancement Act of 1999.\n\n     SEC. 2.

For purposes of this definition, such section \n     3(d) of the Indian Financing Act of 1974 shall be applied by \n     treating the term ``former Indian reservations in Oklahoma'' \n     as including only those lands which are within the \n     jurisdictional area of an Oklahoma Indian Tribe (as \n     determined by the Secretary of the Interior) and are \n     recognized by such Secretary as eligible for trust land \n     status under 25 CFR Part 151 (as in effect on the date of \n     enactment of this sentence).\n       (5) ``Secretary.''--The term ``Secretary'' means the \n     Secretary of Commerce.\n       (6) ``Tribal organization.''--The term ``Tribal \n     organization'' has the meaning given that term by section 4 \n     of the Indian Self Determination and Education Assistance Act \n     (25 USC 450b).\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the American Indian Trust Fund Management \nReform Act of 1994; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n                  indian trust fund management reforms\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President today I am pleased to introduce the \nAmerican Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act Amendments of 1999.\n  As many of my colleagues are aware, by the early 1990's, it was \nobvious that the Federal Government could not account for many of the \nfunds it manages as the trustee to Indian tribes and their members. \nMost of these responsibilities were lodged in the Department of the \nInterior and its Bureau of Indian Affairs.\n  Studies by the General Accounting Office revealed that the Department \nand BIA lacked individuals with the knowledge, experience, or expertise \nneeded to oversee and coordinate reform efforts. Congress reacted by \nenacting the American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act (AITFRA) \nof 1994.\n  Responding to criticisms that the Department's reform efforts were \nuncoordinated and piecemeal, Congress called for the appointment of a \n``Special Trustee'' to provide overall management of the reform \nactivities. The 1994 Act called for the President to nominate and for \nthe Senate to confirm a Special Trustee with demonstrated experience in \nthe management of trust funds, including the investment and management \nof large sums of money.\n  The 1994 Act did not give the Special Trustee all of the tools he or \nshe needed to ensure that the Federal Government would live up to the \nsame trust\n\n[[Page S10940]]\n\nstandards imposed on any other trustee. For example, although Congress \nsought to make the Special Trustee ``independent,'' he had little \nrecourse when Secretary Bruce Babbitt unilaterally reorganized the \nOffice of the Special Trustee for American Indians through a \nSecretarial Order. In fact the Special Trustee resigned following the \nissuance of the Order in January 1999.\n  In 1997, the Special Trustee unveiled the Strategic Plan required by \nthe 1994 Act. The Secretary declined an invitation by the Indian \nAffairs Committee to appear and explain his opposition to the Plan, \nespecially those elements of the Plan that would allow some trust \nmanagement functions to be performed by entities outside the Department \nof Interior.\n  Indian Country neither firmly embraced, nor rejected the proposed \nStrategic Plan. Indian Country has expressed strong concerns, and often \nopposition to the Department's own proposal, the High Level \nImplementation Plan.\n  In our joint Indian Affairs--Energy and Natural Resources Committee \nhearings, one theme has been repeated over and over: we cannot expect \nthe institution that created the problem to design and implement \ncomprehensive reforms for that system. It is also necessary to ensure \nthat any reform proposal is the result of a broad-based consultation \nwith all of the affected entities, especially Indian tribes, \nintertribal entities, and Indian account holders. It is likely that any \nreforms proposed by such a process will require legislative \nimplementation.\n  The legislation I introduce today satisfies each of these factors. \nFirst, it does not rely on those responsible for the current situation \nto determine the scope of reform. Second, it establishes a process that \nwill give those with the greatest stake in this process a commensurate \nopportunity to develop and propose reforms. It also provides an \nopportunity for all those concerned to participate in this process. \nFinally, this legislation makes it clear that at the conclusion of this \nprocess, Congress should consider whether legislation is necessary.\n\n  This bill directs the Senate Majority and Minority Leaders, the \nSpeaker of the House and Minority Leader, and the Secretary of Interior \nto consult and make appointments that equitably represent those who \nwill be the most affected by the management of trust funds. The \nlegislation also requires the Commission to consider whether private \nenterprise, a tribal or inter-tribal enterprise, or perhaps a \ngovernment sponsored corporate entity should be part of the \ngovernment's fulfillment of its trust obligation. This same commission \nwill determine which federal regulatory agency is best suited to \nregulate the Federal Government's activities as trustee.\n  Every financial institution managing and investing the money of the \ncitizens of the United States is regulated by some entity, for example \nby the Comptroller of the Currency, or the Federal Reserve Board, or \nthe Office of Thrift Supervision. The only exception that I am aware of \nis the federal government when it acts as a trustee to Indians and \nIndian tribes. And by now we can all see the mess that has resulted \nfrom this lack of regulatory oversight.\n  This bill does not mandate the form of organization or entity best \nsuited to oversee the Federal Government's activities as trustee. \nInstead, it creates an open and fair process for these issues to be \ndecided by those who know the most about how financial institutions and \ntheir trust Departments are regulated.\n  This bill builds upon a proposal made by the Intertribal Monitoring \nAssociation and represents a starting point for determining how to \nstrengthen the 1994 Act.\n  This bill is a necessary counterpart to another bill I am introducing \nto amend the Indian Land Consolidation Act of 1983 to address the \nfractionated ownership of Indian lands, one of the primary causes of \nthe trust funds crisis. With both measures, it is essential that all \nparties involved--the tribes, individual Indians, the Interior \nDepartment, and Congress--set out to finally lay the groundwork for \nreal trust fund reform. Native Americans deserve no less.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1589\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to modify the \nauthority of the Surface Transportation Board, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n              surface transportation board improvement act\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, today I am introducing a very important \npiece of legislation, the Surface Transportation Board Improvement Act, \nwhich is aimed at correcting an injustice for railroad workers, \nshippers and anyone who have a contractual relationship with a \nrailroad. Basically, my bill would end the onerous procedure of the \nSurface Transportation Board to override, modify, or cancel collective \nbargaining agreements between railroads and their employees. Collective \nbargaining agreements go to the very essence of the labor relations \nprocess. They are the result of hard-fought deliberations between labor \nand management, and of a give-and-take process which often results in \nno winners or losers. While the process is not perfect, collective \nbargaining agreements do not come lightly and they should be honored--\nnot subject to change by a federal agency.\n\n[[Page S10942]]\n\n  In 1920, Congress determined that railroad mergers and consolidations \nshould be subject to exclusive federal jurisdiction through the \nInterstate Commerce Commission (ICC). To effect that intent, Congress \ngave an exemption from antitrust laws, other federal laws, State and \nmunicipal laws to railroads participating in a transaction approved by \nthe ICC. However, what was good policy in 1920 no longer works today \nbecause the language used to effect that policy is too broad giving \nrise to unfair application.\n  Unfortunately, the exemption provisions of the Interstate Commerce \nAct have been extended beyond the limited area of removing inconsistent \nState and municipal regulations governing railroad mergers and \nconsolidations. Instead, they now are used to override contracts \nbetween railroads and their employees and railroads and other parties, \nsuch as shippers. Since 1983, the ICC and its successor the Surface \nTransportation Board (STB) have used the exemption to override, modify, \nor cancel collective bargaining agreements between railroads and their \nemployees. The Board has not confined these overrides, while \nunacceptable under any circumstances, to the period surrounding the ICC \nor STB approval of a transaction. If fact, the exemption has been used \nto modify and cancel collective bargaining agreements more than thirty \nyears after the initial approval of the railroad consolidation. \nRecently, the STB has used the same exemption provisions to override \ncontracts between shippers and railroads. This wide ranging power in a \nfederal agency is unprecedented and needs to be remedied.\n  What we need is a balance. Contracts freely entered should be \nconsidered inviolate and subject to governmental intrusion in only the \nmost important and rare circumstances. A railroad merger does not reach \nthat level of importance. No one can show a legitimate present need to \ntreat railroads any differently from other modes of transportation when \nit comes to their honoring contractual commitments. My bill restores a \nbalance that existed between 1920 and 1983 by making it clear that the \nfederal interest in regulating rail mergers and consolidations does not \nextend to upsetting settled contractual relationships between the \nregulated party, the railroads, and others.\n  The specific remedies provided by this bill are straightforward. \nFirst, the exemption is limited to inconsistent State and municipal \nregulations of rail mergers and consolidations. That was a primary goal \nof Congress in 1920 and is preserved here. The antitrust exemption is \nlifted because in this era of mega-rail carriers, there is no reason \nfuture railroad mergers and consolidations should not be treated the \nsame as mergers and consolidations in other modes of transportation. \nCongress gave the antitrust exemption to the railroad industry in 1920 \nfollowing a period of governmental control triggered, in part, because \nof the rail industry's general economic instability. In 1920, the \nfederal governmental interest supported rail mergers because they \nseemed the key to a stable mode of transportation in an essential \nsector of the economy. Given the general economic health of the Class I \nrail carriers coupled with the recent round of mergers/acquisitions in \nboth West and East, no one can honestly claim further railroad \nconsolidation is necessarily in the public interest.\n  Second, my bill ends the STB's foray into labor relations. From the \ndate of enactment, all future transactions involving the merger of work \nforces proposed by rail carriers under employee protective conditions \npreviously imposed by the ICC or STB will be resolved under the dispute \nresolution procedures provided in the Railway Labor Act (RLA). The RLA \nhas governed railroad labor relations since 1926 (and airlines since \n1935). Congress has not amended the Act significantly since 1966 when \nCongress provided the means to expedite resolution of ``minor \ndisputes'' in the industry. The manner of negotiating a change in \ncollective bargaining agreements has been in place since 1926. While \nsome may disagree with parts of the RLA dispute resolution process, it \nworks and has worked for seventy-three years. My bill places resolution \nof force integration disputes in merger cases back into the same \ncollective bargaining processes that govern all other changes in \nrailroad labor relations.\n  Federal labor policy with respect to collective bargaining, as \nestablished under the RLA, is that private agreements are reached and \namended by the parties without governmental compulsion. That policy \nprovides a process whereby labor and management can voluntarily resolve \ndifferences and enter into contracts, and rejects the notion that the \ngovernment should micro-manage the substantive terms of collective \nbargaining agreements.\n  In defiance of this policy, the STB, which has no experience or \nauthority in collective bargaining, has routinely broken or modified \nprivately negotiated employee contracts in the approval of mergers or \nother transactions. My bill bars the STB from making wholesale changes \nto or abrogating privately negotiated collective bargaining agreements. \nIt is fair public policy that contracts should be saved and changed \nonly when the parties sit down and agree to new terms in a fair \ncollective bargaining setting.\n  Mr. President, I urge all Senators to join me in support of this \nimportant legislation. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ntext of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1590\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The \npurpose was to discuss a variety of issues affecting our relationship \nwith Puerto Rico. The Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, which \nI chair, has the responsibility for the territories and the freely \nassociated States of the United States, of which Puerto Rico is one. \nThat responsibility derives from the plenary authority of the Federal \nGovernment over the territories, which is placed in the Congress under \narticle IV of the Constitution.\n  I take that responsibility very seriously. My State was a territory \nuntil 1959. I truly remember the days when my State was totally \ndependent on the goodwill of the Congress. Sometimes that goodwill was \nsomewhat lacking. We were American citizens. We did not enjoy the right \nto vote. We had no representation in Congress. We were subject to \nFederal income tax. Some Alaskans thought they would feel good about \nfiling under protest and would write that across their income tax \nreturn, but that is about the extent of the satisfaction they got. In \nany event, I do have a certain sensitivity for the American people of \nPuerto Rico.\n  I think it is fair to remind my colleagues that Congress is vested \nwith the power to admit States and the power to dispose of the \nterritory status of those areas within the United States. This is one \nof the fundamental authorities that affect the nature of our society \nand the nature of our Government. Thirty-seven times we have acted to \nadmit new States to the Union. Once we acted to grant independence. In \nthe interim, we have governed areas that expanded this Nation from \nThirteen Original Colonies to a country that stretches from the Virgin \nIslands to Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and from Maine to Alaska \nto American Samoa in the South Pacific. We have tried, perhaps not \nalways successfully, to be responsive to the needs and aspirations of \nthe residents of the territories.\n  Coming from a former territory, I understand the unhappiness of \nliving in territorial status subject to decisions made in Washington. \nAs a consequence, I try to be fair and sensitive and sympathetic to the \naspirations and concerns of the people of Puerto Rico, the American \npeople of Puerto Rico, and whether a continuing quest for self-\ndetermination, which I happen to believe is appropriate and an \nobligation of this Congress, is something that is still unresolved with \nregard to the Americans and the people of Puerto Rico.\n  Perhaps a little history might be helpful on this. Referring to my \nown State, we were purchased for $7.2 million in 1867 from Russia with \ncitizenship except for the ``uncivilized native tribes.'' Full \ncitizenship to all residents was not enacted until 1915. Alaska was \nthen subject to military government for 17 years. When we requested an \nextension of the homestead laws in order to settle a territory, our \nrequests were then ignored by Washington. The Organic Act of 1884 \nprovided for civil government and an appointed Governor but did not \nprovide for either a legislative assembly or a delegate to Congress. \nHowever, in 1906, 39 years after acquisition, we were finally granted a \nnonvoting delegate to Congress in the House of Representatives. In \n1912, an Organic Act provided for a local legislature with limited \nauthority subject to veto by an appointed Governor to the State of \nAlaska, appointed by the President with the oversight of Congress.\n  In some respects Puerto Rico obtained greater local self-government \nfaster than we did in Alaska. In 1950, Puerto Rico had an elective \nGovernor and Constitution while Alaska was still subject to appointed \nofficials. While we now have an elected Governor and Statehood, we are \nstill subject to appointed officials, some of whom appear to think that \nStatehood and federalism are arcane and outdated concepts--impediments \nto the achievement of their particular concept of public good.\n  Mr. President, if that level of insensitivity to the needs and \naspirations of local residents and the wishes of elected officials \noccurs in a State, you can imagine how the residents of a territory \nfeel. That brings me to the subject of this legislation I introduced \ntoday.\n  Vieques is a 33,000 acre island off the east coast of Puerto Rico, \napproximately 22 miles long by 6 miles wide. The federal government \nacquired \\2/3\\ of the island in 1941. The population of 9,400 resides \nin the west central area of the island, sandwiched between two military \nareas. The western portion of the island is used as a Navy Supply Depot \nwith 102 magazines. The eastern portion contains a maneuvering area for \namphibious/land training and a Live Impact Area that is part of the \nAtlantic Fleet Weapons Training Facility.\n  Vieques is the only target range in the U.S. where aircrews drop live \nordnance from tactical altitudes, above 18,000 feet. The facility also \nsupports shore bombardment training with live ordnance. Although the \ncivilian population resides about 8 miles from the Live Impact Area, \nrelations have been tense for some time, as you might expect if your \ncommunity was the recipient of regularly scheduled live exercises with \nlive ammunition. You would keep one eye open at night.\n  It finally happened on April 19, 1999. An F/A-18 from the JFK \nBattlegroup participating in live fire training as part of deployment \npreparations dropped two 500 pound bombs near an observation post \nwithin the Live Fire Impact area. A civilian contract security guard \nwas unfortunately killed and four other personnel received minor \ninjuries. While this is the only fatality to have occurred over the \npast sixty years, there have been several minor incidents within the \nLive Fire Impact area. The guard, David Sanes Rodriguez, was 35 and one \nof 17 siblings who grew up in the La Mina sector of Vieques.\n  Mr. President, you have heard me complain any number of times about \nthe abuse that my constituents must endure from disinterred federal \nbureaucracy. We are denied the ability to develop our resources. We \ncannot obtain rights-of-way to connect our towns and villages. We \ncannot connect by road, by rail, or by wire. I will not go through how \nmany of my constituents have died because we cannot obtain a simple \nright-of-way through a few miles of a wildlife refuge so they can \nobtain emergency medical treatment. This is the case in my State. At \nleast the federal government is not dropping live ordnance on my \nconstituents.\n  I fully understand the reasons why the Governor and virtually \neveryone in Puerto Rico has called for an end to the use of Vieques as \na target range. I\n\n[[Page S10944]]\n\nalso understand that this would not happen if Puerto Rico were not a \nterritory. I fully support the need for our armed services to train, \ndeploy, and test weapons. But there are certain things you simply don't \ndo in an inhabited area. I deeply regret that it took an accident to \nhighlight this situation, but that is the case.\n  For that reason, legislation I have introduced will amend the Puerto \nRico Federal Relations Act to transfer control over Vieques to the \ngovernment of Puerto Rico for public purposes. The term ``public \npurpose'' is very broad and will include the same public benefit uses \nthat we authorized for lands transferred to Guam several years ago.\n  Finally, the day may come when Congress no longer exercises plenary \nauthority over Puerto Rico but the Puerto Rican people will have \ndetermined their self-determination. Until that time, all of us have a \nresponsibility to respond to the needs of our fellow citizens who \nreside there and in the other territories, as well as our own \nconstituents. I hope my colleagues would join me in this amendment.\n  I see no other Senators seeking recognition, so I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 1592. A bill to amend the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central \nAmerican Relief Act to provide to certain nationals of El Salvador, \nGuatemala, Honduras, and Haiti an opportunity to apply for adjustment \nof status under that Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/15/senate-section/article/S10944-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10944-S10947]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            CENTRAL AMERICAN AND HAITIAN PARITY ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Central \nAmerican and Haitian Parity Act of 1999 with my colleague Senator \nKennedy. This legislation will provide deserved and needed relief to \nthousands of immigrants from Central America and the Caribbean who came \nto the United States fleeing political persecution.\n  In the 1980's, thousands of Salvadorans and Guatemalans fled civil \nwars in their countries and sought asylum in the United States. The \nvast majority had been persecuted or feared persecution in their home \ncountries. The people of Honduras had a similar experience. While civil \nwar was not formally waged within Honduras, the geography of the region \nmade it impossible for Honduras to be unaffected by the violence and \nturmoil that surrounded it. The country of Haiti has also experienced \nextreme upheaval. Haitians for many years were forced to seek the \nprotection of the United States because of oppression, human rights \nabuses and civil unrest.\n  Salvadorans, Guatemalans, Haitians and Hondurans have now established \nroots in the United States. Some have married here and many have \nchildren that were born in the United States. Yet many still live in \nfear. They cannot easily leave the United States and return to the \ngreat uncertainty in their countries of origin. If they are forced to \nreturn, they will face enormous hardship. Their former homes are either \noccupied by strangers or not there at all. The people they once knew \nare gone and so are the jobs they need to support their families. They \nalso cannot become permanent residents of the United States, which \nseverely limits their opportunities for work and education. This \nsituation is unacceptable and requires a more permanent solution.\n  Before outlining how this bill will provide a permanent solution, it \nis important to review the evolution of deportation remedies. Prior to \nthe passage of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Responsibility Act in \n1996, aliens in the United States could apply for suspension of \ndeportation and adjustment of status in order to obtain lawful \npermanent residence. Suspension of deportation was used to ameliorate \nthe harsh consequences of deportation for aliens who had been present \nin the United States for long periods of time.\n  In September of 1996, Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform \nand Responsibility Act. This law retroactively made thousands of \nimmigrants ineligible for suspension of deportation and left them with \nno alternate remedy. The 1996 Act eliminated suspension of deportation \nand established a new form of relief entitled cancellation of removal \nthat required an applicant to accrue ten years of continuous residence \nas of the date of the initial notice charging the applicant with being \nremovable.\n  In 1997, this Congress recognized that these new provisions could \nresult in grave injustices to certain groups of people. So in November \nof 1997, the Nicaraguan and Central American Relief Act (NACARA) \ngranted relief to certain citizens of former Soviet block countries and \nseveral Central American countries. This select group of immigrants \nwere allowed to apply for permanent residence under the old, pre-IIRRA \nstandards.\n  Such an alteration of IIRRA made sense. After all, the U.S. had \nallowed Central Americans to reside and work here for over a decade, \nduring which time many of them established families, careers and \ncommunity ties. The complex history of civil wars and political \npersecution in parts of Central America left thousands of people in \nlimbo without a place to call home. Many victims of severe persecution \ncame to the United States with very strong asylum cases, but \nunfortunately these individuals have waited so long for a hearing they \nwill have difficulty proving their cases because they involve incidents \nwhich occurred as early as 1980. In addition, many victims of \npersecution never filed for asylum out of fear of denial, and \nconsequently these people now face claims weakened by years of delay.\n  Mr. President, the bill I introduce today is a necessary and fair \nexpansion of NACARA. It provides a permanent solution for thousands of \npeople who desperately need one. Specifically, the bill amends the \nNicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act and provides \nnationals of El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Haiti an opportunity \nto apply for adjustment of status under the same standards as \nNicaraguans and Cubans. While the restoration of democracy in Central \nAmerica and the Caribbean has been encouraging, the situation remains \ndelicate. Providing immigrants from these politically volatile areas an \nopportunity to apply for permanent resident status in the United States \ninstead of deporting them to politically and economically fragile \ncountries will provide more stability in the long run. Such an approach \nis the best solution not only for the United States but also for new \nand fragile democracies in Central America and the Caribbean. \nImmigrants have greatly contributed to the United States, both \neconomically and culturally and the people of Central America and the \nCaribbean are no exception. If we continue to deny them a chance to \nlive in the United States by deporting them, we not only hurt them, we \nhurt us too.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1592\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator Durbin \nin introducing the ``Central American and Haitian Parity Act of 1999. I \ncommend our colleagues in the House, Representatives Chris Smith, Luis \nGutierrez, and others, who introduced a companion bill last month. This \nlegislation has the strong support of the Clinton administration, \nbecause it is a key component of America's effort to support democracy \nand stability in Central America and Haiti.\n  Two years ago, Congress enacted the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central \nAmerican Relief Act, which protects Nicaraguan and Cuban refugees by \nenabling them to remain permanently in the United States as immigrants. \nBut many Central Americans and Haitians were unfairly excluded from \nthat bill. At that time, many of us in Congress opposed the unfairness \nand discrimination involved in treating Nicaraguans and Cubans more \nfavorably than similarly situated Central Americans and Haitians. We \nbelieve all of these refugees should be treated equally.\n  It is time for Congress to end this disparity. With this legislation, \nwe are remedying this flagrant omission and adding Salvadorans, \nGuatemalans, Hondurans, and Haitians to the list of deserving refugees.\n  These Central American and Haitian refugees, like Nicaraguans and \nCubans, fled decades of violence, human rights abuses, and economic \ninstability resulting from political repression. They suffered \npersecution at the hands of successive repressive governments. Central \nAmericans and Haitians supporting democracy have faced torture, extra-\njudicial killings, imprisonment, and other forms of persecution. These \nand other gross violations of human rights have been documented by the \nState Department, and by human rights organizations such as Americas \nWatch and Amnesty International.\n  Like other political refugees, Central Americans and Haitians have \ncome to this country with a strong love of freedom and a strong \ncommitment to democracy. They have settled in many parts of the United \nStates. They have established deep roots in our communities, and their \nchildren, that have been born here, are U.S. citizens. Wherever they \nhave settled, they have made lasting contributions to the economic \nvitality and diversity of our communities and our nation.\n  Citizens in these countries are now working hard to establish \ndemocracy in their nations. President Clinton and Secretary Albright \nhave repeatedly stated that it is America's long-standing foreign \npolicy to ensure the continuing stability and viability of emerging, \nyet still fragile, democracies in Central America and Haiti. The \nCentral American and Haitian communities in the United States have \ncontributed substantially to this goal, sending hundreds of millions of \ndollars to their native lands. These funds have played a critical role \nin stabilizing these countries' economies as they make the \ntransition to democracy, at no cost to the U.S. taxpayer.\n\n  The State Department has documented the potential adverse \nconsequences of reducing the flow of these funds. From a U.S. foreign \npolicy and humanitarian standpoint, these amounts have taken on added \nimportance. These funds have become a primary source of income for \nfamilies who lost their jobs as a result of the hurricanes that ravaged \nthese countries last year. Repatriating thousands of Central Americans \nand Haitians will impose a substantial additional burden on these \ncountries. It will also diminish the ability of Central Americans and \nHaitians in the U.S. to contribute financially to rebuilding their \ncountries. Allowing Central Americans and Haitians to remain here as \nlegal residents will enable them to continue to provide assistance that \nwill contribute substantially to vital economic recovery and \nreconstruction.\n  This legislation will provide qualified Salvadorans, Guatemalans, \nHondurans and Haitians with the opportunity to become permanent \nresidents of the U.S. To qualify for this relief, they must have lived \nin this country since December 1995. By approving the Central American \nand Haitian Parity Act, we can finally bring an end to the shameful \ndecades of disparate treatment that has existed.\n\n[[Page S10947]]\n\n  This is an issue of basic fairness. The United States has a long and \nnoble tradition of providing safe haven to refugees. Over the years, we \nhave enacted legislation to guarantee safe haven for Hungarians, \nCubans, Yugoslavs, Vietnamese, Laotians, Cambodians, Poles, Chinese, \nand many others.\n  This Congress has the opportunity to right the shameful wrongs that \nCentral American and Haitian refugees have suffered. This bill offers \nthe full protection of our laws to these victims of persecution in \ntheir fight for democracy. Congress has a duty to offer the same \nprotection to Central Americans and Haitians that we have offered over \nthe years to other refugees fleeing from repressive regimes. This bill \ndoes what is fair, what is right, and what is just.\n  We should do all we can to end the current flagrant discrimination \nunder our immigration laws. Central American and Haitian refugees \ndeserve protection too--the same protection we gave to Nicaraguans and \nCubans. We need to pay more than lip service to the fundamental \nprinciple of equal protection of the laws.\n  Since its introduction in the House of Representatives, the Central \nAmerican and Haitian Parity Act has received important bipartisan \nsupport. I am optimistic that it will receive similar support in the \nSenate. It deserves to be enacted as soon as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url":

SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING CAFE STANDARDS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) law, codified \n     at chapter 329 of title 49, United States Code, is critical \n     to reducing the dependence of the United States on foreign \n     oil, reducing air pollution and carbon dioxide, and saving \n     consumers money at the gas pump;\n       (2) the cars and light trucks of the United States are \n     responsible for 20 percent of the carbon dioxide pollution \n     generated in the United States;\n       (3) the average fuel economy of all new passenger vehicles \n     is at its lowest point since 1980, while fuel consumption is \n     at its highest;\n       (4) since 1995, a provision in the transportation \n     appropriations Acts has prohibited the Department of \n     Transportation from examining the need to raise CAFE \n     standards for sport utility vehicles and other light trucks;\n       (5) that provision denies purchasers of new sport utility \n     vehicles and other light trucks the benefits of available \n     fuel saving technologies;\n       (6) the current CAFE standards save more than 3,000,000 \n     barrels of oil per day;\n       (7)(A) the current CAFE standards have remained the same \n     for nearly a decade;\n       (B) the CAFE standard for sport utility vehicles and other \n     light trucks is \\3/4\\ the standard for automobiles; and\n       (C) the CAFE standard for sport utility vehicles and other \n     light trucks is 20.7 miles per gallon and the standard for \n     automobiles is 27.5 miles per gallon;\n       (8) because of CAFE standards, the average sport utility \n     vehicle emits about 75 tons of carbon dioxide over the life \n     of the vehicle while the average car emits about 45 tons of \n     carbon dioxide;\n       (9) the technology exists to cost effectively and safely \n     make vehicles go further on a gallon of gasoline; and\n       (10) improving light truck fuel economy would not only cut \n     pollution but also save oil and save owners of new sport \n     utility vehicles and other light trucks money at the gas \n     pump.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the issue of CAFE standards should be permitted to be \n     examined by the Department of Transportation, so that \n     consumers may benefit from any resulting increase in the \n     standards as soon as possible; and\n       (2) the Senate should not recede to section 320 of this \n     bill, as passed by the House of Representatives, which \n     prevents an increase in CAFE standards.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/15/senate-section/article/S10951-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10951]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n               committee on energy and natural resources\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, New Hampshire is a place where \ncommunity spirit and volunteerism is still a big part of our culture \nand it is partly for that reason that our state is consistently ranked \nas one of the most livable places in the United States. One of the \nreasons why our state remains one of the best places to live is that we \ntry to limit the amount of government intrusion into our lives. \nUnfortunately that message has not gotten through to some people who \nwork in the Forest Service in New Hampshire.\n  The White Mountain National Forest, which is overseen by the U.S. \nForest Service, provides outdoor recreation and economic opportunities \nfor thousands of people who live and work nearby. Preserving this \nnational forest takes a lot of dedication and hard work and many people \ncontribute to keeping the forest in good shape by volunteering their \ntime to clear trails of debris and pick up trash.\n  In fact, over the summer, two retirees, Frank Barilone, 67, and Ted \nMatte, 66, both of Ellsworth, were cleaning up Ellsworth Park Beach, \nwhich had become littered with an old bob house, rotted rowboats, and \nassorted cans and bottles and other trash. They had been coming to the \narea for over 30 years and had both recently decided to retire to the \narea. They took the initiative to discuss the trash problem with the \nlocal Forest Service office in Holderness which told them to go ahead \nand clean it up which they did. As a reward for their hard work, the \nForest Service fined them $150 for ``maintaining the national forest \nwithout a permit,'' which happens to be a federal offense.\n  It seems to me that the Forest Service has it all backwards. Instead \nof thanking Mr. Barilone and Mr. Matte for their hard work, the Forest \nService gave them a slap in the face in the form of a ticket and a $150 \nfine. Most people expect the Forest Service to ticket people who \npollute the forest, not people who try to clean it up. The Forest \nService's decision to fine these two retirees $150 for cleaning up \nEllsworth Park will discourage, not encourage, the public to take a \ngreater role in the protection of our state's natural resources.\n  So on behalf of the people of New Hampshire, I thank Mr. Barilone and \nMr. Matte for volunteering their time to help clean up our national \nforest. Their can-do attitude is what makes New Hampshire such a great \nplace to live. Keep up the good work!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/15/senate-section/article/S10952-3", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               IN RECOGNITION OF FRANKLIN DELANO GARRISON\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ntrue champion for working people from my home State of Michigan, Frank \nGarrison, who is retiring this month from his position as president of \nthe Michigan AFL-CIO after more than 40 years in the labor movement.\n  In many ways, Frank's life story is the story of the labor movement \nitself over these past 65 years. Born Franklin Delano Garrison in 1934, \nduring the depths of the Great Depression, he was named for the \nPresident who gave hope to millions of working Americans and whose \nWorks Projects Administration provided Frank's father with a job. At \nthe age of 10, Frank entered the workforce himself, shoveling coal into \nhis school's boilers so his brothers and sisters could eat lunch at \nschool.\n  While these early years taught Frank the value of work, they also \ntaught him that to achieve their piece of the American dream, working \npeople needed strong advocates, both in the workplace and in \ngovernment. He joined the United Auto Workers in 1952 working at the \nSaginaw Steering Gear plant in Saginaw, Michigan. Once in the union, \nthe same work ethic that filled that school boiler with coal helped \nFrank rise through the ranks. He held several positions in his local \nand his region on his way to becoming the UAW's Legislative Director in \n1976 and the Executive Director of the Union's Community Action Program \nin 1982. During those years, he played a key role in many election \ncampaigns and even helped an upstart former President of the Detroit \nCity Council win a seat in the United States Senate.\n  In 1986, after the sudden death of Michigan AFL-CIO President Sam \nFishman, Frank was selected president by the AFL-CIO's General Board. \nThroughout the thirteen years he has served in that position he has \nupheld the finest traditions of the labor movement. In an era when \nspecial interests tried to dominate the political debate, Frank's was a \nvoice that spoke for the broad interest of working people, whether or \nnot they ever carried a union card--fighting for a higher minimum wage, \nfor health care for all, to strengthen Social Security and Medicaid and \nto preserve those industrial jobs that had brought economic security to \nworking families in Michigan and throughout the country. Few Americans \nhave fought longer or harder for working people than Frank Garrison. \nHis pursuit of justice in the workplace has improved opportunity and \nsecurity and safety for an untold number of Americans.\n  And through it all, the good times and the bad, the victories and the \ndefeats, Frank never lost touch with the convictions that brought him \nto the labor movement in the first place.

Mr. President, it is an honor to take this \nopportunity to recognize a community leader who has given so much to \nthe people of Southeastern Massachusetts. Rosemary Wahlberg has been a \nDirector of the Quincy Community Action Programs for twenty-six years. \nUnder her leadership, these programs have helped large numbers of \nfamilies on issues ranging from education to healthcare to child care \nto energy conservation. This year Rosemary is retiring, and her loss \nwill be felt deeply by all of those whose lives she has touched.\n  Rosemary's commitment to public service is extraordinary. Throughout \nher many years of service, she has helped people to make impressive \nprogress in improving their quality of life. As an advocate and \ncoordinator, she has assisted South Shore communities in the battle to \nreduce poverty and promote self-sufficiency for low-income families. \nShe has served as a member of the Quincy Housing Authority, on the \nQuincy College Board of Trustees, and on the Board of Directors for \nnumerous local, state, and regional committees devoted to community \nservice.\n  Rosemary's accomplishments have earned wide recognition. She has \nreceived distinguished awards from the City of Quincy, the University \nof Massachusetts, the South Shore Coalition for Human Rights, the \nAtlantic Neighborhood Assocation, South Shore Day Care Services, and \nmany other grateful organizations, who recognize the boundless energy, \nability and commitment she pours into every project.\n  For all of us who know Rosemary, we are inspired by her dedication to \nthose less fortunate in our society. She has served the people of \nQuincy and the South Shore with extraordinary distinction, and she is a \ndear friend to all of us in the Kennedy family. In addition to all of \nher other activities, she has been devoted to her wonderful family, \nraising eight children and caring for twenty-one grandchildren.\n  It is with the greatest respect and admiration that I pay tribute to \nthis remarkable leader. Her public service and generosity are a shining \nexample to us all. I know that I speak for all of the people of \nMassachusetts when I say that she will be missed greatly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/15/senate-section/article/S10953-3", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10953]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     MINORITY ARTS RESOURCE COUNCIL AND THE AFRICAN AMERICAN RODEO\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, last year, for the first time in \nPhiladelphia's history, the African American Rodeo came to that great \ncity. It was a memorable occasion with approximately 8,000 school \nchildren attending the rodeo at the Apollo Stadium. While these \nchildren were entertained by the rodeo and re-enactments of life in the \nold West, they learned of the many contributions made by African \nAmericans to our nation's history.\n  On October 8 and 9, of this year, the African American Rodeo is again \ncoming to the City of Brotherly Love to present re-enactments of \nhistorical figures of the old West. Such performances are important \nbecause our history books and Hollywood have failed to give proper \nrecognition of the great sacrifices and heroic deeds made by African \nAmericans.\n  Mr. President, more than 200,000 African American soldiers served in \nthe Civil War. After the war, many of these trained soldiers were sent \nwest, forming two infantry and two cavalry units. The term ``Buffalo \nSoldier'' was given to them by the Native Americans whom they \nencountered. Those soldiers, their families, and thousands who were \nfreed from slavery were among our early settlers, cowpunchers, and \nfarmers in a number of the western states.\n  It is with pleasure that I salute the Minority Arts Resource Council, \nits founder and Executive Director, Mr. Curtis E. Brown, its board \nmembers, and its volunteers for once again bringing this great event to \nthe city of Philadelphia. I urge my colleagues to join me in saluting \nthe invaluable services and contributions of African Americans and the \nrole that they have played and continue to play in American \nhistory.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/15/senate-section/article/S10953-4", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10953-S10954]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        ON THE RETIREMENT OF ALEXANDRIA CITY MANAGER VOLA LAWSON\n\n Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to honor an \noutstanding public servant. Recently, Vola Lawson, the city manager of \nthe City of Alexandria, announced her retirement. During her fourteen \nyears as city manager, Ms. Lawson provided the City with solid \nleadership and opened the doors of City Hall to all Alexandrians. I'm \nproud to add my name to the long list of those who are praising Vola \nLawson. Her distinguished career offers the ideal model for public \nofficials, and inspires confidence in our public institutions. I ask \nthat yesterday's article from The Washington Post on Vola Lawson's \nretirement be printed in the Congressional Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 14, 1999]\n\n   After 14 Years, 4 Mayors, Alexandria Leader To Retire--Fiery City \n                  Manager Lawson in Office Since 1985\n\n                           [By Ann O'Hanlon]\n\n       Vola Lawson, the tough veteran city manager of Alexandria, \n     announced yesterday that she will retire in March, marking a \n     major transition for the city she helped define during the 28 \n     years she worked for it.\n       ``I think this city is one of the greatest cities in \n     America,'' said Lawson, standing in the City Hall lobby that \n     was named for her this year. ``This is a very bittersweet day \n     for me.''\n       Lawson, who turns 65 today, has been city manager since \n     1985, a tenure more than twice the national average. During \n     that time, the city has lured or endured major new \n     development, including the planned U.S. Patent and Trademark \n     Office and a planned 300-acre residential and commercial \n     complex on an abandoned railroad yard. Under Lawson, \n     Alexandria also turned away a bid from then-Gov. L. Douglas \n     Wilder and then-Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke to build a \n     football stadium there.\n       In her 14 years, Lawson served under four mayors, all of \n     whom stood with her yesterday, singing her praises.\n       ``Vola has never met a stranger,'' said state Sen. Patricia \n     S. Ticer (D-Alexandria), one of the former mayors. ``She is a \n     shining example of what a public servant should be.''\n       Although her retirement was expected, a murmur still ran \n     through the city of 122,000 yesterday.\n       ``Boy, that's going to change the city more than anything I \n     can imagine,'' said Katherine Morrison, executive director of \n     the Campagna Center, a prominent local charity. ``I don't \n     know anyone who knows Alexandria better or has devoted more \n     of their life to Alexandria.''\n       Lawson worked her way up in Alexandria, blazing a path for \n     women and minorities that some say is her prime legacy. As \n     city manager, she has transformed City Hall from\n\n[[Page S10954]]\n\n     a largely white bureaucracy to an institution that better \n     reflects the city's 40 percent minority population.\n       ``I think her legacy in the city and in the minority \n     communities will be absolutely enduring,'' said J. Glenn \n     Hopkins, executive director of Hopkins House, an agency for \n     children and families. ``Her ability to be compassionate and \n     to create a compassionate government, her ability to manage \n     and her ability to be accessible to black people, to Hispanic \n     people, to old people, to everybody, regardless of their \n     background or their history or their race, is exceptional \n     among people of her level.''\n       Among today's city and county administrators, Lawson's \n     professional pedigree is unusual. She attended George \n     Washington University part time but dropped out when she had \n     her first child. She plunged into community activism, and as \n     a campaign organizer helped elect the city's first black \n     council member in 1970.\n       Her entry to City Hall was with the anti-poverty program, \n     and she later worked in the housing office. She quickly rose \n     to assistant city manager and found time to initiate the Head \n     Start program and after-school child care at every elementary \n     school.\n       Lawson said she became an Alexandrian by accident. She and \n     her husband, David, a psychiatrist, had planned to move back \n     to Chevy Chase, but she got hooked on the community.\n       ``We'll live the rest of our lives here,'' she said. ``We \n     never planned to live here. We fell in love with \n     Alexandria.''\n       Praise gushed from all corners yesterday, but there were \n     criticisms, too: of an overbearing management style and a \n     temper.\n       ``She's very controlling, and that probably is her \n     downside,'' said Jack Sullivan, who heads the city's civic \n     federation. Nonetheless, said Sullivan, she has ``a marvelous \n     personality'' and is ``one of the ablest public \n     administrators I have ever met.''\n       Lawson's wrath is ``legendary,'' said a close friend, Rep. \n     James P. Moran Jr. (D-Va.), who as mayor hired Lawson. But \n     the source of the anger, he said, is unselfish.\n       ``If you have acted in a way that hurt the city and you \n     should or did know better, then you're dead meat with Vola,'' \n     he said.\n       William H. Hansell Jr., who heads the International City/\n     County Management Association, said her 14-year tenure is \n     ``remarkable,'' especially in a community as ``diverse and \n     challenging as Alexandria.''\n       She accomplished it by reflecting the values of the city, \n     he said, laughing that ``there are not too many city managers \n     who tell a billionaire and a governor where to stick their \n     stadium.''\n       Lawson put the city on firm financial footing, twice \n     achieving the Aaa bond rating and significantly lowering real \n     estate taxes.\n       Her retirement will take effect March 1, after which she \n     plans to see more of her two grandchildren, enhance her \n     reputation as a movie buff and read the three stacks of books \n     she bought at yard sales.\n       When people walk into the lobby that bears her name and \n     wonder who Vola Lawson was, Moran said, they should be told, \n     ``She was a woman who chose to devote her mind and her heart \n     to all the citizens of this community.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/15/senate-section/article/S10954-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10954]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           PILT AMENDMENT TO THE INTERIOR APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I support the PILT amendment to the \nInterior Appropriations bill, which increases payments to counties in \nlieu of taxes. I have worked closely with my good friend and colleague, \nSenator Abraham, in crafting this amendment, and I would like to \nexpress my sincere appreciation to the Senator from Michigan for his \nefforts in this regard. Senator Abraham has consistently shown a \nsensitivity to and an understanding of the needs of rural Americans, \nespecially those living in communities surrounded by public lands.\n  Most of my colleagues understand, by now, that 70 percent of my home \nstate is either owned or controlled by the federal government. I \nbelieve that Utah's public lands stand out for their grandeur and \nunique beauty. Many of our Senate colleagues and staff members have \nvisited these areas to hike, fish, ski, or mountain bike.\n  No one loves these public lands more than the citizens who live among \nthem. But, for the local citizens, these lands can be both a blessing \nand a curse. For a number of Utah counties, as much as 90 percent of \ntheir lands are federally owned, which means they cannot generate tax \nrevenue from these lands.\n  Where once public lands were a source of jobs and opportunity for \nrural America, these lands have increasingly been restricted to single-\nuse activities, such as hiking, biking, or river running. Utah \ncertainly provides excellent opportunities for these types of \nactivities, and we welcome visitors from all over the world.\n  But, we shouldn't forget, Mr. President, that these visitors come \nwith needs: they need roads to travel on, someone to put out their \nfires, law enforcement to keep them safe, someone to collect their \ntrash, someone to come find them when they are lost, and someone to \ntransport them to safety when they are hurt. Mr. President, the \nobligation to fulfill these needs falls on local county governments. \nWith every new wilderness area, monument, or recreation area, county \nrevenues shrink along with taxable economic activity; yet the influx of \nneedy visitors increases.\n  The services counties provide are not money makers. To the contrary, \nthey exact a tremendous cost on rural governments. The puny revenue \nlocal governments raise with their stunted tax base will never cover \nthe costs of providing primary services to visitors over the entire \narea of their county. For this reason, Congress implemented the \nPayments in Lieu of Taxes program--known as PILT--which compensates \nrural counties for some of these services.\n  The problem is that this program has been funded at less than half \nthe authorized level, and this has caused serious hardship for our \ncounties. This amendment, we hope, will be the first installment in an \noverall plan to bring the PILT program to full funding. With small \nincreases to PILT every year, our counties will eventually be made \nwhole. We are not talking about a huge amount of money. We are talking \n$15 million in FY 2000. Last year Senator Abraham and I were able to \nraise funding for PILT to $124 million, but this amount was cut back to \n$120 million in Conference. I hope that this year, we can maintain a \nstrong increase in PILT funding.\n  If your child gets lost in Arches National Park, it will be a Grand \nCounty search and rescue team that will mobilize to find him. If you \nfall and break your ankle on the trail in Dixie National Forest, it \nwill be a Garfield County helicopter and paramedics who will get you \noff the mountain and to the hospital. When you leave Zion National \nPark, it will be a Washington county solid waste truck that picks up \nyour garbage. If someone should start a fire while camping in the \nWasatch National Forest, the Wasatch County firefighters will be there \nto put it out.\n  Our rural governments do all this whether we pay them or not. But it \nis obviously unfair not to compensate them for it. Mr. President, I \nbelieve we should stop treating our rural governments as though they \nwere unpaid chambermaids to the rest of the nation. Our rural areas \ndon't mind providing services to tourists who come to enjoy public \nlands, but they deserve to be justly compensated by the owners of the \nland, the taxpayers, for the basic services they provide.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the PILT amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/15/senate-section/article/S10954-2", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10954-S10955]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO BRUCE E.

Mr. Scott, as president of \nASHP, will represent pharmacists practicing in hospitals, health \nmaintenance organizations, long-term care facilities, home care, \nhospice and other health-care settings.\n  Mr. Scott is currently Vice President of Pharmacy Operations for \nAllina Health Systems headquartered in St. Paul, Minnesota. Allina is a \nnon-profit health care system serving residents of Minnesota, Wisconsin \nand North and South Dakota. As Vice President of Pharmacy Operations, \nMr. Scott is responsible for providing pharmacy services in four \nmetropolitan hospitals with 1700 beds and for developing pharmacy \nservices for Allina Medical Group, with 500 health care providers and \n65 clinics.\n  Exercising his commitment to the future of pharmacy leadership, Mr. \nScott continues to serve as Clinical Assistant Professor and Associate \nMember of the Graduate Program in Hospital Pharmacy at the University \nof Minnesota College of Pharmacy in Minneapolis, a non-salaried \nposition he has held for more than 10 years. As a member of the \ngraduate facility, Mr. Scott assists and\n\n[[Page S10955]]\n\nadvises graduate students in conducting their research and serves as a \nguest lecturer at the University.\n  After receiving his Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy from the \nUniversity of Wisconsin School of Pharmacy, Mr. Scott went on to \ncomplete his Master of Science in Pharmacy Practice from the University \nof Kansas School of Pharmacy. Prior to election as President of the \nASHP, Mr. Scott served as a member of ASHP Boards of Directors. He also \nheld the distinguished position of President of the Minnesota Society \nof Hospital Pharmacists from 1992-1993, and in 1994 he was named a \nFellow of the ASHP in recognition of his sustained contributions to \npharmacy practice excellence.\n  American Society of Health-System Pharmacists is fortunate to have an \nindividual with the credentials of Mr. Scott at its helm, as the \norganization devotes its attention to issues of patient safety and the \neffective use of prescription medications.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/15/senate-section/article/S10955-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10955]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  FOUR CORNERS INTERPRETIVE CENTER ACT\n\n Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to say a few words about S. 28, the Four Corners \nInterpretive Center Act. I was very pleased that the Senate saw fit to \npass this bill by voice vote on September 9, 1999, and I fully expect \nthat this legislation will pass the House and be sent to the President \nduring this Congress.\n  This legislation could not have passed without the strong support of \nits cosponsors, Senators Allard, Bennett, Bingaman, Campbell, and \nDomenici. Chairman Ben Nighthorse Campbell and the staff of the Senate \nIndian Affairs Committee deserve special praise for going the extra \nmile in shepherding this proposal through the committee with speed and \nprofessionalism.\n  The Four Corners Interpretive Center Act will benefit the Four Corner \nstates, the Navajo Nation, and Ute Mountain Ute tribe, and especially \nthe throngs of visitors who make the special effort to visit the remote \nFour Corners region, the only location where the corners of four states \nconverge. A quarter million tourists visit the Four Corners each year, \nonly to find that there are no utilities, no permanent restrooms, no \nrunning water, no telephones, and no vending stations for their \nconvenience.\n  Additionally, the Four Corners National Monument has unique \nhistorical, cultural, and environmental significance. The absence of \nany educational exhibits to help visitors appreciate the area is a \nwasted opportunity. The interpretive center authorized by this bill \nwill enable all Americans who come to this area to learn about the \nancient home of the Anasazi people as well as the area's geography, \nplant and animal species.\n  The objective of S. 28 is simple: to aid in the construction and \nmaintenance of an interpretive center at the Four Corners National \nMonument. The bill calls for a cooperative agreement among the Navajo \nNation, Ute Mountain Ute tribe, affected local governments, and the \nfour corners states to be approved by the Interior Department. Matching \nfunds from each of the four states would also be required. Arizona has \nalready committed funds. This is the type of intergovernmental \npartnership that has worked well on a variety of other projects \nthroughout the country, and it is an appropriate model for the \ninterpretive center.\n  Again, I want to thank my colleagues in the Senate for passing this \nimportant legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/15/senate-section/article/S10955-2", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10955]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--CONFERENCE REPORT TO ACCOMPANY H.R. 2490\n\n  Mr. SHELBY.

FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) clause 3 of section 8 of article I of the United States \n     Constitution recognizes the special relationship between the \n     United States and Indian tribes;\n       (2) beginning in 1970, with the inauguration by the Nixon \n     Administration of the Indian self-determination era, each \n     President has reaffirmed the special government-to-government \n     relationship between Indian tribes and the United States;\n       (3) in 1994, President Clinton issued an Executive \n     memorandum to the heads of departments and agencies that \n     obligated all Federal departments and agencies, particularly \n     those that have an impact on economic development, to \n     evaluate the potential impacts of their actions on Indian \n     tribes;\n       (4) consistent with the principles of inherent tribal \n     sovereignty and the special relationship between Indian \n     tribes and the United States, Indian tribes retain the right \n     to enter into contracts and agreements to trade freely, and \n     seek enforcement of treaty and trade rights;\n       (5) Congress has carried out the responsibility of the \n     United States for the protection and preservation of Indian \n     tribes and the resources of Indian tribes through the \n     endorsement of treaties, and the enactment of other laws, \n     including laws that provide for the exercise of \n     administrative authorities;\n       (6) the United States has an obligation to guard and \n     preserve the sovereignty of Indian tribes in order to foster \n     strong tribal governments, Indian self-determination, and \n     economic self-sufficiency among Indian tribes;\n       (7) the capacity of Indian tribes to build strong tribal \n     governments and vigorous economies is hindered by the \n     inability of Indian tribes to engage communities that \n     surround Indian lands and outside investors in economic \n     activities on Indian lands;\n       (8) despite the availability of abundant natural resources \n     on Indian lands and a rich cultural legacy that accords great \n     value to self-determination, self-reliance, and independence, \n     Native Americans suffer higher rates of unemployment, \n     poverty, poor health, substandard housing, and associated \n     social ills than those of any other group in the United \n     States;\n       (9) the United States has an obligation to assist Indian \n     tribes with the creation of appropriate economic and \n     political conditions with respect to Indian lands to--\n       (A) encourage investment from outside sources that do not \n     originate with the tribes; and\n       (B) facilitate economic ventures with outside entities that \n     are not tribal entities;\n       (10) the economic success and material well-being of Native \n     American communities depends on the combined efforts of the \n     Federal Government, tribal governments, the private sector, \n     and individuals;\n       (11) the lack of employment and entrepreneurial \n     opportunities in the communities referred to in paragraph (7) \n     has resulted in a multigenerational dependence on Federal \n     assistance that is--\n       (A) insufficient to address the magnitude of needs; and\n       (B) unreliable in availability; and\n       (12) the twin goals of economic self-sufficiency and \n     political self-determination for Native Americans can best be \n     served by making available to address the challenges faced by \n     those groups--\n       (A) the resources of the private market;\n       (B) adequate capital; and\n       (C) technical expertise.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To revitalize economically and physically distressed \n     Native American economies by--\n       (A) encouraging the formation of new businesses by eligible \n     entities, and the expansion of existing businesses; and\n       (B) facilitating the movement of goods to and from Indian \n     lands and the provision of services by Indians.\n       (2) To promote private investment in the economies of \n     Indian tribes and to encourage the sustainable development of \n     resources of Indian tribes and Indian-owned businesses.\n       (3) To promote the long-range sustained growth of the \n     economies of Indian tribes.\n       (4) To raise incomes of Indians in order to reduce the \n     number of Indians at poverty levels and provide the means for \n     achieving a higher standard of living on Indian reservations.\n       (5) To encourage intertribal, regional, and international \n     trade and business development in order to assist in \n     increasing productivity and the standard of living of members \n     of Indian tribes and improving the economic self-sufficiency \n     of the governing bodies of Indian tribes.\n       (6) To promote economic self-sufficiency and political \n     self-determination for Indian tribes and members of Indian \n     tribes.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 272, S. 406.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 406) to amend the Indian Health Care Improvement \n     Act to make permanent the demonstration program that allows \n     for direct billing of medicare, medicaid, and other third \n     party payors, and to expand the eligibility under such \n     program to other tribes and tribal organizations.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill \nwhich had been reported from the Committee on Indian Affairs, with an \namendment to strike all after the enacting clause and inserting in lieu \nthereof the following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Alaska Native and American \n     Indian Direct Reimbursement Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In 1988, Congress enacted section 405 of the Indian \n     Health Care Improvement Act (25 U.S.C. 1645) that established \n     a demonstration program to authorize 4 tribally-operated \n     Indian Health Service hospitals or clinics to test methods \n     for direct billing and receipt of payment for health services \n     provided to patients eligible for reimbursement under the \n     medicare or medicaid programs under titles XVIII and XIX of \n     the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.; 1396 et \n     seq.), and other third-party payors.\n       (2) The 4 participants selected by the Indian Health \n     Service for the demonstration program began the direct \n     billing and collection program in fiscal year 1989 and \n     unanimously expressed success and satisfaction with the \n     program. Benefits of the program include dramatically \n     increased collections for services provided under the \n     medicare and medicaid programs, a significant reduction in \n     the turn-around time between billing and receipt of payments \n     for services provided to eligible patients, and increased \n     efficiency of participants being able to track their own \n     billings and collections.\n       (3) The success of the demonstration program confirms that \n     the direct involvement of tribes and tribal organizations in \n     the direct billing of, and collection of payments from, the \n     medicare and medicaid programs, and other third payor \n     reimbursements, is more beneficial to Indian tribes than the \n     current system of Indian Health Service-managed collections.\n       (4) Allowing tribes and tribal organizations to directly \n     manage their medicare and medicaid billings and collections, \n     rather than channeling all activities through the Indian \n     Health Service, will enable the Indian Health Service to \n     reduce its administrative costs, is consistent with the \n     provisions of the Indian Self-Determination Act, and furthers \n     the commitment of the Secretary to enable tribes and tribal \n     organizations to manage and operate their health care \n     programs.\n       (5) The demonstration program was originally to expire on \n     September 30, 1996, but was extended by Congress, so that the \n     current participants would not experience an interruption in \n     the program while Congress awaited a recommendation from the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services on whether to make the \n     program permanent.\n       (6) It would be beneficial to the Indian Health Service and \n     to Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and Alaska Native \n     organizations to provide permanent status to the \n     demonstration program and to extend participation in the \n     program\n\n[[Page S10960]]\n\n     to other Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and Alaska \n     Native health organizations who operate a facility of the \n     Indian Health Service.\n\n     SEC. 3.
