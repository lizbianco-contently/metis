Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes for debate prior to the vote on amendment No. 1789.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this amendment is to express the sense \nof the Senate--that is all we are doing--that lung cancer, colon \ncancer, and brain and central nervous system cancer should be presumed \nto be service-connected disabilities as radiogenic diseases.\n  Colleagues, I am talking about Nagasaki and Hiroshima, atomic \nveterans who were in Nevada and Utah. They went to ground zero. Our \ngovernment never told them they were in harm's way, never gave them any \nprotective gear. It is just unbelievable, the incidents of cancer, and \nall I am saying is that we just right an injustice. We should make sure \nthey get the health care they deserve; they should get the compensation \nthey deserve. We do this presumption for Agent Orange and Vietnam vets. \nWe should. We do it for\n\n[[Page S11380]]\n\nPersian Gulf veterans. We should. We ought to do it for these atomic \nveterans. They have been waiting a half century. I understand the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs is opposed to the Senate going on record \nwith a sense-of-the-Senate amendment.\n  Let me just say that Ken Kizer, former Under Secretary of Health for \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs, wrote that this is a mistake and \nthat given our position on gulf war veterans and Agent Orange veterans, \nit is a matter of equity and fairness.\n  Please vote for this, colleagues. It is absolutely the right thing to \ndo. These veterans have been waiting for justice for a half century.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Minnesota has been a \ndevoted advocate for veterans who have been exposed to atomic \nradiation. I commend him for his advocacy. He has for 3 years pursued \nattaching legislation to this bill. However, the legislation is \nproperly under the VA subcommittee's jurisdiction. The VA has opposed \namending this law because, No. 1, it would cost over $500 million in \nadditional entitlement payments over 5 years. The VA has the authority \nand the responsibility to make the medical judgments as to whether \nthese are, in fact, service-connected disabilities, and I suggest that \nthis body does not have before it the medical evidence or the \nscientific proof needed to make that kind of judgment. We commend the \nSenator for being interested and concerned about these veterans, but we \nare not in a position to make the medical judgment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n1789.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I will be proceeding momentarily on two \namendments, one of which will be accepted, and one of which, it is my \nunderstanding, we still want to have a discussion about to see how we \ncan proceed.\n  Before we do that, last evening, the chairman and the ranking member \ngraciously agreed to include in the legislation an amendment with \nrespect to the Montreal Protocol. Senator Chafee and I, the original \ncosponsors, along with Senator Brownback and others, were not able to \nbe here at that time. We wanted to take a very quick moment on that \namendment, if we could. We promise not to tax our colleagues' patience. \nWe want to say a few words about this because of its importance. We are \nvery grateful to Senator Bond and Senator Mikulski for working with us \nto accept this amendment.\n  I am very grateful to Senator Chafee for his long commitment and \nlabor in this area. He is chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, and he is one of the architects of the very successful \nMontreal Protocol.\n  I also want to thank our colleagues, Senators Brownback, Snowe, \nLieberman, Leahy, Moynihan, Kennedy, Bingaman, Jeffords, Daschle, Roth, \nBoxer, and Grams, who are cosponsoring this amendment.\n  Let me say very quickly where we are with respect to this.\n  The Montreal Protocol is the landmark international agreement to halt \nand eventually reverse the growing hole in the Earth's ozone layer. It \nis extremely important as an agreement in the context of international \nefforts for the environment as well as for public health. The \ndestruction of the ozone layer and the resultant increase in \nultraviolet radiation has been clearly scientifically linked to higher \ninstances of skin cancer, premature aging, and other skin problems; to \ncataracts and other eye damage; and the suppression of the human immune \nsystem.\n  The American Cancer Society reports melanoma, the most serious form \nof skin cancer, is expected to be diagnosed in 44,200 people in 1999. \nIt is one of the fastest growing cancers in the United States--growing \n4 percent per year since the early 1970's. And, according to the EPA, \none in five Americans will develop skin cancer in their life time--and \nthat amounts to one American dying every hour from this disease.\n  According to a scientific assessment called the Environmental Effects \nof Ozone Depletion and published in 1998 by the United Nations, \nexposure to increased UV radiation can be highly destructive to the \nhuman eye. The assessment concludes that, ``The increases of UV-B \nradiation associated with ozone depletion are likely to lead to \nincreases in the incidence and/or severity of a variety of short-term \nand long-term health effects.'' The effects, according to the report, \nwill include cataracts, blindness from cataracts, ocular melanoma and \nother eye cancers, and death associated with cancers of the eye. \nCataracts are the leading cause of blindness in the world, and in 1992 \nalone, the United States spent $3.1 billion treating cataracts.\n  It is because of this danger to human health that American Academy of \nDermatology and the Physicians for Social Responsibility are supporting \nthis amendment.\n  In addition to these health impacts, increased exposure to UV \nradiation can degrade terrestrial and aquatic species, including \ncommercial crops. The damage caused to ecosystems can vary widely \ndepending on the species in question--and we're learning more about how \nUV radiation can subtly--and not so subtly--damage a species. For \nexample, it is becoming increasingly evident that UV-B and UV-A \nradiation have adverse effects on photoplankton, macroalgae and \nseagrasses. Now, I know it's not every day that we talk about \nphotoplankton, macroalgae and seagrass, but if you care about fisheries \nand the well-being of our oceans, then to you these things matter. They \nare the building blocks of the marine ecosystem, the matter of the web \nof life and if they're not healthy, then our ocean and fisheries will \nnot be healthy.\n  The multilateral fund, which is the specific program that our \namendment\n\n[[Page S11381]]\n\nsupports, is the policy mechanism within the Montreal Protocol to \nreduce the emissions of ozone-depleting substances from developing \ncountries.\n  I want to emphasize this. It happens by chance that the Chair at this \nmoment is deeply involved in the issue of Kyoto and global warming. \nThis is not global warming. But it does reflect the same principle of \ngetting less developed countries to participate in the effort to be \nresponsible about environmental damage.\n  The Montreal Protocol specifically brought developing countries into \nthe process through the efforts of the multilateral fund.\n  The United States and other nations leading the effort to protect the \nozone layer have long understood that emissions from developing \ncountries which were not included in the last round of cuts because of \ntheir relatively low emission levels and their relative inability to \nact in the long run would be equally as destructive to the ozone layer \nas the emissions from the United States.\n  So to address the problem in 1990 we passed this effort, and we are \nnow restoring $12 million to the funding within EPA's budget in order \nto support the Montreal Protocol.\n  To address this problem, the United States negotiated in 1990 the \nMultilateral Fund to provide technical and financial assistance to \ndeveloping nations to undertake projects to reduce their emissions. It \nhas been extraordinarily successful.\n  Mr. President, let me say now what this amendment would do--it's very \nsimple. It restores $12 million in funding within EPA's budget to \nsupport the Montreal Protocol's Multilateral Fund. Unfortunately, the \nVA-HUD bill now provides no funds for the EPA to participate in the \nMultilateral Fund--despite President Clinton's request of $21 million.\n  To fund this $12 million increase in the Multilateral Fund, the \namendment makes an across-the-board cut to other accounts in the EPA's \nbudget. I have sought this offset reluctantly. I strongly believe that \nCongress is making a mistake by cutting our national investment in \nenvironmental protection and natural resource conservation year after \nyear. If it were my decision alone, this Senate would not have capped \nnatural resource spending at $2.4 billion below last year's budget and \n$3.1 billion below the President's request. I opposed these low caps \nprecisely because they jeopardize important federal programs \nMultilateral Fund. And, I want to stress that I commend Chairman Bond \nand Ranking Member Mikulski for the work they done to craft the VA-HUD \nAppropriations bill--under what I believe are more demanding \nconstraints than any other appropriations committee.\n  Nonetheless, I strongly believe that we should fund this program, and \nI want to stress that it is only because of critical importance of the \nMultilateral Fund that I accept this shifting of funds within the EPA \naccounts.\n\n  Mr. President, I have asked my colleagues to support this amendment \nfor the following reasons.\n  First and foremost, the Montreal Protocol is a success. In 1998, \nNASA, NOAA and other scientific bodies coauthored a report called the \nScientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion. The assessment concluded--and \nit could not have been more direct or more succinct--that ``The \nMontreal Protocol is working.''\n  Too often we come to this floor to debate the failure of \ninternational agreements, whether they're about the environment, trade \nor peace--but not today. The Montreal Protocol, with the participation \nof over 162 nations, is working.\n  To support this claim, NASA and NOAA cited two compelling \nobservations that clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the \nProtocol:\n  Firstly, the abundance of ozone depleting chemicals in the lower \natmosphere peaked in 1994 and is now slowly declining. Thanks to the \nProtocol we have turned the corner and we are now reducing the \naccumulation of these destructive substances in the atmosphere.\n  Secondly, the abundance of substitutes for ozone depleting chemicals \nin the atmosphere is rising. The abundance of chemicals that have been \ncreated to replace CFCs and other ozone depleting chemicals are on the \nrise in the atmosphere. These chemicals are providing us the same \nservices we require, but not destroy the ozone.\n  This isn't to say that a danger doesn't still exist. One does--and \nthat's the point of this amendment. The fact is that the ozone hole \nover the Antarctic was the largest it has ever been in 1998. While we \nhave turned the corner, we must stat vigilant, follow through and get \nthe job done.\n  Mr. President, I want to make an important point: In their report, \nNASA and NOAA concluded that the success of the Protocol would not have \nbeen possible without the strengthening amendments of 1990 that created \nthe Multilateral Fund. The report reads ``It is important to note that, \nwhile the provisions of the original Montreal Protocol in 1987 would \nhave lowered the [growth rates in ozone depletion], recovery would have \nbeen impossible without the Amendments and Adjustments.''--and it \nspecifically includes the 1990 amendments creating the Multilateral \nFund.\n  Second, the Multilateral Fund itself is working. Since its inception \nin 1990, 32 industrialized nations have contributed $847 million to the \nMultilateral Fund. These funds have sponsored more than 2,700 projects \nin 110 nations, whose implementation will phase out the consumption of \n119,000 tonnes of ozone depleting substances.\n  These projects for technical and financial in developing countries \nare selected by an Executive Committee, which the U.S. chairs. In fact, \nit is the EPA that takes the lead in the U.S. role as chair of the \nExecutive Committee. The Agency provides technical expertise and \nexperience that has been crucial to the Multilateral Fund's success.\n  And the program has been well-run. In 1997, the GAO reviewed the \nMultilateral Fund's performance and concluded that it was well managed \nand fiscally sound. GAO reported that the Executive Committee reviews \nprojects for their cost effectiveness and rejects projects that fail to \nmeet cost standards. Further, the GAO concluded that the administrative \ncosts of operating the Fund were appropriate. In fact, the GAO made a \nsingle recommendation to improve the program's fiscal operation \nrelating to use of promissary notes--which the Clinton Administration \nhas since instituted at the EPA.\n  Third, the Multilateral Fund has strong business support. I have a \nletter from the Alliance for Responsible Atmospheric Policy urging \nCongress to fund the U.S. treaty obligations. This letter demonstrates \nAmerica's leadership in the development, manufacture and marketing of \nozone-safe products. Alliance members include General Electric, Ford \nMotor Co., General Motors Co., Whirlpool, Johnson Controls, \nAlliedSignal and dozens of the others. These are some of leading names \nin American business.\n\n  In their statement, the Alliance writes that they support the fund \nfor very simple reasons:\n  Firstly, the Multilateral Fund was part of the deal when the Montreal \nProtocol was negotiated in the late 1980s. They argue that American \nindustry has been supportive because a fund to assist developing \nnations assured world wide compliance.\n  Secondly, U.S. industry has invested billions of dollars in ozone-\nsafe technologies and the Multilateral fund will facilitate the world \nwide use of these technologies, creating markets for U.S. companies and \nreducing pollution. These companies know that we are creating jobs and \nprofits by exporting American-made, ozone-safe technologies. According \nto EPA, the overwhelming majority of ozone-safe products utilized in \nthe Fund's projects are American.\n  Thirdly, these more than 100 companies recognize that the phase out \nof ozone depleting chemicals in developing nations is the final step in \nprotecting the atmosphere.\n  In a statement to Congress, the Alliance writes,\n\n       The international effort to protect the Earth's \n     stratospheric ozone layer has been one of the most successful \n     global environmental protection efforts ever, with an \n     unprecedented level of cooperation between and among \n     governments and industry. To not fulfill our treaty \n     obligations at this time is bad environmental policy, hurts \n     U.S. credibility around the world, especially in important \n     developing country emerging markets, and is self-destructive \n     toward U.S. industry and workers who have, in effect, already \n     paid for this contribution.\n\n\n[[Page S11382]]\n\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the statement of the Alliance for \nResponsible Atmospheric Policy, and a list of its member companies be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1)\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to discuss how it is that we decided \nto seek $12 million. This year the U.S. commitment to the Multilateral \nFund is $38 million. The Senate has approved roughly $26 million in the \nInternational Operations Programs at the State Department. By restoring \n$12 million into the EPA program, this amendment will allow us to \nfulfill the U.S. commitment of $38 million. Further, we have funded the \nEPA program for the Multilateral Fund at $12 million in FY96, FY97 and \nFY98, and at nearly $12 million in FY99. Therefore, by providing $12 \nmillion we will meet our 1999 obligation and essentially level fund \nthis program.\n  I want my colleagues to know that even if this amendment is accepted, \nit will do nothing to pay down the U.S. arrears to the Multilateral \nFund--which is now at $23.8 million. Mr. President, that is \nunfortunate. I wish that we could do better--and I applaud President \nClinton for requesting enough to pay our debt to the Fund--and urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment so that, at the very least, we can \nmeet our obligations for this year.\n  In closing, I want to stress the bipartisan nature of this effort, \nand not just this amendment. The Montreal Protocol was finalized in \n1987 by the Reagan administration, and it passed the Senate by a vote \nof 93-0. The Multilateral Fund was created in 1990 by the Bush \nadministration. Under the Clinton administration, with the EPA and the \nState Department's stewardship, the Protocol has been strengthened and \nthe Multilateral Fund operated effectively and efficiently. And today, \nour amendment is sponsored by 9 Democrats and 6 Republicans.\n  The Montreal Protocol's Multilateral Fund deserves our nation's full \nsupport. I believe the offset we have chosen is reasonable and fair. I \nthank my colleagues who have sponsored this amendment, and want to \nthank again Senator Bond and Senator Mikulski for accepting the \namendment.\n\n       Exhibit 1--The Alliance for Responsible Atmospheric Policy\n\n\nSUPPORT FUNDING FOR THE STRATOSPHERIC OZONE MULTILATERAL FUND IN EPA FY \n                           2000 APPROPRIATION\n\n       The Alliance for Responsible Atmospheric Policy, the \n     largest industry coalition involved on the issue of \n     stratospheric ozone protection, urges the continued funding \n     of the US treaty obligations to the Stratospheric Ozone \n     Protection Multilateral Fund.\n       The Administration budget request for FY 2000 is $21 \n     million in the EPA budget. This amount, plus funding under \n     the State Department budget would allow the US to meet its \n     year 2000 treaty obligations and to allow it to make up its \n     arrears to the fund. FY 99 funding for this activity in the \n     EPA budget was approximately $12 million.\n       Industry supports this fund for several simple reasons. \n     First, the fund to assist developing countries in the phase \n     out of ozone depleting substances was part of the original \n     bargain when the Montreal Protocol was negotiated in the late \n     1980s. Industry has been supportive of this treaty because it \n     assured world wide compliance rather than damaging unilateral \n     action.\n       Second, the developing country phase out of these compounds \n     is the last critical step towards restoring the Earth's \n     protective stratospheric ozone layer, without developing \n     country phaseout the environmental objective cannot be \n     completed.\n       Third, US industry has invested billions of dollars in \n     substitute technologies to replace the ozone depleting \n     compounds. The Multilateral Fund is designed to facilitate \n     the shift to these new technologies. If the US does not meet \n     its treaty obligations, it puts US industries at a \n     disadvantage against competitors from Japan and Europe.\n       Fourth, US industry has been taxed more than $6 billion in \n     excise taxes since 1990 on the ozone depleting compounds! \n     Total contributions to the Multilateral Fund since 1991 have \n     been less than $300 million!\n       The international effort to protect the earth's \n     stratospheric ozone layer has been one of the most successful \n     global environmental protection efforts ever, with an \n     unprecedented level of cooperation between and among \n     governments and industry. To not fulfill our treaty \n     obligations at this time is bad environmental policy, hurts \n     US credibility around the world especially in important \n     developing country emerging markets, and is self-destructive \n     towards US industry and workers who have, in effect, already \n     paid for this contribution.\n       The Senate Appropriations Committee is urged to restore the \n     funding for this important United States treaty obligation.

Mr. President, I wish to express my thanks to the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts and also to the managers of \nthe bill for accepting this amendment. Once in a while, we pass some \nlegislation that really works. With the Montreal Protocol, we have an \nexample of that.\n  The Montreal Protocol has always enjoyed broad bipartisan support in \nthe Congress and public support across the country.\n  As our colleagues well remember, it was President Reagan who \nnegotiated and signed the Protocol in 1987. Since that time, many \nstrengthening amendments have been adopted and ratified during the \nadministrations of both President Bush and President Clinton.\n  One of the most effective provisions of the protocol is an \ninternational fund that provides assistance to developing nations to \naid their phaseout of ozone depleting substances. This is not a U.S. \naid program. It is an international fund supported by 35 countries. It \nhas assisted projects to reduce ozone use in 120 developing countries.\n  Mr. President, I can tell the Senate that the Montreal Protocol Fund \nis a very cost effective program because the U.S. General Accounting \nOffice audited the program in 1997 and gave it high praise. GAO had \nonly one recommendation to make to improve its performance and that \nrecommendation has since been implemented. I would note that the U.S. \nbusiness community also strongly supports this program. Quite often the \nassistance provided by\n\n[[Page S11383]]\n\nthe fund is used by developing nations to buy our technology to reduce \nCFC use. So, there is no question that this program works and has been \nhighly successful.\n  The only issue is whether there is room for the U.S. contribution in \nthis budget. We have pledged approximately $39 million for this coming \nyear. There is $27 million in the foreign operations appropriation. \nWhich means that we need an additional $12 million to honor our \ncommitment. The amendment by the Senator from Massachusetts would \nprovide that $12 million from EPA's budget. This follows a long \ntradition of paying for part of our contribution from State Department \nfunds and part of our contribution through the EPA budget.\n  Can EPA afford $12 million for this purpose? We know that the budget \nis tight this year. But it is not so tight that we need to entirely \neliminate this expenditure. In fact, I would note that this bill \nprovides EPA $116 million more than the President requested. As the \nSenator from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, has said many times here on \nthe floor, this bill is still a work in progress. I am confident that \nthe very able managers of the bill can find room for the Montreal \nProtocol Fund in a budget for EPA that provides $116 million more than \nthe President's request for the coming year.\n  We have our differences here in the Senate over environmental policy. \nBut everyone has to admit that the international program to protect the \nstratospheric ozone layer negotiated by President Reagan has been a \ntremendous success. The work is not quite done. CFCs are not entirely \nout of our economy. In fact, the U.S. remains the third largest user of \nCFCs. But we are well on the way to a CFC-free world. And this program, \nthe Montreal Protocol Fund, has been a very important part of the \neffort. It deserves our continued support.\n  We have been able to curb the CFCs. We are on a downward glidepath, \nnot only among those nations that signed the Montreal Protocol, but the \ninternational fund is supported by 35 countries. We have also reached \nout to reduce the CFC use in 120 developing countries.\n  The CFCs are extremely dangerous substances in the destruction of the \nozone layer. We are gradually eliminating them. This is a step forward.\n  This amendment takes from the total EPA budget some $12 million, \nwhich is then added to the $27 million in the foreign operations \nappropriations so that we then meet our commitment of $39 million for \nthis international fund, which is the contribution of the United \nStates. It is not the United States alone, as I mentioned before; we \nhave some 35 other countries that are contributing.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, it is my understanding that Senator \nBrownback wants to make a brief comment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment put \nforward by Senator Kerry, Senator Chafee, and myself and a number of \nother Senators. Also, I want to thank Senator Bond and Senator Mikulski \nfor accepting it.\n  I think this is a great statement and a great amendment for us to \npush forward. It provides funding for the Montreal Protocol with the \nmultilateral fund. The fund sponsors technical assistance to 110 \ndeveloping nations to reduce the ozone-depleting substances. It is \nsupported by 120 industrialized nations. I think it is an important way \nfor the world to combat pollution cooperatively.\n  It will help phase out ozone-depleting substances in developing \ncountries. GAO's 1997 report says this was a good working solution. It \nwas working well.\n  The amendment is fiscally responsible as well. It provides $12 \nmillion for the fund, offset with a tiny reduction--less than .02 of a \npercent--in EPA's discretionary spending.\n  Today's world is an international, interactive relationship, \nparticularly on the environment. Here is a very commonsense, practical \napproach for us to be able to work cooperatively with other nations. \nTwelve million dollars is economically responsible, budget-wise, coming \nout of the EPA discretionary fund.\n  This is a good way to work forward.\n  I thank my colleagues for their leadership. I think this is an \nexcellent way for us to work toward international environmental \ncooperation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1756, As Modified\n\n(Purpose: Amend Housing Opportunities for People with AIDS to increase \n              by $7 million and section 811 by $7 million)\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues.\n  Let me quickly proceed to the amendment that I know is going to be \naccepted. I have an amendment at the desk, No. 1756. We have worked out \na modification with the ranking member and the Chair.\n  I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry), for himself and \n     Mr. Bond, proposes an amendment numbered 1756, as modified.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 35, strike ``$904,000,000'' and insert in lieu \n     thereof: ``$911,000,000''.\n       On page 36, line 8, strike ``$194,000,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof: ``$201,000,000''.\n       On page 28, line 2, strike ``$225,000,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof: ``$232,000,000''.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this amendment increases housing \nopportunities for people with AIDS--the AIDS account--and the section \n811 disabled housing account by $7 million each.\n  As I said, this is with the consent of the Chair and the ranking \nmember. I appreciate their willingness to work with me on this \namendment.\n  These funds are going to help provide housing for an additional 1,850 \npeople with HIV-AIDS, and also crucial new housing for the disabled.\n  This particular effort, housing opportunities for people with AIDS, \nserves a unique function within the HUD budget. It is a vital program \nfor people with HIV-AIDS. Fully 60 percent of them will face a housing \ncrisis at some point during their illness. Tragically, at any given \ntime, half the people with AIDS are either homeless or on the brink of \nlosing their homes.\n  This amendment would go a long way to solving that problem. I look \nforward to working with the Chair and the ranking member to maintain \nthis in conference.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield briefly?\n  Mr. KERRY. I think we are going to pass this amendment. I am happy to \nyield for a quick comment.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I will be very brief. I, too, appreciate Senators Mikulski \nand Bond supporting this. I think the point Senator Kerry is making \nwith this amendment--I hope in the days ahead it yields to a broader \ndebate--is that at a time of record economic prosperity, we are having \nextraordinary crises in terms of access to affordable housing. All \nacross this country we have waiting lists, sometimes for years, for the \nkind of people that Senator Kerry is trying to assist with this \namendment. I think this is a start. Senator Mikulski and Senator Bond \nhave been very gracious to accept this amendment. I commend them for \nit. But I hope in the days ahead that we can build on the Kerry \namendment and really drive these waiting lists down. If anything, the \nhot economy we are seeing is driving up rents and, in effect, \ncontributing to the problems we are having with these waiting lists.\n\n  I didn't want to take a lot of time of the Senate, and I am very \npleased Senator Kerry is leading this effort. I hope this is seen as \nthe beginning of a bipartisan effort to drive down these waiting lists \nthat are years and years in some communities for disabled folks, \nseniors, and those with HIV.\n  I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for yielding time. I am glad \nthis amendment has been accepted on both sides of the aisle.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Oregon for his \ncomments and for his own personal dedication to this issue.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we are pleased to be able to work with the \nSenator from Massachusetts, the ranking member on the housing \nauthorization committee. We know there are\n\n[[Page S11384]]\n\ngreat needs. We are very pleased we have been able to work with the \nSenator and provide an additional $7 million for section 8, for the \nHOPWA program and the section 811 program. When we talk about \navailability of housing, section 811 does provide additional housing. \nIn many of the section 8 programs, we find they cannot create new \nhousing. Having a certificate without a place to live, without a place \nto use it, doesn't do any good. The section 811 program has been at a \nstatic level of $194 million over the last decade. We were able to \nprovide in the original mark for an additional $40 million in section 8 \nfor persons with disabilities.\n  Section 811 is a construction program for persons with disabilities. \nThis is a modest increase. It is well deserved. I appreciate working \nwith my ranking member, Senator Kerry, to get this done.\n  I yield to the Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I, too, lend my support for this \namendment. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his advocacy, and \nI thank the Senator from Missouri for the staff, along with my own \nstaff, who helped find the funds.\n  For any person disabled or with AIDS, finding the kind of suitable \nhousing with the appropriate physical architecture, the kind of things \nneeded for the aged or for someone quite ill, is important. We need to \nmake sure we provide the opportunity for people to be able to maintain \nself-sufficiency in the community and be able to get the treatment they \nneed.\n  This goes a long way to adding help for 1,800 more people. I am \nwilling to accept it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1756), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1761\n\n (Purpose: To provide funding for incremental section 8 vouchers under \nsection 558 of the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998)\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we now move to the last amendment I have, \namendment No. 1761.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kerry] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1761.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 18, line 3, strike ``$10,855,135,000'' and insert \n     ``$10,566,335,000''.\n       On page 18, line 4, strike ``$6,655,135,000'' and insert \n     ``$6,366,335,000''.\n       On page 18, line 19, insert before the colon the following: \n     ``: Provided further, That of the total amount provided under \n     this heading, $288,800,000 shall be made available for \n     incremental section 8 vouchers under section 558 of the \n     Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998 (Public \n     Law 105-276; 112 Stat. 2614): Provided further, That the \n     Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may not expend any \n     amount made available under the Departments of Veterans \n     Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent \n     Agencies Appropriations Act, 1999, for tenant-based \n     assistance under the United States Housing Act of 1937 to \n     help eligible families make the transition from welfare to \n     work until March 1, 2000''.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, again, let me summarize this as succinctly \nas I can. It is a critical topic and one I want to talk a couple of \nminutes on in order to share with my colleagues where we stand with \nrespect to housing and section 8 in the effort to try to provide \naffordable housing in the country.\n  I have nothing but enormous respect for the difficult circumstances \nunder which the Chair and ranking member of the Appropriations \nCommittee have labored. It is fair to say their situation has been \nunfair, untenable, and it wasn't until there was a raid on the labor \nand education money that they conceivably had enough money to try to \nbring a bill to the floor.\n  Most Members know what will happen: There will be some other kind of \nraid which will take place to try to restore some money back into the \nlabor and education fund so we can somehow bring a bill to the floor \nand create a fiction that we were able to do something.\n  My comments are not directed at the Chair or the ranking member, who \nhave done an exemplary job of dealing with the most difficult \nconstraints of almost any committee within the Senate. But there are \nsome tough realities about which the rest of us, properly representing \nour States and our citizens, need to talk. Those tough realities are \nthe situations we face with respect to housing in the country.\n  The amendment I have offered redirects $288 million in funds needed \nto renew the existing section 8 contracts, and to use those funds to \nprovide an additional 50,000 section 8 vouchers. I come after this as \nthe ranking member of the authorizing committee with an understanding \nthere are back-end costs. I know the Chair will say it is not just the \n50,000 you put up today; there will be back-end costs. I will talk \nabout that in a moment. I fully acknowledge that reality.\n  However, the amendment we offer is supported by the National Low \nIncome Housing Coalition, by the National Alliance to End Homelessness, \nthe National Housing Conference, the Catholic Charities USA, the Center \nfor Community Change, the National Housing Law Project, and the \nNational Association of Home Builders which call for an increase in \nsection 8 vouchers. I also point out the statement of administration \npolicy in their letter on this bill says they object to the committee's \ndecision not to fund new incremental section 8 vouchers.\n  The President asked for 100,000 new vouchers. I think the President's \nrequest for 100,000 new vouchers represents the commitment we \nreinstituted last year to try to begin a process of recognizing what \nwas happening to housing in the country. The fact is we now face an \nextraordinary and growing shortage of affordable housing for poor and \nworking families in America. It seems to me, and to a lot of my \ncolleagues, in the economic times we have in this country, when the \nstock market--though obviously it is up and down, and yesterday was \ndown--is at its highest level, the economy has been remarkable in its \nsustained consecutive months of growth, unemployment is at a record \nlow--we all know those statistics--in the middle of this remarkable \ngrowth, when ownership of homes is at a new and historic high, we are \nseeing the stock of affordable housing decline. Indeed, we now have a \nrecord number of families that face a housing crisis of some \nproportion. Nearly 5.6 million American families have what is called \nworst case housing needs. Yesterday, HUD released new data showing that \nnumber was added to by some 260,000 households in the past 2 years. We \nare talking about worst case needs, according to our own definition.\n  These families pay one half of their income in rent. I ask all of my \ncolleagues to think about that. We have a pretty good salary and a lot \nof Members in the Senate have income from other sources and don't face \nsome of the choices that a lot of our fellow citizens have, but one \nhalf of family income going to rent for these families is an \nunacceptable level by any of the standards or guidelines we offer. \nIncreasingly, these families are working families. For them, the \neconomic bump in the road that can result is a bump that brings \nshortages of food, utility cutoffs, and even evictions and \nhomelessness.\n  This is illustrated by a study recently completed by the Institute \nfor Children and Poverty which shows that homelessness is rising among \nworking families. The study shows that in Newark, working families \nconstitute 44 percent of the homeless families. Mr. President, 44 \npercent of homeless families are also working families. In Boston, I \nknow we found a huge increase in the rental market. So there is \nincreasing difficulty for working families with students to be able to \nfind adequate housing.\n  I might add, it is not just in the short term that this presents us a \nproblem, it is in the long term that it presents us a problem. We have \n50,000 or 100,000 vouchers we are looking for, which will only take \ncare of a fraction of the need or the demand. But it is help that is \nsorely needed, and it reflects the efforts of the Government to try to \nrespond within the limits we face today.\n\n[[Page S11385]]\n\n I might add, this money is available. We are not taking it from \nsomewhere else. We are taking it from unspent funds within HUD itself \nbecause of their lack of expenditure at this point in time.\n  Let me share with my colleagues one of the aspects of this problem on \nwhich a lot of people do not focus. Dr. Alan Meyers, who is a \npediatrician at the Boston Medical Center, did a series of studies on \nthe impact of high housing costs on child nutrition. In each case, he \nfound that children of poor families receiving housing assistance were \nbetter nourished and in better health than similar families without \nsuch assistance. In a stark illustration of the choices the unassisted \nfamilies face, he found children were most likely to be undernourished \nduring the 90 days after the coldest month of the year, highlighting \nwhat he called the ``heat or eat dilemma.''\n  In addition, let me underscore that lack of proper nourishment is \nonly one problem that comes out of the housing crisis. The fact is, \nchildren who have a housing crisis are also forced to move from school \nto school. Social workers in Charlotte, NC, have told us about children \nthey have seen going to as many as six different elementary schools in \na single year. One expert estimated that as many as half the children \nin the Washington, DC, foster care system could be reunited with their \nparents if their families had access to stable housing.\n  So here we are in the Senate, arguing about changes in the welfare \nculture, arguing about schools that do not work, arguing about the need \nto have parents involved in families, and clearly one of the links that \nreunites parents with families and provides stability in the school \nsystem and capacity for children to stay out of trouble is available, \naffordable housing. It is an astonishing statistic, that half the \nchildren in Washington, DC, in the foster care system could actually be \nreunited with their parents if we had adequate housing available.\n  Some people will say to us that this costs a lot of money and is hard \nto do. There was a report that came out recently called ``Out Of \nReach,'' which was done by the National Low-Income Housing Alliance. In \nmy home State of Massachusetts, a person would have to work 100 hours \nevery week at the minimum wage just to afford the typical rental on a \ntwo-bedroom apartment. It is even worse in a number of other cities \nwhere you need to work 135 hours a week or earn the equivalent of \n$17.42 hourly, more than three times the minimum wage, in order to \nafford to put a roof over your head. Massachusetts is not alone. \nVirginia, Maine, Maryland, Montana, New Hampshire, and other States \nare feeling the economic crunch of the housing shortage and the impact \non families as a consequence of that.\n\n  We also talk a lot around here about making work pay. The fact is, if \npeople go to work and work according to all the rules but they have a \nwork-week of 135 hours, or 100 hours, at a wage of $17, which is three \ntimes the minimum wage, we are obviously creating a gap that breaks \nfaith with the capacity of the Government to provide value for that \nwork. I think that is a serious issue.\n  In addition, let me point out, this is not an enormous request. I ask \nmy colleagues to look at this chart. In 1978, we were putting out \n350,000 housing units a year; in 1979, close to 350,000; in 1980, \n200,000; 1981, about 200,000; and from 1981 through the entire 1980s we \nwent through a dramatic drop in housing, and in 1984, with the passage \nof the Balanced Budget Act, we went through the most dramatic decrease \nin housing, and we have had zero increase in housing starts until last \nyear when, thanks to the good efforts of the chairman of the committee \nand ranking member and others working on it, we were able to get the \nfirst year's increase in 50,000 initial, new vouchers for section 8 \nhousing.\n  But that only tells one part of the story. My colleagues in the \nSenate--and I share this belief--understand we have a lot of budget \nproblems. But we ought to be treating things fairly. Every time we have \na crisis in the Senate, in the budget, whether it is a hurricane, \nwhether it is a farm problem, whether it is some other issue of \nGovernment, where we need to find funding for some project, the piggy \nbank is housing. What we have seen over the last years is what I call \nthe ``Great HUD-Way Robbery.''\n  From 1995 until 1999, we have seen a year-by-year cut, or rescission, \nor diversion from housing. So it is not that housing was not originally \non people's minds. It was not that we did not have an original sense \nthat housing ought to be part of the budget process. But every time \nsomebody wants to fund something else, they take it out of housing's \nhide.\n  The fact is, in 1995 we had $6.462 billion of rescissions; the next \nyear, $114 million; the next year $3.8 billion; $3.03 billion the next \nyear; $2 billion the next year. So we have had rescissions of $15.41 \nbillion. We have had program cuts of $4.8 billion. So housing has lost \n$20 billion-plus in the course of the last years.\n  It is absolutely imperative that housing receive its fair share \nwithin this budget. In the final analysis, it is as critical a \ncomponent of the social fabric and the social security of this country \nas almost anything else we do. We need to make work valuable. We need \nto ensure our citizens understand, if they play by the rules, it pays \noff. It is most important for our children and for a generation that \nare shunted from place to place, or separated from their parents, or \ntaken from school to school to school. This is one of the things that \ncontributes to juvenile violence, to the problems we have in our \ncities, people feeling disconnected--not just in the cities, also in \nrural communities--and I hope we will change it.\n  I look to our colleagues on the committee, who I know are committed \nto trying to do something, to hopefully share with us this sense that, \neven though in the conference ultimately there will be a negotiation--\nwe all know that; ultimately there is going to be a showdown on what \nthe final numbers are going to be--to guarantee, when that showdown \ncomes, housing is not again going to be the piggy bank for everything \nelse; it will be a priority at the forefront of our efforts and we will \nbe able to continue the good work the chairman, I know, cares about, \nand the ranking member is equally committed about, that they began last \nyear where they began to increase funds for housing.\n  Again, this is not a problem of their choice or their making. I know \nthey share a belief this ought to be different. They were given the \ntoughest budget figures of anybody in the Senate. That is why this is \none of the last appropriations bills to be able to come to the floor. \nEveryone knows it only came to the floor by robbing Peter to pay Paul, \nby taking money from education and from the labor account in order to \neven make this possible. I hope we are going to change that trend in \nthe next weeks. We certainly have that opportunity. I also believe we \nhave that obligation and responsibility.\n  I know a couple of others of my colleagues wanted to say a few words.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, I thank the Senator from \nMassachusetts for his eloquent leadership and his determination to keep \nthis issue of affordable housing in front of us. We have 5 million \nAmerican households that have either inadequate or unaffordable \nhousing. We have 2 million of those families with children, and 1 \nmillion of them are seniors.\n  Each one of our communities is faced with this kind of a shortfall. \nWe have a waiting list of over 1 million people for the vouchers, and \nthis amendment will add a few.\n  There are three realities about which we are talking. One is a \nreality out on the street. That is the reality which millions of \nfamilies face that do not have affordable housing or adequate housing. \nWe have a budget reality which is driven by allocations through our \nappropriations subcommittees. This subcommittee has labored mightily to \nsee what it could do with a very inadequate--totally inadequate--\nallocation. It has done an amazingly good job in fighting for at least \na reasonably adequate number.\n  I commend the chairman and the ranking member of this subcommittee \nfor what they have done, for the fight they have waged. It has been a \nlong fight, and I know it has been a hard fight. They were shorted \nseverely at the beginning and less severely now.\n\n[[Page S11386]]\n\n Nonetheless, they have been shorted, and that means America has been \nshorted.\n  The third reality is the conference, and that is the reality to which \nthe Senator from Massachusetts made reference in closing. In supporting \nhis effort to add back half of the vouchers which were requested by the \nadministration for section 8, I can only add my voice, far less \neloquently than his, to the hope that our chairman and our ranking \nmember in conference will strive to find a way to do some justice for \nsection 8 housing this year. Again, I thank him and thank both of our \nfloor managers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the comments that \nhave been made about the need for affordable housing. Unfortunately, \nthis problem is bigger than just section 8. Section 8 is a real \nproblem, as I outlined several days ago.\n  To repeat, we used to have multiyear section 8 contracts, 10-, 15-\nyear section 8 contracts. That allowed landlords to obtain financing to \nbuild housing.\n  In the last 10 years, we have gone from 10-, 15-year contracts down \nto 2-year and 1-year budget authority appropriations. In order to save \nmoney in the overall spending caps in budget authority, they shortened \nthe contracts. That means, No. 1, as these contracts expire, we are \nspending over $20 billion a year in outlays on section 8 contracts. \nThose outlays are in the budget. But the budget authority needed rises \nevery year, from $3.6 billion in 1997 to $8.2 billion in 1998 to $11.1 \nbillion in 1999, and the need is $12.8 billion for fiscal year 2000. \nThat number goes up to $18.2 billion by the year 2004. Unfortunately, \nthat is how we budget around here, on how much budget authority you \nrequest.\n  The problem we have with the administration seeking additional \nsection 8s is that in their recommendations, their OMB budget request, \nthey say they are going to appropriate $11.3 billion for the next 10 \nyears. As those needs for more appropriations continue to rise, we will \nwind up kicking 1.3 million families out the back door.\n  First, let's make clear, we are not going to let that happen. We have \nto protect those who are actually in publicly assisted housing. We have \nto scrape, we have to do everything we can to find the funds to do so.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts mentioned the 50,000 additional \nvouchers the administration sought. Two things: I was promised by the \nSecretary of HUD the budget submission this year will account for those \nadditional 50,000 vouchers, which we will accept into the stock, and we \nare renewing all the vouchers that are coming due. Unfortunately, \ninstead of making provision in the budget for the additional 50,000, \nthe administration proposed, and we have had to accept, a deferral on \nan advanced appropriation of $4.2 billion. In other words, we were $4.2 \nbillion short of the budget authority needed to continue all of the \nsection 8 certificates expiring this year. This means we rolled over \ninto 2001 $4.2 billion. So we are falling way behind in the budget \nauthority and being able to maintain the section 8 certificates we have \nnow.\n  In addition, we have heard people say: The need is now for section 8 \ncertificates. None of the 50,000 vouchers we approved last fall have \nbeen used. None. Zero. Zip. Nada. None of them have been used. The \nadministration has not gotten them out. We have discussed this problem, \nbut they have not gotten them out. We are trying to renew vouchers that \nhave not been used this year. We cannot use money that was not used \nthis year to add new vouchers next year when we have already included \nprovisions for the vouchers that we authorized last year and they have \nnot been used.\n  Probably the most important thing--and this is the point on which we \nreally are going to have to get to work--is that a 1-year section 8 \nvoucher does not create a house. It does not create an apartment. It \ndoes not create a condominium. Nobody can finance the construction of \nhousing on the promise of a 1-year section 8 voucher.\n  Right now in St. Louis County, for every 100 vouchers they issue, \nonly 50 of them are used because there are no places physically to \nhouse the people who need housing. That is why we put money into HOME, \ninto CDBG, to increase the stock of housing. That is why we have the \nlow-income housing credits. That is why we have section 202 which does \nbuild housing for the elderly.\n  We are not suffering a lack of housing because of a lack of section 8 \ncertificates. We are suffering a lack of housing because in many areas \nthey just have not been built.\n  We will work with people on both sides of the aisle to create housing \nthat is needed, to give somebody a certificate. That certificate does \nnot keep the rain off them; it does not keep them warm in the winter. \nThey have to have shelter. Merely giving them a section 8 voucher does \nnot create a shelter when there is no shelter available. It will enable \nthem to pay the rent if there is one available, but in too many areas \nthere is not.\n  This is a subject for much discussion later on. I look forward to \nworking with the Senator from Massachusetts and the others who have \ntalked about it. This is not a section 8 problem. We have our own \nsection 8 problems with the budget authority needed. The real problem \nis providing housing.\n  I commend groups such as Enterprise and LIST. I commend local units. \nI commend people who are working under the low-income housing tax \ncredit, housing authorities across the Nation such as the Missouri \nHousing Development Commission, and Habitat for Humanity. They are the \nones who are providing shelter. These are the places we have to look in \nmany areas for a house.\n  I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his insights on this \nmeasure. Unfortunately, we are in a budgetary situation where we cannot \nprovide additional section 8 certificates in this current budget.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I rise in strong support \nof Senator Kerry's amendment. Also, I recognize the very thoughtful \nanalysis that Chairman Bond has done about the budget problems that \nface this committee as it struggles to fill many different needs in the \narea of housing.\n  All this discussion underscores a very fundamental question that \ntranscends all of our considerations in the Senate and that is, we have \nmany unfulfilled obligations in the country which make us very wary of \nsignificant reductions in our revenues and significant changes in \npolicy until we address these very fundamental concerns: How would we \nprovide going forward with resources so every American can have a safe, \ndecent, affordable home?\n\n  I also agree with Senator Bond that we have to do a lot more in terms \nof construction policies, in terms of encouraging the creation of \nhousing units. But the section 8 program is particularly critical to so \nmany people throughout this country.\n  I think it is also very important to note that this is one of those \nvery significant and very efficient combinations of public purpose and \nprivate enterprise because we are not, in most cases, operating at \npublic facilities these housing units. They are private housing units \nwhich are receiving, through the section 8 subsidies, supports which \nare available to low-income people--again, a very efficient, very \neffective way to use very scarce Federal resources to allow individual \nAmericans access to safe and decent housing.\n  I think we have to, in this situation--even recognizing the \nsignificant budgetary constraints--move forward because this is one of \nthose situations where if we make the commitment we will find a way to \nfund it.\n  I think the essence of Senator Kerry's amendment is: Let's make this \ncommitment. Let's make this commitment this year again to expand the \nsection 8 voucher program so we can offer the real possibility of safe, \ndecent, affordable housing to more citizens of this country.\n  I, too, agree with Senator Bond's analysis, which I have been \nlistening to intently over the last several days, about the need to go \ndeeper with our targeting for the low-income housing tax credit \nprogram, to support the HOME program, to support the CDBG program. All \nof these contribute to the housing market, to the availability of\n\n[[Page S11387]]\n\nadequate, decent housing for all of our citizens. All of them will \ncontribute to the solution of the dilemma facing us all: How do we \nprovide affordable, decent, safe housing for all of our citizens?\n  I support very strongly Senator Kerry's amendment and commend him for \ndoing this. I also commend, as I have said before, both Senators Bond \nand Mikulski for their great efforts to try to work through this very \ndifficult thicket.\n  Let me, before I conclude, also raise another topic which I have \naddressed previously on the floor; that is, the staffing level within \nthe Department of HUD, but in particular the HUD Community Builders \nFellowship. I must confess I did not know too much about this \nparticular program until we began this debate. But it has come to my \nknowledge this is an innovative program which is essentially selecting \nthrough some very rigorous means professionals in the area of urban \npolicy planning, housing policy, to spend 2 years as a fellow at the \nDepartment of HUD after training at the Harvard Kennedy School of \nGovernment, to try to create an entrepreneurial spirit in HUD, to go \nbeyond the box to create new opportunities in housing. Then these \nindividuals, having served their fellowship, have the opportunity to go \nback to their communities and take these skills, this training, and \ntheir expertise and again contribute to their communities.\n  I think it is a worthwhile program. But I am prompted to speak not so \nmuch because of what I have heard on this floor but because of what I \nam hearing back in Rhode Island as a result of the success of this \nprogram. Stephen O'Rourke is the executive director of the Providence \nHousing Authority. He is a tough-minded administrator who stepped into \na difficult situation decades ago in a housing authority that was \ncrumbling, both physically and in terms of its management style, a \nhousing authority that was beset with all the problems of urban \ncities--crime, drug use, violence, dilapidated units--and he has done a \nremarkable job. He has done it by being hard-nosed, aggressive. I \nsuspect people would probably characterize his approach as ``tough \nlove.'' And it has worked.\n\n  He has seen every fad and fancy in housing in the last two decades. \nHe has taken it upon himself to communicate with the regional HUD \noffice, commending the Community Builders Fellowship Program. In fact, \nin his words:\n\n       I find their enthusiasm and ``can-do'' attitude infectious. \n     They constitute a new, special breed of government workers.\n\n  When I start hearing about that kind of performance from a local \nofficial, I think there is something here we cannot discard totally.\n  In Rhode Island, this program is working to do things that people \nhave wanted to do for years. But they have never been able to think \noutside the box or cross the bureaucratic lines of organization to get \nthe job done. These fellows are doing that. They started a statewide \nownership center so we can do what I think we all want to see--get \npeople into their own homes.\n  They are working with the Welfare-to-Work Program to develop an \ninnovative program where a housing authority is sponsoring a \nmicrobusiness, a van service, that not only employs individuals but \ncontributes to one of the most significant issues facing people making \nthe transfer from welfare to work--how do you physically get to work? \nThis van service helps that.\n  These are the types of out-of-the-box, innovative, entrepreneurial \nsolutions we should encourage and not discourage. There have been \nseveral preliminary assessments of the program.\n  Anderson Consulting company has looked at the program and has \nconcluded that it has a positive effect on the ability of HUD customers \nto conduct their business and get the job done. Ernst & Young has \ninterviewed many people involved in this program. They, too, are \nconvinced. These are their words:\n\n       They consider Community Builders to be responsive to their \n     concerns and timely in addressing them.\n\n  Finally, the individuals at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government \nwho were training these professionals believe the program is \nworthwhile. So I think at this juncture, after barely a year of \nexperience, to totally eliminate the program is the wrong approach.\n  The other aspect we should know is that HUD has already seen \nsignificant reductions in its personnel rolls from 13,000 to 9,300. In \nfact, both GAO and the HUD IG are arguing that perhaps they have \nreached the limits of cuts that can be made reasonably. There is no way \nwe can demand a new reformed, reinvigorated, entrepreneurial HUD if \nthey do not have physically the men and women to hold the jobs and to \ndo the jobs. If this program is eliminated totally, as proposed in this \nappropriation, 81 communities throughout the country will be affected, \nincluding Providence, RI, and others. In fact, for the sheer lack of \npersonnel, many significant functions of HUD will be lost if this \nprogram is abandoned. If we are asking HUD to be more efficient, more \neffective, more customer conscious, I do not think at this juncture we \nshould eliminate a program that shows promise.\n  There also has been a suggestion on the floor that there are some \ninternal criticisms. There was reference, I think, to the Commissioner \nof the Federal Housing Administration, of Mr. Apgar's criticism. He, in \nfact, indicates there is potential for this program.\n  At this juncture, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a letter from Mr. Apgar.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                U.S. Department of\n\n\n                                Housing and Urban Development,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 21, 1999.\n     Hon. Christopher Bond,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: I understand that in the Senate \n     Appropriations Committee discussion on the FY2000 HUD/VA \n     Appropriations Act, you attempted to discredit HUD's \n     Community Builder initiative by referencing a memo dated \n     September 2 and signed by me. By taking this routine internal \n     communication out of context, you presented a distorted \n     picture of my views on the critical role Community Builders \n     play in helping the HUD's Office of Housing manage its \n     programs.\n       I would like to take this opportunity to set the record \n     straight. My views on this topic are informed both by my \n     experience as the Federal Housing Commissioner, as well as by \n     two decades of research and teaching on housing and community \n     development issues at Harvard's Joint Center for Housing \n     Studies and Kennedy School of Government. Based on this \n     experience, I truly believe that your efforts to ``fire'' \n     some 400 Community Builders will significantly harm HUD's \n     ability to accomplish its mission and protect the public \n     trust. Initially, over 20 offices could be forced to close as \n     they would not have adequate staff to function. To close \n     these offices would be disastrous. In particular, the loss of \n     400 HUD employees could cripple HUD's ability to dispose of \n     HUD held assets (Real Estate Owned Properties) in a cost \n     effective manner and seriously undermine the financial \n     integrity of the FHA fund.\n       The Community Builder initiative is an innovative effort to \n     clarify the roles and responsibilities of HUD staff. Leading \n     management experts frequently write and speak about the \n     dysfunction that results from requiring employees to assume \n     dual roles--at times offering assistance, facilitating and \n     problem solving, and at other times performing oversight and \n     enforcing compliance. Through a series of public forums on \n     the future of the Federal Housing Administration that I led \n     in 1994, I gained extensive first hand knowledge about the \n     adverse consequences of the Department's historical failure \n     to separate the service and compliance functions.\n       Even before joining the HUD team, I applauded Secretary \n     Cuomo's plan to identify two distinct groups of HUD \n     employees. ``Public Trust Officers,'' with responsibility for \n     ensuring compliance with program rules and requirements and \n     protecting against waste, fraud and abuse; and ``Community \n     Builders,'' who function out in the communities as the \n     Department's ``front door'' and access point to HUD's array \n     of program resources and services. While working at HUD, I \n     have watched the Secretary's vision become a powerful reality \n     as each day Community Builders serve HUD, and FHA, taxpayers \n     and low- and moderate-income families and communities.\n       I appreciate that you and many of your Senate colleagues \n     are concerned about the effective and fiscally responsible \n     operation of FHA and HUD. I am therefore hard pressed to \n     understand how the Subcommittee's effort to terminate 400 \n     essential HUD employees will help. Community Builders are \n     vital to the success of FHA's homeownership and rental \n     housing initiatives. Community Builders have primary \n     responsibility for all marketing activities including \n     ensuring that FHA's single-family programs effectively serve \n     minority and other underserved communities. They work with \n     community based organizations to implement the new \n     Congressionally mandated single-family property disposition \n     initiative. They also work with state and local agencies to \n     expand\n\n[[Page S11388]]\n\n     availability of services for HUD's elderly and family \n     developments. These are just a few of the ways that Community \n     Builders assist the Office of Housing in meeting the needs of \n     low- and moderate-income families and communities.\n       Community Builders play a particularly important role in \n     HUD's effort to manage and dispose of distressed multifamily \n     properties. The September 2 memo reflects HUD's ongoing \n     commitment to manage these disposition efforts in a way that \n     both empowers communities and preserves the public trust. \n     Property disposition must be a team effort involving \n     Community Builders working in cooperation with the \n     Department's Enforcement Center, Property Disposition \n     Centers, and Office of Multifamily Housing. As indicated in \n     the memo, Edward Kraus, Director of the Enforcement Center, \n     Mary Madden, Assistant Deputy Secretary for Field Policy and \n     Management and myself constantly monitor the work effort of \n     both Community Builders and Public Trust Officers to insure \n     that each HUD employee knows his or her role and \n     responsibility, and that through effective communication \n     these employees operate as a team.\n       The Community Builders play an essential role in property \n     disposition efforts. While all monitoring, compliance, and \n     enforcement decisions must be made by Public Trust Officers, \n     Community Builders serve as HUD's ``EYES AND EARS'' in the \n     neighborhood, providing important early information about HUD \n     insured and HUD subsidized properties obtained from their \n     ongoing meetings with tenant and community-based \n     organizations and state and local officials. Clearly, \n     effective early communication with all interested parties is \n     essential for the fair and quick resolution of issues \n     associated with troubled properties, and if need be the cost-\n     effective disposition of assets through foreclosure and sale.\n       In closing, I ask you to stop this wrong headed effort to \n     fire 400 HUD employees. As you know, the management of HUD's \n     portfolio of troubled properties has long been a source of \n     material weakness in our operations. The loss of 400 front \n     line workers, combined with the Subcommittee's equally \n     questionable decision to cut back funding for Departmental \n     salaries and expenses, could very well cripple HUD's capacity \n     to manage these troubled assets. Rather than continue to use \n     the memo of September 2 to present a distorted picture of the \n     Community Builder program, I trust that you will share this \n     letter with your Senate colleagues so that they will have a \n     fair and accurate accounting of my own views on this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 William C. Apgar,\n                 Assistant Secretary for Housing--Federal Housing \n                                                     Commissioner.\n\n  Mr. REED. Again, this is an example of a program that has great \npotential. I think it would be unfortunate to eliminate it in its first \nyear of operation. Let us step back objectively and review it, look at \nit, and make a judgment. I think that judgment, based on what I am \nhearing from my home State of Rhode Island, would be a very favorable \none. So I urge reconsideration of this program to go forward.\n  Again, I thank Senator Kerry for his leadership on this issue of \nSection 8. I recognize the difficulty both Senators Bond and Mikulski \nface, but this might be an issue, when it comes to section 8--\nparticularly if we move forward boldly to serve the people who sent us \nhere--we will find the means to do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. I will take a quick minute. Other colleagues are waiting.\n  I thank the Senator from Rhode Island very much. He is a valuable and \nvery thoughtful member of our committee; and clearly representing Rhode \nIsland, he understands the pressures people are under in this respect. \nI thank him also for raising the issue of community builders and \nputting the letter from Secretary Apgar in the Record.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a memorandum from Ernst & Young, which \ndiscusses the Community Builder Program, and a letter from Harvard \nUniversity regarding the training process for the community builders be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            Ernst & Young LLP,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     To: Douglas Kantor, HUD.\n     From: Ernst & Young LLP,\n     Date: September 21, 1999.\n\n\n               ``Analysis of Community Builder Program''\n\n                               background\n\n       Ernst & Young is providing this memorandum as an interim \n     status update of our Analysis of the Community Builder \n     Program engagement.\n       We are finalizing our procedures and drafting our report on \n     the effectiveness of the Department of Housing and Urban \n     Development's Community Builder Program. Based on the case \n     studies reviewed and the interviews conducted to date, \n     Community Builders have been successful in facilitating \n     positive communication between HUD and the communities they \n     serve. Participants interviewed indicated that Community \n     Builders are effectively serving as the ``front door'' of \n     HUD, as envisioned in the Department's 2020 Management Reform \n     Plan.\n       Our work to date has included:\n       Review of a sample of 25 case studies provided by HUD \n     covering a cross section of programs and each HUD region;\n       Research regarding the history, design and purposes of the \n     Community Builder program;\n       Interviews of Harvard University Kennedy School of \n     Government personnel; and\n       Interviews of over 50 HUD customers and stakehoders listed \n     in the case studies with knowledge of the selected cases. The \n     interviewees included Housing Authorities, Civic Leaders, \n     other Federal, state and local government personnel and \n     others.\n\n\n                         interviewee responses\n\n       Interviewees generally provided very positive feedback \n     regarding the work of the Community Builders. They consider \n     Community Builders to be responsible to their concerns and \n     timely in addressing them. A number of interviewees indicated \n     that:\n       The Community Builders have been very effective in bringing \n     their private sector expertise to the public sector.\n       The Community Builders have been proactive in identifying \n     opportunities and areas of need within their communities.\n       The Community Builders are acting as a point of contact \n     which makes HUD seem much more accessible to interviewees.\n       The Community Builders are very knowledgeable about HUD \n     programs and non-HUD programs alike.\n       The Community Builders are efficient. They are able to \n     provide information on several programs rather than the \n     client having to contact numerous departments.\n       The Community Builders are professionally competent and are \n     well respected figures in their communities.\n       The Community Builders are a ``New Face'' for HUD. Several \n     respondents commented that their perception of HUD is much \n     improved due to their interactions with the Community \n     Builders.\n       In fact, one interviewee indicated the Community Builder \n     program was the most innovative program he has seen in his \n     twenty (20) years of government service.\n\n\n                          Working Partnerships\n\n       The case studies indicate that Community Builders have \n     performed outreach to a diverse group of community partners \n     including private businesses, not-for-profits, health \n     organizations, Federal agencies, resident groups, religious \n     organizations, universities, investment banks, local \n     government entities, and Housing Authorities. According to \n     the case studies and the interviews, successful partnerships \n     have been developed to date with a number of groups \n     including:\n         National Housing Ministries,\n         Non-Profit Center of Milwaukee,\n         Cleveland Browns football team,\n         Federal Reserve Bank of Los Angeles,\n         Cherokee Nation Housing Authority,\n         AIDS Task Force,\n         Hawaii Governor's Office of State Volunteers,\n         Credit Counseling Center, Inc.,\n         Capitol Region Council of Churches,\n         Temple University,\n         University of Pennsylvania,\n         Harrison Plaza Resident Council,\n         Northwest Opportunities Vocational Technical Academy,\n         Council of Churches of Bridgeport, CT,\n         Valley Catholic Charities,\n         FEMA.\n\n\n         customer and stakeholder concerns and recommendations\n\n       When asked, most of the interviewees did not express \n     concerns or provide recommendations regarding the Community \n     Builders. Some interviewees who did respond in this area \n     provided comments such as additional clarification is needed \n     regarding the roles and responsibilities of the Community \n     Builder as well as Community Builders should have better \n     familiarity with the community they serve. In addition some \n     interviewees indicated that some individual Community \n     Builders had not yet been in place long enough to see all of \n     their projects to completion. There were some differences of \n     opinion among customers and stakeholders. For example, some \n     customers thought that Community Builders should receive more \n     of the Department's resources while others did not want \n     resources diverted away from enforcement activities.\n\n\n                                summary\n\n       Almost all of the interviewees told us that the Community \n     Builder Program positively changed their perception of HUD. \n     Please note that this is an interim status report. We will \n     give you a final report on this project shortly after we \n     complete our procedures and finish summarizing the results.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                           Harvard University,\n\n                                Cambridge, MA, September 22, 1999.\n     Christopher Feeney,\n     Ernst and Young.\n       Dear Christopher. I'm writing to follow up your inquiry and \n     our discussion about the Community Builders program of the US \n     Department of Housing and Urban Development. I currently \n     serve as the school's director and dean for executive \n     education, though\n\n[[Page S11389]]\n\n     I should stress that the thoughts herein are my own.\n       Executive education is an important element in the Kennedy \n     School's mission to train people to play leadership roles in \n     their organizations, communities and in the larger society. \n     In this capacity, we conduct dozens of executive education \n     programs for public officials from the US and abroad. We have \n     developed a three-week program (taught in two modules, of two \n     and one week respectively) on community building, strategic \n     management and leadership, which has been elected by the \n     newly appointed Community Builders from inside and outside \n     HUD. Over the past year and a half more than four hundred \n     community builders have participated in the program. This \n     involvement provides a vantage point to offer some \n     observations about the program.\n\n\n                         purpose and conception\n\n       The need for and potential value of the program arises from \n     several observations.\n       First, the federal government, through the vehicle of the \n     Department of Housing and Development (HUD) has significant \n     potential to add real value to the development process in \n     America's communities and neighborhoods. HUD can draw upon a \n     wide range of resources, including its knowledge and \n     comparative perspective, research, its convening and \n     coordination capacity as well as its legal and financial \n     resources.\n       Second, I doubt that anyone would argue that HUD is as \n     effective as it could be in bringing value to the process. \n     Its program and activities have been historically organized \n     and delivered through a number of specific programmatic and \n     regulatory channels, stove pipers, in effect, each with its \n     own discrete organizational structure, personnel, procedures, \n     and norms, From the standpoint of community leaders, this \n     often appeared as a bewildering array of possible channels \n     and activities, no doubt at times it has seemed that HUD's \n     left hand and right hand (and feet) were pointing in \n     different directions.\n       Third, like many other federal agencies, HUD has been \n     buffeted by the erosion in trust and confidence in \n     government, has seen its budget and personnel levels cut, in \n     some areas sharply, and the morale and commitment of HUD's \n     career staff has certainly suffered.\n       Against this background, the concept of the community \n     builders program, bringing in a mix of experienced HUD staff \n     and diverse professionals from outside HUD; charging them to \n     bring new energy and vitality to HUD's activities, to help \n     communities around the country develop strategies that draw \n     together resources from the complex array of federal \n     programs, to bridge the various stovepipes on behalf of \n     community needs and priorities, this makes a good deal of \n     sense.\n       It is also predictable, as night follows day, that an \n     initiative such as this, bringing several hundred new HUD \n     officials into the field, charged up and inspired as they \n     have been, is bound to generate friction, misunderstandings, \n     and ill will in some locations, as the newly authorized \n     community builders encounter the existing HUD establishment.\n       This surely has happened in a number of locations, and is a \n     function of how well HUD's staff has prepared the ground for \n     the community builders arrival, and the personalities, \n     temperament and professionalism of the HUD staff both new and \n     of longstanding (including, of course, the community \n     builders). Anecdotal reporting suggests a wide range of \n     experiences--both positive and negative--for the community \n     builders and existing HUD staff.\n\n\n                         Evaluating the Program\n\n       It is much too early to assess or properly evaluate the \n     program. Some community builders have only recently taken up \n     positions. Those of longest standing have been in their \n     assignments less than one year of their two year contract. \n     This is very much the shakedown and learning period for a \n     venture such as this.\n       To do a reasonable evaluation, one would ideally wait until \n     well into the second year of the initial cohort, then direct \n     an assessment to key officials in local communities where the \n     community builders are working, to the community builders \n     themselves and to other HUD professionals, both in the field \n     and headquarters.\n       One would look at whether and how communities had been able \n     to concert resources from HUD (and elsewhere), bridging \n     stovepipes and boundaries and taking full advantage of public \n     and private resources. If a number of communities were able \n     to cite such successes (as departures from past practice), \n     and the community builders and demonstrably involved, there \n     is a pretty good indication that the program is having the \n     desired effect. But, it is just too early to expect such as \n     accounting or to find this kind of evidence.\n\n\n                         Teaching and Learning\n\n       We have had the experience of working with several hundred \n     community builders--both from within HUD and those hired from \n     outside, over the past year or so. In our classrooms, they \n     have shown themselves to be serious, committed, bright, and \n     thoroughly professional. They work hard, are open to learning \n     and are well regarded by the faculty who teach them. It is my \n     impression that their performance compares favorably with \n     other groups of officials we teach in programs here and in \n     government agencies at federal, state and local level.\n       Overall, the program holds considerable promise (not fully \n     realized as it is still early) to make a distinctive \n     contribution to community development in the US, helping \n     local communities advance their development goals and \n     contributing to more effective partnership between the \n     federal government and those at the local level.\n       If I can answer any further questions, I'm happy to do so.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Peter Zimmerman.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. With respect to the community builders--and I think the \nSenator from Rhode Island summarized it; I will not repeat that--I have \nheard from many people in Massachusetts concerned about the cut. Many \nof them have had very positive experiences with the community builders.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters supporting the Community \nBuilders Program from the mayor of Boston, Mayor Menino; from the mayor \nof Springfield, Mayor Albano; from the Boston Police Department; and \nfrom the Veterans Department be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       State of Massachusetts,\n\n                               City of Boston, September 17, 1999.\n     Ms. Mary Lou K. Crane,\n     Regional Director,\n     U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Boston, MA.\n       Dear Mary Lou: I appreciate your discussion with me \n     concerning the Community Builders Fellowship program which \n     Secretary Cuomo has initiated, and I am very pleased to see \n     the degree to which Community Builders in the Boston HUD \n     Office have been involved with the City. I also like the fact \n     that you have assigned several different people to work with \n     us.\n       Certainly Community Builder Juan Evereteze has brought much \n     knowledge and enthusiasm to his liaison work with our massive \n     Disposition Demonstration program. In that same vein, it has \n     been quite helpful to have Community Builder HOPE VI \n     Specialist Abbey Ogunbola assisting the Boston Housing \n     Authority on the complicated Orchard Park development.\n       One of my special initiatives has been the after-school \n     program know as From 2 to 6, and Bonnie Peak-Graham has been \n     a dynamic addition to our team for that program.\n       I would be remiss if I did not mention the substantive \n     contributions Deborah Griswold makes in her role representing \n     you as liaison to our Empowerment Zone. She has been very \n     skillful in helping our folks craft their governance \n     structures.\n       It is great having so many talented Federal partners \n     working with my professional team. I know you have always \n     been available to help us, but I also know that you have \n     competing demands for your time. Having the Community \n     Builders here has been very useful. Thank you for your \n     careful attention to our myriad issues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Thomas M.

Crane\n     HUD Secretary's Representative for New England, Boston, MA\n       Dear Secretary Crane: It has come to my attention that \n     Senator Kerry has asked Secretary Cuomo to provide some \n     objective analysis of the added value which the new Community \n     Builders are bringing to HUD's relationship with its many \n     partners. I would like to comment on the significant \n     contributions I believe this gentleman assigned to \n     Springfield, MA, Jim Wenner, has made.\n       While I know that I have but to call you office whenever I \n     have a question, it is very helpful to have a generalist with \n     the skills and experience of Jim Wenner basically ``on call'' \n     to our great city whenever we need him. Mr. Wenner has made a \n     substantive difference in so many of the pending issues we \n     must deal with on a daily basis. My Housing Department has \n     praised his involvement in the Lower Liberty Heights \n     neighborhood as we continue our work to bring back that area \n     of Springfield. Jim has worked with the Board of Director's \n     of a low-income cooperative housing development assisting in \n     building their management capacity. In addition, Jim was \n     quite helpful to Herberto Flores, Executive Director of \n     Brightwood Development, Inc., on major foreclosure issue.\n       I can't tell you how pleased I am to learn that we have \n     been selected to be a pilot city for the Asset Management \n     Pilot Program which your property disposition team is \n     launching. I know that Mr. Wenner's representation to tackle \n     difficult projects was persuasive in your selection.\n       As Mayor of a city located a distance from Boston, we \n     frequently complain that we never see our Federal and State \n     partners. I can no longer say that now that we have a \n     Community Builder. Jim Wenner has brought our partnership \n     with HUD to a very professional and responsive level and I \n     want to be sure you know how appreciative I am.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Michael J. Albano,\n                                                            Mayor.\n\n[[Page S11390]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                      Boston Municipal Police,\n\n                                    Dorchester, MA, March 2, 1999.\n     Ms. Deborah Griswold,\n     Community Builders,\n     U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Boston, MA.\n       Dear Ms. Griswold: I was very impressed with your \n     presentation of the ``Community Builders'' program at the \n     Ramsay Park Coalition last week, and I was wondering if you \n     would be available on March 9, 1999 to speak to the Grant \n     Manor/Camfield Gardens/Roxse Homes and Lenox Camden Safety \n     Task Force. The Task Force was established to coordinate \n     safety and security for the H.U.D./M.H.F.A. Demonstration \n     Disposition Program, and I feel many of the initiatives of \n     the Community Builders Program would be an invaluable \n     resource for the various tenant associations.\n       The Safety Task Force meeting will be held at the Lenox \n     Camden Residents Association Office at 515 Shawmurt Ave. \n     Also, if possible, could you send me a copy of your booklet \n     ``Boston Connects''.\n       Thank you for your cooperation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Robert Francis,\n     Deputy Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               Department of Veterans Affairs,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 27, 1998.\n     Mr. Ron Armstead,\n     U.S. Department of Housing & Urban Development, Boston, MA.\n       Dear Mr. Armstead: Thank you for your help in putting \n     together and executing the Center for Minority Veterans most \n     successful training conference to date.\n       Over 150 Minority Veterans Program Coordinators (MVPC) \n     participated in this year's conference. Initial feedback \n     indicates that conference goals were overwhelmingly \n     accomplished. Participants walked away better prepared to \n     build effective minority veterans programs at their local \n     facilities. They have a more comprehensive understanding of \n     VA benefits and programs, as well as ways to promote the use \n     of these services.\n       This success was achieved through the collaborative efforts \n     of everyone involved. Again, thanks for your role in making \n     this a great event.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Willie L. Hensley,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to express my support for \nmore section 8 housing vouchers to help local housing agencies meet \nlocal housing needs. Although many Americans have benefited \ntremendously from the current economy, many others have not shared in \nthat wealth. In my state, housing costs in communities like Santa Fe \nand Albuquerque have risen faster than the incomes of low- and middle-\nincome workers.\n  Many working families can no longer afford housing in the cities \nwhere they work, and many are forced to commute long distances just to \nstay employed. Section 8 vouchers fulfill a very great need in the \ncommunities where entry level housing costs are seven to eight times \nthe annual income of its residents.\n  The need for vouchers in New Mexico far exceeds the number of \nvouchers currently available. The waiting list for section 8 vouchers \nis 14 months in New Mexico. The waiting time is even higher in places \nlike Albuquerque and Santa Fe. Mr. President, the elderly, disabled and \nworking families with children cannot wait 2 years to get into decent, \naffordable housing. Those on the waiting list do not have many \nalternatives in New Mexico as the waiting time to get into public \nhousing is 9 months. Voucher recipients are not asking for free \nhousing, they are asking for assistance in obtaining one of the most \nbasic needs we have--shelter.\n  Although Congress authorized 100,000 new vouchers for fiscal year \n2000, this bill failed to fund those new vouchers. Mr. President, I \nhope we can pass an amendment today that will adequately address the \nhousing needs of our working families, disabled, and elderly.\n  Mr. KERRY. A final, quick comment. I couldn't agree more with what \nthe Senator from Missouri, the chairman, said about the problems of the \nbudget. What we are asking today is, when we go into the final \nnegotiations and the numbers that are being fought over as to what the \nallocations really will be, when we have an opportunity to perhaps make \ngood on certain efforts, that this program, this effort of housing, \nwill be at the forefront of those priorities. We understand the \nlimitations of the current allocation, but most people are assuming we \nhave an opportunity to change that.\n  Secondly, the Senator from Missouri is correct about the problem of \nbuilding housing, but that will never resolve the current problem of \nlow-income working families who are simply out of reach of affordable \nhousing. I think everybody understands that section 8 and other \naffordable housing efforts within HUD are the key measures that try to \nlift people up when they play by the rules, go to work, do their best \nto try to get ahead, but simply can't afford to put one half of their \nentire earned income into rent, therefore, at the expense often of \nhealth care, of food, of adequate clothing, and of the other essentials \nof life. I think that is really what we are talking about. Even in the \nbest of circumstances, if we start building housing today, there will \nstill be millions of American families in that worst-case situation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise before you today in support of \nincreased funding for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment. Specifically, two programs--housing vouchers for low-\nincome families and the Community Builders program--of interest to both \nDelaware and the nation, need additional funding that is not in this \nbill. I hope that my comments will be helpful to my colleagues when we \neventually head into conference on this bill.\n  Before I speak, I wish to commend the managers of this bill. \nCompeting demands and good programs are a recipe for tough choices. \nThese managers have done an excellent job in moving this bill along \nsmoothly and effectively and with a spirit of comaraderie.\n  But this bill would not fund a single new housing voucher for low-\nincome Americans to obtain housing. Not a single one. This just makes \nno sense for two basic reasons. First, these vouchers enable low-income \nfamilies to afford a reasonable place to live, to afford decent \nhousing--but we now have more than one million Americans waiting for \nhousing assistance. Not only are these numbers abominable, but \nAmericans are waiting months and even years to get affordable housing. \nIn my home state of Delaware, people are stuck on waiting lists for an \naverage of 10 months for public housing and 18 months for section 8 \nvouchers. In Philadelphia, just down the road, the waiting time is 11 \nyears. In Cincinnati, it is 10 years. How can we be freezing a program \nthat provides housing vouchers when, before the freeze, HUD-assisted \nhouseholds were growing at a rate of 107,000 households per year? We \nare freezing out the elderly, persons with disabilities, and persons \ntrying to get close to a good job. And what is the alternative for \nthese million people on waiting lists? It is substandard housing or a \npaycheck that goes almost entirely to rent.\n  Second, we are in a time of booming growth and prosperity. A time \nwhen we have an actual surplus in our treasury. But not all Americans \nare touched by this prosperity, as evidenced by the waiting lists. In \nfact, many Americans are discovering that they cannot pay their rents \nbecause this economy has driven up the cost of their rents. Over 5 \nmillion families have severe housing needs in this country. These \nvouchers are all the more necessary as rents rise more and more out of \nreach.\n  The administration has asked for a conservative number of new housing \nvouchers. These 100,000 vouchers would go to the elderly, the homeless \nand worst-case housing needs. In addition, these vouchers would support \npeople moving from welfare to work. Mr. President, we are creating new \njobs in this economy, but the people that need these jobs are not \nliving where these jobs are. These vouchers would help get people to \nwhere they need to be in order to work and get off the welfare rolls. \nLast year we voted to add 90,000 new vouchers, the first growth since \n1994. If we vote for new vouchers now, 259 families in Delaware would \nbe able to receive housing assistance. To provide no new vouchers seems \njust unreasonable.\n  This bill also terminates the Community Builders program. This public \nservice program has put HUD out into the community to strengthen and \nrevive our neighborhoods. Frankly, in the past, HUD has not been an \nexemplary representative of good bureaucracy. But this administration \nhas gone to great lengths to turn things around--and begin to provide \nservices effectively and skillfully to our communities. The Community \nBuilders program is a successful example of this turn-around. The \nprogram is not even 2 years old, yet what it has accomplished in my \nstate of Delaware is remarkable.\n\n[[Page S11391]]\n\nLet me tell you what the Community Builders program is doing in \nDelaware and why it is important.\n\n  We did not have a HUD presence in Delaware before the Community \nBuilders. Now, for the first time, Delaware has a direct link to HUD \nprograms. Let me tell you what that means. In Delaware, we have some \npretty amazing people who are trying to help their communities by \ndeveloping projects to create jobs and fair housing. They have the will \nand Community Builders gave them the way. The Community Builders, who \nare experts in technical assistance, are training these people on how \nto start community development programs.\n  Besides providing expertise, this program has literally put people on \nthe street who facilitate and coordinate the community's access to HUD \nprograms. Let me give you another example. Next week in the Terry \nApartments on Bloom Street in Wilmington, computers will be installed \nfor its elderly residents. The Community Builders helped secure the \nfunding for these computers. It also teamed with the University of \nDelaware so that next week, people will come to the apartment building \nto train these residents how to use the computers. This means that \npersons living in section 8 buildings will now have access to the \ninternet.\n  I have seen letter upon letter sent to HUD thanking them for what \nthis program has brought to Delaware. Let me quote for you a letter \nfrom Patti Campbell at the University of Delaware written to HUD:\n\n       The Delaware Community Builders have been instrumental in \n     our continued progress on building community Neighborhood \n     Networks, and have made possible the first ever Statewide \n     strategic discussion and conference of faith-based community \n     development groups. The input and advice from HUD's Community \n     Builder . . . provides a unique housing perspective that has \n     helped the program make strong, well-thought out strategic \n     decisions. This expertise is an invaluable tool that assists \n     in the forward progress of many of our affordable housing and \n     community based programs. HUD's Community Builders have a \n     unique position in Delaware in that they can offer \n     information about the overall community-based development \n     process with the full knowledge and support of HUD's broader \n     programs.\n\n  As this letter vocalizes, the Community Builders have created a \npartnership connecting organizations trying to develop affordable \nhousing in Delaware--and has built their capacity to do so. It is clear \nthat closing this office in Delaware, which would happen if this \nprogram is disbanded, would harm this partnership.\n  Mr. President, again, I commend the managers of this bill. This bill \nwould be an even better one if it secured more housing for the people \nthat need it and if it continued HUD's presence in local communities. I \nhope that my colleagues will be able to find the resources to fund \nthese programs by the time this bill comes out of conference.\n  I know my colleagues are ready to move on. Let me make three broad \npoints. It will take about 3 to 5 minutes.\n  No. 1, the fact is, we have asked the Housing Department, HUD, to \nbecome more innovative. We have asked them to trim down. We have asked \nthem to become more efficient. We have asked them to become more \ncustomer oriented. I think under Andrew Cuomo they have done just that. \nNow, because of problems beyond the control of the subcommittee, this \nis the caboose at the end of the train that is going to be empty. This \nis not going to get the kind of attention, the whole of HUD is not \ngoing to get the kind of attention, it deserves.\n  The second point is very basic. My colleague from Missouri made a \nvery compelling argument about section 8. He made the point, why this \ntax cut is so brain dead, why we are here talking about cutting what \neveryone on this floor acknowledges there is a need for, recognizing \nbut not saying that in order to be able to come up with a surplus of $1 \ntrillion over 10 years, which is the projection, that encompasses a 20-\npercent cut across the board in all programs. If we increase defense, \nit means a 40-percent cut in some programs.\n  Here we are debating, tying up the end of a session. This is totally \nbeyond the control of my colleagues on the subcommittee, totally beyond \ntheir control. I am not suggesting they agree with what I am saying. I \nam telling Senators, this is the classic example of why we are in such \ntrouble.\n  Here we are with this booming economy, a projected surplus, very few \nappropriations bills passed. The only thing we are talking about is an \n$800 billion tax cut that now has been vetoed and now it is said there \nwill be no compromise on until next year. We are spending a surplus we \ndon't have, and we are kidding the American public that there is \nsomehow a painless way of arriving at the surplus so we can give it \nback in a tax cut.\n  I defy anyone to tell me how we are going to meet the needs. \nDemocrats and Republicans have stood up, to the best of my knowledge, \nand said: You are right; we have this serious section 8 problem; we \nhave this serious problem in providing affordable housing; we should do \nsomething about it. Tell me how you do it. This, as well as education, \nas well as 10 other things we could name--defense, where we all \nacknowledge there are significant needs--by spending a surplus we don't \nhave and that is premised upon a continued cut of 20 percent beyond \nwhat we have cut over the last 6 years on balance.\n  As the grade school kids used to say, I hope we get real here. These \nfolks managing this legislation can't manufacture an allocation. They \ncan't come up with magic money. I hope people who are setting policy, \nmaking the decisions about how to proceed on these overall budget items \nand how to deal with the projected surplus, which seems to have us \ncompletely tied up in knots--I have been here for 27 years. My friend \nfrom Massachusetts has been here longer than I have. I don't ever \nremember a time when things were in as much disarray at the end of the \nyear and in the appropriations process. The difference is, nobody has a \nplan. Nobody has a plan. At least when Gingrich was in charge over \nthere, they had a plan. There was a light at the end of the tunnel. It \nwas the proverbial freight train, but it was a light. He had a plan--a \nbad plan but a plan. We don't even have a plan.\n  We are careening down this hill, having no notion what is going to \nhappen. At least I don't have any notion. Maybe others are smarter than \nI am and can tell me what is going to happen in the next week, 2 weeks, \n1 month, 6 weeks. I have no idea. I don't think there is a plan.\n\n  The plan relates to having a rational strategy towards the budget in \nterms of how we are going to deal with this booming economy, this \nprojected surplus, and the spending priorities. Mark my words, this is \nnot the only one. My friend from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, and my \nfriend from Illinois have talked about education and how it has gotten \njust gored--no pun intended. This is crazy.\n  I hope saner leaders decide how to approach this problem, so we are \nnot here talking about something we all think we should do something \nabout and the American public, with the economy booming, can't \nunderstand why we can't do something about. Yet we have no idea how to \ndo anything about it. I find that fascinating, I find that deplorable, \nand I find that frightening.\n  I hope this illustration on this small issue in relative terms is \nable to be looked at by people. If there is a problem here, it is \neverywhere. All these priorities we say we want, and yet we are \nfighting over a surplus that doesn't exist and trying to give away $800 \nbillion in a tax cut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair.\n  I say, very quickly, to my colleague from Delaware, I appreciate the \nkind words he said about the ranking member and me, but I have to \ndisagree with all the rest he said.\n  I am not going to make the argument here. There is a plan. We have a \nbudget. We are faced with problems in this allocation, not because of \nany tax cut but because of the budget caps that were adopted by \nCongress and signed into law by the President.\n  There is a plan, and I will leave it to the Budget Committee members \nand the leadership of the committees to describe that plan. We have \nadded money above the caps this year for the costs of military actions. \nThat is why there will be work on the Labor-HHS bill to raise the money \nnecessary within the available surplus. It has nothing to do with the \ntax cut. We will not be touching Social Security.\n\n[[Page S11392]]\n\n  Because the Senator from Rhode Island raised a question about \ncommunity builders, I send a memorandum to the desk and ask unanimous \nconsent it be printed in the Record. It is a memorandum from the \nAssistant Secretary for Housing, the Federal Housing Commissioner, \noutlining the problems with community builders. We have heard from many \npeople in HUD offices, who do not wish to be quoted, concerning their \nproblems with the community builders. We are not going to argue that \npoint here.\n  There being no objection, the memorandum was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    U.S. Department of Housing and\n\n\n                                            Urban Development,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 2, 1999.\n\n     Memorandum for: Secretary's Representatives; Senior Community \n         Builders; Departmental Enforcement Center, Headquarters \n         Division Directors; Departmental Enforcement Center, \n         Satellite Office Directors; Multifamily Hub/Program \n         Center Directors; Property Disposition Center Directors; \n         Headquarters Multifamily Office Directors.\n     Subject: Clarifying Community Builder Roles in Troubled FHA \n         Multifamily Housing Projects.\n\n       In order for HUD to promptly and properly address troubled \n     multifamily projects, it is essential that we act and speak \n     with one voice, as ``One HUD''. As HUD is currently \n     structured, the Office of Housing remains responsible for the \n     asset management functions for these projects at all times. \n     The Departmental Enforcement Center (DEC), working closely \n     with Housing staff, is currently involved with several \n     hundred of these projects.\n       It has come to our attention that in their effort to \n     provide responsive customer service, Community Builders (CBs) \n     in certain areas have misinterpreted or overstepped their \n     role in dealing with HUD's identified troubled multifamily \n     projects.\n       Handling these troubled multifamily projects must be a team \n     effort at all times. To this end, it cannot be stressed too \n     strongly that, prior to responding to any inquiries, issues, \n     etc. regarding any multifamily project, the Community \n     Building MUST first consult with the Multifamily Hub/Program \n     Center Director to determine whether it is a troubled MF \n     project and how to respond. If Housing advises the CB that \n     the DEC is involved in the troubled project, then Housing and \n     the Community Builder must communicate with the appropriate \n     DEC Satellite Office. These three organizations will jointly \n     determine the response and the role of the Community Builder, \n     if any, in addressing the issue. In highly sensitive cases \n     (e.g., involving OGC or OIG), the CB may be advised to \n     refrain from any communication, or will be limited to \n     discussion of only very specific aspects of the case.\n       At no time is it proper for the Community Builder to \n     schedule meetings, respond to or initiate contacts directly \n     with an owner, owner's representative, owner's agent, the \n     media, tenants, Members of Congress or their staffs, etc. \n     regarding a troubled multifamily project without the explicit \n     prior agreement of the Director of the Multifamily Hub/\n     Program Center and, where the DEC is involved, the DEC \n     Satellite Office Director. Keep in mind that any separate \n     communications between the Community Builders and any of \n     these parties could compromise proposed or ongoing \n     negotiations between the Departmental Enforcement Center and \n     the owner. At all times, HUD must present itself to the \n     public as speaking with one voice on troubled multifamily \n     projects.\n       When a multifamily project has been referred to one of the \n     Office of Housing's two Property Disposition (PD) Centers for \n     foreclosure or taking over a project as mortgagee-in-\n     possession or owner, responsibility for the property moves to \n     the PD Center. In such cases, Community Builders remain an \n     essential part of the HUD team, but will need to work closely \n     and coordinate with the Director of the appropriate PD \n     Center.\n       The policy outlined above must be adhered to immediately. \n     More detailed guidance is being developed by a working group \n     to be established by the Office of Housing, Departmental \n     Enforcement Center, and the Office of Field Policy and \n     Management.\n       If you have any questions, please contact Marc Harris, \n     Office of Housing (202) 708-0614, ext. 2680; Jane Hildt, DEC \n     Operations Division (202) 708-9395, ext. 3567 or Barry \n     Reibman, Office of Field Policy and Management (202) 708-\n     1123. Note that the Departmental Enforcement Center Satellite \n     Offices are located in New York, Atlanta, Chicago, Fort \n     Worth, and Los Angeles; the Property Disposition Centers are \n     located in Atlanta and Fort Worth.\n     William Apgar,\n       Assistant Secretary for Housing/Federal Housing \n     Commissioner.\n     Edward J. Kraus,\n       Director, Departmental Enforcement Center.\n     Mary E. Madden,\n       Assistant Deputy Secretary for Field Policy and Management.\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I want to pay my compliments to \nSenators Bond and Mikulski. They have each made the best of a very \ndifficult situation. I compliment them on their leadership. I \nparticularly thank Senator Mikulski, who continues to be of service to \npeople of my State and whose own priorities are written throughout this \nbill, which for all of us in our region of the country is particularly \nimportant. It is in furtherance of their priorities, not in \ncontradiction, that I rise in support of Senator Kerry's amendment.\n  This legislation does not contain any funding for new section 8 \nhousing vouchers. This amendment will provide $288 million for 50,000 \nof those new vouchers. It is a modest but necessary addition. It does \nnot increase authority or outlays. There are offsets for each and every \none of those dollars. It is simply a reordering of priorities to \nrecognize the state of housing in America.\n  Rising economic prosperity in America erodes the foundation of many \nof our most endemic social problems. Housing is a single exception. \nProsperity is not solving the housing crisis in America; it is \nexacerbating the housing problem in America. Indeed, what was a housing \nproblem in the last decade is a housing crisis in this decade. Rents \nare rising, costs are increasing, there is homelessness, and \nhomelessness increases as the demand on people's income to accommodate \nhousing also rises.\n  The single weapon the Federal Government has available to deal with \nthe housing crisis in America is section 8 vouchers. This is not a \ngiveaway; this is no free ride for the citizens of America. Between 30 \nand 40 percent of people's income must be dedicated to paying rent from \ntheir own resources as part of this program. In many of our urban \nareas, it is the single tool available to prevent children and families \nfrom going to the streets.\n  In Newark, NJ, over 172,000 families are paying more than 50 percent \nof their income in rent or living in substandard conditions. More than \n1 million people are languishing on waiting lists for section 8 \nvouchers or affordable housing. And they are not waiting a few days or \nweeks or even a few months; the average is 28 months. You realize you \nare in trouble, you cannot provide affordable, decent housing for your \nchildren, and then you wait in substandard conditions, paying rent \nwhere you also cannot afford health care or food for your children. You \nwait 28 months--unless you live in Philadelphia, where you wait 11 \nyears. In New Jersey, the average in our cities is 3 years. We have \n15,000 people waiting for vouchers in Jersey City and 10,000 are \nwaiting in Newark.\n  Every year, year in and year out, the numbers in America grow by \n100,000. The simple reality is that this year, unless Senator Kerry's \namendment is adopted, the number of section 8 vouchers will not \nincrease--not by 100,000 to meet growing demand, not by 50,000 to meet \nhalf of the demand, but by none, not a single new family. The problem \nbecomes a crisis, and the crisis deepens.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to follow Senator Kerry's leadership to \nimprove upon the work, the already considerable work, Senators Mikulski \nand Bond have done.\n  Also, as did the Senator from Rhode Island, I add my voice in defense \nof the Community Builders Program. This is America at its best, where \nyoung people, for modest remuneration, give their time and their \ntalents to reach out to fellow citizens, to help them avail themselves \nof Government or private programs, to improve their own lives. In some \ncities of my State, virtually the only contact some desperate people in \nneed of assistance for housing, drug abuse, educational services have \nis with these people. Their only contact with the Federal Government \nmay be one of these young people giving a stage of their lives to go \ninto a community and reach out. That program is not going to be reduced \non the legislation. It could be eliminated.\n  This Senate voted to allow Andrew Cuomo to become a member of this \nCabinet to provide leadership for HUD. This is one of his signature \nprograms. His talents and his time have brought him to believe this is \none thing we can\n\n[[Page S11393]]\n\ndo for a modest cost that would make a difference. He deserves that \nsupport. This modest vote will allow him to continue with a program \nthat he believes and I believe is critical.\n  I urge adoption of Senator Kerry's amendment. I express my thanks, \nagain, to Senator Bond, and particularly Senator Mikulski, for \nimproving this legislation and bringing us to this point. We are all \nvery grateful.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank all of my colleagues for their \nkind words about the Senator from Missouri and myself.\n  Speaking on the amendment of Senator Kerry of Massachusetts, I want \nto reiterate the fact that there is very keen interest on the part of \nthe subcommittee to continue to expand the voucher program. What we \nlack is really the wallet. We hope that as we move to conference, \nworking very closely with the administration, we can find an offset to \npay for new vouchers, and an offset that will not only take care of \nthis year's appropriation but will be sustainable and reliable.\n  I am pleased to report to my colleagues in the Senate that I have had \nextensive conversations with the head of OMB, who is working on this, \nalong with our Secretary of HUD, Andrew Cuomo. I do not believe the \neloquent statements by my colleagues on the compelling human need to be \nreiterated by me. I do want to reiterate my support for increasing the \nvoucher program in conference. I know that the President is deeply \nconcerned about this, and should we not be able to proceed with an \nexpansion, his senior advisers are already advising a veto. We are not \nthere yet.\n  I say to my colleagues that this is a work in progress. They have \noutlined the compelling human need. I could give the same kinds of \nexamples from my own State of Maryland, where, though we are enjoying a \nprosperous economy, there are still very significant ZIP Codes of \npoverty. So working together, we will be able to do that.\n  With that, I want to convey, first, my support, and, second, I \nbelieve we can move forward and listen to the Senator from \nMassachusetts in relation to the bill.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Kerry amendment. \nLet me explain that, as a member of the Budget Committee, I understand \nthe burden this appropriations subcommittee faced. The budget \nallocations were entirely inadequate for the demands of this very \nimportant budget--the Veterans' Administration, the National Aeronautic \nand Space Administration, and certainly for the Department of Housing \nand Urban Development, as well as other agencies.\n  The chairman of the subcommittee and Senator Mikulski of Maryland \nhave done the very best they could under the circumstances to try to \naddress these critical national needs. I believe Senator Kerry and \nothers have said perhaps one of the areas that really needs more \nattention when this bill goes to conference relates to the section 8 \nvoucher program--a program which takes working families and gives them \na helping hand to find affordable housing.\n  It is hard to imagine why, in this time of economic prosperity, we \nwould have people still searching for housing. In my home State of \nIllinois, in the city of Chicago, we have seen this booming economy \nbring rents up even higher, and so working families, particularly with \nthe low minimum wage, which has not been addressed for several years, \nare striving to do their very best for their children while rents are \nrising in an otherwise prosperous economy.\n  In the city of Chicago, we can have some pretty powerful winters. I \ncan recall not too long ago visiting the flat of a working family. The \nman had recently become unemployed, his wife was on dialysis, and he \nhad two small children. They had no heat in the apartment they were \nliving in. They were all huddled in one room with a space heater. All \nof the plumbing had frozen. It was a miserable living condition. They \nwere within minutes of the loop of Chicago.\n  I think it is an illustration of families that are struggling to \nprovide decent, safe, healthy housing for their families under the \nworst of circumstances.\n  This bill does not provide any additional money for section 8 \nvouchers. For over 20 years, we have put more money into section 8 \nvouchers to try to keep up with the demand of those who cannot find \nadequate housing.\n  I might also add that we are now going through a revolution in \nthinking on public housing, which probably started several decades ago \nin the city of St. Louis--represented by the chairman of this \nsubcommittee--when they decided the vertical slums, the public housing \nprojects, were to be torn down, and they were to try to build things \nwhich were more habitable and housing which was more decent for the \nfamilies that needed them.\n  We are doing the same thing in Illinois and in the city of Chicago. \nBut as these high-rise, public housing units are torn down, the people \nliving there need a place to live. Section 8 vouchers give them money \nin hand to supplement with their own money to find something in the \ncommunity. When this bill provides no new money for section 8, it \nreduces, if not eliminates, the possibility that these families can \nfind that kind of housing.\n  When you take a look at the situation in the State of Illinois, when \nit comes to housing, it is an illustration, as my colleague from New \nJersey noted earlier, of the problems they face. The number of families \nwith unmet worst case needs for housing in the metropolitan area of \nChicago is 151,000 families. The average time on waiting lists for \npublic housing and section 8 vouchers in Illinois for public housing is \n16 months. If you wanted to get into a public housing unit, the average \nwait is 16 months, if you are eligible. If you apply for a section 8 \nvoucher to stay in the private market and rent a flat or a unit or an \napartment, you wait 63 months--over 5 years to qualify for section 8 \nvouchers.\n  That will get worse if in conference we don't put money in for \nsection 8 vouchers.\n  In addition, the number of families on waiting lists in the \nmetropolitan area of Chicago is 31,000 families looking for public \nhousing, and 30,000 for section 8 vouchers. If we don't put additional \nmoney for section 8 in this bill in conference, the number of families \nin my State that will not receive assistance for section 8 is over \n12,733 families that, frankly, will be out on their own.\n  Why do we have such a crisis at this time of otherwise economic \nprosperity? Because, frankly, despite the fact that between 1977 and \n1994 the number of HUD-assisted households grew by 2.6 million--an \naverage of 204,000 additional households each year from 1977 through \n1983, and an additional 107,000 households in 1984 to 1994--in 1995, we \nsaw a historic reversal in Federal housing policy, freezes on new \nhousing vouchers, despite a growing need.\n  If you travel through some cities in this country, even our Nation's \nCapital of Washington, in the cold of winter, you will see homeless \npeople. Some of these folks have serious personal problems. Others are \ndesperate to find housing. What we do in this bill relates directly to \nthe relief they need.\n\n  I salute the Senator from Massachusetts for his leadership. I hope in \nconference the Senators from Missouri and Maryland and other members of \nthis subcommittee can find the resources and wherewithal to increase \nthe number of section 8 vouchers in this bill.\n  The last point I will make is this: This bill also eliminates 400 \nemployees in HUD for community builders who are generally young people \nwho have decided to give 2 years of their life to leave a job or career \nand dedicate it to public service. These are people working in \ncommunities throughout the United States to provide housing and \ncounseling, and their counseling is very good.\n  Ernst & Young, a very well-respected organization, did an audit of \nthe Community Builders Program in HUD, and didn't stay in Washington to \nspeak for the bureaucrats here. They went out in the communities and \nasked the people who served. They applauded community builders. They \nsaid community builders work. These are people doing a good job for the \ngovernment, people with idealism and energy whom we\n\n[[Page S11394]]\n\nneed to make this already good department an even better agency.\n  It is sad to me this appropriations bill eliminates these 400 \ncommunity builders, and will close down offices in some 81 cities \nacross America.\n  That is a disservice to the people who truly need their services. I \nhope in conference the conferees will reconsider this.\n  Let me close by commending Senator Mikulski and Senator Bond for \ntheir hard work. I understand the burden they face with the budget \nallocation. But we certainly have a burden, too, and the burden is to \nface the needs of working people who need help to find decent housing \nfor their families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 1782, Vitiated\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to vitiate \namendment No. 1782.\n  This was included inadvertently in the list of amendments and was \nalready agreed to as part of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 1761, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Illinois for the \nsubstance of his comments, and also for his generous comments about my \nefforts and the efforts of the ranking member and others on this bill.\n  I thank each of our colleagues who have come to the floor--the \nSenator from Michigan, the Senator from Rhode Island, and others--each \nof whom have spoken very eloquently and very forcefully about the need \nto increase housing, and section 8 particularly.\n  All of us are very mindful of the particular predicament the Senator \nfrom Maryland and the Senator from Missouri have faced. We have said \nmany things on the floor this morning about their commitment to this \neffort. I am particularly grateful to the Senator from Maryland for her \nstatements a moment ago about the efforts they will make in the course \nof the conference.\n  After discussions with Secretary Cuomo, and discussions with the \nchairman and with the ranking member, we are convinced the best course \nat this point in time is to continue to respect what the ranking member \nsaid--that this is a working process--to do our best in the course of \nthe next weeks to honor the efforts of those Senators on the floor \ntoday who have spoken about the need. I am convinced we can do that.\n  I think there is no purpose at this point in time in taking the \nSenate to a vote, given the assurance of those efforts by the \nadministration and ranking member, and therefore I ask unanimous \nconsent that I be permitted to withdraw the amendment at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1790\n\n   (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding education \n                                funding)\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 113, between lines 16 and 17, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The American people know that a strong public education \n     system is vital to our Nation's future and they \n     overwhelmingly support increasing the Federal investment in \n     education.\n       (2) The funding level for the Subcommittee on Labor, Health \n     and Human Services, and Education of the Committee on \n     Appropriations of the Senate has been reduced to pay for \n     other programs.\n       (3) The current allocation for the Subcommittee on Labor, \n     Health and Human Services, and Education of the Committee on \n     Appropriations is 17 percent below fiscal year 1999 levels.\n       (4) The 17 percent reduction in Head Start will result in \n     142,000 children not being served.\n       (5) The 17 percent reduction will cost school districts the \n     funds for 5,246 newly hired teachers.\n       (6) The 17 percent reduction will deprive 50,000 students \n     of access to after-school and summer school programs.\n       (7) The 17 percent reduction in funding for the Individuals \n     with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) will make it far more \n     difficult for States to provide an appropriate education for \n     students with disabilities by reducing funding by more than \n     $880,000,000.\n       (8) The 17 percent reduction will deprive 2,100,000 \n     children in high-poverty communities of educational services \n     to help them do well in school and master the basics.\n       (9) The 17 percent reduction will result in 1,000 fewer \n     school districts receiving support for their initiatives to \n     integrate technology into their classrooms.\n       (10) The 17 percent reduction will deny nearly 200,000 \n     disadvantaged and middle-income students access to counseling \n     and educational support to help them succeed in college.\n       (11) The 17 percent reduction will reduce funds provided to \n     schools to improve school safety by nearly $100,000,000.\n       (12) The 17 percent reduction will cause 100,000 students \n     to lose their Federal Pell Grant awards.\n       (13) No action has been taken in the Senate on the \n     Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and \n     Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2000.\n       (14) There are only 5 legislative work days left before the \n     end of fiscal year 2000.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Senate should increase the Federal investment in \n     education, including providing--\n       (A) $1,400,000,000 for the second year of the initiative to \n     reduce class sizes in early grades by hiring 100,000 \n     qualified teachers;\n       (B) an increase in support for programs that recruit, \n     train, and provide professional development for, teachers;\n       (C) $600,000,000 for after-school programs, thereby \n     tripling the current investment;\n       (D) an increase, not a decrease, in funding for the Safe \n     and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act of 1994;\n       (E) an increase in funding for part A of title I of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 for children \n     from disadvantaged backgrounds, and an increase in funding \n     for reading and literacy grants under part C of title II of \n     such Act;\n       (F) an increase, not a decrease, in funding for the \n     Individuals with Disabilities Education Act;\n       (G) funding for a larger maximum Federal Pell Grant award \n     for college students, and an increase in funding for \n     mentoring and other need-based programs;\n       (H) an increase, not a decrease, in funds available to help \n     schools use technology effectively in the classroom and \n     narrow the technology gap; and\n       (I) at least $3,700,000,000 in Federal resources to help \n     communities leverage funds to modernize public school \n     facilities; and\n       (2) the Senate should stay within the discretionary \n     spending caps and avoid using the resources of the social \n     security program by finding discretionary spending offsets \n     that do not jeopardize important investments in other key \n     programs within the jurisdiction of the Subcommittee on \n     Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education of the \n     Committee on Appropriations of the Senate.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this is the last amendment, as I \nunderstand it, that will require a rollcall vote. I propose that there \nbe a 1-hour time limit provided for the amendment with the assumption \nthat there would be no second degree amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that there be a 1-hour time limit provided \nfor the amendment to be equally divided, and no second degree amendment \nbe in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I want to \ntalk with the majority leader and others on this before we agree to a \ntime limit. I suggest the absence of a quorum at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader has the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I observe the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have the floor, do I not?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader has the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me begin by discussing the amendment.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, will the Democratic leader yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would prefer not to object. But I was not \naware of the content of the amendment\n\n[[Page S11395]]\n\nuntil just a short time ago. I would like to have a chance to take a \nlook at it. I think I am going to want to offer, to be perfectly frank, \na second-degree amendment to it.\n  I want to have a chance, when the Senator completes his remarks, to \ntalk with him about what time will be needed and how we can work \nthrough the parliamentary procedure. I want to be candid with the \nSenator about that. I look forward to having a chance to discuss it.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we are 7 calendar days away from the \nbeginning of the new fiscal year. We have yet to schedule a markup on \nspending for Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education here in \nthe Senate. It is becoming increasingly disconcerting to many Members \nthat over the course of the last several months, it has been the Labor, \nHealth and Human Services, and Education bill in particular, that has \nbecome the ATM machine for the entire Federal budget.\n  Given the fact that we are at the end of a fiscal year, given the \nfact that just yesterday we saw the intentions of our Republican \ncolleagues on the House side as they made spending decisions with \nregard to education, given the fact it may be we will not have an \nopportunity to debate a Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education \nbill on the Senate floor at least before the first of October, many \nMembers thought it was important to raise the issue now, to at least \nhave some discussion about where we are and where we need to go on this \ncritical issue prior to the time we have cemented in all the other \ncommitments and all the other decisions with regard to the budget and \nappropriations for the next fiscal year.\n  On January 6, the majority leader made a very strong statement about \neducation. He said, ``Education is going to be a central issue this \nyear. The Democrats say it is important and should be a high priority; \nRepublicans say it is a high priority.''\n  On April 14, the distinguished chair of the Budget Committee made a \nsimilar statement, very strong in its nature. He claimed that the \nbudget resolution increased education funding by $3.3 billion for \nfiscal year 2000, and on March 1 he said, ``We are going to put real \nmoney where our rhetoric has been.'' The reality is, so far our \ncolleagues have not kept their promise. Instead, as I said, we are \nusing education as an ATM machine for everything else.\n  Senate funding for Labor-HHS-Education today is $15 billion below \nlast year's levels, a 17-percent cut from a hard freeze of last year. \nJust last week, the Appropriations Committee took $7 billion away from \nthe education budget. The Republican tax bill which was vetoed \nyesterday would have cut education by 50 percent in the 10th year. \nYesterday, the House Labor-HHS-Education Subcommittee finally brought \nup a bill, and that bill provides less for education than we provided \nlast year. It kills the class-size reduction program, it provides only \nhalf of the President's request for afterschool programs, it provides a \nhalf a billion less for Head Start than the President requested, it \nunderfunds title I for disadvantaged children, it underfunds safe and \ndrug-free schools, and it underfunds education technology and youth \nemployment programs. Clearly, education is the lowest--not the \nhighest--priority for our Republican colleagues.\n  In the Senate, we still have a 17-percent cut, which would be \ndevastating. Make no mistake about it, the ramifications of that kind \nof cut on education in one fiscal year would absolutely devastate \neducational programs: 175,000 fewer young children would attend Head \nStart; 2.1 million kids from high poverty areas would not receive the \nhelp they need to succeed; 85,000 fewer students would have access to \nafterschool programs and summer school programs than the year before; \nFederal funding for special education would be destroyed; virtually all \nschools would lose funding for drug abuse and violence prevention \nprograms; 166,000 college students would not get work-study that makes \ncollege more affordable; 120,000 disadvantaged college students would \nlose the TRIO services that help them complete college.\n  Americans certainly know strong public schools are vital to our \nfuture. They say it over and over when we ask them in the polling data. \nMr. President, 79 percent of Americans in a poll just taken say \nimproving education and schools is one of the most important factors \nthey will use in choosing the next President. A strong majority \nsupports increasing our investment in education, not slashing it. Some \nsay public schools are broken and can't be fixed. That evidence is just \nnot there. It doesn't support claims as erratic and as irrational as \nthat.\n\n  In 1994, the Congress passed the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct. We put policies in place to encourage schools to set high \nstandards for disadvantaged children and assess students' performance. \nThe standards are just now going into effect. Setting standards for \nlow-achieving students helps all students. Eighty percent of poor \nschool districts and almost half of all districts report title I has \nactually encouraged schools to put standards in place for all. We are \nstarting now to see real results. Student performance is rising in \nreading, math, and science. U.S. students scored near the top on the \nlatest international assessment of reading. American fourth graders \noutperform students from all other nations but one. The combined verbal \nand math scores on SAT increased 15 points between 1992 and 1997. The \naverage math score is at its highest level in 26 years.\n  There are other signs of improvement. More students are taking \nrigorous courses and doing better. The percentage of students taking \nbiology, chemistry, and physics has doubled. The number of AP exams \nwhere students scored a passing grade has risen nearly fivefold since \n1992. Fewer students are dropping out. From 1982 to 1996, the dropout \nrate for students between 16 and 24 fell from 14 to 11. The gap between \nwhites and blacks in completing high school has closed. In 1995, for \nthe first time, blacks and whites completed high school at the same \nrate, 87 percent.\n  However, not all schools, not all students, reach their potential. We \nknow we have to do better. Schools face many challenges they didn't \nface even when I was going to school. Enrollments are at record levels. \nA large part of the teaching corps is getting ready to retire. \nDiversity is increasingly bringing new languages and cultures into the \nclassroom. Family structures are changing. More women are in the \nworkplace. That increases the need for instructive afterschool and \nsummer school activities. We are learning more about how children learn \nduring early childhood, how important stimulating activities are for \nlater success in school. The importance of a higher education and \nlifelong learning has never been greater, requiring even better \npreparation of all students.\n  These are national challenges. The Federal Government has to be a \npartner in addressing them. Now cannot be the time to cut education. \nOur Republican colleagues have proposed an education plan that falls \nshort, not just in funding. Their other actions show they don't have a \nconstructive agenda for public schools. They are blocking efforts to \nkeep guns out of the hands of kids. Education block grants shift help \naway from disadvantaged children and reduce accountability, yet they \ncontinue to create even more block grants, and then slash the funding. \nThey think giving a $5-per-year tax break to families with children in \npublic schools will somehow improve student learning. They think \ndiverting Federal resources to provide vouchers for a few children to \ngo to private school rather than strengthening public schools that \nserve 90 percent of all children is somehow going to improve education \nin this country.\n  I think, with all due respect, our colleagues on the other side need \nto think a little harder. We have a comprehensive, constructive, and \nrealistic educational agenda for the rest of this session. We help \ncommunities by serving all students, providing $1.4 billion to reduce \nclass size and improve teacher quality, by tripling funding for \nafterschool programs and improving school safety, by increasing college \naccess and affordability, by expanding opportunities to incorporate \neducation and technology into the classroom and training teachers and \nprincipals in using it effectively, by advancing school readiness and \nliteracy, and by helping communities leverage funds to modernize school \nbuildings.\n\n[[Page S11396]]\n\n  Further, as the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee \nworks to update the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, we will \npush for higher standards for student achievement and get those \nstandards into the classroom. We are going to fight for strong \naccountability provisions, including providing school report cards to \nparents, increasing public school choice through open enrollment, \nexpansion of charter schools, and strengthening reforms to turn around \nfailing schools.\n  We are going to focus on attracting talented individuals into \nteaching and make sure that new and veteran teachers and principals \nhave access to opportunities to learn more about effective teaching and \nmanagement strategies. We want to continue support for efforts to \nstreamline Federal regulations and increase flexibility for local \nschool districts while holding them accountable for student \nachievement.\n  However, funding is critical. While money is not the only answer, it \nhas to be part of the solution. Mr. President, 17-percent cuts in \nprograms such as title I and Head Start will only make matters worse. A \nfreeze at last year's levels is also unacceptable. The current fiscal \nyear ends in 5 business days. Time is clearly running out.\n\n  We are simply offering a sense-of-the-Senate resolution to lay out \nwhy a 17-percent cut in education is unacceptable, and to lay out our \npriorities. The Democratic record on education could not be stronger. \nWe voted for increases in funding for education without exceeding the \nspending caps or spending Social Security trust funds. We have a \nconstructive agenda to improve public schools and increase achievement. \nStrong public education is critical to our future. Public schools have \nincreased opportunities for people from all walks of life throughout \nour Nation's history. We have to continue to make sure all students \nhave access to public schools so all students have the opportunity to \ndevelop their skills and learn to their highest abilities.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts for a \nquestion.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, do I not have the floor?\n  Mr. LOTT. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader has the floor and may \nyield for a question.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I had yielded to the Senator from Massachusetts for a \nquestion, but if the Senator will withhold for a moment, I am happy to \nyield to the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. I wanted to ask, if we are going to have some debate, if we \ncould go back and forth? Or is it the Democratic leader's intention to \nhave Senator Kennedy ask a question?\n  I would like to get into some discussion, but I understand the \nSenator has the floor. Certainly I would not want to take you off your \nfeet. But I would like to be heard on this issue, and I hope we can get \nsome flow back and forth. I might say, we are trying to work up an \nagreement as to how we can proceed on this today and Monday. When you \nand I have a chance, I would like to clear that. That is all.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Massachusetts \nfor a question.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If I could have the attention of the two leaders, if it \nis the desire of Senator Lott to have Senator Gregg speak briefly so \nthe two leaders can talk, I will be glad to withhold then, with the \nunderstanding I might be recognized afterwards to speak for maybe 15 \nminutes, if that is the way the leaders want to go. We can do it \nwhichever way. If it is the desire of the leaders to get together to \nwork out procedure, I will be glad to withhold questions. The Senator \nfrom New Hampshire could speak, if it is for 10 or 15 minutes, and then \nI will be glad to follow, if that is helpful. Or we could continue the \nway we are. Whichever way.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. As I understand it, I still have the floor, and I am \nhappy to yield to the majority leader at this time.\n  Mr. LOTT. Let's see if we can ascertain exactly what the Senator from \nMassachusetts is proposing. Perhaps Senator Gregg could speak, and then \nSenator Kennedy, giving the two of us the chance to talk about how we \ncan proceed. Is that what he was proposing?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thought that was what the leader wanted. That will be \nfine and acceptable to me.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Perhaps we can enter into a unanimous consent agreement \nthat the Senator from New Hampshire be given 10 or 15 minutes----\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, 15 would be nice.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. To be recognized, then the Senator from Massachusetts, \nand then I ask I be recognized following the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. LOTT. And this is all for debate only. Was that in the form of a \nunanimous consent request?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Could I have 15 minutes?\n  Mr. GREGG. Do I have 15 minutes?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I amend my request by asking that the Senator from New \nHampshire have 15 minutes, the Senator from Massachusetts have 15 \nminutes for purposes of debate only, and I be recognized following the \npresentations by both Senators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, let me begin by thanking the leaders for \ntheir courtesy and thanking the Senator from Massachusetts for his \ncourtesy. I want to respond to some of the points the Democratic leader \nhas made relative to the education issue and talk about some of the \nagenda items about which we as Republicans are talking.\n  I have not seen the Democratic leader's sense of the Senate, but as I \nunderstand it, it is basically a castigation of the Republican majority \nfor our position on education and promotion of the Democrat position on \neducation, which would not be too surprising coming from the Democratic \nleader. But let me make a couple of points that I think underlie this \nwhole debate.\n  The first is this: There is no amendment on the floor, there is no \nproposal on the floor, dealing with funding for education. It is my \nunderstanding the appropriations subcommittee, of which I happen to be \na member, which deals with education funding, is going to be funding \nthe Head Start at a very aggressive level and is going to be funding \nother education accounts at very aggressive levels. Those levels will \nbe significant.\n  The second point to make: the Democratic membership has come forward \nwith a whole series of new initiatives, most of them put forth by the \nPresident. They include class size initiative, afterschool initiative, \nbuilding of new schoolroom initiatives. All of these are extremely \nexpensive items. What they have not come forward with, however, is a \ncommitment to support the already expensive items which the Federal \nGovernment has forced the local communities and the States to spend \nmoney on--specifically, special education.\n  On our side of the aisle, we have taken the position that it is much \nbetter for the Federal Government to fund already-existing programs, \nwhich it requires the local communities to spend money on, than to \nstart up new programs, to force the local communities to spend new \nmoney on programs when they are not even getting reimbursed for the \nprograms for which we already asked them to pay.\n  Special education is probably the single biggest drain on the costs \nof running your local school districts. You can go across this country \nand I suspect you will not find any school district in this country \nwhere the principals and the superintendents, and even the teachers, \nand especially the parents, do not tell you that if the Federal \nGovernment would simply pay its fair share of the cost of special \neducation, then the local schools could do the things they need to do \nin other areas; whether it happens to be reducing the class size, \nbuilding buildings, adding computers, adding foreign language courses, \nor adding new athletic programs. But because the Federal Government has \nrefused to pay its fair share of the cost of special education when the \nFederal Government originally committed to pay 40 percent for each \nchild in special ed, and today only pays about 10.5 percent, because \nthe\n\n[[Page S11397]]\n\nFederal Government has failed to fulfill its commitment in this area of \npaying the full 40 percent, local school districts have had to take \nschool dollars raised at the local level and apply those dollars to \nsatisfy the Federal obligation, to pay for the Federal obligation. That \nhas skewed dramatically the ability of the local school districts to \neffectively manage their own budgets and to take care of local \neducation.\n  What has been the administration's response to this? Has the \nadministration said that is wrong? We put on the books a law that said \nwe were going to help the special needs child--a very appropriate law--\nand the Federal Government would pay 40 percent of the cost of the \nspecial needs child, and we are not doing it. We are only paying 10.5 \npercent. Has this administration said let's take care of that problem, \nlet's address that problem?\n\n  No. They have totally ignored the special needs child in their \nbudgets. In fact, were it not for the Senate Republicans and for the \nleadership of Senator Lott, special education, the special education \ncommitment of the Federal Government, would still be around 6 percent.\n  Over the last 3 years, because of Senator Lott's support and because \nof efforts of other Senators such as myself, we have been able to move \nthat number up fairly significantly so we are now supporting about 10.5 \npercent. We have essentially doubled, in many States, the amount of \nmoney coming from the Federal Government, but we are still far short of \nthe dollars that should be going back to local communities to help them \nwith special education.\n  This has had a series of insidious impacts, this failure to fund \nspecial education, especially the failure of this administration to \nstep up to the bar and fund special education. What this administration \ndoes is it creates or proposes all these new programs, whether it is a \nnew building program or class size program or afterschool program, and \nit says to the local school district: OK, we are going to send you \nmoney for this program--call it a building program for their local \nschool district. Then it says to the local school district, but to get \nthis money you may have to have some sort of match. So the local school \ndistrict finds itself in an impossible position because the Federal \nGovernment, instead of sending it the money it needs for special \neducation, is saying to them: We are not going to send you the money we \nalready told you we were going to send you for special education cases; \nwe are going to take the money we told you we would send you for \nspecial education and create a new program; and we are going to tell \nyou that you have to take this new program in order to get the money \nwhich you should have gotten in the first place from the special ed \ndollars.\n  The local school districts are left in the impossible situation of, \nfirst, using their local dollars to pay the Federal share of special \neducation, and then in order to get the dollars coming to them for \nspecial education from the Federal Government, they have to create a \nnew program and do something they do not want to do; where if the \nFederal Government did what it was supposed to do in the first place--\nwhich is pay for its fair share of special education--they would be \nfreeing up the dollars at the local level that have been used to \nsubsidize the Federal Government, and the local school district can \nmake a decision: Do we need a new building? Do we need more teachers? \nDo we need afterschool programs? Do we need a foreign language program? \nDo we need new computers? The local school districts can make those \ndecisions.\n  The Democratic leadership in this Congress and the President do not \nlike that idea. Why do they not like that idea? Because they do not get \nto call the shots. The education bureaucracy in Washington does not get \nto make the decisions for the local school districts. That is what this \nis about.\n  This is not about funding. This is not about adequate resources being \nsent to support the local school districts. The Republican proposals \nhave put more money into special education than the Democratic \nproposals ever even thought of doing. We committed more than adequate \nfunding for areas such as Head Start. But what we do not do--and this \nis what really galls the education establishment; this is what galls \nthe teachers' unions that happen to dominate this city's liberal left \nand especially the Democratic Party in this city in the White House--is \nwe do not tell them how to spend the money. We return to the States the \nmoney we said we would pay them in the first place for special \neducation, and we let the States, then, make their decisions and the \ncommunities make the decisions and the parents make the decisions as to \nhow they are going to spend their own dollars--whether they are going \nto add a classroom, add a teacher, add a foreign language program, add \na computer program--instead of saying to them, as this President would \nhave us do and as the proposal from the Democratic leader would have us \ndo: We are going to tell you how to spend the money we send you, and \nyou have to do it our way or you do not get the money.\n\n  Isn't it about time we, as a government, as a Federal Government, \nlive up to our obligations when we say to local communities we are \ngoing to send you 40 percent of the cost of a special ed student's \neducation, we should be sending them the money to pay for that special \ned student's education? We require that education under Federal law. We \nshould, obviously, fund it.\n  This administration does not want to do it. Why? It is very simple. \nIt is purely an issue of power. They want to control local education \nfrom Washington. They do not like the idea the local school district \nmight have its local dollars freed up so it can make a decision, so a \nparent can go into a school and say: Listen, we don't happen to have \nenough books in the library; that's what we need. They do not like the \nidea that a parent might have that much power with the local dollars. \nThey want to take those local dollars and control them by underfunding \nthe Federal obligation. Then they want to come up with new Federal \nprograms which may have absolutely no need in the local community and \nwhich, as a practical matter, really skews the ability of the local \ncommunity to fund its local education activities.\n  Let's also talk about the merits of some of these programs they are \nproposing and are going to force down the throats of the local school \ndistricts, the towns, and the cities. Let's talk about their teacher \nprogram, their class size program.\n  The theory is, if you do not have an 18-to-1 ratio, you do not meet \nthe class-size obligations the Federal Government is setting up, and \ntherefore you must take this money to spend it on additional teachers.\n  First off, 42 of the 50 States already meet the 18-to-1 ratio. So it \nis almost a meaningless proposal. Secondly, there happens to be very \nlittle statistical support for the idea that a class size of 18 to 1 is \nbetter than 20 to 1 or better than 15 to 1. It is not the size of the \nclass when you get into those levels of ratio; it is the teacher. Do \nyou have a good teacher? It is the person who is actually standing in \nthat classroom that makes the difference. If you have a terrible \nteacher in a failing school who has taught there for a long time, you \nare going to turn out poorly prepared students whether you have 5 to 1, \n10 to 1, or 25 to 1.\n  What the Federal Government refuses to do is say to the failing \nschool that has failed year after year: Stop it; stop; just stop; stop \nit; don't teach our kids poorly any longer.\n\n  Why not? Because the teachers' unions have such a control over the \npositions of this administration and the Department of Education that \nthere is trepidation about confronting the failing school and the \nfailing teacher in the failing school.\n  The Republicans have a better idea. We say essentially this. We say \nif a school has failed for 2 years on standards set by the State, not \nset in Washington--we are not going to tell the State and local \ncommunities how to set the standards, but if it has failed for 2 years \nso the kids are not getting a good education, then we say the States \nhave to come into that school and direct that school to do a better job \nwith its kids.\n  If after 4 years of failure--and that means almost half a generation \nof kids going through that school, if it is an elementary school going \nup to grade 8--if it is still failing and it is not producing results, \nand the kids coming out of that school cannot read and cannot do math--\nvery basic things; we are not asking them to teach rocket science;\n\n[[Page S11398]]\n\nwe are asking them to teach the basics of American education--if after \n4 years this school still cannot cut it under standards set by the \nState, then we suggest that it is time to give the parents of the kids \nin those schools a chance to get their kids out of those schools.\n  We say to the school systems that the dollars that were going to that \nschool system will instead follow the child to another school, to \nwhatever school that parent wants to send that child to so that child \nhas an opportunity to get into a school where they can actually learn \nand, thus, participate in the American dream.\n  It is unconscionable that the proposals coming from the other side \nessentially take the attitude that we will continue to support failing \nschools year after year and, thus, basically deny the kids going \nthrough those schools a shot at the American dream because you cannot \nparticipate in the American dream if you are not educated. Yet that is \nthe position. That is the position of the President.\n  Why does he take that position? Very simply because there is an \neducation lobby in Washington which refuses to face up to the fact that \nthere are failing schools because they recognize that once they admit \nthat, and once they admit that parents should have the right to take \ntheir kids out of those schools, they are admitting that parents should \nhave choice and have a chance to participate in the system of educating \ntheir kids.\n  That is something that is an anathema, the idea that parents should \nactually have some role in choosing where their kids go to school and \nhaving the opportunity of making sure their kids get a decent education \nas a result of having some choice. That is an anathema to the education \nlobby in Washington.\n  The proposal brought forward by the President, one, shortchanges the \nspecial needs child dramatically. It doesn't do anything to help fund \nthe special needs child. Two, it skews the ability of the local school \nsystem of the opportunity to use local dollars where they think they \nshould go, whether it is a new building, whether it is a new library, \nwhether it is another teacher, or whether it is a new language program. \nIt makes it impossible for them to make that choice because they are \nnot given the dollars necessary to make that choice and the dollars are \ntaken instead to support the special education obligations the Federal \nGovernment requires them to make.\n  Three, they are putting in place categorical programs. The President \nwants categorical programs which have no relationship, in many \ninstances, to the needs of the local school district.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask for one additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. They are categorical programs that have no relationship to \na local school district's needs, instead of giving the school district \nand parents the flexibility to make the choices they want.\n  And four, the Republican proposal suggests that parents and schools \nshould have the ability to take action when a school is failing year in \nand year out. This is opposed by the other side of the aisle.\n\n  Good education proposals are being put forward in this Congress. They \nare being put forward by those of us on this side of the aisle who see \nthe need to help special education, who see the need to empower \nparents, who see the need to give teachers the opportunity to learn and \nexpand their abilities, but also to recognize if the teacher is not \ndoing their job, there should be action taken.\n  These are good initiatives. This education debate is going to be \nabout the difference in opinions. We are looking forward to that \ndebate.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor 15 minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Will the Senator from Massachusetts yield for a moment?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will be glad to yield to the leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent this not be taken \nout of his time so the Senator has his full 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe we are about ready to do what I \nhad suggested to Senator Kennedy, that the managers of this bill will \nbe able to do a manager's amendment and complete action on the HUD-VA \nbill expeditiously. We can go forward then with our discussion of \neducation and have votes on the two different approaches Monday \nafternoon.\n  Would the Senator from Massachusetts prefer to go forward?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am always delighted to accede to my friend, Senator \nMikulski. I probably have 15 minutes. But if you thought hers was just \na matter of a few minutes, I will ask consent when I conclude she be \nrecognized to do that. Would that be satisfactory?\n  Mr. LOTT. That is an excellent idea. I cannot speak for Senator \nDaschle, but I do not think he would object to that. He has indicated \nhis willingness to work through what we have talked about. Since they \nare not here--maybe it will take a couple minutes to get ready to wrap \nit up--you can give your remarks and then we can go to the chairman and \nranking member on the HUD-VA bill and complete that.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes. I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/24/senate-section/article/S11398-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11398-S11420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          EDUCATION IN AMERICA\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I always enjoy having the opportunity to \ndiscuss education policies with my friend from New Hampshire. As usual, \nhe has been very eloquent in terms of the positions which he has \nadvanced. I would like to bring a few points to the attention of the \nmembership, though, on items he has raised to try to clarify some of \nthese issues and questions.\n  One was the issue of flexibility, whether there is sufficient kinds \nof flexibility at the local level to permit the education of the \nchildren in various communities across the country.\n  I have Speaker Hastert's statement he put out at the time the \nPresident signed the Ed-Flex legislation. At that time, the Speaker \nsaid: ``Ed-Flex''--which passed the House and Senate-- ``ensures our \nschools have the flexibility they need to make good on the promise to \nhelp each child reach their full potential.'' The release goes on and \nindicates he believes now there is the kind of flexibility the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire talks about being extremely important. It seems the \nSpeaker, at least, and many others, believed, with the passage of that \nact, the local communities had the flexibility they needed.\n  I think that was certainly the purpose of the legislation. I am glad \nthe Speaker certainly has supported the President's concept in having \nthat kind of flexibility.\n  Secondly, there was some talk about the funding of the IDEA. I want \nto recall for the Members that we did have an opportunity earlier this \nyear to have full funding of IDEA for the next 10 years. The Senator \nfrom New Hampshire has mentioned the importance of us in Congress to \nmeet the responsibilities to those children who are participating in \nthat program.\n  The fact is, earlier this year, on March 25, 1999, I offered an \namendment that would provide full funding for IDEA over the next 10 \nyears, and also the funding for the class size reduction initiative--\nthat we would provide full funding for those two items. It would have \ntaken one-fifth of the tax cut. With one-fifth of the tax cut, we could \nhave funded all of the IDEA programs for a period of 10 years. That was \na party-line vote, including the vote of the Senator from New Hampshire \nwho voted against it. That is real money. That isn't speeches on the \nfloor of the Senate. That is real money.\n\n  We would have welcomed the opportunity to have worked with him and \nothers in this body to take some of that money, the $780 billion that \nwas going to be used for tax cuts, and use the money that would be \nnecessary for the funding of the IDEA, but that was voted out. We are \nnot giving up on that.\n  So for those who share my belief--I know our colleague, Senator \nHarkin, is a great leader on that issue; and it has broad, bipartisan \nsupport in terms of fashioning that legislation. We will continue to \nfight for increased funding\n\n[[Page S11399]]\n\nfor the IDEA. It certainly is preferred to fund that than have the kind \nof tax breaks that have been suggested in the Republican proposal. But \non that date, it was the sense of the Republican leadership and the \nRepublican Party that the tax breaks were more important than funding \nthe IDEA. That, I believe, was wrong.\n  Finally, I say, I hope in our discussion and debate on education that \nwe can understand a very basic and fundamental concept; and that is, we \nshould not be pitting children against each other. We want to have \nbetter teachers. We want smaller classes. We want improved reading \nskills. We want after-school programs. We want safe buildings. We want \nthose conditions for children who are in the IDEA programs, and we want \nthose conditions for children in the Title I programs, and we want \nthose conditions for children in the high-achievement programs.\n  Let us not begin to pit one group of children against another. That \nis why we support the kind of coordinated program, in terms of both \nprogram and resources, so all children can move along together to take \nadvantage of the real opportunities that are out there. That is what \nbasically underlines the reason for Senator Daschle's Sense-of-the-\nSenate Resolution.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to take a moment of the Senate's \ntime to say why I believe this amendment, this Sense of the Senate, is \nso important at this time.\n  You can ask: Why are we taking time in the Senate on a Friday \nafternoon to put the Senate on record in urging my colleagues, in the \nremaining days, to provide the resources that will be necessary to \nfully fund the President's requests on education and to not see these \ndramatic cuts which have been indicated with the 17-percent reduction \nin the allocation of funds for the appropriations for education?\n  Families across this country ought to be concerned. We are hopeful \nthat we are giving that signal to the American families. What we are \ngoing to do in the next 4 weeks is going to be of the greatest \nimportance and significance in terms of whether we are going to be \nenhancing or diminishing the quality of education for children in this \ncountry.\n  I would like to see education be the No. 1 appropriations . I wish we \nhad a binding resolution that said: Before we deal with any other \nappropriations, we are going to deal with the education appropriations. \nThat ought to be the No. 1 appropriations.\n  I daresay, if you ask the American people, sure, they may say \nnational security and defense, that may be in there; but they are going \nto say national security and defense, and they are going to say \neducation. But what has been the record?\n  Here is the record. In 1994, under the Republican leadership, the day \nthey captured the House of Representatives and the Senate of the United \nStates, they didn't even wait until the appropriations legislation came \nup. They put a rescission program request into the Congress that \neffectively said money that had been appropriated, signed by the \nPresident, would be rescinded. They asked for a rescission of $1.7 \nbillion below enacted in 1995. That was one of the first actions taken \nby the Republican leadership.\n\n  In 1996, the House appropriations bill had a $3.9 billion request for \neducation below what was actually agreed to in 1995; in 1997, $3.1 \nbillion below the President's request.\n  It was in 1995 that the Republican Party introduced a resolution to \nabolish the Department of Education--abolish the Department of \nEducation. That gives us some idea about what their views are in terms \nof any kind of partnership between the Federal Government and the \nStates and local communities. They wanted to abolish it.\n  I think most parents in this country want to have someone at that \nCabinet table every time the Cabinet meets who is going to say: Mr. \nPresident, what about education? That is what the Secretary of \nEducation is supposed to do. That is why he is there. Every time there \nis a debate on national domestic issues, any time there is a debate on \npriorities, that Secretary of Education is there saying: What are we \ndoing about educating and enhancing the education of our children?\n  Republicans wanted to forbid that Secretary to come into the room. \nThey wanted to deny him access to the President of the United States. \nWhat possible sense does that make?\n  We ask why the Daschle amendment is being brought up now. So we can \ngarner the support of the American people and say we are not going to \nget rolled on this issue, not without a fight. This President isn't \ngoing to get rolled on it. All we have to do is look at where the \npriorities have been on the education issue.\n  We want the funding for education as the first appropriations. We \nchallenge the Republican leadership in the next Congress to bring it \nout as No. 1, not as the last one. And the last one, here in 1998, is \nonly $200 million below the President's request; 1999, $2 billion--the \nHouse bill. The House bill, according to Mr. Obey, is $2.8 billion \nbelow the President's.\n  We have to ask ourselves, what is happening across the country on \neducation? I will tell my colleagues what is happening. We have 400,000 \nnew students--400,000 new students who are going to classrooms in \nAmerica now. We have 200,000 teachers who taught last year who have \ngiven up and retired from teaching, and only 100,000 have been \nreplaced. One would think the effort contained in the President's \nprogram of trying to find qualified individuals to teach ought to be \nsomething that is pretty important, wouldn't they? Sure, they would. \nNot the Republican appropriators, not the Republicans. They cut that \nalmost in half.\n  We have to ask ourselves, what are they possibly thinking about? \nSure, these are numbers, but they are a pretty good indicator. What we \nare saying is--talking about numbers--that just because of $1 billion \nor $2 billion, it is not going to necessarily solve all the education \nproblems we have in our country, but it is a pretty clear indication \nabout what a nation's priorities are.\n  That is what the appropriations process is about--what are our \nNation's priorities. What are parents going to say and what should they \nsay, when every single time they see those reductions? Now we are \nseeing it again with these actions that have been taken in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  We are going to resist those. We are saying it not only because we \nsee what is happening with the growth of the various numbers of \nstudents and the decline of the numbers of teachers, but we know a \nwhole host of other things.\n  Most Americans understand we want our children to have the kind of \nskills that are going to be necessary for them to play a role in \ngetting a decent job and providing for their families for the next \ncentury.\n\n  I will not take the time today, but maybe later I will have the time \nto discuss the various studies which show that only 20 percent of the \ngraduates now entering the job market have the kind of skills that 60 \npercent of those students are going to need, not 5 years from now, but \n1 year from now--a year from now. That is what is happening out in the \njob market. That is what is happening in this new economy.\n  President Clinton understands that. He has funding in this so we can \nhave continuing, ongoing training and skills for the young people of \nthis country, so they will be able to be part of the economy. This \nRepublican Appropriations Committee guts that particular provision and \neffectively wipes it out.\n  I will mention one final item. We heard from our good leader about \nthe importance of reading. There isn't a teacher across this country \nwho doesn't know the significance and the importance of reading. Yet we \nfind here in the United States that we are still challenged in terms of \nhaving our children reach acceptable levels that are going to be \nnecessary for the improvement of their education and their academic \nachievement.\n  I am not taking the time to go through the various assessments and \nthe progress that has been made, although progress has been made. It \nhas been small, perceptible, but we are on the road to enhancing the \nnumber of children who are going to be able to read satisfactorily to \nbe able to grow in terms of their own future education.\n  What has happened to the reading programs--the reading programs that \ndepend upon volunteers, that depend\n\n[[Page S11400]]\n\nupon local contributions, that depend upon people within the community \nto be a part of these programs where we get such a bang for the buck in \nterms of the scarce resources we put in on the reading for excellence \nprograms that are taking place and are oversubscribed in States around \nthe country--they are effectively slashed with this budget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair. I will have more to say on this on \nMonday. I thank the leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, under the unanimous consent agreement, I \nam to be recognized\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I compliment the distinguished Senator \nfrom Massachusetts for a powerful statement and for his analysis of the \ncurrent education budget and our circumstances here.\n  He has laid out what the ramifications are. People ought to know that \nrhetoric and reality could not be further apart as we listen to our \nRepublican colleagues talk about education. The rhetoric all year long \nhas been: Education is important; education is going to get the \npriority it deserves. The reality is, we are now 1 week away from the \nend of the fiscal year and we have yet to pass an education bill. We \nhave yet to make decisions about what we are going to do on education \nnext year. The decisions we are making--they are making, let me clarify \nthat--that they are making on education are devastating, absolutely \ndevastating.\n  I ask the Senator from Massachusetts, what is his analysis of a $1.5 \nto $2 billion cut in the President's budget this year? I ask the \nSenator from Massachusetts, what would his advice be to the President \nof the United States if he were to get an education budget $2 billion \nbelow his request?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would expect that budget would be vetoed and hope that \nit would be. I think all of us have every expectation that it will be.\n  This President, from the very beginning of his administration, has \nset a series of priorities and he has expressed those. In more recent \ntimes, he has talked about the importance of Medicare, Social Security, \na prescription drug benefit, and targeted tax cuts for needs. He has \nbeen very clear about his priorities. But there has not been a higher \npriority for this President than the issue of education, and he has \nbeen strongly committed to it. I have every expectation this \nlegislation will not pass, nor should it pass.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will ask the Senator from Massachusetts another \nquestion, if I may. He mentioned that one of the most important issues \nwe are facing is the fact that we are dealing with 400,000 new \nstudents. We are dealing with the fact that we will have a shortfall, \nperhaps, in the next few years of 2 million teachers. Yet we see a \nRepublican budget that eliminates the ability for us to help schools \ndeal with class size by absolutely cutting the very programs that allow \nus to reduce class size and improve the student-teacher ratio. I ask \nthe Senator, what do we do with a budget, or what will be the \nramifications of a budget, that fails to recognize the demand for new \nteachers, the extraordinary explosion of new students, and the \novercrowding of schools from South Dakota to Massachusetts? What is the \nmessage this Congress is sending with those facts?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, it basically says to not just the Nation, but to \nthe students that education really isn't so important. If a student \ngoes into a crowded classroom, uses old books, or goes into a classroom \nthat is leaking, or where there are no recreational programs; if a \nstudent goes into these kinds of settings where no music or art is \navailable, we are sending a very powerful message to those children. We \nare saying your education doesn't really count; it doesn't really \nmatter because it doesn't matter to us to try and provide you with the \nkind of classroom, the kind of teachers, the kind of athletic \nfacilities, and other after-school programs that you deserve. We say \nour children are the future, which they are. Children understand, \nchildren are perceptive, and they know when they are getting a second-\nrate deal. That is what they would be getting if the Republican \neducation funding proposal were to pass.\n  Let me finally, in answering this question, mention for the Record \nwhat the President actually said yesterday. I will put the full \nstatement in the Record. He said:\n\n       If the Republicans send me a bill that doesn't live up to \n     our national commitment to education, I won't hesitate to \n     veto it. If it undermines our efforts to hire quality \n     teachers, to reduce class size, or to increase accountability \n     in our public schools, I will veto it.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print the President's radio \naddress in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, so ordered.\n\n    Radio Address of the President to the Nation, September 18, 1999\n\n       The President: Good morning. This month millions of \n     students across America are beginning the last school \n     semester of the 20th century. Today I want to talk about our \n     obligation to give them the education they deserve to succeed \n     in the new century--for more than ever, in this information \n     age, education is the key to individual opportunity and our \n     share of prosperity.\n       That's why, even though we've worked hard to cut spending \n     to balance the budget, we've also nearly doubled our \n     investment in education and training. Many people said we \n     couldn't do it, but we proved them wrong.\n       Today, we have the longest peacetime expansion in our \n     history. After years and years of deficits, we now have \n     budget surpluses for years ahead. More people have a chance \n     to realize the American dream than ever before. More children \n     have the chance to realize their full potential than ever \n     before. We've laid a foundation to preserve our prosperity \n     for future generations.\n       Now, as the budget deadline rapidly approaches this year, \n     we face many of the same tough choices again. And once again, \n     I think the answer is clear: To build a strong nation in the \n     new century, we must continue to invest in our future. That \n     means we must strengthen Social Security, secure and \n     modernize Medicare, pay off the national debt in 15 years, \n     making America debt-free for the first time since 1835. And \n     once again, it means we must invest in education, not \n     sacrifice it.\n       Months ago now, I sent Congress a responsible budget--to \n     maintain our fiscal discipline and honor our commitment to \n     our children's education. So far, the Republicans in Congress \n     haven't put forward a budget of their own. In fact, they're \n     so busy trying to figure out how to pay for their \n     irresponsible tax plan that they're in serious danger of not \n     meeting their obligation to finish the budget by the end of \n     the budget year. Even worse, they're preparing to pay for \n     their own pet projects at the expense of our children's \n     education.\n       We know now that the Republicans' risky tax cut would force \n     us to slash vital funding for education by as much as 50 \n     percent over the next 10 years. But what many people don't \n     know is that next year alone, the Republican plan would cut \n     the bill that funds education by nearly 20 percent.\n       Now, if carried out, this plan would lead to some of the \n     worst cuts in education in our history. More than 5,000 \n     teachers, hired as part of my Class Size Initiative, could be \n     laid off. Fifty thousand students could be turned away from \n     after-school and summer school programs. More than 2 million \n     of our poorest students in our poorest communities would have \n     a smaller chance of success in school and in the workplaces \n     of the future.\n       These aren't just numbers on a balance sheet, they're vital \n     investments in our children and our future. In a time when \n     education is our top priority, Republicans in Congress are \n     making it their lowest priority. So let me be clear: If the \n     Republicans send me a bill that doesn't live up to our \n     national commitment to education, I won't hesitate to veto \n     it. If it undermines our efforts to hire high-quality \n     teachers to reduce class size or to increase accountability \n     in our public schools, I will veto it. If it fails to \n     strengthen Head Start, after-school and summer school \n     programs, I'll veto it. If it underfunds mentoring or college \n     scholarship programs, I will veto it.\n       If it sends me a bill that turns its back on our children \n     and their future, I'll send them back to the drawing board. I \n     won't let Congress push through a budget that's paid for at \n     the expense of our children and our future prosperity.\n       So, again, I ask Congress to put partisanship aside and \n     send me a bill that puts our children's education first. \n     Let's use the last school semester of the 21st century to \n     prepare our children and our nation for excellence in the \n     21st century.\n       Thanks for listening.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Those were the standards that were insisted upon when we \nextended the SEA program, which are having an effect and reflecting \nhigher achievements. They are the smaller classes where the most \ncomprehensive study of any education program was done, smaller classes \nin the State of Tennessee, the STARS Program. We should universally \nrecognize the important academic achievement of those children who \nstarted out with a smaller class size in grades 1 through 3, and about \nthe importance of higher quality teachers, which was at the heart of \nthe Higher Education Extension Act that we passed 2 years ago. He\n\n[[Page S11401]]\n\nsaid he would veto it. I welcome the fact.\n  The President continues:\n\n       If it fails to strengthen Head Start, after-school, or \n     summer school programs, I will veto it. And if it underfunds \n     mentoring or college scholarship programs, I will veto it.\n\n  It looks like this bill has about 8 vetoes coming up.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I appreciate the Senator's answer. I appreciate his \nputting that statement in the Record.\n  I think the message is clear. We have a unanimous consent request we \nwill be making momentarily. First, let me just say this bill will not \nbe signed into law so long as we have the necessary votes to sustain \nthat veto when it comes to the floor.\n  I am happy to yield to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from South Dakota. Of course, I join \nhim in his tribute to our colleague from the State of Massachusetts. \nSenator Kennedy has been a leader on education as long as he has served \nin the Senate. His speech about the demands of education in the 21st \ncentury and how we in Congress have failed to meet those obligations, I \nthink, will become part of the permanent record of this body, and they \nshould inspire us.\n  My question to the Senator from South Dakota is, if you go across \nAmerica--any pollster, Republican, Democrat, or otherwise--and ask \nAmerican families what is the No. 1 priority, they say the first \npriority in their lives is education--over and over and over again. It \nis almost a reflex response from American families.\n  I ask the Senator from South Dakota the following: How can this be \nthe first priority of American families and the dead-last priority in \nthis Congress? The Senator from South Dakota eloquently spoke earlier \nabout the use of this budget for schools as an ``ATM machine.'' For \nmonths, we have seen appropriations subcommittee after subcommittee \npulling billions of dollars out of the education budget for a variety \nof uses. Some of them are very good. But I question whether any of them \nmeet the level of importance of education to the people of America and \nto the families.\n  I ask the Senator how we can find ourselves in these predicaments \nwhere the speeches say education is a first priority, the people say \neducation is a first priority, and this Senate, this Congress makes it \ndead last in the priority list.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I think the Senator asks an excellent question. The \nanswer is they are not listening. They are not listening. When you \npropose a tax cut of the magnitude they proposed, gutting education by \n50 percent--a tax cut the American people have said they don't want, \nthey don't care about--and then take money they do care about and pay \nfor that tax cut, it is an amazing thing to me. That is the most \nstartling aspect of all of this.\n  What they care about is how educated their children are going to be, \nthey care about what kind of a classroom they are going to have, they \ncare about what kind of a school the children are going to walk into, \nthey care about whether there is an afterschool program, they care \nabout whether schools are safe, they care about whether or not they are \ngoing to have good teachers, and they care about whether or not they \nare going to be able to go to college. That is what they care about, \nand they tell us that in the polls.\n  So it is baffling to many of us why what we care about doesn't seem \nto be reflected in the laundry list of deep cuts, if not eliminations, \nof the very programs that do exactly what the American people care \nabout.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield again. I ask the Senator this: \nThis country has seen, unfortunately, episodes of violence in schools. \nIt is a national tragedy. Columbine High School transfixed America as \nwe focused on safety in schools. We considered a juvenile justice bill \non the floor of the Senate and passed it, thanks to the vote of Vice \nPresident Gore, which would move us forward toward making our society \nand our schools safer. It died hopelessly in the House. We are still \nwaiting for any indication of life on this bill.\n  Is it not true that if the Republican budget cuts go through on \neducation, we will not only be cutting the money for schools to use for \nsafe and drug-free schools, but we also will be dramatically reducing \nafterschool program opportunities? We don't live in a society any \nlonger of Ozzie and Harriet and the Brady Bunch. Kids get off school at \n3 o'clock and nobody is home. Are they going to be supervised? Are they \ngoing to have a meaningful experience?\n  The President wanted 1.4 million more students in America to have an \nafterschool program. Across the State of Illinois--and I bet in South \nDakota--that is an immensely popular idea. It is my understanding that \nthe Republican House bill on education would cut existing afterschool \nprograms and turn 50,000 kids loose at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, with \nno supervision, no opportunity for doing homework or learning a new \nskill, or learning to use a musical instrument. How can we, on one \nhand, beat our breasts about what happens at Columbine High School, and \nthen turn around in the budget and eliminate the resources needed so \nthat kids can have a better and safer experience in school?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, that is exactly the question millions of \nAmericans have to be asking once they analyze their budget. I can't \ntell you the number of times that law enforcement officials, teachers, \nand parents have come to me and said: Look. We all know the most \nvulnerable time for students is when they leave school. The most \nvulnerable time statistically--the time when most damage may be done \nand when most violations of law occur--is that period between 2 and 8 \nin the evening.\n  Obviously, we need as a society to come up with ways to effectively \nengage students and young people during that time when both parents may \nbe working, during that time when the schools are closed.\n  What do our Republican colleagues do? Under the current framework, \nthey would have to reduce the availability of programs for exactly that \npurpose. Again, it shows rhetoric and reality are so far apart.\n  The real sad tragedy is that the students are going to feel the brunt \nof this. Once we lose a student, it is hard to get him or her back. I \ndon't know who but someone once said, ``It is much easier to build a \nchild than to repair an adult.''\n  We are going to be doing a lot of reparation and very little building \nwith this kind of a budget. We need to be building kids and not \nrepairing adults. This is not a budget to build children.\n  That is why we are fighting as hard as we are, and that is why we \nwill continue to fight until we get those numbers turned around.\n  I know that our colleagues are prepared to offer an amendment, the \nSenators from Virginia.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am proud to support Senator Daschle's \namendment on education.\n  We were forced to forage for funds for the VA-HUD bill. The spending \ncaps have put us in a terrible position, we have had to pit one group \nagainst another, and one of the biggest losers in this battle has been \neducation.\n  There are three important things we need to do to get behind our \nkids, our teachers and our parents: 100,000 new teachers and \ncounselors; technology in the classroom; and afterschool programs.\n  One of the best things we can do for our kids is to get 100,000 new \nteachers in the classroom. Smaller classes means that kids will get \nbetter supervision.\n  This is important for all kids, not just the ones that get into \ntrouble; all children need help, some children just need extra help.\n  We want to make schools safe places without making them Fortress \nAmerica. We need to support our teachers by hiring 100,000 new nurses \nand by hiring social workers and counselors. 100,000 new nurses in \nschools will promote early detection of warning signs.\n  I just visited a school where 75 percent of the children there were \non medication. The nurse is oftentimes the first line of defense for \nwhen kids need extra help. Some of the frustration from kids stems from \nmedical problems. Without nurses in the schools, these unnoticed \nmedical conditions can lead to truancy and trouble. We need the experts \nin the schools who can deal with conflict resolution.\n  We also need structured after-school activities for kids that \ninvolves community based programs. We need to support our parents and \nmake sure parents have the flexibility in the workplace to spend time \nwith their children\n\n[[Page S11402]]\n\nafter school. They need leave time. By the way, they also need a \npatients bill of rights that provides access to medical insurance for \npeople that don't have it.\n  And we also need technology in the classrooms; computers in the \nschools, training for our teachers and our students so they are \nprepared to cross the digital divide and are ready for the 21st \ncentury. I look forward to fighting for you and getting behind our \nkids, our parents and our schools.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, on January 6 of this year, the Majority \nLeader stood on the Senate Floor and told us that education would be a \nhigh priority for the Senate. This is what he said:\n\n       Education is going to be a central issue this year. \n     Democrats say it is important and it will be a high priority. \n     Republicans say it will be a high priority.\n\n  I don't think the Republican Leadership can make that claim today.\n  We are now less than five legislative days--and that's counting \nMondays and Fridays--before the end of the fiscal year, and there is \none education bill that must be enacted--the education appropriations \nbill.\n  Yet, despite proclamations that education would be a top priority, \nthe Senate has been working on all but one of the thirteen \nappropriations bills. The only one left--the one that is now dead \nlast--is the education bill. Mr. President, this is the wrong priority.\n  Despite a valiant effort by the Chairman of the subcommittee--Senator \nSpecter--the education appropriations bill has not even been written. \nSenator Specter has fought every day to move the bill. He tried in \nJune, July, August, September. He tried last week.\n  And, if that isn't bad enough, the leadership has robbed the \neducation bill to pay for the others. As a result, we are looking at \ndeep cuts in all of the programs funded by the Labor, Health and Human \nServices and Education appropriations bill.\n  Not only is education dead last on the calendar, education is dead \nlast for resources. Our subcommittee started with an allocation \nsubstantially below a freeze from last year. Now, it is even worse.\n  Last week, the leadership staged a raid on education. They took \nanother $7.276 billion in budget authority and $4.969 billion in \noutlays from education and other essential priorities in the bill.\n  So now, our subcommittee allocation is $15.5 billion below a freeze. \nThat means we are faced with cutting education programs a whopping 17%.\n  What does a 17% cut mean? It means that 5,246 of the new teachers we \nhired to reduce class size will be fired. A 17% cut means that 142,000 \nstudents will be cut from the Head Start program. This cut means 2.1 \nmillion children will lose the extra help they receive from the Title I \nprogram to master the basics of reading and math. That is where we \ncurrently stand in the Senate.\n  Yesterday, the House education appropriations subcommittee passed the \nFY 2000 bill. The news for education is not good. Under the House bill, \nU.S. schools will receive less money next year than last by $200 \nmillion. The bill falls $1.4 billion short of the President's budget \nrequest for the activities funded by the Department of Education and \nprovides $500 million less for Head Start.\n  The bill eliminates funding for the initiative to reduce class size \nso 30,000 will get pink slips next spring.\n  The bill cut funding for education technology; froze funding for the \nTitle I reading and math program and terminated the School to Work \nprogram.\n  In addition, the bill cut, from current levels, funding for vital job \ntraining programs by $700 million because unemployment is low. Training \nprograms do not only help workers when they lose a job but also help \nworkers upgrade and improve their job skills to compete in the \ninternational marketplace.\n  The gap between the rich and poor continues to grow and the key to \nreducing this disparity is to help workers improve their job skills. \nAnd yet, the House bill slashes funds to help workers upgrade their \nskills as we enter the new millenium.\n  Last week, the Assistant Majority Leader said we should not be \nincreasing funding for education. He was making a hypothetical \nstatement about the education appropriations bill.\n  The picture is becoming clear. The record is replete with statements \nfrom the other side talking about education as a priority. We now find \nthose words are not even worth the paper on which they are written. The \nHouse has cut education, and the Assistant Majority Leader has \nconcurred.\n  The Republican leadership found $16 billion for the Pentagon. That's \n$4 billion more than DOD even asked for! And they found real money.\n  But when it comes to education, we get platitudes and promises. The \nchildren of America deserve better.\n  That's why we are offering this Sense of the Senate resolution. 17% \ncuts are unacceptable. Such cuts will savage our schools\n  We must have significant new investments in education. There are more \nchildren in our public schools than at any time in our history and we \nmust not turn our backs on them.\n  We must keep our promise to help local school reduce class size. We \nmust help keep our children safe by significantly increasing our \ninvestment in after school programs. We must increase our investments \nin IDEA and the Title I reading and math program. And we must help \nmodernize our nation's crumbling schools. This resolution makes it \nclear that education will be a priority not just in words, but in deed.\n  Actions by the Republican majority in Congress directly contradict \nthe priorities of the American people. It is time to free the education \nspending bill and make the necessary investments in education.\n  I urge my friends on the other side of the aisle to listen to the \nAmerican people. Let us not get into another protracted battle over the \neducation budget. I urge adoption of the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the two \nSenators from Virginia have an issue they would like to raise. Then I \nwould like to, on behalf of Senator Bond, with Senator Mikulski, \nproceed with a managers' amendment.\n  First, we would like to hear from the Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. Senator Robb and I \nhave joined on an amendment. The Senator will introduce the amendment. \nI would like to address it. I think to show courtesy it is first on \nSenator Robb's watch, and then I will follow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1791\n\n   (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that the decline in \n  funding for aeronautics research and development should be reversed)\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment will \nbe set aside, and the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia (Mr. ROBB), for himself, Mr. \n     Warner, and Mr. DeWine, proposes an amendment numbered 1791.\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING AERONAUTICS RESEARCH.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) Every aircraft worldwide uses and benefits from NASA \n     technology.\n       (2) Aeronautical research has fostered the establishment of \n     a safe, affordable air transportation system that is second \n     to none.\n       (3) Fundamental research in aeronautics is not being \n     supported anywhere in the country outside of NASA.\n       (4) The Department of Transportation predicts that air \n     traffic will triple over the next twenty years, exacerbating \n     current noise and safety problems at already overcrowded \n     airports. New aeronautics advancements need to be developed \n     if costs are to be contained and the safety and quality of \n     our air infrastructure is to be improved.\n       (5) Our military would not dominate the skies without \n     robust investments in aeronautics research and development.\n       (6) Technology transferred from NASA aeronautics research \n     to the commercial sector has created billions of dollars in \n     economic growth.\n       (7) The American aeronautics industry is the top \n     contributor to the U.S. balance of trade, with a net \n     contribution of more than $41 billion in 1998.\n\n[[Page S11403]]\n\n       (8) Less than ten years ago, American airplane producers \n     controlled over 70% of the global market for commercial \n     aviation.\n       (9) America's dominance in the world's civil aviation \n     market is being challenged by foreign companies like Airbus, \n     which now has approximately 50% of the world's civil aviation \n     market, and is aiming to capture 70%.\n       (10) The rise of foreign competition in the global civil \n     aviation market has coincided with decreases in NASA's \n     aeronautics research budget and a corresponding increase in \n     European investment.\n       (11) NASA's aeronautics laboratories have the research \n     facilities, including wind tunnels, and technical expertise \n     to conduct the cutting-edge scientific inquiry needed to \n     advance state-of-the-art military and civil aircraft.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the United States should increase its commitment to \n     aeronautics research funding.\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I yield to my distinguished senior Senator \nfor remarks. He has important questions. I will pick up with my remarks \nas soon as he last concluded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, last week the Senate Appropriations Committee \ncompleted action on the appropriations bill for a number of Federal \nagencies including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. I \ncommend Senator Bond and Senator Stevens for their efforts to support \nthe full request for NASA in the midst of extreme budget pressures. The \nNASA funding in the Senate bill will face a stiff challenge in the \nconference with the House, however. I want to take this occasion to \nreflect on the importance of investment in research and development in \nthe NASA budget to civilian and military aeronautics.\n  The aerospace industry in the United States has undergone a dramatic \ntransition in the last ten years. In 1986, 70 percent of the sales of \nthis industry were to the government, primarily for the defense market. \nLess than 30 percent of the business base of the industry consisted of \ncommercial products. At that time, Federal research and development \nsupporting aerospace technology was largely funded by the Defense \nDepartment.\n  Today, the situation has reversed. The defense portion of U.S. \naerospace business is at 29 percent, and the defense share continues to \nshrink. Although Federal funding for military-unique hardware will \nalways be needed in the interests of national security, non-defense \nresearch from agencies such as NASA is growing in importance to the \nindustry. Nearly 70 percent of aerospace sales are in the commercial \narena, and 41 percent of aerospace production in this country is for \nexport.\n  As we grow increasingly concerned about monthly trade balance \nfigures, the importance of these aerospace exports for our national \neconomy grows. The aerospace industry was responsible for $59 billion \nin exports and $22 billion in imports in 1997. This resulted in a \npositive trade balance of $37 billion--the single biggest trade balance \nof any sector in the entire American economy. In 1998, our exports grew \nto $64 billion in equipment with total imports of $23 billion. The \nindustry trade surplus of $41 billion has widened the gap between the \naerospace industry and all other sectors. Make no mistake; we are \ncompeting in an aggressive global marketplace. Technological leadership \nis absolutely essential if the U.S. aerospace industry is to continue \nsuccessfully competing in an increasingly complex and sophisticated \nworld economy.\n  Some long-term trends for the health of the aerospace industry are \ntroubling, however. There has been a dramatic reduction in Federal \naerospace R funding. During the Carter administration, we invested 18 \npercent of our R funding in the U.S. aerospace community. That amount \nincreased to 21 percent during the Reagan years. Today, it is only 8 \npercent and declining.\n  The reductions have been even more severe in certain specific areas. \nThe aeronautics budget in NASA has declined from $920 million in fiscal \nyear 1998 to $620 million in the request for fiscal year 2000, a \nreduction of almost a third over just three years! Reducing research \nand development funding for this vital industry runs counter to all of \nour historical economic experience.\n  We are experiencing a time of tremendous economic expansion in our \ncountry, but we seem to have forgotten the tremendous role R plays in \nsustaining this growth. Alan Greenspan recently testified that rapid \ntechnological change has made a significant contribution and is a major \nforce in this expansion. We cannot, and as long as I am a Member of the \nUnited States Senate, we will not forget this!\n  In 1804, the venerable president from Virginia, Thomas Jefferson, \nwith the full support of Congress, set in motion the first official \nexploration of our new frontier. He boldly sanctioned the Lewis & Clark \nexpedition not only to map the new territories of the United States, \nbut also to satisfy an American passion for discovery--the same passion \nthat has led our country to be the leader among nations. That first \nstep paved the way for today's exploration of the solar system, the \ncontinued exploration of communication technologies, and the future \nexploration of the planet Mars.\n  The very year the United States landed a man on the moon, the \nDepartment of Defense had begun to work on a new technological concept \nthat is now coming into its own. I speak of the Internet that is \ntransforming the structure of our economic life. The technological \nwonders that support our national security and fuel our economic growth \nwere not invented overnight. We must be prepared to weather the slow \nand often tedious process of design and development of products and \nsystems necessary to bring them to maturity.\n  It is no different in aeronautics. I am concerned that without a \nnational strategy for aeronautics R investment, we will gradually \nlose the technological edge of which we are so proud and which is key \nto our competitiveness in the global economy and our security as a \nnation. We should not delude ourselves; America will lose its \npreeminence in aeronautics unless we adequately fund aeronautics \nresearch at NASA.\n\n  For instance, the Appropriations Committee in the House recently cut \nthe NASA budget so severely that it will cause a major employment \nproblem and will devastate advanced technology programs so carefully \nplanned for implementation. The House reduced NASA numbers by $1 \nbillion in order to pay for more housing and veteran programs. I \nappreciate the position facing the Appropriators, but to halt some 30-\nscience programs in their tracks and halt vital research in the \naeronautics area is nothing short of foolhardy. I applaud the recent \naction of the Senate Appropriation's Subcommittee in reversing this \nHouse action and urge all of my colleagues in the Senate to insure the \nSenate position prevails in the coming conference.\n  Programs such as those at NASA cannot be turned off and on like a \nlight switch. It takes time to realize the fruits of our labors. We \nmust not so cavalierly cancel programs and efforts just as they are \nbeginning. A reduction of the magnitude proposed by the House will \ndevastate both research in astronautics and aeronautics in this \ncountry.\n  In my travels through Virginia over the recess, I was made aware of \nthe real effect of reductions in the NASA aeronautics R budget \nproposed by the House of Representatives. I visited the NASA facility \nin Langley, Virginia that leads the nation in aeronautical research and \naviation safety technology. It has led this nation in aeronautical \nbreakthroughs from the development of the super critical wing used on \nmany commercial aircraft flying today, to the development of a new \ncollision-avoidance aircraft system for the FAA. This is the center \nthat gave us the magnificent leaders of our Manned Space Program like \nDr. Bob Gilruth, Dr. Chris Kraft, Dr. Max Faget, and many others who \nleft Langley to lead our Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs. NASA \nLangley has exemplified a passion for excellence from its earliest days \nwhen it conducted research to produce safe, more efficient and \ntechnically superior aircraft for both the military and commercial \nmarkets.\n  Given that 70 percent of NASA Langley programs are funded through the \nNASA aeronautics budget, the future of this national resource is in \ndoubt unless Congress and the Administration can find ways to reverse \nthe severe reductions to this part of our national R effort.\n\n[[Page S11404]]\n\n  This nation's leadership in aerospace is not an accident of history, \nMr. President. It was made possible by dedicated leaders who looked \nbeyond the present and dreamed of the future that could be. People like \nthose at Langley and throughout NASA. We must not forsake this global \nleadership in aeronautics technology. We must work together to balance \ncritical priorities and provide the leadership, sacrifice, and enduring \ncommitment to technology, research, and most of all learning. We must \ncontinue to fund a robust R program through these agencies.\n  Let me close, Mr. President, with a final thought. As Chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee, I am keenly aware of the challenges our \nmilitary forces face as they attempt to maintain our security in the \nface of ever declining resources. Part of the strategy of our \nleadership at the Department of Defense is to save resources by buying \ncommercial aerospace products wherever possible. This dependence on the \ncommercial marketplace is increasing dramatically. Because of this \nthere is an increasing security dimension to the R we accomplish at \nNASA. This is yet another reason to insure that the effort is funded \nproperly.\n  Mr. President, my concern is as follows.\n  This very important appropriations bill which I will support contains \nthe basic funding for NASA. My concern is that within the NASA budget \nthere is a growing decline and emphasis on research and development \nfunds for aerospace. I say marshal the aerospace industry as it relates \nto civil aircraft and military aircraft. Frankly, the rush to get to \nspace, the rush to develop the space station--I must say components of \nthat are being made in my State--concern me greatly as I see the \nfollowing.\n  Some long-term trends for the health of the aerospace industry are \ntroubling.\n  There has been a dramatic reduction in Federal aerospace R funding.\n  During the Carter administration, we invested 18 percent of our R \nfunding in the U.S. aerospace community. That amount increased to 21 \npercent during the years under President Ronald Reagan. Today, that \ncategory of R is only 8 percent and continuing to decline. The funds \nare being siphoned off into the space program.\n  This Chamber will be in recess probably in several hours. Seventy-\nplus percent of my colleagues are going to depend on civil aviation to \ntransport themselves back to their home districts and their States for \ncontinuation of the business in the Senate. I am among them.\n  I visited Langley Research Center just a short time ago. There I saw \na test bed of a program which the technicians told me--these are not \npoliticians, these are trained technicians--Senator, if we can continue \nour funding, we are going to come up with the software and the hardware \nwhich, hopefully, can reduce by over 50 percent the accidents that \nplanes experience every day in either the landing or the take-off \nphases. Therein is the high risk in aviation. That same research and \ndevelopment can be applied to our military aircraft. It is common to \nboth aircraft. It is a very small amount of money.\n  Fortunately, I received the assurance from the NASA Administrator \nwhen he visited my office a few days ago that the program will stay \nintact.\n  I cited other programs in here, such as noise reduction. More and \nmore the airports are growing around the highly populated areas, and \nnoise becomes a problem. At National Airport it is a very significant \nproblem.\n  Again, a relatively small amount of money can make a difference in \nyears to come--a small amount in comparison to the enormous sums of \nmoney going towards the space station and other related infrastructure. \nWe will get to space someday. But in the meantime, we cannot turn our \nbacks on civil aviation.\n  Our exports on civil aviation products--largely airplanes--is one of \nthe biggest, positive factors in our ever-declining balance of trade. \nIt is a major offset.\n  I am pleased to join my distinguished colleague in offering this \namendment. It has been my intention, frankly, to go for a cut--a \nspecific cut.\n  But I have been in consultation with the distinguished Senator from \nMaryland, the distinguished Senator from Missouri, the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, and the chairman of the committee, Mr. Stevens.\n  First, they made a heroic effort to get more money back into these \naccounts. They are being watchful of the same problems that concern me.\n\n  So I decided to withdraw my amendment which would have gone to \nspecific cuts to fund what I believe would be an adequate amount.\n  I am now going to join my distinguished colleague, Mr. Robb, in \nanother approach on this.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, thank you. I thank my distinguished senior \ncolleague from Virginia.\n  Mr. President, I wanted to take a minute or two to discuss the item \nthat my senior Senator has just alluded to, which, in my judgment, is \ncritical.\n  I begin by saying that it is an area of research and development that \nis of enormous importance to every American who lives by an airport, \nevery American who is concerned with our Nation's defense, and every \nAmerican who flies on a regular basis, as all of our colleagues do. \nThat issue is aeronautics research and development.\n  Since the time of the Wright Brothers, American's commitment to \naeronautics research and development has brought extraordinary returns \non our Nation's military superiority and the rise in affordable \npassenger air travel. Both can be attributed directly to our \ninvestments in aeronautical research.\n  In addition, aerospace products are America's top manufactured export \ncommodity and are the top contributors to the positive side of the U.S. \nbalance of trade.\n  Air traffic is predicted to triple over the next 20 years. As our \nskies become more crowded and our airports noisier, aeronautics \nresearch continues to grow in importance. If we are to improve the \nsafety, efficiency, and performance of our air travel system, we are \ngoing to need to develop new aeronautics, new aeronautics concepts, and \nnew aeronautics designs and technologies that can better respond to the \ngrowing demands of our aeronautics infrastructure.\n  In addition, America's aerospace industry is facing a fierce \nchallenge from the European consortium, Airbus which has now captured \nover 50 percent of the world market that American airplane products and \nproducers once dominated.\n\n  At a time when there is a clear need for new investments in this \nfield and near unanimous support in our country for new investments in \nbasic research, it is troubling that our commitment to aeronautics \nresearch has been waning. Funding for aeronautics research was cut by \n$151 million from 1998 to 1999, and this year the President proposed to \ncut it by an additional $150 million. That is a 30-percent reduction in \njust 2 years.\n  Even more worrisome is the fact that the House cut an additional $1 \nbillion out of NASA's budget, placing the future of NASA aeronautics \nresearch and critical facilities such as NASA's Langley Research Center \nin great danger. For more than 80 years, the Langley Research Center in \nHampton, VA, has been at the forefront of aeronautics research and \npioneered innovations that are present in every plane in the air today, \ninnovations that have affected and are important to every plane that \nflies today. Its facilities are one of a kind. If this center were \nclosed, the United States would lose its most valuable resource for \nimproving aircraft safety and performance.\n  Senator Warner and I have worked closely with Senators Bond and \nMikulski over the past few months to strengthen our commitment to \naeronautics research. I am grateful to both of them that they have \nrestored many of the severe cuts that were proposed by the House. I am \nstill disappointed, however, that more money has not been set aside for \naeronautics research. We have reached an understanding with the \nchairman and ranking member that further increases will be considered \nin conference.\n  With that, I am very pleased to join the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Virginia in offering this amendment. It is my understanding it has \nbeen agreed to on both sides. I note that the distinguished chairman of \nthe committee,\n\n[[Page S11405]]\n\nthe senior Senator from Alaska, probably spends more time in the air \nthan any other Senator in this body.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia. \nSenator Robb is correct; we have a great interest in this amendment. I \nhave had some personal conversations with the Administrator of NASA, \nDan Goldin, about this very subject. I am delighted that the two \nSenators from Virginia have brought it to the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I think the comments by both Senators from Virginia \nare, indeed, meritorious. I think our side is prepared to accept the \namendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I do believe it is important that we emphasize the \ncritical nature of this research. It is critical not only to the \npresent but to the future of aviation, and not just commercial aviation \nbut general aviation in many ways.\n  With the support of the Senator from Maryland, on behalf of Senator \nBond, I am happy to accept this amendment, and I ask it be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1791) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n            UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--AMENDMENT NO. 1790\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. On behalf of the leader, I ask unanimous consent the \npending amendment be withdrawn and the text of amendment No. 1790 be \nsubmitted at the desk in the form of a Senate resolution and placed on \nthe calendar. I further ask unanimous consent that Senator Lott be \nrecognized to offer a similar sense-of-the-Senate resolution and it be \nplaced on the calendar.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that at 3:30 p.m. on Monday the \nSenate resume both resolutions concurrently, there be 1 hour of debate \non each resolution to be equally divided between the two leaders, and a \nvote occur on or in relation to the Lott resolution at 5:30, to be \nfollowed immediately thereafter by a vote on or in relation to the \nDaschle resolution, and that all of the previous occur without any \nintervening action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 1792 Through 1802, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. On behalf of Senator Bond and Senator Mikulski, I send a \npackage of amendments to the desk and ask for their immediate \nconsideration en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, these items have been cleared on both \nsides and are not controversial and include the following items:\n  An amendment on behalf of Senator Feinstein requiring EPA to form a \nstudy and plan related to leaking underground storage tanks;\n  A Smith amendment extending the comment period by 90 days for the EPA \nproposed rulemaking related to total maximum daily loads;\n  A Breaux amendment extending for 1 year the Coastal Wetlands \nPlanning, Protection, and Restoration Act, otherwise known as the \nBreaux Act;\n  A Chafee amendment with numerous cosponsors funding the Montreal \nProtocol Fund within EPA's budget, through an across-the-board cut to \nEPA accounts;\n  A Gramm of Texas amendment relating to the funding of the Office of \nFederal Housing Enterprise Oversight;\n  A Dodd-Bennett amendment related to funding of local governments for \nY2K conversion costs;\n  A Bond-Lautenberg technical correction to section 430;\n  A Bond amendment addressing HUD staffing levels;\n  A Hutchison amendment on storm water studies;\n  A Coverdell amendment regarding housing for private school teachers;\n  Finally, an amendment dealing with EPA pesticide tolerance fees, \nincluded on behalf of Senator Craig, which has been cleared by the \nAgriculture Committee on both sides.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, we concur with the managers' amendment \nas presented by the Senator from Alaska and are prepared to accept it.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent those amendments \nbe agreed to en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendments will be \nconsidered en bloc, agreed to en bloc, and appropriately numbered.\n  The amendments agreed to en bloc are as follows:\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 1792\n\n   (Purpose: To improve the regulation of underground storage tanks)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANKS.\n\n       Not later than May 1, 2000, in administering the \n     underground storage tank program under subtitle I of the \n     Solid Waste Disposal Act (42 U.S.C. 6991 et seq.), the \n     Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall \n     develop a plan (including cost estimates)--\n       (1) to identify underground storage tanks that are not in \n     compliance with subtitle I of the Solid Waste Disposal Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 6991 et seq.) (including regulations);\n       (2) to identify underground storage tanks in temporary \n     closure;\n       (3) to determine the ownership of underground storage tanks \n     described in paragraphs (1) and (2);\n       (4) to determine the plans of owners and operators of \n     underground storage tanks described in paragraphs (1) and (2) \n     to bring the underground storage tanks into compliance or out \n     of temporary closure; and\n       (5) in a case in which the owner of an underground storage \n     tank described in paragraph (1) or (2) cannot be identified--\n       (A) to bring the underground storage tank into compliance; \n     or\n       (B) to permanently close the underground storage tank.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am offering an amendment to \nrequire the Environmental Protection Agency to develop a plan by May 1, \n2000 for bringing all underground storage tanks into compliance with \nfederal safety requirements.\n  Why do we need this amendment?\n  Leaking underground storage tanks are the leading source of \ngroundwater contamination and petroleum is the most common substance \nleaking out. Most of the 825,000 regulated underground tanks in this \ncountry store petroleum products, from the local gas station on your \nneighborhood corner to the industrial complex using a large motor \nfleet.\n  I am offering this amendment to make underground storage tanks safe \nas a way to stop the contamination of drinking water by the gasoline \nadditive MTBE.\n  What is MTBE? MTBE is methyl tertiary butyl ether, a gasoline \nadditive. It is used by most refiners to make oxygenated or \nreformulated gasoline. It is the oxygenate of choice by refiners who \nsell gasoline in areas that need clean-burning gasoline to meet or \nmaintain clean air standards. The major way MTBE gets into groundwater \nis from defective underground tanks storing petroleum products.\n  What's Wrong with MTBE?\n  Unlike other components of gasoline, MTBE does not biodegrade; it has \na taste like terpentine and smells like paint thinner; it gravels \nquickly; it is expensive to cleanup ($1 million per well in \nCalifornia). MTBE is carcinogenic in animals and according to U.S. EPA, \n``has a human carcinogenic hazard potential.'' Dr. John Froines, a \ndistinguished UCLA scientist, testified at a California EPA hearing on \nFebruary 23, 1999 as follows:\n\n       We in our (University of California) report have concluded \n     the cancer evidence in animals is relevant to humans. There \n     are `acute effects in occupationally exposed workers \n     including headaches, dizziness, nausea, eye and respiratory \n     irritation, vomiting, sensation of spaciness or \n     disorientation and burning of the nose and throat.\n\n  MTBE exposure was associated with excess cancers in rats and mice, \ntherefore, multi-species,'' and he cited ``multiple endpoints, \nlymphoma, leukemia testicular cancer, liver and kidney. All four of the \ntumor sites observed in animals may be predictive of human cancer \nrisk.''\n  Where is MTBE?\n  The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory studied underground tank \nsites in California and concluded that ``a minimum estimate of the \nnumber of MTBE-impacted sites in California is greater than 10,000.'' \nThe Association of California Water Agencies has also found MTBE at \nover 10,000 sites and in many of the state's surface water reservoirs. \nBecause of widespread contamination, California Governor Gray\n\n[[Page S11406]]\n\nDavis ordered a phaseout of MTBE by December 31, 2002. A major \nUniversity of California study has called for a phaseout. A top-level, \nEPA ``Blue Ribbon'' panel of experts in July recommended reducing the \nuse of MTBE.\n  Nationally, while there is no comprehensive study, we do know that \nMTBE has been found in drinking water in many states, including Maine, \nPennsylvania, Virginia, Texas, Kansas, New York, New Jersey, Georgia, \nAlabama, Colorado, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Delaware, and Arizona. \nA U.S. EPA-funded study by the University of Massachusetts found MTBE \nin 251 of 422 public wells in 19 states.\n\n  Are Tanks Safe?\n  On December 22, 1998, all underground storage tanks had to meet \nfederal safety requirements. EPA has said that tanks that do not meet \nstandards can be placed into temporary closure until December 22, 1999 \nat which point they must be upgraded or permanently closed. Under the \nlaw, noncomplying tanks can be fined $11,000 per day per violation. The \nsafety requirements address tank integrity, design, installation; leak \ndetection, spill and overfill control. Tank owners had ten years to \nmeet the deadline.\n  Here are the facts:\n  1. Many tanks are still unsafe: Many underground tanks containing \ngasoline still out of compliance with federal safety regulations. In \nthe country, around 165,000 tanks (20 percent of the total) are out of \ncompliance, according to EPA. In my state, approximately 1,900 (3 \npercent) are not safe.\n  2. Many tanks are sitting empty, in temporary closure--74,250 in the \ncountry (9 percent) and 10,430 (10 percent) in California. These tanks \nare just sitting there in limbo. EPA considers the tanks that are in \ntemporary closure to be ``in compliance'' for now and this is one way \ntank owners ``met the deadline'' for compliance. These tanks' ultimate \nuse needs to be determined. Someone needs to decide whether to close \nthem permanently or upgrade them.\n  3. EPA has funds to act. The Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund has \n$1.6 billion in it. This bill appropriates $71.6 million, the \nPresident's request. The fund is financed by a 0.1 cent per gallon \nmotor fuels tax which began in 1987, that generates about $150 million \na year. The American motorist is paying this tax and in doing so, \nexpects it to be used for the purposes authorized.\n  4. Even new tanks are not safe. A July 1999 study by the Santa Clara \nValley Water district of its groundwater supplies found that even with \nthe new upgrades, required by federal law by December 22, 1998, the new \nsystems are not preventing MTBE contamination. The study, entitled \n``Investigation of MTBE Occurrence Associated with Operating UST \nSystems,'' concluded, of 28 sites in Santa Clara county that have new \nor upgraded tank systems, the majority of which have not had previous \ngasoline contamination, 13 have evidence of MTBE in groundwater because \nof improper installation, operation or maintenance. The study says, \n``These data indicate that MTBE may be present in ground water at \napproximately 50 percent of the UST facilities that meet 1998 upgrade \nrequirements within Santa Clara County.'' Officials were clear: \n``Immediate improvements are warranted.'' To me this says, enforce the \nlaw.\n  Similarly, in testimony in the House of Representatives on May 6, \n1999 officials of the Natural Resources Defense Council made this \nimportant point:\n  ``. . . if gasoline contains oxygenates, future gasoline tank leaks \ninvolving MTBE appear inevitable. Even new tanks will eventually fail \nthrough material aging, operator error and accident.''\n  5. Contamination growing, unknown?\n  As I mentioned, California has had 10,000 groundwater sites impacted, \nas documented by the Lawrence Livermore study. Many of the state's \nreservoirs and surface waters have been impacted. At South Lake Tahoe, \n20 percent of the water supply has been eliminated; $2 million has been \nspent to address it. MTBE is less than 1,000 feet from the lake. Santa \nMonica lost 75 percent of its groundwater supply because of MTBE. Their \nwater system has been decimated and they will spend up to $150 million \nto clean up.\n\n  In a disturbing August 16 story, the New York Times reported last \nyear, the state of New York compiled a ``public list'' of 1,500 MTBE \ncontaminated sites, but the actual number on an ``internal list'' is \ncloser to 7,000 sites, more than three times that reported. So this \nsuggests that we really do not know the extent of MTBE contamination.\n\n\n                           time to fix tanks\n\n  EPA and the states should take steps to make tanks safe. This \namendment merely says, come up with a plan: identify the tanks, their \nowners, their status and bring the tank into compliance or close it. \nEnforce the law.\n  EPA reported last week they ``have no information from their \nregions'' on enforcement actions, that there is no formal schedule or \nofficial framework for finding out what enforcement actions are being \ntaken in (1) EPA regional offices or (2) in the states. We could obtain \nno national list, for example, of enforcement cases, citations, \nadministrative orders or fines.\n  Today I did receive some information for region 9, the EPA region in \nwhich California is located. In this region, since the December 22, \n1998 deadline, of 71,686 underground storage tanks, 80 have been \ninspected. Twenty-three citations have been issued. These actions, \naccording to EPA, are ``informal enforcement,'' not ``formal \nenforcement.'' The citations are like a traffic ticket and usually give \nowners 30 days to comply. It appears that the ``formal'' enforcement \nmechanism, levying the $11,000 per violation fine, is not being used.\n  I also received an EPA memo signed by Sammy Ng, of the Office of \nUnderground Storage Tanks, dated April 13, 1999, which says:\n\n       At the end of the first half of FY 99, states and regions \n     have reported over 385,000 confirmed releases. States, \n     regions and responsible parties initiated cleanups at 84 \n     percent of these sites and completed cleanups at about 54 \n     percent of the sites. . . . the data do not necessarily \n     reflect the full extent of current compliance with the 1998 \n     requirements.  . . .\n\n  While this is helpful--and disturbing information--it still does not \ntell us what is happening to make these tanks safe for storing \npetroleum products.\n  This amendment is quite modest, in my view. It merely says to EPA, do \nyour job. We have a strong law. Tank owners had a deadline. Leaking \ntanks are contaminating drinking water. Take steps to make tanks safe.\n  The public needs assurance that EPA and the states are enforcing the \nlaw, stopping leaks, and protecting our drinking water.\n  I am pleased that this important amendment has been accepted.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1793\n\n (Purpose: To extend the comment period for proposed rules related to \n                          the Clean Water

This is one of \nthe most difficult bills to manage with its varied programs and \nchallenging allocation, but I think the bill meets most of the demands \nmade of it while not exceeding its budget and is a strong candidate for \nenactment. So I commend my friend, the chairman, for his efforts and \nleadership.\n  When outlays from prior-year BA and other adjustments are taken into \naccount, the bill totals $91.3 billion in BA and $103.8 billion in \noutlays. The total bill is under the Senate subcommittee's 302(b) \nallocation for budget authority and outlays.\n  I ask Members of the Senate to refrain from offering amendments which \nwould cause the subcommittee to exceed its budget allocation and urge \nthe speedy adoption of this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nBudget Committee scoring of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n   S. 1596, VA-HUD APPROPRIATIONS, 2000--SPENDING COMPARISONS--SENATE-\n                              REPORTED BILL\n               [Fiscal year 2000, in millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                   General\n                                   purpose   Crime   Mandatory    Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\n  Budget authority..............    69,619  .......    21,713     91,332\n  Outlays.......................    82,291  .......    21,496    103,787\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority..............    69,633  .......    21,713     91,346\n  Outlays.......................    82,545  .......    21,496    104,041\n1999 Enacted:\n  Budget authority..............    71,045  .......    21,885     92,930\n  Outlays.......................    80,376  .......    21,570    101,946\nPresident's request:\n  Budget authority..............    72,055  .......    21,713     93,768\n  Outlays.......................    82,538  .......    21,496    104,034\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget authority..............    71,632  .......    21,713     93,345\n  Outlays.......................    82,031  .......    21,496    103,527\n \nSENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED TO:\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority..............       -14  .......  .........       -14\n  Outlays.......................      -254  .......  .........      -254\n1999 Enacted:\n  Budget authority..............    -1,426  .......      -172     -1,598\n  Outlays.......................     1,915  .......       -74      1,841\nPresident's request:\n  Budget authority..............    -2,436  .......  .........    -2,436\n  Outlays.......................      -247  .......  .........      -247\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget authority..............    -2,013  .......  .........    -2,013\n  Outlays.......................       260  .......  .........       260\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

Mr. President, I realize that this year Senators Bond and \nMikulski are facing a challenging appropriations season with tight \nbudgetary constraints. However, I wanted to bring to their attention \nthree projects which I think are particularly important to Nebraska, \nprojects that I believe will directly benefit many of our Nebraska \ncitizens.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I know that you have worked hard on a number of \nprojects, and I would appreciate it if you could describe your requests \nin greater detail?\n  Mr. KERREY. Yes, it would be my pleasure. On March 31, 1999, I \nrequested that $1.5 million be appropriated within the CDBG program's \nEconomic Development Initiative for the North 27th Street Center for \nChildren and Youth in Lincoln, NE. The Center is being developed by \nCedars Youth Services, Inc. at the request of the City of Lincoln. The \nFederal dollars would be used by Cedars to develop, operate, and \nimplement a program for the collaborative provision of services by \nseveral organizations through a design that will allow participants to \navoid having to negotiate the administration and service delivery \npractices of the various organizations. In other words, it is an effort \nto develop a ``one-stop'' service center for youth programs.\n  In addition, during March 1999, I also requested $750,000 or Project \nJericho in Omaha, NE to be used by Family Housing Advisory Services for \nthe ongoing administration and operation of Project Jericho. Project \nJericho assists individuals, couples, and families who qualify for \nSection 8 assistance to locate safe affordable housing in the Omaha \narea. Financial management and mobility counseling are provided to help \nparticipants who want to find rental properties in neighborhoods with \nless than 35 percent minority population. Project Jericho is now one of \nthe top recognized mobility programs in the country.\n  Finally, I requested that $120,000 be provided from the Environmental \nPrograms and Management Account of the EPA, to the Fontenelle Forest \nAssociation for the Missouri River Ecology Institute (MREI). Fontenelle \nForest would use the funds to continue MREI, which provides an \nintensive, six week summertime experience in field-based natural \nscience for teenagers (primarily students entering the 10th grade). \nMREI services as a leadership development initiative for students with \na strong interest in the environment, and includes activities to help \nprepare them for future careers in this field.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I have noted the importance of these \nprojects and I will do my best to include these projects when the \nconference committee meets on this bill, if adequate funding is \navailable.\n  Mr. BOND. I certainly understand the concerns of the Senator from \nNebraska and we will review these requests prior to conference.\n  Mr. KERREY. I appreciate the consideration and the help of the \ndistinguished Senators from Missouri and Maryland. They have always \nbeen very supportive of the needs of Nebraska and I appreciate that.\n\n\n                   economic development in wisconsin\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I thank Senators Bond and Mikulski for their \ngood efforts and sense of fairness in putting together the VA-HUD \nAppropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2000. We all agree that this year's \nattempts to stay within the spending caps has forced us all to make \nsome tough choices and to work that much harder to reach consensus and \ncomplete our appropriations work in a timely and responsible manner. \nSenators Bond and Mikulski are to be commended for their hard work.\n  I would ask for a clarification on a point of concern for my \nconstituents in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. As you know, the VA-HUD bill \ncontains funds in support of several important economic development \ninitiatives in Wisconsin, including both the Metcalfe Neighborhood and \nMenomonee Valley Redevelopment projects in Milwaukee. I am pleased that \nthe Committee has expressed support for both projects, but would simply \nask if the Chairman and Ranking Member would have any objection to \nshifting the amount of funds distributed between these projects during \nthe conference negotiations. In other words, would you have any \nobjection to shifting funds designated for the Menomonee Valley project \nto the Metcalfe Neighborhood project? I ask for this clarification in \norder to allow the City of Milwaukee the flexibility to reallocate the \nfunds provided in keeping with its economic development needs and \ntimeframes for project completion.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I would have no objection to shifting funds between the \nMilwaukee projects if the Senator from Wisconsin, on behalf of his \nconstituents from Milwaukee, makes such a request during our work in \nthe conference.\n  Mr. BOND. I concur with my Ranking Member and would be happy to work \nwith the Senator from Wisconsin to ensure that his constituents' needs \nare met.\n\n\n                                  clem\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to ask the distinguished managers \nof the bill if they would consider a request I have concerning the \nconference. Knowing the great difficulty they faced in reporting a bill \nthat would not exceed this year's stringent budget caps, I was not too \nsurprised to see that they were not able to provide funding for New \nYork University's Center for Cognition, Learning, Emotion, and Memory, \nor CLEM, in the bill. However, I do hope that funding for CLEM can be \nfound in conference. CLEM can help educators, physicians and other \nhealth care givers, policymakers, and the general public by enhancing \nour understanding of normal brain development as well as the many \ndisabilities, disorders, and diseases that erode our ability to learn \nand think, to remember, and to emote appropriately.\n  CLEM focuses on research and training in the fundamental \nneurobiological mechanisms that underlie learning and memory--the \nacquisition and storage of information in the nervous system. Current \nstudies by the faculty at NYU are determining why fear can facilitate \nmemory; how memory can be enhanced; what conditions facilitate long-\nterm and short-term memory; and where in the brain all these memories \nare processed and stored. The Center for Cognition, Learning, Emotion \nand Memory will draw on the University's strengths in the fields of \nneural science, biology, chemistry, psychology, computer science, and \nlinguistics to push the frontiers of our understanding of how the brain \ndevelops, functions, malfunctions, matures, and ages. NYU researchers \nbring substantial strength in psychological testing, computational \nsophistication, advanced tissues staining and electrical problems, and \nhumane animal conditions. These core facilities are well regarded by \ntheir peers and together have been awarded a total of $7 million from \nfederal agencies and private foundations for their research. Also, the \nUniversity is presently recruiting additional faculty in other areas of \nmemory and learning specialization. As a major training institute, the \nCenter will help prepare the next generation of interdisciplinary brain \nscientists.\n  I believe that the work of this Center is an appropriate focus for \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs because research into how cognition \nand emotion interact can have applicability to other diverse areas of \ninterest. For example, in understanding maladaptive responses and \nemotional disorders, researchers are better able to understand and \ntreat phobias, panic attacks, and post-traumatic stress disorders. In \naddition, research into the learning process as it relates to attention \nand retention will lead to insights on mental losses and the decay of \nmemory. Similarly, research at the center could prove most valuable to \nthe EPA in its efforts to learn about and prevent the effects of toxic \nsubstances on man and animals.\n  Mr. President, funding for New York University in this bill would be \nentirely appropriate under VA, EPW, or as an item in the EDI account. \nIt would be money well spent. I ask the distinguished managers if they \nwill consider providing $1 million for NYU.\n  Mr. BOND. I will certainly keep the request from the Senator from New \nYork in mind when we go to conference.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I too will remember the request from my colleague from \nNew York when the bill gets to conference.\n\n[[Page S11409]]\n\n     national center for science literacy education and technology\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I wonder if the distinguished managers \nof the bill would consider a request of mine? As they are aware, in \nprevious years NASA has provided funds to the American Museum of \nNatural History to support the National Center for Science Literacy \nEducation and Technology. The Museum reaches literally millions of \nchildren and families, schools and community groups each year through \nscience education and exhibition, curriculum development and innovative \neducational technology. Now the Museum is unveiling a unique new \nresource for educating the nation about the wonders of the universe and \nour own planet Earth, the Rose Center. It will include a new state-of-\nthe-art Hayden Planetarium, the Colman Hall of the Universe, and the \nGottesman Hall of Planet Earth. The centerpiece of the new Center is a \n90-foot-in-diameter sphere situated in a cubic glass-walled enclosure; \nand in the upper half of this sphere the Museum will be housing the \nmost technologically advanced sky theater in the world with a map of \nthe universe created by the Museum's National Center for Science \nLiteracy and Technology in partnership with NASA: The Digital Galaxy \nMapping Project.\n  While the National Center has received strong NASA-based support, the \nMuseum has raised the funds, almost $100 million, for the Rose Center \nand these cutting-edge Halls of the Universe and Planet Earth through \nnon-federal State, City, private and foundation support.\n  The Center is already working with innumerable schools in New York \nand beyond to develop more effective science education curriculum \nmaterials, as well as partnering with leading colleges and universities \non critical research, education and training initiatives. They are now \nproposing to further expand the role of NASA and the Center with the \ngoal of educating an ever broader segment of the American public. \nThrough the Center's Education Materials Lab Project the Museum and \nNASA will develop additional curriculum modules from the prototypes \ncreated in the first phase of the NASA-Center agreement, based on and \nutilizing the unique investments and facilities of the Museum. There \nwill be a major investment in a science visualization project that will \nhighlight NASA developments and activities, from progress in the space \nstation to new astronomical discoveries.\n  As you can see, Mr. President, the potential of the National Center \nat the Museum is boundless. However, a continuing and expanded federal \npartnership for science education and educational technology is \nimportant and appropriate there, given the role they play and the \nmillions they reach.\n  I realize the constraints the subcommittee was under in writing a \nbill that would meet budget requirements. I simply ask that when the \nbill goes to conference the managers remember my original request that \nthe NASA budget include a FY2000 appropriation of $5 million to further \nexpand the reach of this important National Center, develop and improve \neducational materials and educational technology for schools, children \nand families, and to enhance the Museum's instrumentation and \nlaboratory facilities that will contribute to these education, training \nand research objectives. The House Bill contains $3 million. I hope \nthat sum can be increased to $5 million.\n  Mr. BOND. I will certainly keep the request by the distinguished \nSenator from New York in mind when we go to conference.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I too will remember this request for the American \nMuseum of Natural History when we get to conference.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank both my distinguished colleagues for their \ncooperation.\n\n\n                      national science foundation\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I see the report encourages the National \nScience Foundation to ``strengthen its activities with respect to \ninternational cooperation in research and education.''\n  Mr. BOND. Yes, that's right. That sort of cooperation is good for \nscience and good for education right here at home. The National Science \nBoard is going to examine that issue, and I look forward to seeing \ntheir recommendations.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. The Chairman may be aware that as part of last year's \nHigher Education Act, working with thirteen of our colleagues, I was \nable to get a program in East Asian Science, Engineering, and \nTechnology authorized at NSF. This new program, which is a successor to \na program at the Defense Department, will teach American scientists and \nengineers about East Asian languages, technological developments, \nmanagement techniques, and research institutions. It will improve our \nunderstanding of East Asian research and train a cadre of American \nresearchers who can effectively cooperative with their East Asian \ncounterparts.\n  Mr. BOND. That does sound like the sort of activity we'd like to \nencourage at NSF.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Well, unfortunately the program was authorized too late \nin the year to make it into the President's budget request for FY 2000. \nBut NSF, including the top leadership is quite enthusiastic about the \nprogram. They've had a day-long workshop to help design the program, \nand I understand may even release the report from that workshop soon. \nMy point is I think that they could be ready to get the program started \nthis coming fiscal year.\n  Would the Chairman agree that to the extent there is some \ndiscretionary money available at NSF in FY 2000 and that NSF's \nleadership believes they have a solid program plan, they can and should \nbegin the East Asian Science, Engineering, and Technology program in FY \n2000? Moreover, that NSF should budget for the program in FY 2001 and \nbeyond? I think that would be consistent with your interest in seeing \nmore international cooperation in science and engineering.\n  Mr. BOND. I will be open to NSF's plans once they are developed. If \nthe National Science Board and NSF support funding the program in FY \n2000, I will review it as part of their operating plan and future NSF \nbudget proposals.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. If I could just briefly add my thoughts. The East Asian \nScience, Engineering, and Technology program does indeed sound like \nsomething NSF should get started on this coming fiscal year, provided \nthey're ready, and then include it in the President's request for FY \n2001.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the distinguished Chairman and Ranking Member.\n\n\n                            Barry University\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, we would like to engage the Chairman and \nRanking Member of the Subcommittee, in a brief colloquy regarding Barry \nUniversity in Miami Shores, Florida. Through the outstanding leadership \nof sister Jeanne O'Laughlin, Barry has had a strong history of \naddressing important Miami community issues like urbanization, ethnic \ndiversity, community development and cultural understanding. Many of \nBarry's students are first-generation college students and ethnic \nminorities. Recently the University announced the planning of an \nIntercultural Community Center that is designed to promote necessary \nneighborhood and small business revitalization. The new facility will \nalso be a hub for ongoing workforce development and service learning \nliteracy training for the local community.\n  Mr. MACK. Given the merits of the project, we were disappointed that \nBarry University was not included in the legislation before us that \nallocates funds to the ``Economic Development Initiatives'' for such \npurposes. Barry University's proposal meets the criteria established by \nthe Subcommittee in terms of serving low-income populations. Our hope \nis that this project can be re-considered during final deliberations on \nthe bill. Specifically, we would request that favorable language be \nincluded in this bill directing the Secretary of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment to spend a minimum of 1.5 million dollars from the Economic \nDevelopment Initiative fund to finance this important program that \npromotes economic and social revitalization. We would appreciate the \nSenator's support, along with the Chairman's in the funding of the \nBarry University Intercultural Community Center in the Conference \nReport.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Senators from Florida for bringing this \nissue to\n\n[[Page S11410]]\n\nmy attention. I will be pleased to review the proposed project at $1.5 \nmillion and will give it every consideration during conference \ndeliberations.\n  Mr. BOND. I concur with my good friend from Maryland, and we will \nmake every effort to consider the merits and funding requests of the \nBarry University project in conference.\n\n\n                  bayard wastewater treatment facility\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to thank the Chairman and Ranking \nMember for their fine and fair work on this appropriations bill. I \nacknowledge how difficult their job is and fully appreciate their \nefforts.\n  I understand the tight budget situation the committee finds itself in \nand the many requests the Chairman and Ranking Member face for water \nand wastewater funding from the EPA's State and Tribal Assistance Grant \nProgram. Unfortunately, the committee could not find sufficient funding \nfor a critical wastewater treatment project in Bayard, New Mexico. This \ncommunity, along with the Village of Santa Clara and the Fort Bayard \nState Hospital, face a loss of their wastewater treatment plant. Three \nyears from now, the Cobre copper mine will no longer accept wastewater \nfrom these communities and an alternative must be found. If not, these \ncommunities will essentially return to the days of the outhouse.\n  May I ask the Chairman if he is aware of the critical wastewater \nsituation facing the citizens of Bayard and Santa Clara?\n  Mr. BOND. Yes, I appreciate the Senator from New Mexico informing me \nof the situation in Bayard and the citizens' need for a new wastewater \ntreatment facility.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. The estimated cost of the new wastewater treatment \nplant is almost $3 million. Is the Ranking Member aware that Mayor \nKelly and the city council in Bayard are working very hard to obtain \npartial funding for the new plant from all available local, state and \nfederal sources?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I commend the Mayor and citizens of Bayard for their \nefforts to seek funding from all available sources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I'd like to continue to work with the Chairman and \nRanking Member as this appropriations bill moves forward to see if \nthere isn't some way to provide a grant from EPA's State and Tribal \nAssistance Grant Program to help fund a portion of the cost of the \nwastewater treatment plant in Bayard.\n  Mr. BOND. The Senator can be assured we will give the project our \nfull consideration in conference.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I appreciate knowing of the Senator from New Mexico's \ninterest in the Bayard project.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Senators for their consideration.\n\n\n                        NOx SIP call\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise at this time to engage in a \ncolloquy with the Subcommittee Chairman, the Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. President, I am concerned about what I feel is an apparent \ninconsistency and inequity created by two separate and conflicting \nactions that occurred last spring. One was EPA issuing a final rule \nimplementing a consent decree under section 126 of the Clean Air Act \nthat is triggered in essence by EPA not approving the NOx \nSIP call revisions of 22 states and the District of Columbia by \nNovember 30, 1999. The other was by the United States Court of Appeals \nfor the D.C. Circuit in issuing an order staying the requirement \nimposed in EPA's 1998 NOx SIP Call for these jurisdictions \nto submit the SIP revisions just mentioned for EPA approval.\n  Caught in the middle of these two events are electric utilities and \nindustrial sources who fear that now the trigger will be sprung this \ncoming November 30, even though the states are no longer required to \nmake those SIP revisions because of the stay, and even though EPA will \nhave nothing before it to approve or disapprove.\n  Prior to this, EPA maintained a close link between the NOx \nSIP Call and the section 126 rule, as evidenced by the consent decree. \nI believe a parallel stay would be appropriate in the circumstances. \nEPA should not be moving forward with its NOx regulations \nuntil the litigation is complete and those affected are given more \ncertainty and clarity as to what is required under the law.\n  A stay is very much needed, especially in light of EPA's most recent \ncomments suggesting that it may reverse its earlier interpretation of \nthe Clean Air Act regarding State discretion in dealing with interstate \nozone transport problems. The effect of such a reversal would be to \nforce businesses to comply with EPA's federal emission controls under \nSection 126 without regard to NOx SIP Call rule and State \ninput.\n  The proposed reversal is creating tremendous confusion for the \nbusinesses and the States. Under EPA's proposed new position, \nbusinesses could incur substantial costs in meeting the EPA-imposed \nsection 126 emission controls before allowing the States to use their \ndiscretion in the SIP process to address air quality problems, less \nstringent controls or through controls on other facilities altogether.\n  Indeed, the fact that these businesses almost certainly will have \nsunk significant costs into compliance with the EPA-imposed controls \nbefore States we required to submit their emission control plans in \nresponse to the NOX SIP Call rule would result in \nimpermissible pressure on their States to forfeit their discretion and \ninstead simply conform their SIPs to EPA section 126 controls.\n  The bottom line, Mr. Chairman, is that not only do the States and \nbusiness community not know what EPA is doing, EPA doesn't know what it \nis doing. This is hardly a desirable regulatory posture for what \nclearly is promising to be a very costly and burdensome regulation.\n  Let's be clear what the law is and what it requires, before rather \nthan after the EPA writes and enforces its rules. I think that is a \nreasonable expectation and a reasonable requirement that the EPA should \nbe able to meet.\n  Mr. Chairman, would you agree with me that the EPA should find a \nreasonable way to avoid triggering the 126 process while the courts \ndeliberate and we have a better understanding of what the law requires \nstates and businesses to do to be in compliance?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the Senator bringing \nthis to the Senate's attention. I agree that this matter should be \nresolved swiftly. I would encourage and expect the EPA to, over the \nnext several months, find a way that is fair to all sides. In addition, \nI would expect that any remedy would ensure that the States maintain \ncontrol and input in addressing air pollution problems through the SIP \nprocess. I would be happy to work with the Senator from Alabama to \nensure that EPA is fully responsive to these legitimate problems.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the gentleman from Missouri yield?\n  Mr. BOND. I am happy to yield to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as the gentlemen from Alabama and Missouri \nknow, I have had concerns regarding the impact of the NOX \nSIP Call for states throughout the Midwest, including my own. I would \nagree that recent actions taken by the EPA and Northeastern states \ncreates confusion for both industries and states governments alike. I, \ntoo, strongly encourage the EPA to work with all parties, and I look \nforward to finding a fair and equitable solution to improve our air \nquality in an economically and environmentally sound way.\n\n\n                     study on hydraulic fracturing\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the need to \ncollect good scientific data upon which the Environmental Protection \nAgency can establish appropriate regulations to protect human health \nand the environment.\n  Mr. BOND. The Senator from Alabama raises a good point. In order for \nthe EPA to protect people and the environment, the agency must have \naccess to good scientific data.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Has the Subcommittee from time to time, directed the \nEPA to fund studies related to pending regulations when there is a \nneed?\n  Mr. BOND. Yes, this Subcommittee has occasionally directed the EPA to \ngather additional scientific data relevant to their regulatory duties.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would like to make the Senator aware of a situation \nin my own state of Alabama where the EPA is being forced by a court \norder to promulgate regulations regarding an activity called hydraulic \nfracturing.\n\n[[Page S11411]]\n\n  Alabama is the second largest producer of coal bed methane in the \ncountry. The production of this clean burning fuel from coal beds has \nonly recently become economically viable and offers a way to capture \nmethane from coal beds which might otherwise be vented into the \natmosphere during normal coal mining operations. As you know, methane \nis thought to be a potent contributor of the so-called ``greenhouse'' \neffect and has been shown to contribute the formation of ground level \nozone. However, the production of methane for fuel use helps to reduce \nair emissions and improves our balance of trade by contributing to our \noverall domestic gas production. Increased production of coal bed \nmethane should be encouraged.\n  One of the procedures needed to produce methane from coal beds is the \nuse of hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing essentially involves \nthe placing of water and sand down a well bore at high pressure to \ncreate microscopic fractures in the coal beds which allow methane gas \nto escape. Following this procedure, over 90 percent of the water and \nsand propping agent is pumped out of the well and disposed in \ncompliance with all State and Federal laws. There has never been a \ndocumented case of underground water contamination resulting from this \nprocedure.\n  The EPA never intended to regulate this procedure. However, in 1995 a \nlawsuit was filed against the EPA claiming that the hydraulic \nfracturing in Alabama should be regulated through the Underground \nInjection Control program established by the Safe Drinking Water Act. \nThe EPA argued that hydraulic fracturing did not fit in the context of \nthe Underground Injection Program, that the State of Alabama already \nregulated the process and that the procedure itself posed little risk \nto underground drinking water sources or the environment. In 1997, the \n11th Circuit Court of Appeals made a technical ruling that hydraulic \nfracturing does in fact, constitute underground injection because it \ndoes involve the placement of fluids underground. Following the court \nruling, the EPA implied that it might support a technical change to the \nSafe Drinking Water Act to exempt hydraulic fracturing from the \nUnderground Injection program. However, efforts to get this technical \ncorrection passed into law were upset by the EPA who called for more \ntime to study the issue. Unfortunately, the EPA has still not developed \nthe scientific data to determine whether or not there is even a need \nfor federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing at all.\n  It is no wonder that the EPA has not dedicated many resources to this \nissue. No where in the nation has there been even a single case of \ngroundwater contamination from hydraulic fracturing operations despite \nthe dramatic increase in the use of this procedure over the last 15 \nyears. In fact, based upon the data which is currently available, I \nbelieve that federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing operations may \nbe an ineffective use of both federal and state resources. However, \nthere is a need to be certain that hydraulic fracturing does not pose a \nthreat to underground sources or drinking water and more scientific \nstudy must be completed.\n  The Geological Survey of Alabama, working in conjunction with Alabama \nuniversities, has already initiated study on the environmental impacts \nof hydraulic fracturing operations. Because of the work which the \nGeological Survey has already begun, it would make an ideal institution \nto carry out additional studies on the impact of hydraulic fracturing \nand could contribute a great deal to the body of scientific data needed \nby the EPA. The Geological Survey has proposed an 18 month study, using \n$175,000 of federal funds through an EPA grant, to carefully examine \nthe environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing operations. I would \nask that the Senator from Missouri work to include language in the VA/\nHUD Appropriations Conference report that would direct the EPA to make \nthis important grant.\n  Mr. BOND. In my own State of Missouri, production of coal bed methane \nhas recently been started at several sites. I understand that hydraulic \nfracturing has been used at each of these sites to stimulate the flow \nof methane. I agree with the Senator from Alabama that the EPA should \nseek out the best scientific data and should seek to provide assistance \nto the Geological Survey of Alabama to study the impact this procedure \ncould have on underground sources of drinking water.\n\n\n                        atlanta va construction\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I would like to discuss with the Ranking \nMember of the VA/HUD Appropriations Committee the documented need for \nfunding of the Atlanta Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center for funds \nto renovate and modernize patient wards. The Atlanta VA construction \nproject was rated 5th on the Department of Veterans Affairs Fiscal Year \n2000 Priority Medical Construction Project Report. This project was \nlisted as 12th last year and with the increasing need was moved to the \ntop 5 by the Office of Management and Budget. On September 8, 1999, I \nwas pleased to support the Senate's passage of S. 1076, the Veterans' \nBenefits Act of 1999, which authorized $12.4 million for the renovation \ncritical to caring for our veterans. The need for this project will not \ngo away. I believe that this project should receive at least $2 million \nin initial design and planning for FY 2000 to pave the way for later \nfull funding. Included in this start-up money would be asbestos testing \nthat needs no further delays for environmental safety.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I understand the Senator's concerns and push his to \nobtain this needed renovation for VA patient care. I also want to thank \nthe Senator for his responsible approach to phasing in this project in \nlight of serious budget concerns. While serious budget constraints \nprevent the acceptance of this request in the FY 2000 appropriations \nbill, it is the Appropriations Committee's hope and expectation that \nthis worthy project will be fully funded in the President's FY 2001 \nbudget submission.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I want to thank the Ranking Member for her comments and \nacknowledge her efforts to redeem the promises to our veterans.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The VA/HUD Appropriations Committee will give every \nconsideration to funding the completion of the Atlanta VA renovation \nproject in the FY 2001 budget process.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I thank the Ranking Member and the Chairman for their \nleadership during these challenging times of budget constraints and the \nchanging health care environment for caring for this Nation's veterans. \nYour support of the Atlanta VA Medical Center renovation is a visible \nreminder to our veterans that we do care and appreciate their \nsacrifices for this country.\n\n\n                         VA cemetery in atlanta\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I want to thank the ranking member of the \nVA/HUD appropriations subcommittee for her diligence and dedication to \nthe veterans of this country and for the hard work she and her staff \nhave done this year. We are all aware of the sacrifices that our \nveterans have made to our Nation in times of war. Now, in time of peace \nwe must not forget those sacrifices. Since 1980, I have been working to \nestablish a new national cemetery in metropolitan Atlanta based on a \ndocumented need for such a facility.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Senator for his kind words of support. I am \nfully aware of the critical need for cemeteries to accommodate our \nveterans population. I am aware of the Senator from Georgia's dedicated \nefforts to construct a cemetery which dates back to his tenure as head \nof the Veterans Administration.\n  Mr. CLELAND. The Senator from Maryland is correct. Georgia currently \nhas two cemeteries, the Andersonville National Historic Cemetery and \nthe Marietta National Cemetery. Unfortunately, the Marietta cemetery \nhas been full since 1970. As the senator knows legislation which I \nsponsored, S. 695, passed the Senate. This legislation would authorize \nthe VA Secretary to establish national cemeteries in Atlanta, Georgia; \nsouthwestern Pennsylvania; Miami, Florida; Detroit, Michigan; and \nSacramento, California.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I am certainly aware of my colleague's work on this \nimportant issue and applaud the Senator's efforts.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Is it the understanding of the ranking member, that \nshould funds be available in FY2000 to begin planning for a new round \nof national cemeteries that the authorized national cemetery in Atlanta \nwill be included in the FY2000 budget?\n\n[[Page S11412]]\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Certainly, should the funding be available, they could \nbe used for future cemetery construction projects.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I thank the ranking member for including such language \nendorsing the construction of a new national veterans cemetery in the \nMetropolitan Atlanta area. Again, I appreciate the help of the Senator \nfrom Maryland and the subcommittee on this issue, which is so vital to \nthe veterans of Georgia.\n\n\n                           minnesota projects\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I would like to engage the \ndistinguished Ranking Member of the VA/HUD Appropriations Committee in \na brief colloquy regarding two important projects which I believe \ndeserve support.\n  Mr. President, over the past years there has been an alarming \nincrease in the need for adolescent treatment programs. The Mash-ka-\nwisen facility in Sawyer, MN, has recognized this need and therefore \nproposes the construction of a culturally specific treatment program \ndesigned for adolescents. The presence of an eighteen-bed adolescent \ntreatment center will serve American Indian adolescents from throughout \nthe Bemidji Indian Health Service Area, which includes the states of \nMinnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. For the past twenty years, the \nexisting center in Sawyer, MN, has served American Indians in need of \nalcohol and drug treatment with a culturally specific recovery program. \nAs a result of their commitment, the Center has a national reputation, \nas well as one of the very highest treatment success rates in the \nnation. The Minnesota Indian Primary Regional Treatment Center has \nrequested $2 million to fund the construction of their adolescent \ntreatment facility.\n  I also wish to call your attention to the request of $1.7 million by \nNortheast Ventures Corporation of Northern Minnesota. During the last \n15 years, Northeastern Minnesota has experienced severe economic \nlosses. Since 1989, Northeast Ventures has provided capital support for \nmicro enterprises in the region. In addition to the assistance that \nNortheast Ventures has provided, its not for profit affiliate, the \nNortheast Entrepreneur Fund, has been providing financial and technical \nsupport services to unemployed and underemployed men and women in \nNortheastern Minnesota. In reaction to the special economic needs of \nthe Iron Range, a second not for profit affiliate, Iron Range Ventures, \nworks specifically to provide investments in the Iron Range. Together \nthese organizations have helped to provide the region with assistance \nthat has led to gradual economic recovery and diversification. A HUD \nSpecial Purpose Grant will make it possible for this organization and \nits not for profit affiliates to provide additional support to existing \nand emerging businesses in the region. $850,000 will support the \nexpanded and enhanced delivery of services and capital to small \nbusinesses and the remaining $850,000 will support increased investment \nin the Iron Range area of northeastern Minnesota.\n  I am aware of the difficult financial constraints under which the VA/\nHUD Appropriations Subcommittee worked this year, and I appreciate the \nRanking Member's willingness to engage in a colloquy on these important \nprojects. So I would simply ask my colleague from Maryland if she \nagrees with the importance of including these two projects in the VA/\nHUD appropriations bill and is willing to work towards earmarking $2 \nmillion for the Mash-ka-wisen treatment facility and $1.7 million for \nNortheast Ventures Corporation?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank my colleague from Minnesota, Senator Wellstone, \nfor his continued vigorous support for these projects. First let me say \nthat I appreciate his acknowledgment of the difficult funding \nconstraints under which the committee was working this year. I agree \nwith my colleague that these two projects will serve a valuable role in \ntheir communities, both Indian Country, and Northeastern Minnesota. For \nthat reason, I will give the Minnesota Indian Primary Residential \nTreatment Center and the Northeast Ventures Corporation every \nconsideration during the conference deliberations.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator for her commitment to seek funding \nfor these projects for the next year. I am grateful for her continued \nsupport and to know she will support these projects in the upcoming \nconference committee.\n\n\n          Surface Acoustic Wave--Mercury Vapor Sensor Research\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I seek recognition today along with my \ncolleague, Senator Collins, to draw to the Chairman's attention our \nrequest for funding within the budget for the Environmental Protection \nAgency to defray some of the costs of researching and developing an \neffective new technology for monitoring mercury vapor emissions.\n  As we know, mercury is one of the most toxic substances in our \nenvironment and one of most common air pollutants and, unfortunately, \nremains largely unregulated, causing great neurologic damage if \ningested by humans. This is why I have cosponsored a bill, S. 673, that \nwill go a long way towards developing a much needed solution to the \nproblem of mercury emissions in our environment.\n  I am advised that researchers in Maine and in Maryland are teaming \ntogether to research and develop a new, environmentally beneficial \ntechnology for tracking mercury vapor emissions. I am hopeful that in \nConference, the distinguished Chairman and the Ranking Minority Member, \nSenator Mikulski, will look again at the proposal and to consider \ndesignating it for funding within the appropriate budget account.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I want to join my colleague, Senator Snowe, and \nreiterate my support for this important proposal. If funding is made \navailable, the Sensor Research/University of Maryland team will examine \nmercury emissions from several combustion sources and will compare a \nnew family of mercury vapor sensors to state-of-the-art continuous \nmonitoring devices in order to determine the efficacy and fidelity of \nthe newer technology. I understand that these new ``Surface Acoustic \nWave'' senors offer the promise of low cost/extremely-high reliability \nmonitoring that can better determine the origin of and transport \nmechanisms involving this family of pollutants.\n  I thank the Chairman for his consideration of this proposal and ask \nthat he and Senator Mikulski make this a top priority in Conference.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I appreciate the work done by my colleagues from Maine \non this mercury sensor proposal, which would utilize the tremendous \nresearch tools of the University of Maryland at College Park. While we \nare laboring under difficult budget constraints, I remain hopeful that \nwe will be able to jumpstart this valuable scientific evaluation \nprocess. I look forward to working with Chairman Bond on this issue in \nConference.\n  Mr. BOND. I am grateful to my colleagues from Maine and to my good \nfriend, Senator Mikulski, for their input on the Surface Acoustic Wave \nsensor proposal, which could be a real step forward in protecting our \nenvironment. I will be glad to continue working with my colleagues on \nidentifying potential areas for funding as we proceed to Conference.\n\n\n                     The Atlanta Watershed Project\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to make a few remarks \nabout the Regional Atlanta Watershed restoration program and, with the \nhelp of the Chairman of the VA HUD Appropriation Subcommittee, to \nclarify the use of EPA funds. It is my understanding that these funds \ncan be made available for studies to address serious combined sewer \noverflow problems.\n  Mr. BOND. The Senior Senator from Georgia is correct.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. It is also my understanding that there are serious \nproblems in the Atlanta Region with sewer and overflow facilities and \nthat work is required as part of a $250 million complex settlement that \nthe City of Atlanta negotiated with the Environmental Protection Agency \nand the Department of Justice due to unpermitted releases from Combined \nSewer Overflow (CSO) facilities.\n  It is my understanding that the Atlanta Region faces an aging \ninfrastructure and rapid growth and that the City of Atlanta has \ncommitted $1 billion in local funds to go directly to the combined \nsewer system and other watershed restoration initiatives.\n  It is my understanding as well that the House of Representatives has \nrecommended that $1 million be appropriated for this project, and I ask \nthat\n\n[[Page S11413]]\n\nthe Chairman give every possible consideration to this amount during \nConference considerations. Also, I would ask that fair and appropriate \nconsideration be given to an even greater sum.\n  Mr. BOND. I understand the difficulties the Atlanta Region faces due \nto an aging infrastructure and a rapidly growing population, and I \ncommend Senator Coverdell's advocacy and commitment on its behalf.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Chairman for his consideration and look \nforward to working with him on this project.\n\n\n                  SWIFT BUILDING IN MOULTRIE, GEORGIA\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today in hopes of engaging the \nChairman, Senator Bond, and Ranking Member, Senator Mikulski in a \ncolloquy regarding a project of extreme concern and importance to me, \nspecifically the Swift Building in Moultrie, Georgia.\n  Mr. BOND. I am glad to discuss this matter with Senator Cleland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I, too, welcome this discussion with my colleague.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I thank my distinguished colleagues. The Swift Building \nis located in Moultrie, Georgia, an area that faces a poverty rate well \nabove the national average. I was horrified to see the current state of \nthis building. the building is not only completely dilapidated and \npartially torn down, but also contains major friable asbestos \ncontamination as well as traces of cadmium and celenium--all of which \npresent serious health risks to the residents of the surrounding \ncommunity. Senator Mikulski, you were kind enough to take the time to \nreview this project with me. Would you agree that the Swift Building \npresents this community with a serious problem--one that needs and \ndeserves immediate attention.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I strongly agree with my colleague. I was also startled \nby the graphic nature of the state of this building. Not only does this \nbuilding present severe health concerns to local residents, but what \nmakes this building even more disconcerting is the fact that it is \nlocated right beside U.S. highway 319, which, as I understand, is the \nmain thoroughfare running directly into the center of Moultrie.\n  Mr. CLELAND. The Senator is correct. The building with its major \nfriable asbestos is not only located right along this major highway, \nbut the exposure to this migratory hazard has been further exacerbated \nby the partial destruction of this building. As I mentioned earlier, \nthe Swift Building is located in a severely economically depressed \narea, so without federal assistance the health and economic \nconsequences it presents will remain unaddressed. As you know, the \nAdministration has stated its strong opposition to the exclusion of \nfunding for the Redevelopment of Abandoned Building Program. The \npurpose of this new program is to address the blight caused by \nabandoned apartment buildings, single family homes, warehouses, office \nbuildings and commercial centers. I believe that the Swift Building \nprovides an ideal example of the type of project well suited for this \nprogram. Although I was greatly disappointed that I was unable to have \nmy amendment accepted to obtain this critical funding, I will be glad \nto withdraw my amendment if I can get the assurances of the Chairman \nand Ranking Member that if funding is provided for the Redevelopment of \nAbandoned Buildings during conference with the House, this project will \nbe given high priority.\n  Mr. BOND. I appreciate the Senator's cooperation and understand his \nconcern about this project. Rest assured that when we reach conference \nwith the House, we will give this project strong consideration for \nfunding.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I also pledge to work to seek funding for this critical \nproject during conference with the House.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I thank the distinguished Chair and Ranking member for \ntheir time and assistance in this matter.\n\n\n                            the swift plant\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise to request that the Chairman of \nthe Senate Appropriation Subcommittee on VA, HUD and Independent \nAgencies help me to clarify the use of appropriated funds under the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development. It is my understanding \nthat certain discretionary funds are available for projects.\n  Mr. BOND. The Senior Senator from Georgia is correct.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. The Town of Moultrie, Georgia, founded in 1856, has \nserved as an agricultural center for surrounding farms and related \nindustry. Unlike many small towns, Moultrie has managed to avoid \npopulation losses, which is mostly attributable to its livable, high \nquality residential neighborhoods, historical county seat and active \ncommunity development efforts. It is my understanding that Moultrie is \nseeking to promote revitalization and economic development that will \nraise the standard of living of town residents whose per capita income \nlevel is only 75% of the country's and 56% of the state's level.\n  In doing so Moultrie faces two key economic development issues. \nFirst, is the need to revitalize its downtown to retain retail \nbusinesses and attract new retail businesses. Second is the need for \nattractive industrial and business sites to retain existing, as well as \ndraw new businesses and industry.\n  It is also my understanding that Moultrie's downtown economic \ndevelopment is stymied by an obsolescent industrial and commercial \ndistrict located between the central historic Courthouse Square and the \nmain entry to the town from Interstate 75. This is a brownfields \ndistrict typical of smaller, older towns. It contains vacant and under-\nutilized land and buildings along a railroad, and substandard housing \ninterspersed within a grid of city streets. The most visible problem in \nthe district is the former Swift Plant, once one of the largest pork \nprocessing plants in the south. Today its largest building is partially \ndemolished and the site contains documented soil and groundwater \ncontamination. The 250 acre brownfield district in which the Swift \nPlant is located, has other contaminated properties and yields little \ntax revenue. No new businesses have located within the district in many \nyears, and many of the existing businesses are considering relocating \ndue to the area's low level of development.\n  It is my understanding that Moultrie has developed an economic \nredevelopment initiative to revitalize Moultrie's brownfields district \nand strengthen the city economy, and they have requested federal \nfunding to proceed. Central to this plan is the complete demolition of \nthe Swift Plant.\n  Mr. Chairman, based on what criteria do you consider projects such as \nthis?\n  Mr. BOND. Strong community support, the creation of public/private \npartnerships and a financial commitment by the local entities are \ncriteria that I believe illustrate a project's importance and \nvialbility.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Chairman for his assistance and look \nforward to working with him on this important matter.\n\n\n                          state veterans homes\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I appreciate the leadership of Senator Bond \nand Senator Mikulski on this appropriations bill. I know that this has \nbeen a very difficult process, and I appreciate their efforts.\n  I would like to bring to the attention of the United States Senate a \nsituation that is of great concern to me: long-term care for our \nveterans. In my state of Utah, we have a nursing home that is owned and \noperated by the State of Utah. This nursing home was certified by the \nDepartment of Veterans' Affairs and received monthly per diem payments, \nwhich comprise nearly half of the nursing home's budget.\n  Although the nursing home was certified in January, it did not see a \nsingle per diem payment from the Department of Veterans' Affairs until \nJune. The payment for February and March also arrived in June; payment \nfor April and May came in late June. The June payment was supposedly \nsent by the Department of Veterans' Affairs, but it still has not been \nreceived. Payment of per diem for July and August was received in \nSeptember.\n  I understand that other veterans homes around the country have \nsimilarly suffered from delayed and sporadic per diem payments.\n  To me, this is a fairly clear picture that the administration of per \ndiem payments needs to be improved. I cannot believe that each and \nevery payment for nine months is being deliberately held up because the \nveterans home is guilty of some unnamed compliance problem. In fact, \nthe VA itself has advised me that this is not the case at least with \nrespect to the Utah veterans home.\n\n[[Page S11414]]\n\n  Let me be clear that I do not intend that deficient veterans homes \nare let off the hook. We expect accountability. I urge the VA not only \nto enforce applicable standards, but also to assist state veterans \nhomes to meet these standards for care of our veterans.\n  But, I hope that the VA will give attention to designing a better \nsystem of payments so that state veterans homes can more effectively \nmanage their resources and, therefore, provide better and more \nconsistent care for our veterans.\n  Mr. BOND. I agree that the Department of Veterans Affairs should \nnever put the State veterans homes in a fiscally vulnerable position \nand, therefore, possibly compromise the quality of care for our \nveterans. I have several veterans nursing homes in my State in \nMissouri, and I believe that they deserve prompt per diem payments.\n  However, I also do not wish to hinder the VA from enforcing \napplicable standards for care in these state veterans homes. Does the \nSenator from Utah agree?\n  Mr. HATCH. Absolutely. The VA should certify homes as it has always \ndone. Homes that are seriously deficient should be decertified. \nTechnical assistance should be offered to homes having difficulty.\n  But, I would hope that proper quality control by the VA could be done \nin such a way so as not to unnecessarily disrupt the flow of payments \nto the home. Does the distinguished Senator from Missouri agree that a \nstate veterans home cannot be effectively managed if the federal funds \nthat are promised come in a haphazard manner?\n  Mr. BOND. Yes, I do. I recognize that irregular payment or per diem \ncan complicate the remediation of existing problems as well as possibly \ncause others. Does the Senator from Utah agree that the VA should have \nsome leverage in order to get prompt action to correct deficiencies in \npatient care or safety?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes. I agree that withholding per diem can be an \nappropriate action if the VA has previously notified the state veterans \nhome that there are specific problems. The homes should have an \nopportunity to correct those problems so as not to miss a scheduled \npayment.\n  I also believe that if a state veterans home is recalcitrant in \nmaking improvements where necessary, either for substantive patient \ncare or for administrative purposes, the VA should decertify the home. \nIf violations are serious enough to withhold payments for a prolonged \nperiod of time, they are serious enough to warrant decertification.\n  I hope, however, that my colleagues will agree that state veterans \nhomes cannot be effectively managed if the federal government is so \nunreliable in making these per diem payments. In the absence of any \nsubstantive quality issues, state veterans homes should be able to \nexpect prompt payment. It is a promise we have made, and it is \nnecessary that we keep it to maintain consistent and high quality of \ncare for our veterans. That, I believe, is the goal we all share.\n  Mr. President, in deference to the members of the Senate Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, I will not offer my amendment to require the \nVeterans' Administration to pay the per diem it owes to fully certified \nstate veterans homes.\n  However, I want the record to show that this amendment is cosponsored \nby Senator Crapo, Senator Snowe, Senator Collins, and Senator Craig. It \nhas the support of the National Association of State Veterans Homes and \nthe American Legion.\n  Mr. President, for too long, state veterans homes have been getting \nthat age-old promise from the federal government that the check is in \nthe mail.\n  In my home state of Utah, the Utah State Veterans Nursing Home has \nexperienced tremendous difficulties in receiving per diem payments from \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs. The Utah veterans home was \ncertified in January 1999. But it did not see a single payment from the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs until June 1999--six months.\n  Now, I ask my colleagues: what business can go without payment for \nsix months without having to cut corners or stiff its own creditors? \nHow are these veterans homes supposed to provide quality care if they \ndo not know from month to month what their operating budget will be? \nHow are they going to pay their personnel, their food service \nproviders, linen services, and so on. How are they going to pay for \nroutine repairs on the plant? The VA simply has to find a way to get \nthese payments out on time.\n  In Utah's situation, the per diem payment for April and May came in \nlate June. The payment for June still has not been received. The July \nand August payments were received in September.\n  Let me be clear about this point. The Department of Veterans Affairs \nwas not withholding those funds because of quality of care or \ncompliance problems in the Utah veterans' nursing home or because of \nthe lack of funds.\n  On the contrary, the VA was forthright in saying that the paperwork \ngot lost on somebody's desk. Now, I can understand that, and I \ncertainly want to say that I appreciate getting an honest explanation \nfor this. I have lost things, and I am sure all Senators have lost \nthings from time to time.\n  My problem, however, is that this clearly was not a one-time \noccurrence. These late payments have become the rule not the exception, \nand the Utah veterans home has not been the only victim. I understand \nthat veterans nursing homes all over the country have had to suffer \nthese late per diem payments and that veterans homes in Oregon and \nMaine, for example, have had similar difficulties. As a veterans \nnursing home operator in Maine put it, ``It is something that we have \nlearned to live with.''\n  Mr. President, maintaining a quality nursing care facility is a \ndifficult enough job as it is without the federal government imposing \nthe additional burden of not getting the funds out to these state \nveterans homes on time.\n\n  Our veterans homes should not have to ``learn to live with it.'' If \nthe federal government has taken on this responsibility, then it needs \nto deliver. If the VA cannot fulfill this obligation under existing \nlaw, then it should report to the Veterans' Affairs Committees of the \nSenate and House and seek assistance to do so.\n  These state veterans homes are simply too critical a component in our \neffort to care for America's elderly veterans. By giving these state \nveterans homes short shrift, we give our veterans short shrift. I know \nthat this is not what the VA intends.\n  It has been argued that the VA needs the authority to withhold per \ndiem payments as leverage for corrective action taken by homes that may \nhave compliance problems.\n  Mr. President, I absolutely agree that the VA should enforce the \napplicable quality standards for these veterans homes. I modified my \namendment to address this concern. Deficiencies that affect patient \ncare and safety should be promptly corrected, and my amendment allows \nthe VA to withhold per diem payments is such deficiencies have been \nidentified and the home is notified about them in writing prior to the \ndue date of the expected payment. This would provide the home the \nopportunity to act on the deficiencies so as not to miss a payment.\n  Additionally, I believe that serious and ongoing deficiencies warrant \ndecertification. No state veterans home that is not certified should \nreceive payments.\n  But, Mr. President, neither we here in the Senate, nor the VA, should \nforget that the effective management of these veterans facilities needs \nreliable funding. We cannot expect the best quality of care for our \nveterans if the state veterans home is receiving only sporadic per diem \npayments. The haphazard manner in which the VA has made per diem \npayments has itself become a cause for concern about quality in these \nhomes.\n  I trust that the VA, given the impetus of this amendment, will take \nsteps to improve this payment process and get the per diem payments out \non time.\n  Moreover, I urge my colleagues on the Veterans' Affairs' Committee to \ntake a serious look at this issue.\n\n\n                   upper midwest aerospace consortium\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, about four years ago I hosted NASA \nDirector Dan Goldin at the University of North Dakota where he met with \nrepresentatives from universities in Montana, North and South Dakota, \nIdaho and Wyoming. We felt it was important to meet with Mr. Goldin to \nexplore ways in which NASA satellite data could be\n\n[[Page S11415]]\n\nhelpful to the public in a region which has always seemed so far \nremoved from the activities of NASA.\n  Over the course of these four years, I believe NASA has been very \nimpressed with the innovations of this group, called the Upper Midwest \nAerospace Consortium. UMAC's primary focus has been to make NASA data \nuseful to the public, particularly farmers, ranchers, resource \nmanagers, educators, and small businesses. For example, noxious weed \ndetection through the NASA satellite data has had an astounding effect \non eradicating and stemming the spread of noxious weeds on cattle \nrangelands; wheat farmers have planned their fertilizer applications to \noptimize their crop yields; and teachers and teacher-educators have \nprepared geographic information systems that bring modern spatial \ntechnologies to rural classrooms.\n  All of these innovations and uses have been the result of three \ngrants that UMAC has won competitively through NASA's peer review \nprocess. The organization has now proven its value in a region where \nNASA's presence had previously been nearly nonexistent. It has reached \nthe juncture where it must achieve the stability that only a long-term \ncommitment by NASA can ensure.\n  Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Maryland and Ranking \nMinority Member of the VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee is well \nacquainted with the value of NASA's presence in her own state. Now we \nin the upper Midwest have developed the nucleus for NASA to create a \ncenter which would support and advance NASA activities in our region.\n  The report accompanying this bill contains language urging NASA to \nconsider creating a permanent center in the upper Midwest. While it is \ndifficult to find funds in this bill for this purpose, I would urge the \nSenate to provide $1 million during conference on the bill toward the \nestablishment of UMAC as a permanent entity to continue its work with \nNASA and the public.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The Senator from North Dakota is absolutely correct in \nhis observation about the need for NASA to share the value of its data \nand its expertise with all Americans. The states represented in UMAC \nare the most distant from any existing NASA Center, so the idea of \nstrengthening this organization for long-term service to this region is \njustified, and I pledge to work to achieve this goal during Conference.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the support of the Senator from Maryland for \nthe Upper Great Plains Aerospace Consortium and I thank her for her \ncomments.\n\n\n                     tubman african american museum\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today in hopes of engaging the \nRanking Member, Senator Mikulski, in a discussion about a project of \ngreat importance to me and the citizens of Macon, Georgia, specifically \nthe Tubman African American Museum.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I am glad to discuss this matter with my colleague.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I thank the distinguished ranking Member. The Tubman \nAfrican American Museum, located in Macon was founded in 1981. The \nMuseum is dedicated to educating people about all aspects of African \nAmerican art, history, and culture. In addition to its permanent and \nvisiting art exhibits, the museum hosts concerts, plays, celebrity \nstorytelling and frequent lectures by well-known authors. The benefits \nfrom these programs and others is not only to enhance the cultural \nopportunities for local residents, but also to showcase the \nsignificance of the social, cultural, and historical influence of \nAfrican American culture on our society. I strongly support the Tubman \nAfrican American Museum and believe that it strongly contributes to the \neducation and understanding of both local citizens and visitors to the \nMacon area. This museum also has the strong support of the local \ncommunity in Macon as well as prominent leaders in Georgia, including \nformer Governor Zell Miller, Senator Sam Nunn, Macon's Mayor Jack Ellis \nand Macon's former Mayor Jim Marshall.\n  The amendment that I have filed before the Senate would provide $2 \nmillion for the purposes of relocating and expanding the Tubman African \nAmerican Museum. The proposed new facility is estimated to cost $15 \nmillion. The City of Macon and Bibb County have proven their commitment \nand support for this project by already providing $775,000 for the \nproject's feasibility study and to purchase property in downtown Macon, \nthe selected site for this project. Senator Mikulski, I recognize the \nbudget constraints that you and Senator Bond are facing in trying to \nconsider many valuable projects that deserve funding. With this \nrecognition, I will be glad to withdraw my amendment. I simply ask that \nshould additional funding become available during conference with the \nHouse, I would greatly appreciate this project be given strong \nconsideration for funding.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank Senator Cleland for his cooperation and assure \nhim that during conference with the House, this project will be given \nevery consideration for funding.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I thank the distinguished Ranking Member.\n\n\n                             tubman museum\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support of \nthe Tubman Museum in Macon, Georgia and, with the help of Chairman Bond \nof the VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee, to clarify the use of \nCommunity Development Block Grants and the importance of projects such \nas the Tubman African Museum to create an economic development \nopportunity as well as to commemorate an important historical figure \nsuch as Harriet Tubman.\n  It is my understanding that Community Development Block Grants can be \nmade available to projects that create jobs, fill community needs, \neliminate physical or economic distress. Is this correct, Mr. Chairman?\n  Mr. BOND. The Senior Senator from Georgia is correct.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. It is my understanding that the Tubman African \nAmerican Museum fulfills all of the criteria requirements for such \ngrants and have supplied the Chairman with supporting evidence of the \nmuseum's qualifications.\n  Mr. BOND. That is correct.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Today, the Tubman Museum is Georgia's largest African \nAmerican museum and one of Macon's top downtown tourist attractions. In \njust five years, the museum's visitors have increased from less than \n5,000 in 1992 to over 65,000 in 1997.\n  It is my understanding that the requested $5.2 million would go \ntowards the development of a new museum facility in Macon, Georgia to \nmeet the expansion needs and the cultural, educational, social and \neconomic needs of the City of Macon.\n  It is also my understanding that the Tubman Museum may become a \nConference issue, and I ask every possible consideration be given to \nthe request.\n  Mr. BOND. I appreciate Senator Coverdell's dedication and efforts on \nbehalf of the Tubman African American Museum and look forward to \nworking with him on this project.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Chairman for his consideration and for his \nhard work on the committee.\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I introduced an amendment to the \nFiscal Year 2000 VA-HUD Appropriations bill that would have provided \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs with a new flow of non-appropriated \nrevenues, thereby benefiting all American veterans who rely on the \nagency's services. This legislation would improve the VA's ability to \ncollect insurance costs from third-party providers. Currently, the VA \ncollects only about one-third of the money it is owed by private \ninsurers through its Medical Care Cost Recovery (MCCR) program. The \nIndependent Budget prepared by AMVETS, Disabled American Veterans, \nParalyzed Veterans of America, and Veterans of Foreign Wars explicitly \ncalls for Congress to give VA the authority to privatize MCCR. My \nlegislation would require the VA to privately contract for these \ncollections for a period of three years, during which the VA would \ndevelop an internal process to improve medical cost recovery.\n  Unfortunately, I could not obtain the concurrence of the Chairmen of \nthe VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee or the Veterans Affairs \nCommittee to attach my amendment to this bill. Nonetheless, I will \ncontinue to fight for this proposal, as I believe it is a potential \nsource of considerable revenue for the chronically underfunded VA. \nSenate Veterans Affairs\n\n[[Page S11416]]\n\nCommittee Chairman Specter has told me that this is an important \namendment, and that his committee would give full consideration to my \nfree-standing legislation on VA medical cost collection. I look forward \nto working with him, our veterans service organizations, and other \nMembers of Congress to require the VA to improve its ineffective and \ndelinquent medical cost collection program. Doing so should help us \nmove the VA budget closer to the $20 billion target identified by those \nwho speak for America's veterans as necessary for sustaining our \ncommitment as a nation to care for those who have honorably served her \nin uniform.\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to thank both Senator Bond \nand Senator Mikulski for their hard work on this important legislation \nwhich provides federal funding for the Departments of Veterans Affairs \n(VA) and Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and Independent Agencies. \nHowever, once again, I find myself in the unpleasant position of \nspeaking before my colleagues about unacceptable levels of parochial \nprojects in this appropriations bill. Although the total level of pork-\nbarrel spending in this bill is down from last year's total of $607 \nmillion, this bill still contains nearly $470 million in wasteful, pork \nbarrel spending. This is an unacceptable amount of low priority, \nunrequested, wasteful spending.\n  The total value of specific earmarks in the Veterans Affairs section \nof this bill is about $80 million, $30 million more than last year.\n  Let me review some examples of items included in the bill. An \nespecially troublesome expense, neither budgeted for nor requested by \nthe Administration for the past eight years, is a provision that \ndirects the Department of Veterans Affairs to continue the eight-year-\nold demonstration project involving the Clarksburg, West Virginia VAMC \nand the Ruby Memorial Hospital at West Virginia University. Two years \nago, the VA-HUD appropriations bill contained a plus-up of $2 million \nto the Clarksburg VAMC that ended up on the Administration's line-item \nveto list and that the Administration had concluded was truly wasteful.\n  Like the transportation and military construction bills, the VA \nappropriations funding bill is a convenient vehicle to add building \nprojects to the President's budget request. For example, the bill adds \n$10 million in funding for a new National Cemetery in Oklahoma City/\nFort Sill, Oklahoma. Although this is a worthy cause, I wonder how many \nother national cemetery projects in other States were passed over to \nensure that Oklahoma's cemetery received the VA's highest priority. \nAnother project added to the bill was $3.9 million to convert \nunfinished space into research laboratories at the ambulatory care \naddition of the Harry S. Truman VAMC in Columbia, Missouri.\n  In the area of critical VA grant funding, again, certain projects in \nkey members' states received priority billing, including $50 million \nadded and made available to replace the boiler plant and construct a \ndietary facility at the Southeastern Veterans Center/Pennsylvania State \nVeterans Home in Spring City, Pennsylvania. Both projects were rejected \nby the Department of Veterans Affairs as wasteful spending of taxpayers \ndollars. Furthermore, the Department told the Committee that the \nresponsibility for maintenance, repair, and replacement of boiler power \nplants is the responsibility of the State of Pennsylvania.\n  Grant money totaling $14 million is added and made available for \ncemeteries in Bloomfield and Jacksonville, Missouri. Again, I am sure \nthat these are two worthwhile cemetery projects, but they push aside \nhigher priority cemetery grants, including one in my State of Arizona.\n  Earmarks aside--there are many good things about this bill.\n  Over the past four years, veterans' health care funding has been \nvirtually flat. This funding level has occurred as our veterans \npopulation is aging and in need of greater long-term health care that \nis often more expensive. Earlier this year, several key veterans \norganizations (the Disabled American Veterans, AMVETS, Paralyzed \nVeterans of America, and Veterans of Foreign Wars) reported in the \n``Independent Budget'' that President Clinton's budget is $3 billion \nless than is necessary to maintain current health care services to our \nnation's veterans. Furthermore, the American Legion has also been \nproactive with veterans nationwide and in discussions with me regarding \nthe severe inadequacies in veterans health care.\n  I was proud when the Senate passed legislation that Senator Wellstone \nand I sponsored earlier this year to add $3 billion in budget authority \nfor veterans health care and I felt that we had the commitment of the \nSenate, with a solid vote of 99-0.\n  Last week, I wrote to the Chairmen of the Senate Committee on \nAppropriations and VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee to ask that they \nincrease critical veterans health care funding that is not contained in \nthe President's budget. Unfortunately, the bill as reported only \nincluded $1.1 billion.\n  When the bill was brought to the Senate, I sponsored legislation with \nSenator Byrd that added $600 million and another critical amendment by \nSenator Wellstone that added an additional $1.3 billion to veterans \nhealth care. Unfortunately, the latter failed to pass. Although Senator \nByrd's amendment designates additional veterans funding under an \nemergency designation of the Balanced Budget Act, I agree with Chairman \nStevens' statement that we should find the additional $600 million in \nfunding from other than emergency designation. Such funding will prove \ninstrumental to ensuring that quality health care is delivered in a \ntimely manner in our nation's VA medical care facilities and preventing \nthe continued curtailment of essential veterans programs and services.\n  As I travel across the country, I am overwhelmed by the concerns of \nveterans regarding the poor health care situation in VA facilities. I \nam happy with the support and leadership that Senator Bond has provided \nin supporting a $1.7 billion plus-up to President Clinton's veterans \nbudget and commend him on his efforts. But more remains to be done. And \nI pledge to do everything in my power to correct this injustice in \nveterans health care funding in the future.\n  This bill also contains the funding for the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development (HUD) which is responsible for many programs vital in \nmeeting the housing needs of our nation and for the revitalization and \ndevelopment of our communities. The programs administered by HUD help \nour nation's families purchase their homes, assists many low-income \nfamilies obtain affordable housing, combats discrimination in the \nhousing market, assists in rehabilitating neighborhoods and helps our \nnation's most vulnerable--the elderly, disabled and disadvantaged have \naccess to safe and affordable housing.\n\n  While many of the programs funded in this portion of the bill are \nlaudable, I am deeply concerned about the number of earmarks in this \nsection of the bill. I will highlight just a few of the more egregious \nviolations of the budgetary review process. These include:\n  Six pages of earmarks dictating how a large portion of the Community \nDevelopment Block Grant money must be allocated. This is inappropriate \nand a direct violation of the appropriate budgetary process. More \nimportantly, it diverts critical funds from many communities which need \nthe funding for local development programs but are excluded from the \nfunds because of these egregious earmarks.\n  For example:\n  $1.7 million is earmarked for the Sheldon Jackson College Auditorium \nin Sitka, AK for refurbishing.\n  $1 million is set aside for the construction of a fire station \nproject in Logan, UT.\n  $1.2 million of CDBG funds are earmarked for renovating a gateway to \nhistoric downtown Madison, MS.\n  $1.75 million for the University of Nevada in Reno, NV for the \nStructures Laboratory.\n  $1.25 million for the revitalization of the Route 1 corridor.\n  $3.5 million for the University of Alaska Fairbanks Museum.\n  These are a few of the many earmarks in housing which put aside money \nfor specific projects and bypass the open, competitive process of \nselecting the most urgent and worthy projects, thereby limiting the \nfunds available to communities around the country who are not fortunate \nenough to reside in a community with a Senator on the Appropriations \nCommittee.\n\n[[Page S11417]]\n\nIn total, $93.2 million of the $4.8 billion for CDBG is earmarked for \nprojects selected for special set-asides.\n  Contained in both the bill and the Senate report is an exemption for \nAlaska and Mississippi from the requirement to have a public housing \nresident serving on the board of directors of PHAs for FY 2000.\n  Also contained in the bill is a provision preventing Peggy A. Burgin \nfrom being disqualified on the basis of age from residing at Clark's \nLanding in Groton, VT. While I do not know the specifics of this \nsituation, I do know that providing relief to a specific individual is \nno more appropriate than providing funding for a specific project or \nentity.\n  This bill also funds the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) which \nprovides critical resources to help state, local and tribal communities \nenhance capacity and infrastructure to better address their \nenvironmental needs. Protection of the environment is among our highest \nresponsibilities. I strongly support directing more resources to \ncommunities that are most in need and facing serious public health and \nsafety threats from environmental problems. Unfortunately, after a \nclose review of this year's Senate bill and report for EPA programs, I \nfind it difficult to believe that we are responding to the most urgent \nand pressing environmental issues. Instead, I am disturbed by the \ncontinuing trend to focus spending on more parochial interests rather \nthan on environmental priorities. In this year's bill and report, I \nfound nearly $207 million in unrequested, locality-specific, and low-\npriority earmarks.\n  There are many environmental needs in communities back in my home \nstate of Arizona but these communities will be denied funding as long \nwe continue to tolerate egregious earmarking that circumvents a regular \nmerit-review process. For example, earmarks are directed in the amount \nof $750,000 for painting and coating compliance enhancement project at \nthe Iowa Waste Reduction Center and an extra $200,000 for the \nUniversity of Missouri-Rolla to work with the Army to validate soysmoke \nas a replacement for petroleum fog oil in obscurant smoke used in \nbattlefield exercises. While these projects may be important, there is \nno explanation provided as to why the Administration did not prioritize \nthem as part of its budget or why these projects rank higher than other \nenvironmental priorities.\n  The subcommittee also saw fit to provide $400,000 for a Sound Program \nOffice in Long Island, New York. While this project may have merit, I \ncannot understand why we should spend almost half a million dollars on \na project which does not appear to be related to an environmental \nissue.\n  Furthermore, this bill directs more funding toward universities for \nresearch or consortia rather than directing resources to local \ncommunities for environmental protection. For independent agencies such \nas the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), this bill \nalso includes earmarks of money for locality-specific projects such as \n$3 million for a hands-on science center in Huntsville, Alabama, and \n$14 million for infrastructure needs of the Life Sciences building at \nthe University of Missouri-Columbia. For the National Science \nFoundation (NSF), there is $10 million added for the Plant Genome \nResearch Program.\n  The examples of wasteful spending that I have highlighted are only a \nfew of the examples of earmarks and special projects contained in this \nmeasure. There are many more low-priority, wasteful, and unnecessary \nprojects on the extensive list I have compiled. The full list is on my \nwebsite.\n  In closing, I urge my colleagues to develop a better standard to curb \nour habit of directing hard-earned taxpayer dollars to locality-\nspecific special interests so that instead, we can serve the national \ninterest.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to say a few words about the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Community Builders \nProgram. Community Builders are providing an important customer \nservice, and have been a key component of HUD's outreach efforts in \nrural states like North Dakota. As Mayor Carroll Erickson of Minot \nsaid: ``Through the Community Builders, HUD has become more accessible \nto communities such as Minot and to rural states like North Dakota. \nThis program is very effective and it should be retained.'' Or, as \nGrand Forks Mayor Pat Owens said: ``HUD's increased outreach and \nconsultation with non-traditional smaller communities is absolutely the \nright direction.''\n  Mr. President, the Community Builders program was part of HUD's \nsuccessful reorganization effort. Community Builders in North Dakota \nprovide technical assistance that is absolutely vital to rural \ncommunities. Those who have used the program have praised it as an \nexample of government's ability to provide helpful, efficient customer \nservice.\n  It would be a shame, Mr. President, for this successful program to be \nterminated even as it is starting to yield results. I urge the \nconferees to strongly support this program. I urge them to enable HUD's \nCommunity Builders to continue their important work of serving \nAmerica's rural and urban communities.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I'd like to take just a few moments to \nexpress my concern about the funding of the Round II Empowerment Zones. \nI recognize how difficult your job is to balance all the priorities \nwithin the VA-HUD appropriations bill, but I want to make the managers \nof this legislation aware of how important Empowerment Zones are to \ncommunities nationwide. While I will continue to seek a bill that will \nenact full funding of the Round II Empowerment Zones, we need to make \nsure there are adequate funds to continue the economic revitalization \nefforts this year.\n  Quite simply, the Round II Empowerment Zones and Enterprise \nCommunities represent a commitment made by the Congress in the 1997 \nTaxpayer Relief Act which approved a second round of competition for 20 \nnew empowerment zone designations. Congress did not follow through with \nthe grant money that complement the tax incentives that have already \nbeen approved. Without this funding, they will fall short of their \ngoals, particularly in their ability to leverage funds.\n  The Empowerment Zone program is of special importance to me because \nof my support of the efforts of Virginia's Norfolk-Portsmouth \nEmpowerment Zone. Norfolk-Portsmouth took the first step to reclaim \ntheir community when they won an Enterprise Community designation \nduring Round I competition. When Congress approved the Round II \ncompetition two years ago, Norfolk-Portsmouth won an ``upgrade'' to \nfull Empowerment Zone status. This means that Norfolk-Portsmouth has \nmore resources to leverage millions in public and private sector \ninvestments. Continued funding means a more well-prepared workforce to \ncomplement the tax credits already approved to attract employers. And \nthat's just scratching the surface of Norfolk-Portsmouth's potential. \nFrom May 1995 to June 1999, 60 percent of those completing training are \nemployed, with another 16 percent involved in additional training. \nOther cities have shown results just as impressive within its first \nyear: for example, in the Columbus Empowerment Zone in Ohio, they have \nso far created or retained 700 jobs in a zone that had a poverty rate \nof about 46 percent. Working with over 15 businesses in Columbus, they \nhave already secured about $700 million in private sector commitments.\n  This type of investment in Norfolk-Portsmouth and other cities is an \nexample of public-private partnerships at their very finest. \nEmpowerment Zones work because people in the community--local \ngovernment, the private sector and civic organizations work together to \ncreate a vision for their community and a strategic plan to achieve it. \nThis kind of collaboration, designed and created for the people of the \ncommunity by the people of the community, use public, private and non-\nprofit funds to create economic and community revitalization.\n  Without question, our nation is experiencing good economic times. But \nif we are to include those who are striving mightily to also \nparticipate in our economic prosperity, the time to do so is now. One \nway we can do this is by supporting the work of the Round II designees.\n\n[[Page S11418]]\n\n  With some additional appropriation in the VA-HUD bill, the Round II \ndesignees will have just enough to continue the work they're doing. The \nAdministration is fully behind this effort and I understand they will \nbe working on this issue with the Chair and Ranking Member.\n  I hope the money allotted to Round II Empowerment Zones in the \nHousing and Urban Development budget and approved by the President will \nbe restored.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have several concerns about provisions \nin the pending bill, especially the failure to provide any housing \nvouchers and the termination of the community builders program.\n  We are all aware of the critical need for housing vouchers for low \nincome families. Our nation is experiencing tremendous economic growth \nand expansion, with record low unemployment. Yet it is clear that for \nmany families the cost of housing is still out of control.\n  In Boston, housing affordability is a problem for many families, and \nit is becoming a problem for businesses as well in their efforts to \nattract and retain employees.\n  The Clinton Administration has requested 100,000 new housing vouchers \nin this bill. Such vouchers will not solve the housing crisis, but for \nthe families helped, this will go a long way toward stabilizing their \nfamilies and helping them to lift themselves out of poverty to economic \nself-sufficiency. Yet this bill provides not one new voucher.\n  We are all aware of the budget constraints under which we are \noperating. Yet it is unacceptable not to find any resources to address \nthis unmet need.\n  Another issue that deserves higher priority is the Community Builders \nprogram, which is an important element in making HUD a better, more \neffective, more customer-responsive agency.\n  The Community Builders program has helped improve the way HUD works \nand interacts with its customers and clients, the American people.\n  These Community Builders are people with impressive experience in the \nhousing and community development world. Their expertise helps HUD to \nmeet the needs of communities throughout our nation.\n  Now, however, after these Community Builders have been hired, and in \nmany instances, relocated in order to serve the communities in which \nthey are most needed, the pending bill proposes to eliminate funding \nfor the program. This step would be a serious waste of the investment \nthat has been made in hiring these qualified and talented men and women \nwho are willing to share their expertise to improve the way HUD serves \nthe American people.\n  I urge my colleagues to address both of these issues as the \nconference committee works to reconcile the House and Senate bills. At \na time when Secretary Cuomo has taken such significant steps to improve \nthe management of the agency, we should not undermine programs which \nare meeting important needs and improving the way HUD serves the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I come before the Senate today to address \nan issue of critical importance for the people of my State of Georgia \nand the Nation. It is a matter of personal relevance to me. The issue \nis our treatment of our nation's veterans and particularly their health \ncare.\n  Upon returning from Vietnam after sustaining my injuries, I was \nintroduced to the VA system, where I received quality care from a VA \nhospital. It was then that my awareness of veterans and veterans issues \ntook hold. Since then, not only have I been a patient, but I also had \nthe honor of serving as the Administrator of the Veterans \nAdministration during the Carter Administration.\n  This year has seen a welcome and overdue increase in attention to the \nplight of our nation's veterans. I salute the Chairmen and Ranking \nMembers of the Appropriations Committee and the VA/HUD Subcommittee for \ntheir successful efforts to increase funding in this bill for veterans \nhealth care, and I regret that the Senator from Minnesota's attempts to \nprovide an even more adequate boost in such funding were not approved.\n  I am particularly proud that earlier this year the Senate passed my \nlegislation to establish new national cemeteries not only in Metro \nAtlanta, but also in Pennsylvania, Florida, California, and Michigan--\nthe areas with the greatest documented need for such facilities. While \nI understand the difficult budgetary constraints which confronted the \nVA/HUD Subcommittee, I believe it is unfortunate that no funding or \nreport language consistent with the authorizing legislation for new \nnational cemeteries has been included. I have an amendment which would \nseek to correct this shortcoming, at least with respect to the Metro \nAtlanta cemetery.\n  I also introduced the Federal Civilian and Uniformed Services Long-\nTerm Care Insurance Act of 1999. This legislation would provide the \nopportunity for Federal employees, as well as current and retired \nmembers of the uniformed services, to obtain long-term care insurance \nto assist them with nursing home or other long-term care. Working \nclosely with the distinguished Ranking Member of the VA/HUD \nSubcommittee as well as a number of other Senators from both sides of \nthe aisle, we are close to having a consensus bill which I hope will \nreceive favorable Senate action in this Congress.\n  This year has also seen the passage of H.R. 1568, the Veterans \nEntrepreneurship and Small Business Development Act. Included in the \nbill is language from S. 918, the Military Reservists Small Business \nRelief Act, which I co-sponsored. The bill provides financial and \ntechnical assistance to veteran-owned small businesses through the \nSmall Business Administration (SBA). It also offers assistance to \nbusinesses owned by reservists during and following times of military \nconflict. America's reservists and veterans supported our nation, and \nit is now time for our nation to demonstrate its commitment to them and \ntheir small businesses.\n  We are here today, Mr. President, to debate and approve the VA/HUD \nappropriations budget for fiscal year 2000. It is with a renewed sense \nof hope that I will support this legislation, which will represent the \nfirst real increase for veterans programs after a five year flat-lined \nbudget. The House has already supported the $1.7 billion increase for \nthe VA, and with the Senate's earlier action on this bill, we are now \nin agreement with the House position.\n\n  The VA estimates that there are 25.6 million veterans in America. Our \nnation is proud to count within its population 3,400 World War I \nveterans, 5,940,000 World War II veterans, 4,064,000 Korean War \nveterans, 8,113,000 Vietnam War veterans, and 2,223,000 Gulf War \nveterans. My home state of Georgia has a veterans population of \n667,128.\n  Department of Veterans Affairs facilities have grown over the years \nfrom 50 hospitals in 1930 to today's 171 medical centers, 350 \noutpatient, community, and outreach clinics and 126 nursing home care \nunits.\n  The Department of Veterans Affairs has undergone many changes in \nrecent years. I appreciate the general direction in which this agency \nis moving to answer the challenges of the new millennium. \nUnfortunately, these changes, exacerbated by under funding, have too \nfrequently disrupted the service systems for our veterans. The VA has \nfound cost savings and efficiencies in outpatient care, a departure \nfrom the long-term hospital care of the past. This shift allows the VA \nto reach beyond the normal geographic locations through Telemedicine \nand Telepharmacy to Medicare subvention. I support these proposals to \nmove the VA beyond the large hospitals to more rural and small markets \nto provide access to all veterans.\n  Despite these new directions, there is still more to be done. As I \nstated, this is the first significant increase in the VA budget in five \nyears. The department is seeing a rise in veterans seeking treatment \nbecause of the recently enacted VA enrollment plan and the aging of our \nveterans population. The VA estimates an increase in total patients to \n3.6 million in 2000, up from 2.7 million in 1997. However, with this \ngrowing patient load, the VA is currently estimating a reduction in VA \nemployment of up to 8,000 employees in the medical system alone. This \nfact was recently brought home to me by announcements of serious \npotential reductions in force at the VA in Augusta if the VA budget is \nnot boosted.\n  As President Coolidge was quoted as saying, ``The nation which \nforgets its\n\n[[Page S11419]]\n\ndefenders will be itself forgotten.'' Simply put, our veterans \ncommunity--who won the two great World Wars of this Century, vanquished \nSaddam Hussein and Slobodan Milosevich, and served honorably and well \nin Korea and Vietnam--needs our support. Our former service members \nshould not only be the first in our hearts, but the first in our \npriorities when it comes to keeping the promises of the nation. They \nkept their commitment to us, let us fulfill our promise to them. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there are no further amendments, the \nquestion is on the engrossment of the amendments and third reading of \nthe bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read a third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  The bill (H.R. 2684), as amended, was passed.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent the Senate insist on its \namendment, request a conference with the House on the disagreeing votes \nof the two Houses thereon, and the Chair be authorized to appoint \nconferees on the part of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered.\n  The Presiding Officer (Mr. Bunning) appointed Mr. Bond, Mr. Burns, \nMr. Shelby, Mr. Craig, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Stevens, Ms. \nMikulski, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Byrd and Mr. \nInouye conferees on the part of the Senate.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, before we leave the floor, I commend the \nchairman of the VA-HUD appropriations subcommittee, Mr. Bond, who put a \nlot of effort into getting this legislation ready to consider on the \nfloor, and, as always, the very cooperative spirit and dedication of \nthe ranking member, Senator Mikulski from Maryland. The two of them \nmake a great team. They were able to move a very large bill with a lot \nof issues that could have been very difficult to deal with. I commend \nthem.\n  Also, I thank the chairman of the full committee whom we have to call \nthe ultimate player. He is chair of the full committee, chairman of the \nDefense Subcommittee, and he fills in on the VA-HUD subcommittee. I am \nsure he is watching the agriculture conference, the energy and water \nconference. A person has to be dexterous to be chairman of the \ncommittee. I commend Senator Stevens for his willingness to do all of \nthat and to be here to help wrap up this bill.\n  I thank the committee for their efforts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I, too, would like to express my very \ndeep appreciation to the chairman of the full Appropriations Committee, \nSenator Stevens, as well as the ranking member, Senator Byrd. On two \noccasions their direct intervention enabled us to move this bill, first \nto add the $7 billion, where we were below last year's funding. We were \nvery appreciative because without that we could not have moved this or \nelse we would have been in gimmicks and a variety of other things. \nAlso, Senator Stevens and Senator Byrd gave us the opportunity to add \n$600 million in veterans funding. Therefore no facility will be closed. \nWe will be able to meet the needs of our veterans.\n  So I thank the Senator from Alaska as well as the Senator from West \nVirginia, Mr. Byrd, for helping us to move this bill. I also express my \nappreciation to Senator Bond for all his help in moving this bill, the \nconsultation with the minority party, the collegial relationships, and \nessentially being able to meet the needs of the American people.\n  I thank Senator Bond's staff, Jon Kamarck, Carrie Apostolou, Cheh \nKim, and Joe Norrell for all their hard work on this bill, and a \nspecial thanks to my own staff, Paul Carliner, Sean Smith, and Jeannine \nSchroeder.\n  I am proud of the bill we passed today because I believe it takes \ncare of national interests and national needs. I also believe that this \nbill provides a solid bridge between the old century and the new \ncentury. In the old century, we saw the ravages of war and the ravages \nof the environment.\n  Now we are ready to complete our move from the industrial age to the \ninformation age, and the programs this bill funds will allow us to do \nthat.\n  This bill provides an opportunity structure for home ownership and \nwider opportunities for educational advancement. In addition, it will \nallow us to stay the course in technology. Our mission is to honor the \nold century, but move swiftly into the new one.\n  The VA-HUD bill is about: meeting our obligations to our veterans, \nserving our core constituencies, creating real opportunity for people, \nand advancing science and technology.\n  Perhaps the most important is the need to ensure that we keep the \npromises we made to our veterans. The bill we passed today provides $19 \nbillion in funding for veterans health care, and the Byrd-Bond-\nMikulski-Stevens amendment provided $600 million in additional funding, \nan increase of $1.7 billion over the President's request. In addition, \nI am pleased that we were able to maintain funding for VA medical \nresearch at $316 million.\n  The VA plays a very important role in medical research for the \nspecial needs of our veterans, such as geriatrics, Alzheimers, \nParkinson's and orthopedic research. The entire nation benefits from VA \nmedical research--particularly as our population continues to age.\n  We also provide full funding to treat Hepatitis C, which is a growing \nproblem among the veterans population, particularly for our Vietnam \nVeterans. This bill funds the State Veterans Homes at $90 million. The \nState Homes serve as our long-term care and rehabilitation facilities \nfor our veterans. I am also pleased that the bill includes important \nlanguage related to the Ft. Howard VA medical center that will ensure \nquality care during its transition to a mixed-use facility.\n  We have also made sure that we take care of our working families by \nfunding housing programs that millions depend upon. The bill that we \nbrought to the floor yesterday provides $10.8 billion to renew all \nexisting section 8 housing vouchers. That means those who have vouchers \nwill continue to receive them. I hope that should additional funding \nbecome available, we will be able to provide additional vouchers. I am \npleased that we also maintained level funding for other critical core \nHUD programs.\n  Funding for housing for the elderly and the disabled has been \nincreased by $50 million over last year, with additional funding for \nassisted living and service coordinators within the section 202 \nprogram. Homeless assistance grants are funded at the President's \nrequest.\n  In addition, we have funded drug elimination grants and Youthbuild at \nlast year's level, and the Community Development Block Grant Program is \nfunded at $4.8 billion.\n  I'm pleased that we were able to provide funds for several projects \nin my home state: $750,000 for the Patterson Park Community Development \nCorporation to establish a revolving fund to acquire and rehabilitate \nproperties in East Baltimore; $1,250,000 for the University of \nMaryland--Eastern Shore for the development of a Coastal Ecology \nTeaching and Research Center; $1,250,000 for Prince Georges County for \nthe revitalization of the Route 1 corridor. In addition, I have \nincluded report language that directs HUD to continue its efforts to \nbridge the information technology gap in communities through its \n``Neighborhood Networks Initiative.''\n  The Neighborhood Networks Initiative brings computers and internet \naccess to HUD assisted housing projects in low income communities. This \nwill help us to ensure that every American has the ability to cross \nwhat Bill Gates has called the ``digital divide.'' I have seen the \nresults of the Neighborhood Networks Initiative firsthand in Baltimore, \nand I look forward to seeing it in many other communities across the \ncountry.\n\n  With regard to NASA funding, I was extremely troubled by the House \nversion of the bill. The House bill included devastating funding cuts \nto America's space agency, including the\n\n[[Page S11420]]\n\nGoddard Space Flight Center and Wallops Flight Facility. The House bill \ncuts 2,000 jobs at Goddard and Wallops. The Senate bill we pass today \nwill save 2,000 jobs at Goddard and Wallops. I fought hard to restore \nfunding for NASA, and I am truly pleased that this bill will save those \njobs. NASA is fully funded in this bill, at $13.5 billion, the same as \nthe President's request. Funding for the space shuttle, space station, \nand critical science programs are funded at the President's request.\n  National Service is funded at $423 million, a slight reduction from \nlast year. I continue to hope that this funding can be increased as we \nmove toward conference. National Service has enrolled over 100,000 \nmembers and participants across the country in a wide array of \ncommunity service programs, including: AmeriCorps, Learn and Serve \nAmerica, and the National Senior Service Corps.\n  With regard to the EPA, the Subcommittee has provided $7.3 billion in \ntotal funding. The Subcommittee increased funding for EPA's core \nenvironmental programs: $825 million for the drinking water state \nrevolving fund, and $1.3 billion for the clean water revolving fund, \nincluding $5 million for sewer upgrades in Cambridge and Salisbury, \nMaryland.\n  Taking care of local communities infrastructure needs has always been \na priority for me and this committee. We also provided $250,000 for a \nKempton Mine remediation project. Superfund is funded at $1.4 billion, \ndown slightly from last year.\n  I'm especially pleased that we were able to support the President's \nfull request for the Chesapeake Bay Program Office--over $18 million--\nfor FY 2000. The Chesapeake Bay Program Office is a leader in efforts \nto restore the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem for future generations. We also \nincreased funding for the Chesapeake Bay Small Watershed Program that \nhelps our small communities and prevents runoff and pollution.\n  FEMA has $1 billion in the disaster relief fund. The bill we pass \ntoday adds $300 million to the disaster relief fund. This will help \npeople in the Eastern United States who are still dealing with the \nhorrible aftermath of Hurricane Floyd. That is why I'm glad that this \nbill was passed, and that FEMA will continue to be able to help those \nwho are affected by natural disasters. We will await any further \nAdministration request for disaster assistance in light of Hurricane \nFloyd.\n  The National Science Foundation is funded at $3.9 billion, which is \n$250 million more than fiscal year 1999. This funding level will allow \nus to make critical investments in science and technology into the next \ncentury. The funding increase for NSF is an important step for \nmaintaining our science and technology base.\n  Mr. President, I recognize that there may have been certain \nprovisions in this bill that members may have disagreed with or \nopposed. I acknowledge their concerns. But I am very pleased that we \nworked together to pass this bill today, and I hope we can resolve any \noutstanding differences as this process continues. I believe the VA/HUD \nbill is good for Maryland, good for America, and good for the American \npeople who rely on the programs it funds.\n  I thank Senator Bond and my colleagues once again for their support \nfor this bill.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I see the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia. Does he seek the floor?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, no Senator in this body exceeds the Senator \nfrom West Virginia in his appreciation of the work that the Senator \nfrom Alaska does as chairman of the Appropriations Committee. He is an \noutstanding chairman. I am proud to serve with him. He always works \nwith me in these matters concerning allocations, and I cannot find the \nwords to adequately praise him. He is doing an excellent job. No \nSenator in this body, including the Senator speaking, could ever be a \nbetter chairman of that committee than Senator Stevens.\n  I served with a lot of chairmen of that committee over the years, but \nit is a two-way street. It is a team effort. This Senator contends it \nwill always be that, whether I am ranking member or whether I am the \nchairman. I try to give my full cooperation to Senator Stevens. We have \nnever had a difference on the committee, not when I was chairman--he \nwas not the ranking member at that time, but he has done an excellent \njob. He has seen the need to increase the amount of moneys for \nveterans' health care, and upon several occasions I have talked with \nhim about the need to increase the amount. I took the lead, inside the \ncommittee, in increasing that amount by $1.1 billion. He fully \nsupported me. It is the chairman, in the main, who decides how much \nmoney will be allocated to the various subcommittees. But I believe it \nis my job as ranking member to work with him. If I have any \ndifferences, I let him know, but I have never had any differences with \nSenator Stevens.\n  So I wanted to add my compliments concerning the distinguished \nSenator. I also want to compliment Senator Bond, again, the chairman of \nthe VA subcommittee, for the excellent work he has done on that \nsubcommittee. I compliment the ranking member, Senator Mikulski, for \nthe work she does. When she was chairman of that subcommittee, she was \none of the best subcommittee chairmen--I don't say chairperson--she was \none of the best chairmen that we had of any subcommittee.\n  I did not want this day to pass without this lowly ranking member \nhaving an opportunity to say some good words about the people who are \nentitled to commendation. It doesn't make any difference to me whether \nthey are Republicans or Democrats. If they are entitled to \ncommendation, I give it to them.\n  So I applaud you, Mr. Chairman, not only for doing a good job but for \nbeing the fair and considerate Senator that you are, and also a fair \nand considerate chairman as well. Again, I have to say some good words \nabout Senator Bond, Senator Mikulski. They could not be better. They \ncould not be more fair. They could not be more considerate.\n  They are hamstrung, as you are, Mr. Chairman, by the fact that we do \nnot have enough money. I am for raising the caps. I am for telling the \nAmerican people the truth. We need more money. Let's raise those caps. \nI am not a bit backwards about saying I support raising the caps. We \nhave to meet the people's needs. I hope we will get around to that. I \nthink we are going to have to do that before it is over.\n  I thank Senators for their patience for listening, but I wanted to \nget in my two cents' worth of commendations also.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Senator very much.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am sure Senator Mikulski and Senator Bond appreciate \nthose kind words from the Senator from West Virginia as much as I do. I \ndo thank the Senator for his cooperation and willingness to work with \nme as chairman of this committee. It is a distinct honor to follow him \nas chairman.\n  We should mention, on our side, the help of Paul Carliner, Jeannine \nSchroeder, and Sean Smith, who worked with Senator Mikulski. This has \nbeen a very fine working team. Senator Bond, Senator Mikulski, and the \nteam of both the majority and minority have worked very hard to meet \nthe needs of the agencies and the American people under this bill, \nunder some very difficult circumstances in regard to ceilings and \nlimits under which they had to live. I, again, emphasize the Budget \nCommittee has filed a statement saying this bill is within the budget.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/24/senate-section/article/S11420-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--H.R. 1402\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, again I thank the members of the VA-HUD \nappropriations subcommittee and the full committee for their good work. \nAlso, I am pleased we were able to work out an agreement as to how we \ncould proceed for the remainder of the day. We have now completed \naction on the VA-HUD appropriations bill. The education issue that was \nbeing discussed earlier by Senator Daschle, Senator Gregg, and Senator \nKennedy, and others who will be commenting in a few minutes, those two \nissues will be considered back-to-back on Monday.\n  There will, obviously, be no further votes today. The next votes will \noccur at 5:30 on Monday. As it now stands, there will be two votes at \nthat time.\n  The Senate has done good work this week. In addition to completing \naction on the VA-HUD appropriations bill, after a lot of delay and \nunnecessary obstruction, in my opinion, we were able to complete the \nInterior appropriations bill, and we also passed, by an overwhelming \nvote, the defense authorization conference report for the year--a good \nbill. Senator Warner and his Armed Services Committee members, Senator \nThurmond, Senator Levin, did an excellent job on that bill. I certainly \nexpect and hope the President will sign the defense authorization \nconference report and, hopefully, the Interior Committee conference \nwill get underway on Monday, and the VA-HUD conference as well.\n  That leaves only one appropriations bill to be considered in the \nSenate before all 13 of them will be completed. I believe we are well \nahead of where we have been in many years in getting that done. It is \nactually possible that we could get the Labor-HHS-Education \nappropriations bill up by Tuesday or Wednesday of next week and either \ncomplete it before the end of the fiscal year or within a day of that, \nand then, of course, go to conference.\n  Will it be easy? No. I am sure it is going to be an interesting \ndebate, but that is as it should be. I look forward to completing that \nwork and moving forward with the appropriations conference reports. I \nhope there will be one or two conference reports that might be \navailable on Monday. Whenever they become available, we will consider \nthem that day or the next day. Energy and water is close to being \ncompleted, I believe, and Agriculture is still in the mill. We hope to \nget those done.\n  I do want to emphasize that I think the way we worked out handling \nthis education issue is much better than having it on the VA-HUD \nappropriations bill. It does not relate to the VA-HUD bill. I did not \nthink it should have been offered on that appropriations bill, even \nthough it was offered as a sense of the Senate. It is better to handle \nit the way we have agreed to do it.\n  Senator Daschle seemed to question whether we intended to go to the \nLabor-HHS appropriations bill. I have been saying for weeks we intend \nto do it. As soon as the committee reports it out, we will have it on \nthe floor as soon as the rules allow. I have been saving next week for \nits consideration. Education amendments, I am sure, will be offered \nnext week when this bill is considered in the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/24/senate-section/article/S11421-2", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11421-S11423]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    REAUTHORIZING THE ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ACT OF 1965\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to comment a bit about education. \nFirst, let me lay down a predicate about myself. I feel very strongly \nabout the need for quality, safe, and drug-free education in America. \nWe have lost our edge in education. Our kids are not getting as good an \neducation as they should. In fact, I do not think they are getting as \ngood an education as we were getting in the fifties and sixties. There \nhas unfortunately been a steady decline in our schools. While some \nschools are doing a little better and some scores are, in many areas \nour schools are not what they should be.\n  I said three things: Quality, safe, drug-free schools. We have a lot \nof work to do in these areas.\n  I will not stand second to any Member of the Senate when it comes to \nfeeling strongly about education and advocating on behalf of education, \nbut it has to be done in the right way.\n  What has happened is the education establishment is firmly entrenched \nin the status quo. They believe that we should stay in this box, and we \nshould not change it and, by the way, it should be run from Washington. \nThat is not the answer, in my opinion.\n  I want to make this clear: While I think we should have choice in \neducation, I am a product of public education from the first grade \nthrough the second, third, and fourth grades where I went to school at \nDuck Hill, MS, and I had better teachers in the second, third, and \nfourth grades in Duck Hill, MS, than I had the rest of my life. They \nwere probably better than most people have had in these very fancy and \nbetter funded schools. Those teachers loved their students. They worked \nhard and taught us the basics. I have never forgotten them, and I \nappreciate what they did.\n  I went to public school all the way through college and law school. \nSo did my wife, so did my son, and so did my daughter. So when some \nSenators get up and pontificate that we cannot allow students to have \nchoice, that we have to save public education--let me be clear, I want \npublic education. I want every student, regardless of religion, income \nlevel, race, sex, or anything else, to get a good education. But the \ntragedy is that that may not always be in a particular school. If a \npublic school in your neighborhood is not doing the job, you ought to \nbe able to leave.\n\n  Some people say if that happens, the bad schools will fail. Right. It \nis called competition. Produce, give quality education, drug-free and \nsafe, or get out of the business.\n  To tell students--intelligent students, needy students, poor \nstudents--they have to go to this school no matter what is wrong. Why \nis it in America that our elementary and secondary education is ranked \n17th in the world and yet our higher education is No. 1 in the world? \nWhat is the difference? Why are we doing so poorly at the elementary \nand secondary level and doing so well in higher education?\n  There are a couple of simple answers. First of all, when you finish \nhigh school, rich or poor, whatever State you live in, you have a \nchoice: You can go to work if you have had vocational education in high \nschool, or you can go to additional training. You can go to a community \ncollege, you can go to a State university, you can go to a parochial \ncollege, you can go out of State, you can go to Harvard. You get to \nchoose what fits your needs. But in elementary and secondary education, \noh, no, you have to do it the way we tell you in this box. No choice. \nThat is one problem.\n  The second problem is financial support. I am from a poor, blue-\ncollar family. When I was in college, I worked and got a loan which, by \nthe way, I paid back 1 year after I graduated. I could not have made \nit, though, if I had not been able to work for the university and get \nloans.\n  In America--and I hope every student in America and every parent \nhears me now--in America, when every child finishes high school, they \ncan get a college education. No doubt about it. Some people say: I come \nfrom a family with no money. Hey, I was in a family with no money. At \none point, I had no family. But I got a loan. Other students can get a \ngrant or a supplemental grant or a State scholarship, a private \nscholarship. The financial aid is there. Every student can get an \neducation in America.\n  There is financial aid when you go to college but not when you are in \nelementary and secondary school. Senator Coverdell wants to remedy \nthat. He wants to allow parents to save for their children's education \nso that the financial support will be there to choose a different \nschool if you want to, to help you with the books, to help you get a \ncomputer, to help you get a uniform if that is what you need--choice \nand financial opportunity.\n  I want to add this: I am the son of a schoolteacher, and I still act \nlike one sometimes. At times, my staff brings in a letter which has bad \ngrammar. I feel a little guilty, but I start marking on it: This is \nsurplus language; this is not correct grammar.\n  My mother taught for 19 years. So I care about education. I worked \nfor 3 years of my life at the University of Mississippi. I worked in \nthe placement office helping students get jobs when they graduated, and \nI worked in the financial aid office. I was the one who\n\n[[Page S11422]]\n\nadded up the numbers to see if a student got a grant or a loan. I met \nwith the students. I handled the scholarships. The best scholarship in \nthe university was a Carrier scholarship. I interviewed the students \nwho applied for it.\n  When I finished undergraduate school, I worked in the placement \nbureau of the law school to help law students find employment in law \nfirms, and I was head of the law alumni association. So I have had \nexperience in the academic sphere of the university.\n  One of the great things I did for 2 years is I went to every school \nin the State of Mississippi--every one. I met with the students, I \ntalked with the teachers, I talked with the guidance counselors. I was \na member of the State Guidance Counselors Association. I went into \nschools. I actually stood outside and looked at some buildings and \nsaid: I am not sure I want to go in there; this may fall down.\n  I remember the commitment of the teachers. I remember the efforts of \nthe guidance counselors. I really believe education was better then \nthan it is now, and that is sad. We have to do something about that.\n  When some people allege that Republicans do not care about education, \nthey don't know what they are talking about. I will put my credentials, \nmy background in public education, my feelings about education against \nanybody in this Chamber. Our party, the Republican Party in the Senate, \nhas determined that education is our first priority. S. 1, the first \nbill I introduced, improves education. We want full funding for \neducation. I want to fund education at the level the President asked \nfor and more, if we can find a way to do it.\n  But there is a key difference: We want to do it differently.\n  I have no confidence whatsoever in this body or in any bureaucrat in \nWashington, DC, to make the right decisions on education--none. The \nteachers, the parents, the students, the communities in Wyoming and in \nMississippi, know best what those students need. They know their \nstudents. They know their needs. They know the community. They know \nwhat they can afford. They know what they can spend. And they do not \nneed some nameless, faceless bureaucrat or some Senator from some other \nState telling them: You are to spend it here or spend it there.\n  I trust the people; I trust the teachers at the local level. I do not \ntrust the unions. I do not trust the Department of Education. I voted \nto make it a separate Department because I thought it was being \nundermined in the old Department it was in; it was gobbled up by other \nthings. Maybe I made a mistake. I want to give education a high \npriority, but I do not think this Department up here, inside the \nBeltway, in this administration or in previous administrations, has \nhelped education much. They are part of the problem. Let the local \npeople make the decisions.\n  I want to make this point, too. There are those who say what we need \nis more money. Yes, everybody comes to Washington knocking on the door: \nI need more money. We need bigger Government. That is ridiculous. We \nare wasting too much of the people's money here in Washington, DC. We \ndo not need more money in this Government.\n  When was the last time any Senator had somebody show up and say: Hey, \nwe can do better with less? No. The American people say they want a \nbalance. The American people say they want to make sure we do not spend \nthe Social Security surplus. But yet then the professional lobbyists \nsay: We want more.\n  It is all good. I am from an agricultural State. Agriculture wants \nmore. I appreciate what the veterans have done for our country. \nVeterans want more. Armed services are important for the future \nsecurity of our families. They need more. We would like to have the \nAmerican dream of having a home available for everybody. Fine. I think \nit ought to be done in the private sector. I think the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development, as a whole, is a miserable failure. I \ncould go down every Department, every agency; and I support a lot of \nthem.\n  I do support ships being built in my hometown of Pascagoula, MS. But \nI do not see a hunk of steel. I see pipe fitters, boilermakers, \nlaborers. I see men and women and Indians out there pulling those steel \nlines, running those cranes, and providing for the defense of our \ncountry. I wanted more money for NASA, but you cannot have it both \nways.\n  One of the interesting things about the resolution that was \nintroduced by Senator Kennedy and Senator Daschle here today is --they \ntalked about some of the problems in education and that funding should \nbe increased in programs right across the board. They want the Federal \nGovernment to start hiring local teachers --Federal Government \ndictates: There have to be X number of students in a classroom.\n  We need more money for afterschool programs, more money for the Safe \nSchools Program, more money for elementary and secondary education--\nmore money, more money, more money.\n  Then it says--this is what is really ingenious--more money for \neverything. And, by the way, ``the Senate should stay within the \ndiscretionary spending caps and avoid using the resources of the social \nsecurity program by finding discretionary spending offsets that do not \njeopardize''--great, great.\n  If somebody shows up and tells me how we can increase every program \nin the Federal Government and stay within spending limitations, I will \ngive them a prize.\n  There are those who have a way to do it. It is called more taxes. \nYes, let's increase taxes--somewhere, someday, user fees. Let's find \nmore money to come to Washington.\n  We do not need more money in Washington. The people need to keep \ntheir money back home. The American people are overtaxed. Their taxes \nare too high. They are unfair. They are complicated. When the people \nwere told what we had in our tax cut package, they said: Yes, we \nsupport that.\n\n  But you can't have every nickel you want spent in Washington and have \nfiscal responsibility and have tax relief for working Americans, young \nfamilies, such as my own daughter who just got married in May. She and \nher husband both work because they do not have a lot of money. By the \nway, they are going to pay more in taxes this next year than they did \nthe previous year just because they got married. What a ridiculous set \nof circumstances.\n  We wonder why we have troubles having the traditional family survive. \nOne reason is that you get taxed if you get married, for Heaven's sake.\n  In America, you get taxed if you die. When I get to the end of my \nroad, after my life's work, I want two things, and that is all. I want \nmy name to be decent and clean, and I want my kids to be able to have \nwhatever I have earned. I do not want Uncle Sam showing up saying: Give \nme half of it. Nobody of any income level can defend the death tax. It \nis totally ridiculous.\n  We have a resolution that I believe is better than what was proposed \nby Senator Daschle and Senator Kennedy. So I send this resolution to \nthe desk and ask for it to be printed at this time. I will send it \nforward in a minute.\n  Let me just read this resolution into the Record because I think it \nis a good resolution. I want the American people to know what we think \nabout education.\n\n       Whereas\n       The fiscal year 2000 Budget Resolution [that passed the \n     Congress] increases--\n\n  Hear me now--\n\n     education funding by $28 billion over the next five years, \n     and $82 billion over the next ten years.\n\n  We are not stingy when it comes to education. Our budget resolution \nsays we are going to have more:\n\n       The Department of Education received a net increase of $2.4 \n     billion in FY 2000 which doubles the President's request.\n\n  I do not understand what Senator Kennedy and Senator Daschle are \ntalking about.\n\n       Compared to the President's requested levels, the \n     Democratically controlled Congress' appropriations for 1993-\n     1995 reduced the President's funding requests by $3.0 \n     billion.\n\n  The Democrat Congress reduced the President's request for education \nby $3 billion.\n\n       Since Republicans took control of Congress, federal \n     education funding has increased by 27%.\n\n  Maybe 100 percent would be better, but we are doing the job. We need \na little credit for what we have been doing.\n\n       In the past three years, the Congress has increased funding \n     for Part B of [the IDEA program]--\n\n\n[[Page S11423]]\n\n\n  Where we have made a commitment, fulfilled over a period of years--\n\n     by nearly 80%, while the Administration's fiscal year 2000 \n     budget only requested a .07% increase which is less than an \n     adjustment for inflation.\n\n  Remember what happens. Schools are being told by the Federal \nGovernment: You must comply with IDEA. You must provide the special \neducation. The schools are saying: But if we spend that money and you \ndo not do your share, it means we have to take from somewhere else.\n  The most difficult thing the schools across this country are having \nto deal with is complying with special education requirements and the \nFederal Government not doing its share. That is what our resolution \nfocuses on. We should give schools the flexibility to use this money to \ncomply with IDEA or use it in other areas.\n\n       Congress is not only providing the necessary funds, but is \n     also reforming our current education programs. Congress \n     recognizes that significant reforms are needed in light of \n     the following troubling statistics:\n       40% of fourth graders cannot read at the most basic level.\n       In international comparisons, U.S. twelfth graders scored \n     near the bottom in both math and science.\n       70% of children in high poverty schools score below even \n     the most basic level of reading.\n       In math, 9 year olds in high poverty schools remain two \n     grade levels behind students in low poverty schools.\n       Earlier this year, the 106th Congress took the first step \n     toward improving our nation's schools by passing the \n     Education, Flexibility and Partnership Act . . .\n\n  Really simple: We just allow the schools at the local level to make \nthe decisions where to spend all this Federal money that is going to be \navailable to them. Really simple. It will work. And the teachers and \nthe Governors and the parents say, yes, that makes sense.\n\n       This year's reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act will focus on increasing student achievement by \n     empowering principals, local school boards, teachers, and \n     parents. The focus should be on raising the achievement of \n     all students.\n\n  In other words, we say: We are going to give you the flexibility, but \nwe expect results. You are going to have to show some results.\n  Also:\n\n       Congress should reject a one-size-fits-all approach to \n     education.\n\n  What is good in Boston, MA, just may not be good in Boise, ID, or in \nLaramie, WY, or certainly not good in Pascagoula, MS. We have different \nneeds. We ought to have that flexibility to address the needs we do \nhave.\n\n       Parents are the first and best educators of their children. \n     We have to find ways for the Congress to support proposals \n     which provide parents greater, not less, control and input \n     into the unique educational opportunities we want for our \n     children.\n       Every child should have an exceptional teacher in the \n     classroom.\n\n  We have a program in Mississippi--I am trying to remember who did \nit--but a philanthropist gave every classroom in Mississippi, or at \nleast every school, a computer. I was talking to a local educator \nrecently. He said: That's real nice, but in many of those schools, \nthose computers are still sitting in the boxes in the hallways or in \nthe backs of the rooms because the teachers don't know how to use the \ncomputers, let alone how to teach the use of the computers.\n\n  Technology is great. We have to make sure, though, that the teachers \nhave the ability or at least can be trained or have access to training \nso they can use the modern technology.\n  Our whereas goes on. It just says that Congress will continue its \nefforts to improve the Nation's schools by reauthorizing the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act, guided by the principles I have been \nreferring to above; that is, more flexibility, more control by the \nteachers and the school boards, and more involvement by the parents.\n  We feel very strongly about this. The Democrats say: We will provide \n100,000 teachers, hired by the Federal Government, and we want to start \nrepairing roofs.\n  The quality of the buildings themselves and repairing roofs are a \nlocal issue. The Federal Government should not be doing that. While \nothers will say, well, wait a minute, we need to help these schools and \nthese States in repairing buildings, where does it end? If we proceed \ndown the road where we start paying for building schools at the local \nlevel, we will have to build every school in America. That is where it \nwill end. Sure, it is nice; people like it.\n  Let me tell my colleagues about the States. Every single State in the \nNation has a surplus, more than they are going to spend. You say, well, \nmaybe it is not much. It is almost $34 billion. If you have dilapidated \nschools in your State, I say: State, fix them. The Federal Government, \nUncle Sop, is not going to pay for repairing roofs in Biloxi, MS. Let \nthe people in Biloxi, in the State of Mississippi, do that. I am for \nit. I am for teacher pay raises, but the answer is not in this hallowed \ncity that we stand. The answer is with the American people. I believe \nthat. Give them the flexibility. When Senator Kennedy said, basically, \nwhat we want is for Washington to run the schools, frankly, a bad \nsituation could be worse. The Federal Government would mess it up.\n  So we have an alternative. We will be debating it again on Monday. I \nbelieve our alternative will pass. It should pass. But I am telling you \nright now, I am telling the President of the United States, William \nJefferson Clinton, and I am telling everybody in this Senate, when it \ncomes to education, Trent Lott is not going to yield to anybody, and \nthe Republicans in Congress are not going to be run over by a bunch of \nadditional Federal programs that will waste the money, should not be \nour responsibility, and will not get the job done. We are going to make \nit flexible. We are going to make it local.\n  This is going to be an interesting debate. I can tell you one thing: \nI am going to be at the debate because I am going to be involved in \nthis. I care about it, and I know what will work, and I know what won't \nwork. What we have is not working. We have to do it differently.\n  I beg the pardon of my colleagues for getting fired up and going on a \nlittle long, but I am not going to let those sorts of things be said on \nthe floor of the Senate on education without an adequate response.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The resolution will be received and \nappropriately referred.\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from Georgia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/24/senate-section/article/S11423-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11423-S11424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EDUCATION FUNDING\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, it has been marvelous to listen to the \neloquence of the distinguished Senator on the high-tech environment of \nDuck Hill, MS. It reminds me of my own educational background in \nLithonia, GA, at little Lithonia Elementary School there. I worshiped \nmy second- and third- and fourth-grade, fifth-grade teachers, too. But \nby no means do I want to go back to those days in 1953 and 1954.\n  This is 1999. We are fixing to go into a new millennium and a new \ncentury. I am afraid this country is about to go into this new century, \nwith great opportunity ahead of it, with minimal opportunity for our \ncitizens to take advantage of it.\n  Bill Gates, who has become preeminent as a thinker and an innovator, \nand certainly one who is interested in the cause of education, has put \nit clearly. He said: It is clear that our ability to continue \nbenefiting from technology will largely depend on how well we educate \nthe next generation to take advantage of this new era.\n  I don't think anyone really questions the wisdom of Mr. Gates. The \nchallenge, of course, is to live up to that challenge Mr. Gates has put \nbefore us. He not only talks the talk; he walks the walk. Last week, \nBill Gates pledged to spend $1 billion to provide college scholarships \nto thousands of deserving but financially needy students across the \ncountry. This gift is the largest individual contribution to education \nin history. We can learn something from the leadership our business \nleaders around America are now showing. I think the Senate leadership \ncan learn something.\n  We are only 4 months away from the year 2000. We must not forget the \nfuture of this country is in very small hands. Yet despite all the \nrhetoric, the great speeches, and the fact that three out of four \nAmericans in the latest Washington Post/ABC poll put improving \neducation No. 1 on the national agenda, what we see here in the agenda\n\n[[Page S11424]]\n\nof the Senate is a desire to raid the education pot to pay for other \nprograms higher up on someone else's national agenda.\n\n  How do I say that? If the words of our distinguished majority leader \nare true and the tremendous commitment he has shown on the floor today \nis actually true, then I wonder why the Subcommittee on Labor, Health \nand Human Services, and Education of the Committee on Appropriations of \nthis great Senate has reduced the money for education by 17 percent \nover last year's levels. If all this rhetoric is really true, why are \nwe, in the background, in some subcommittee on appropriations, cutting \n17 percent out of education funding from last year?\n  I agree with the words of Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli, the great \nBritish Prime Minister of the last century, when he said for his \ncountrymen in that century words that ring true for us as we go into a \nnew century. He said: Upon the education of the people of this country, \nthe fate of this country depends.\n  If I had to sum up our challenge as a Nation--and I am on the Armed \nServices Committee, and I know we are challenged in our military \ndefense of this great Nation--I would say to you, without an educated \nworkforce, without an educated defense force, we cannot compete in the \nworld, either economically or in terms of our own defense.\n  The sad part about it is, every day in America almost 2,800 high \nschool students drop out. The United States, once the leader in high \nschool graduation among industrialized nations, now trails 22 nations \nand leads only 1, Mexico. This is not acceptable. This will not get us \nwhere we want to go in the next century. Each school year, more than \n45,000 underprepared teachers, teachers who have not even been trained \nin the subjects they are teaching, enter the classroom. Who here among \nus believes this to be acceptable? I don't. Most fourth graders cannot \nread and understand a simple children's book, and most eighth graders \ncan't use arithmetic to solve a practical problem--that according to a \nrecent survey in Education Week. Who would argue in this body we have \nto do better?\n  Last year, there were 4,000 reports of rape and sexual battery in \nAmerica's public schools. We have had an outbreak of violence in the \nschools. Remember Littleton, Jonesboro, Conyers? School shootings were \nunheard of in this Nation 20 years ago. Who here would not do \neverything in their power to restore safety and sanity to America's \nschools?\n  The truth is, Democrats and Republicans alike have to raise this to \nthe top of our agenda. It is time to put education first and put first \nthings first. We have to be willing to invest in the Nation's future, \nimprove the recruitment and retention of professional teachers.\n  We have to improve our test scores, although that is not, in my \nopinion, the single-most important goal of our public educational \nsystem. The most important goal is to teach kids to think. I remember a \nstory about Bill Gates. Out in Seattle, his mother went out in the \ngarage where Bill was and said, ``Son, what are you doing?'' He said, \n``Mother, I'm thinking.'' That is the goal of our public educational \nsystem.\n  The Public Schools Excellence Act recognizes America's ability to \nattract and retain qualified teachers is key to quality education. S. \n7, of which I am a cosponsor, would provide local school districts with \nthe help and support they need to recruit excellent teacher candidates. \nI agree, the States are the leaders in educational improvement. They \nhave to be. I was a State official, with 4 years in the State senate \nand 12 years as secretary of state. I spent more time as a State \nofficial than I have as a Federal official. But it is obvious, a lot of \nour school systems in our States can't get to where we need them to be \nwithout some Federal help. Who would deny that?\n  We need 100,000 new, trained, qualified teachers in this country. One \nreason is to reduce class size in grades 1 through 3. Every index I \nhave seen of student performance--and part of the key to student \nexcellence and achievement is the reduction of the pupil-teacher ratio, \nparticularly in grades 1 through 3. No matter how you cut it, a teacher \nwith 10 or 15 students in the class, regardless of where those teachers \nand students are--what State, what district, what county--they learn \nmore and do better than a teacher who has 30 or 35 kids in the class.\n  We have another problem: 14 million children in the U.S.A. attend \nschools in need of extensive repair or replacement. I come from a State \nthat is fast-growing, and it is hard to build enough classrooms, \nparticularly in Metropolitan Atlanta. If you look around my State, a \nrecent survey pointed out that in Georgia some 62 percent of our \nclassroom buildings need repair. We have had legislation on the floor \nof the Senate to deal with this. We have not dealt with it.\n  There is another issue. Every day, 5 million children have to care \nfor themselves in the hours before and after school. When I was growing \nup, in my hometown of Lithonia, when I came home--and my mother and \nfather were working--my grandmother was there. I was not a latchkey \nkid. The truth is, in that key time period from 3 o'clock to 8 o'clock \nat night, half of all the violent juvenile crime in this country takes \nplace. This is a key period for our youngsters in America. Why can't we \nhelp out?\n  Today, only a virtual handful of children participate in good \nafterschool care. Let's not cut educational funding from what it was \nlast year by 17 percent. Let's not let this subcommittee, behind our \nbacks, cut the feet out from under us as we make great speeches on the \nfloor of how many of us support education.\n  Let us actually take a lesson from Bill Gates: Let us help our \ncommunities reduce juvenile crime by investing our dollars in \nafterschool care. That is one of the challenges before us and one of \nthe programs that was cut by the subcommittee.\n  Let me say also that I think we ought to take the words of Benjamin \nDisraeli to heart as we enter this debate next week, as it is a truism: \n``An investment in education is an investment in the future of \nAmerica.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nDelaware.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/24/senate-section/article/S11424-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11424-S11426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ADMIRAL KIMMEL AND GENERAL SHORT\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an important--a \nhistorically important--vote taken in the course of our recent \ndeliberations on defense policy. I am speaking of the rollcall vote \nthis Chamber took on May 25 requesting the long-overdue, posthumous \nadvancement of two fine World War II officers, Adm. Husband Kimmel and \nGen. Walter Short. The Senate voted in support of the Kimmel-Short \nresolution, and I wish to take a moment to underscore the historic \nimport of that vote.\n  As you may recall, Admiral Kimmel and General Short were publicly and \nwrongly accused of dereliction of duty and unfairly scapegoated with \nsingular responsibility for the success of the fateful December 1941 \nattack on Pearl Harbor.\n  After the end of World War II, this scapegoating was given a \npainfully unjust and enduring veneer when Admiral Kimmel and General \nShort were not advanced on the retired lists to their highest ranks of \nwar-time command--an honor that was given to every other senior \ncommander who served in war-time positions above his regular grade.\n  After over 50 years, this injustice remains a prominent, painful spur \nin the integrity of our Nation's military honor. After numerous \nofficial investigations totaling well over 30 volumes of thick text \nabsolved these officers of dereliction of duty and highlighted gross \nnegligence and ineptitude on the part of their superiors as predominant \nfactors in the Pearl Harbor disaster, these officers still remain \nunfairly treated.\n  For those of you who are interested, I will shortly send to the desk \nfor placement in the Congressional Record a set of excerpts from these \ninvestigations. This is a short document, but it poignantly highlights \nhow unjust treatment endured by Kimmel and Short just does not \ncorrelate with the official history--the official documented history--\nof the Pearl Harbor disaster.\n\n[[Page S11425]]\n\n  Anyone who looks over these few pages cannot but feel uncomfortable \nwith how our Nation has so unfairly turned its back on these two \nofficers who dedicated their lives to our own freedoms.\n  Mr. President, a great step, indeed an historic step was taken toward \nthe correction of this injustice last May, on May 25 to be exact. This \nChamber, the U.S. Senate, the legislative body our Constitution deems \nresponsible for providing advice and consent in the promotion of \nmilitary officers, voted and passed an amendment to the Senate Defense \nauthorization bill that stated:\n\n       This singular exclusion from advancement of Rear Admiral \n     (retired) Kimmel and Major General (retired) Short from the \n     Navy retired list and the Army retired list, respectively, \n     serves only to perpetuate the myth that the senior commanders \n     in Hawaii were derelict in their duty and responsible for the \n     success of the attack on Pearl Harbor, and is a distinct and \n     unacceptable expression of dishonor toward two of the finest \n     officers who have served in the Armed Forces of the United \n     States.\n\n  This resolution then requested the President to advance the late Rear \nAdm. Husband Kimmel to the grade of admiral on the retired list of the \nNavy and the late Maj. Gen. Walter Short to the grade of lieutenant \ngeneral on the retired list of the Army.\n  Mr. President, the injustice suffered by Admiral Kimmel and General \nShort remains a flaw in the integrity of our Nation's chain of command \nand its unparalleled military honor.\n  In this regard, the Senate's vote on the Kimmel-Short resolution was \nof great historic importance. The Senate has every right to be proud of \nthis vote. This Chamber, which under the Constitution is responsible \nfor promotion of military officers of our Armed Forces, deemed the \ntreatment of Kimmel and Short to be unfair and unjust and inconsistent \nwith our national sense of honor.\n  That vote gave formal and official recognition to this injustice and \nhighlighted it as a pernicious inconsistency in the application of our \nnational understanding of military accountability.\n  It demonstrated that no wrong, no matter how distant in the past will \nbe ignored by this Chamber. it correctly called upon the President to \ncorrect this injustice by advancing these two fine officers on the \nretired lists.\n  It is now up to the President to take this corrective action. I hope \nthat he will not heed the contradictory conclusions of his advisors on \nthis matter. While the Pentagon opposes the advancement of Kimmel and \nShort, they nonetheless recognize that, and I quote their own 1995 \nreport, ``responsibility for the Pearl Harbor disaster should not fall \nsolely on the shoulders of Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant General Short, \nit should be broadly shared.''\n  How they square this conclusion with the reality that today Kimmel \nand Short are the only two officials to suffer from official sanction \nis beyond me.\n  I hope that the President of the United States will use his wisdom to \nlisten beyond this contradictory and unjust advice. I hope that he will \nlook at the official record compiled by over eight official \ninvestigations.\n  I hope that he will listen to the studied voice of the Senate and \ntake the final step necessary to correct this injustice by advancing \nthese two fine officers to their highest grade of World War II command \non the retired lists.\n  Mr. President, the Senate has once again ably demonstrated that it is \nnever too late to correct an injustice. I urge the President of the \nUnited States to do the same and advance Kimmel and Short to their \nhighest grade of command as was done for their peers who served in \nWorld War II.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have an attachment printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Key Excerpts From the Pearl Harbor Investigations\n\n\n                         the dorn report (1995)\n\n       ``Responsibility for the Pearl Harbor disaster should not \n     fall solely on the shoulders of Admiral Kimmel and General \n     Short; it should be broadly shared.''\n       ``It is clear today, as it should have been since 1946 to \n     any serious reader of the JCC (Joint Congressional Committee) \n     hearing record, that Admiral Kimmel and General Short were \n     not solely responsible for the defeat at Pearl Harbor.''\n       ``. . . the evidence of the handling of these \n     (intelligence) messages in Washington reveals some \n     ineptitude, some unwarranted assumptions and misestimates, \n     limited coordination, ambiguous language, and lack of \n     clarification and follow-up at higher levels.''\n       ``The `pilot', `fourteen-point' and `one o'clock' messages \n     point, by the evening of December 6th, to war at dawn \n     (Hawaiian time) on the 7th--not to an attack on Hawaii--but \n     officials in Washington were neither energetic nor effective \n     in getting that warning to the Hawaiian commanders.''\n\n\n      The Army Board for the Correction of Military Records (1991)\n\n       ``The Army Pearl Harbor Board (of 1944), held that General \n     Marshall and the Chief of War Plans Division of the War \n     Department shared in the responsibility for the disaster.''\n       ``The applicant in this case . . . must show . . . that the \n     FSM (in this case Major General Short) was unjustly treated \n     by the Army . . . the majority found evidence of injustice.''\n       ``In this regard, the majority was of the opinion that the \n     FSM, singularly or with the Naval commander, was unjustly \n     held responsible for the Pearl Harbor disaster.''\n       ``Considering the passage of time as well as the burden and \n     stigma carried until his untimely death in 1949, it would be \n     equitable and just to restore the FSM to his former rank of \n     lieutenant general on the retired list.''\n       ``Recommendation.--That all of the Department of the Army \n     records, related to this case be corrected by advancing the \n     individual concerned to the rank of lieutenant general on the \n     retired list.''\n\n\n               the army pearl harbor board inquiry (1944)\n\n       ``The Chief of Staff of the Army, General George C. \n     Marshall, failed in his relations with the Hawaiian \n     Department in the following particulars:\n       (a) To keep the Commanding General of the Hawaiian \n     Department fully advised of the growing tenseness of the \n     Japanese situation which indicated an increasing necessity \n     for better preparation for war, of which information he had \n     an abundance and Short had little.\n       (b) To send additional instructions to the Commanding \n     General of the Hawaiian Department on November 28, 1941, when \n     evidently he failed to realize the import of General Short's \n     reply of November 27th, which indicated clearly that General \n     Short had misunderstood and misconstrued the message of \n     November 27 and had not adequately alerted his command for \n     war.\n       (c) To get to General Short on the evening of December 6th \n     and the early morning of December 7th, the critical \n     information indicating an almost imminent break with Japan, \n     though there was ample time to have accomplished this.''\n       ``Chief of War Plans Division War Department General Staff, \n     Major General Leonard T.

PAUL, UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to pay a special tribute today \nto Brigadier General Terry L. Paul, the Legislative Assistant to the \nCommandant of the Marine Corps and trusted friend of the United States \nSenate. After almost thirty years of honorable and dedicated service in \nthe Corps, Brigadier General Paul will retire from active duty October \n1st, 1999.\n  The Members of Congress and their staffs have come to know General \nPaul as a person who possesses a deep and abiding passion for the \ninstitution which he has served so faithfully--the United States Marine \nCorps. It is difficult to comprehend a Corps absent the ranks of a \nTerry Paul. His absence will be especially felt in the Office of \nLegislative Affairs where he served nine years in the Senate Liaison \nand most recently as the Legislative Assistant to the Commandant. He \nhas set the standard by which all other Legislative Assistants will be \nmeasured.\n  The strength of the Marine Corps relationship with the Congress is in \nlarge measure due to the professional dedication of Brigadier General \nPaul. This relationship has been forged and nurtured over the years by \nhis unrelenting resolve to establish a climate of mutual respect and \nunderstanding. The underpinning for this success was a rapport that was \nbuilt on a credible and straightforward approach for dealing with \nissues, large or small. He possessed an innate ability to appreciate \nthe environment in which he worked. It is through this understanding we \ncan fully treasure the tenacity of Terry Paul to communicate the \nCommandant's message of ``making Marines and winning battles'' on \nCapitol Hill.\n  Brigadier General Paul's imprint will resonate through these hallowed \nhalls and unto our Nation long after his departure. Through the \nforesight and oversight of the United States Congress, the Corps will \nhave been provided the needed resources that will enable it to confront \nthe challenges of the 21st century. Terry Paul was always there to \nfoster and develop our knowledge of key resource needs. When all seemed \nlost with the pending cancellation of the V-22 program it was Brigadier \nGeneral Paul that was assigned as ``point-man'' on the Hill--\nresponsible for building support to resurrect, not merely a dying \nprogram, but to advocate a concept which would ultimately revolutionize \nwarfare in the next century. General Paul ensured Congress was aptly \ninformed as to the capabilities, technological advances, concept of \noperations, and funding requirements to bring this program to fruition. \nHis vigilance and ability to communicate carried the day. The V-22 \nOsprey will enable commanders to accomplish the mission more \nefficiently, with far fewer casualties than otherwise would have been \nthe case. Terry fought the hard fight and he should be extremely proud \nthat his unrelenting efforts have borne the fruit of his labor.\n  General Paul carried the message to the Hill on a plethora of \nprograms. Programs that represented innovation, ingenuity, and a \nwillingness to adapt to changes on the emerging battlefields which will \nelevate the Marine Corps as the world's premier crisis response force \nin the 21st century. Programs such as the Advanced Assault Amphibious \nVehicle, the KC-130J, Maritime Pre-positioned Force-Enhancement and LHD \nclass ships.\n  General Paul is a leader of unquestionable loyalty and unswerving \nstandards. His tenure as the Commandant's Legislative Assistant was the \ncapstone performance of nearly thirty-year career in the infantry, \nSenate Liaison office, and as a Special Assistant to the Commandant. \nFor his efforts the Marine Corps is a better institution today, one \nthat has a bright and prosperous future. Terry, we the Members of the \nUnited States Senate and the 106th Congress want to convey our sincere \nappreciation for all you have done for our Nation. Your legacy will be \nthe well-equipped Marines who will continue to provide for our \ncountry's defense. They will be better equipped, more capable, and \nbetter able to survive on the modern battlefield due to your dedication \nand selfless sacrifice to duty. You will be sorely missed, but surely \nnot forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/24/senate-section/article/S11426-2", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11426-S11428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n STOP PLAYING POLITICS WITH OUR NATIONAL SECURITY: RATIFY THE TEST-BAN \n                                 TREATY\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, three years ago today, the United States \nled the world in signing the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty. \nSince then, 152 countries have followed our lead; and 45 of them, \nincluding Great Britain and France, have ratified the Treaty.\n  Two years and two days ago, the President of the United States \nsubmitted the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty, plus six \nsafeguards, to the Senate for its advice and consent to ratification. \nSince then, the Senate has done nothing.\n  That is an outrage. We--who are rightly called the world's greatest \ndeliberative body--have been unwilling or unable to perform our \nconstitutional duty regarding this major treaty.\n  Some of my colleagues have principled objections to this treaty. I \nrespect their convictions. I have responded on this floor to many of \ntheir objections, as have my colleagues from Pennsylvania, North and \nSouth Dakota, Michigan and New Mexico.\n  Now it is time, however, for the Senate to do its duty. \nAdministration officials, current and former Chairmen of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, and eminent scientists are prepared to testify in \nfavor of the Test-Ban Treaty. We, in turn, are prepared to make our \ncase in formal Senate debate on a resolution of ratification.\n  It is high time that the Republican leadership of this body agreed to \nschedule Senate debate and a vote on ratification. It is utterly \nirresponsible for the Republican leadership to hold this treaty hostage \nto other issues, as it has for two years.\n  The arguments in favor of ratifying the Test-Ban Treaty are well-\nknown.\n  It will reinforce nuclear non-proliferation by reassuring non-nuclear \nweapons states that states with nuclear weapons will be unable to \ndevelop and confidently deploy new types of nuclear weapons.\n  It will keep non-nuclear weapon states from deploying sophisticated \nnuclear weapons, even if they are able to develop designs for such \nweapons.\n  It will improve our ability to detect any nuclear weapons tests, with \nother countries paying 75% of the bill for the International Monitoring \nSystem.\n  U.S. ratification will encourage India and Pakistan to sign and \nratify the Test-Ban Treaty--one of the few steps back from the nuclear \nbrink that they may be willing to take, without a settlement of the \nKashmir dispute.\n  U.S. ratification will encourage Russia, China and other states to \nratify.\n  Our ratification will maintain U.S. leadership on non-proliferation, \nas we approach the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference \nnext April. That U.S. leadership is vital to keeping non-nuclear \nweapons states committed to nuclear non-proliferation.\n  Equally important are the safeguards that the President has proposed, \nto ensure that U.S. adherence to the Treaty will always be consonant \nwith our national security:\n\n       A: The conduct of a Science Based Stockpile Stewardship \n     program to ensure a high level of confidence in the safety \n     and reliability of nuclear weapons in the active stockpile. . \n     . .\n       B: The maintenance of modern nuclear laboratory facilities \n     and programs . . . which will attract, retain, and ensure the \n     continued application of our human scientific resources to \n     those programs. . . .\n       C: The maintenance of the basic capability to resume \n     nuclear test activities. . . .\n       D: Continuation of a comprehensive research and development \n     program to improve our . . . monitoring capabilities. . . .\n       E: The continuing development of a broad range of \n     intelligence . . . capabilities and operations to ensure \n     accurate and comprehensive information on worldwide nuclear . \n     . . programs.\n\n[[Page S11427]]\n\n       F: . . . if the President of the United States is informed \n     by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Energy (DOE) \n     . . . that a high level of confidence in . . . a nuclear \n     weapon type which the two Secretaries consider to be critical \n     to our nuclear deterrent could no longer be certified, the \n     President, in consultation with Congress, would be prepared \n     to withdraw from the CTBT . . . in order to conduct whatever \n     testing might be required.\n\n  Thus, if nuclear weapons testing should ever be required to maintain \nthe U.S. nuclear deterrent, then we will test.\n  Thanks in part to these safeguards, our senior national security \nofficials support ratification of the Test-Ban Treaty. These officials \ninclude not only cabinet members such as former Senator Cohen, but also \nthe directors of our National Laboratories and the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff.\n  Ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty is vital to \nour national security. If the Senate dallies, India and Pakistan could \nfail to cap their nuclear weapons race; China could resume testing, to \nmake better use of stolen U.S. nuclear secrets; and non-nuclear weapons \nstates could give up on non-proliferation.\n  In the coming days, therefore, several of us will bring up in a more \nformal form the need for Senate action on this Treaty. I urge all my \ncolleagues to support that effort.\n  Whatever our views on the Test-Ban Treaty, it is a national security \nissue. Let us agree that it is not to be held hostage to other issues. \nLet us agree that it is not just one more football in the Washington \ngame of ``politics as usual.''\n  If the Republican leadership does not handle this Treaty responsibly, \nI have no doubt how the issue will play out in next year's elections. \nThe latest national poll shows overwhelming public support for the \nTest-Ban Treaty: 82 percent in favor and only 14 percent opposed.\n  Those results go beyond party lines. Fully 80 percent of \nRepublicans--and even 79 percent of conservative Republicans--say that \nthey support the Test-Ban Treaty.\n  Republicans may appeal to the far right by calling for a return to \nthe Cold War of nuclear testing. Bob Dole did that in 1996 on the \nChemical Weapons Convention; but he lost. Then he took the responsible \nstand.\n  This time, let's skip the politics. Let's do our job--with hearings, \ndebate, and a timely vote, at least before next April's Non-\nProliferation Treaty review conference.\n  We can address the Test-Ban Treaty responsibly. It isn't hard, and \nthe American people know that. It's time the Senate did what Nike says: \n``Just do it.''\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, it has been a moving and gratifying \nexperience to witness the outpouring of genuine, spontaneous concern by \ncountless Americans for the victims of the Hurricane Floyd flooding.\n  It goes without saying that I am deeply grateful for the countless \npublic servants and concerned neighbors who have been and still are \nworking around the clock to extend heroic efforts and helping hands to \nthe thousands of Eastern North Carolina people who have lost everything \nthey possess--except their courage, and their determination to rise \nabove the hardship that befell them.\n  Mr. President, before I go further I am compelled to convey publicly \nmy personal gratitude to FEMA Director James Lee Witt and his \nremarkable associates for their dedication to helping those in such \ndire need. No federal agency could possibly be more efficient in \ncarrying out its mission, and Director Witt deserves enormous credit \nfor the incredible responsiveness FEMA has demonstrated on so many \noccasions when disasters have befallen many other areas of America.\n  Also, I am deeply grateful to my colleagues, who have responded to \nthis disaster not merely with kind condolences and genuine sympathy, \nbut also with their actions. For example, the senior Senator from \nMissouri, Senator Bond, made every effort to assure that FEMA is \nadequately funded to do the job in North Carolina. The Senate \nLeadership on both sides of the aisle--particularly Senator Lott--have \nbeen gracious in their offers of assistance.\n  Many in the administrative branch are also going out of the way to be \nhelpful. Yesterday, Customs Service Administrator Raymond Kelly granted \nmy request to administratively waive certain maritime regulations, \nthereby allowing grain and feed shipments to reach flood-ravaged \nfarmers more quickly. I am genuinely appreciative of his swift action.\n  And Mr. President, let there be no mistake: Eastern North Carolina \nneeds all the help it can get. I do not exaggerate when I say that the \nflooding is of near-Biblical proportions. At least 45 people have lost \ntheir lives; there are fears of finding even more bodies as the flood \nwaters recede. Entire communities have been washed away. Standing flood \nwaters are becoming more polluted each day by gasoline, chemicals, \nanimal waste and drowned livestock. An estimated 1,000 roads have been \nflooded, and countless houses have been damaged, some beyond repair. \nPerhaps the most poignant stories are those of cemeteries washing away, \nwith coffins rising to the surface.\n  It is a devastating regional problem, Mr. President, but more than \nthat, it is truly a national problem affecting every state in the \nUnion. Because the communities affected by this flooding--whether they \nbe Wilson or Greenville, Rocky Mount or Goldsboro, Kinston or Tarboro--\nare communities that are essential to American agriculture.\n  The heart of the agriculture community in North Carolina has been \nvirtually destroyed by this storm, Mr. President. And as concerned as \nwe are for the countless citizens who have lost their homes and their \npossessions, the agricultural implications of this disaster for our \nentire country are enormous.\n  Here's why: North Carolina ranks third in total agricultural income, \nbehind only California and Iowa. Numerous commodities will be radically \naffected by the flooding because North Carolina ranks in the top ten \nstates of production for such a wide variety of products: turkeys, \nsweet potatoes, hogs, cucumbers for pickles, peanuts, poultry and egg \nproducts, chickens, blueberries, peanuts, strawberries, cotton, \ncatfish, pecans, watermelons, peaches, tomatoes.\n  In short, Mr. President, North Carolina agricultural production is \ninseparable from U.S. agricultural production, and this regional \ndisaster is in fact a national disaster. And I highlight this not to \ninsist upon a government response--though one is needed--but to \nunderscore the inescapable fact that the private sector must play a key \nrole in helping Eastern North Carolina recover from this disaster.\n  The federal government can do its share to meet the needs of those \nwho have been affected by the flood--and I will work to make sure the \nfederal government plays a substantial role in assisting in the \nrecovery. (In fact, those who are being helped by FEMA know that the \nfederal government is already doing its part to lend a helping hand.) \nBut government cannot do it all, Mr. President. The private sector must \nplay an enormous role in rebuilding the communities and economy of my \nhome state. And this will be an historic test of the strength and \npurpose of the free enterprise system--and of all of us who believe \nthat the strength of America is the willingness to stand up for each \nother in times of hardship.\n  North Carolinians understand this fact instinctively, Mr. President. \nAlready, private citizens and businesses from all over the state are \nvolunteering their time and money to help their neighbors. May I offer \na few examples:\n  Carolina Power & Light, a wonderfully civic-minded electrical \ncompany, has promised to match citizens' donations to the Red Cross up \nto $100,000 and is double-matching its employee's contributions. \nCapitol Broadcasting in Raleigh has donated $100,000.\n  From the financial industry, Bank of America has donated $150,000. \nFirst Union is contributing the same generous amount to the Red Cross \nand is also pitching in with in-kind contributions of ice and water. \nFirst Citizens Bank has donated $100,000 and has already developed a \nshort-term emergency loan program.\n  The tobacco industry, which is so important to Eastern North \nCarolina--and which, incidentally, is now facing another spiteful \nattack by the Justice Department-- has been especially generous. RJ \nReynolds has donated $250,000; Philip Morris has donated\n\n[[Page S11428]]\n\n$50,000 in addition to the food products they are donating through \nKraft. US Tobacco has given an additional $25,000.\n  And, of course, I have been in contact almost daily with Franklin \nGraham, son of the remarkable Billy Graham, who operates a truly \nwonderful organization called Samaritan's Purse, which distributes \nfood, clothing and medical supplies to people who are suffering all \nover the world. Franklin and his associates have once again \ndemonstrated their usual selflessness by sending truckloads of potable \nwater and other needed supplies to the areas in greatest need.\n  All of this generosity does not include the generous contributions of \nindividual North Carolinians that are pouring in, Mr. President. Our \nfine Governor, Jim Hunt, has set up a Disaster Relief Fund for \ncontributions to the United Way, and the contributions are coming in so \nfast that they have yet to be counted. I am continually amazed and \nhighly gratified by the thoughtfulness of North Carolinians who \ngenuinely want to help those in distress.\n  Mr. President, neither government nor the private sector alone can \nhelp rebuild the communities of North Carolina. If ever there was a \ntime In North Carolina's history when all of our institutions--public \nand private--must work together, that time is now. And I pledge to do \nmy part to make sure that individuals, businesses and government are \nworking together to help North Carolina recover from the worst disaster \nin its history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/24/senate-section/article/S11428-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               PRESIDENT'S VETO OF THE REPUBLICAN TAX CUT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to say a few words about President \nClinton's veto of the Republican-sponsored $792 billion tax cut. I \ncommend the President for vetoing this bill because it would have taken \nus down the wrong path:\n  The path to huge budget deficits;\n  The path to higher interest rates; and\n  The path that fails to protect Medicare and Social Security;\n  In vetoing this bill, the President has taken us down the fiscally \nresponsible path toward:\n  Paying down the $5.7 trillion national debt;\n  Lowering interest rates and continuing our economic growth; and\n  Protecting Medicare and Social Security in anticipation of the baby \nboom generation.\n  Republicans claim the projected surplus over the next ten years is \nlarge enough to give taxpayers a $792 billion tax cut and still make \n$500 billion worth of investments in domestic priorities.\n  They claim that there is an estimated $1.4 trillion worth of surplus \nfunds available for tax breaks and whatever else needs attention.\n  But their surplus projection is based on a fantastic, unrealistic, \nand unwise assumption about domestic discretionary spending: It is \nbased on the assumption that Congress will enact drastic cuts in \ndomestic services over the next ten years .\n  The New Republican Baseline is the amount of Total Discretionary \nSpending over the next ten years as figured by the Congressional Budget \nOffice at the request of Senator Domenici. It is the level of spending \nthat Senator Domenici said on the Senate floor on July 29, 1999 would \nallow for the Republican tax cut and $505 billion to be added back. It \nwas also posted on the Budget Committee Website.\n  This proposal assumes that Congress will cut discretionary spending \nin accord with the budget caps through 2002 and then freeze \ndiscretionary spending at 2002 levels for the years 2003 through 2009.\n  In other words, while the price of a home, car, food goes up; while \nthe cost of health care and tuition go up, the level of domestic \nservices such as Head Start, student loans and economic development \ngrants remains frozen in nominal dollars.\n  A freeze in nominal dollars means a decrease in real dollars. So the \nRepublicans are proposing real, severe cuts in domestic services in \norder to make their tax cut seem feasible.\n  Huge cuts--tens of billions of dollars below current 1999 levels--are \ntotally unrealistic (and a bad idea).\n  This chart shows that the Republican proposed reductions in domestic \nservices defy history.\n  This chart shows the trend in domestic discretionary services over \nthe last 15 years (in terms of actual outlays) in real 1999 dollars.\n  The trend--(regardless of whether Democrats or Republicans controlled \nCongress) is upward--and sharply upward over the last ten years--during \na period of serious efforts to reign in spending.\n  Looking forward, the trend (on which the Republican tax cut and \nproposed investments in domestic priorities are based) is sharply \ndownward with domestic services slashed by over a third by the year \n2009.\n  A reversal in domestic discretionary services of this size just won't \nhappen--and it shouldn't happen--we shouldn't slash head start, and \nPell grants, and community development block grants, and safe drinking \nwater programs by tens of billions of dollars over the next ten years. \nAnd history tells us we won't.\n  The current budget process tells us we won't: Newspaper editorials \nacross the country are chiding Congress for already having spent next \nyear's surplus.\n  I support the President's veto because it recognizes our collective \nresponsibility to get America's fiscal house in order and because the \nRepublican tax cut plan and the assumptions that underlie it are \nunwise, unrealistic and would have squandered this historic \nopportunity.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the chart to which I \nreferred.\n  There being no objection, the chart was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord as follows:\n\nDOMESTIC DISCRETIONARY SPENDING: PROPOSED REPUBLICAN PLAN COMPARED TO 15\n                    YEAR HISTORY IN CONSTANT DOLLARS\n              [Outlays in billions, constant 1999 dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                             Year                               Dollars\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1984.........................................................        227\n1989.........................................................        235\n1994.........................................................        282\n1999.........................................................        307\n2004.........................................................        226\n2009.........................................................        195\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: CBO.

Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Massachusetts \nfor offering this amendment. I am a cosponsor of the amendment. The \nMontreal Protocol has always enjoyed broad bipartisan support in the \nCongress and public support across the country.\n  As our colleagues will remember, it was President Reagan who \nnegotiated and signed the Protocol in 1987. Since that time, many \nstrengthening amendments have been adopted and ratified during the \nadministrations of both President Bush and President Clinton.\n  One of the most effective provisions of the protocol is an \ninternational fund that provides assistance to developing nations to \naid their phaseout of ozone depleting substances. This is not a U.S. \naid program. It is an international fund supported by 35 countries. It \nhas assisted projects to reduce ozone use in 120 developing countries.\n  Mr. President, I can tell the Senate that the Montreal Protocol Fund \nis a very cost effective program because the U.S. General Accounting \nOffice audited the program in 1997 and gave it high praise. GAO had \nonly one recommendation to make to improve its performance and that \nrecommendation has since been implemented. I would note that the U.S. \nbusiness community also strongly supports this program. Quite often the \nassistance provided by the fund is used by developing nations to buy \nour technology to reduce CFC use. So, there is no question that this \nprogram works and has been highly successful.\n  The only issue is whether there is room for the U.S. contribution in \nthis budget. We have pledged approximately $39 million for this coming \nyear. There is $27 million in the Foreign Operations appropriation. \nWhich means that we need an additional $12 million to honor our \ncommitment. The amendment by the Senator from Massachusetts would \nprovide that $12 million from EPA's budget. This follows a long \ntradition of paying for part of our contribution from State Department \nfunds and part of our contribution through the EPA budget.\n  Can EPA afford $12 million for this purpose. We know that the budget \nis\n\n[[Page S11429]]\n\ntight this year. But it is not so tight that we need to entirely \neliminate this expenditure. In fact, I would note that this bill \nprovides EPA $116 million more than the President requested. As the \nSenator from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, has said many times here on \nthe floor, this bill is still a work in progress. I am confident that \nthe very able managers of the bill can find room for the Montreal \nProtocol Fund in a budget for EPA that provides $116 million more than \nthe President's request for the coming year.\n  We have our differences here in the Senate over environmental policy. \nBut everyone has to admit that the international program to protect the \nstratospheric ozone layer negotiated by President Reagan has been a \ntremendous success.

To recognize National Medal of Honor sites in California, \nIndiana, and South Carolina; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n legislation to recognize national medal of honor sites in california, \n                      indiana, and south carolina\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwould designate the Medal of Honor memorials at the national cemetery \nat Riverside, California, the White River State Park at Indianapolis, \nIndiana, and the museum at Patriots Point in Mount Pleasant, South \nCarolina, as National Medal of Honor sites. I am joined in this effort \nby Senators Crapo, Cochran, and Bingaman. This legislation is a \ncompanion bill to H.R. 1663, sponsored by Representative Ken Calvert \nand cosponsored by 77 Members of the House of Representatives.\n  Mr. President, this is not a frivolous piece of legislation that I am \nintroducing today. The Medal of Honor is this nation's highest honor. \nThe 3,417 Americans who have received the Medal of Honor, from the \nCivil War through the terrible battle in the dusty streets of \nMogadishu, each demonstrated uncommon courage in the service of their \ncountry, many at the cost of their lives. In testimony in support of \nthe House bill before the Veterans Subcommittee on Benefits, Paul \nBucha, president of the Congressional Medal of Honor Society, stated \nthat the Society ``believes that these projects will bring full \nrecognition to recipients and is hopeful that this will complete the \nsystem of memorials that recognize Medal of Honor recipients.'' Passage \nof the bill Senators Crapo, Cochran, Bingaman and I are introducing \ntoday will help to ensure this recognition in a timely manner.\n  Designation of the three sites as ``National'' memorials will give \nthem the status they deserve, while bringing them appropriately under \nthe department of Interior. There is no cost associated with this \nlegislation. I hope that my colleagues in the Senate will support \npassage of this legislation, and thank the President for this \nopportunity to address the Senate on behalf of this worthy legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S11431]]\n\n                                S. 1633\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Medal of Honor \n     Memorial Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President. I am honored today to introduce the \nResidential Solar Energy Tax Credit Act of 1999 which provides a 15 \npercent residential tax credit for consumers who purchase solar \nelectric (photovoltaics) and solar thermal products.\n  This bill is an important step in preserving U.S. global leadership \nin the solar industry where we now export over 70 percent of our \nproducts. In the last five years, over ten U.S. solar manufacturing \nfacilities have been built or expanded making the U.S. the world's \nlargest manufacturer of solar products. The expansion of the U.S. \ndomestic market is essential to sustain U.S. global market dominance.\n  Other countries, notably Japan and Germany, have instituted very \nlarge-scale market incentives for the use of solar energy on \nbuildings--spending far more by their governments to build their \nrespective domestic solar industries. Passage of this bill will insure \nthe U.S. stays the global solar market leader into the next millennium.\n  The recent tax bill passed by this body included necessary support of \nthe independent domestic oil producers, overseas oil refiners, nuclear \nindustry decommissioning, and wind energy--all worthy. This small \nproposal not only adds to these but provides an incentive to the \nindividual homeowner to generate their own energy. In fact, 28 states \nhave passed laws in the last two years to provide a technical standard \nfor interconnecting solar systems to the electric grid, provide \nconsumer friendly contracts, and provide rates for the excess power \ngenerated. These efforts at regulatory reform at the state level \ncombined with a limited incentive as proposed in this bill, will drive \nthe use of solar energy.\n  Contrary to popular belief, solar energy is manufactured and used \nevenly throughout the United States. Solar manufacturers are in \nArizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, \nMaryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, \nNorth Carolina, Ohio, Texas, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin. In \naddition, solar assembly and distribution companies are in: Alaska, \nConnecticut, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Maine, Minnesota, \nMissouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode \nIsland, Tennessee, Vermont, as well as Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands \nand Guam. In addition to these states, solar component and research \ncompanies are in Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Nebraska, \nNorth Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and West Virginia.\n  More than 90 U.S. electric utilities, including municipals, \ncooperatives and independents--which represent more than half of U.S. \npower generation--are active in solar energy. Aside from new, automated \nsolar manufacturing facilities, a wide range of new uses of solar \noccurred in 1999, such as:\n\n  an array of facilities installed in June at the Pentagon power block \nto provide mid-day peak power;\n  installation of solar on the first U.S. skyscraper in Times Square in \nNew York City; and\n  development of a solar mini-manufacturing facility at a brown field \nin Chicago which will provide solar products for roadway lighting and \nfor area schools\n  This small sampling of American ingenuity is just the beginning of \nthe U.S. solar industry's maturity. Adoption of solar power by \nindividual American consumers will create economies-of-scale of \nproduction that will, over time, dramatically lower costs and increase \navailability of solar power.\n  The bill I have introduced costs much less than the Administration's \nproposal and provides consumer safeguards. This bill represents a \npragmatic approach in utilizing the marketplace as a driver of \ntechnology. The benefits to our country are profound. The U.S. solar \nindustry believes the incentives will create 20,000 new high technology \nmanufacturing jobs, offset pollution of more than 2 million vehicles, \ncut U.S. solar energy unit imports which are already over 50 percent, \nand leverage U.S. industry even further into the global export markets.\n  The Residential Solar Energy Tax Credit Act of 1999 is sound energy \npolicy, sound environmental policy, promotes our national security, and \nenhances our economic strength at home and abroad. I ask my colleagues \nto include this initiative in upcoming tax deliberations. American \nconsumers will thank us, and our children will thank us for the future \nbenefits we have preserved for them.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAMS:\n  S. 1635. A bill to amend the Agricultural Market Transition Act to \nextend the term of marketing assistance loans; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                agricultural marketing assistance loans\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce \nlegislation extending the term of the CCC marketing assistance loans \nmade to producers by Farm Service Agencies from nine months to thirty-\nsix months. Moreover, my bill grants the Secretary of Agriculture \ndiscretion to extend the term of a marketing assistance loan for an \nadditional nine month period if the Secretary determines the extension \nbeyond the thirty-six months would be beneficial to producers.\n  This nonrecourse marketing assistance loan program gives farmers more \nbargaining power in the market because they are not forced to sell \ntheir crops immediately after the harvest. Without the loan program, \nbuyers' knowledge that farmers have their backs against the wall \nneeding money to repay their bills can force down prices. Prices at \nharvest also tend to be lower due to the ample volume of grains. These \nnonrecourse loans permit a farmer to store the grain for a period of \ntime, allowing him the opportunity to sell his crop later when the \nmarket price might be higher than the harvest price.\n  The problem with the current system is that buyers know when the nine \nmonth loans are coming due, which adversely impacts the marketing \nposition of producers. Buyers know that the financial pressure on \nproducers is building and they will be forced to take a lower price. \nExtending the term of the loans from nine to thirty six months will \ngive the farmers better marketing power because it introduces more \nuncertainty and therefore options to farmers on when the grain will be \nsold.\n  I should note that I do not expect farmers to exhaust the full \nthirty-six months to market their grain, or that the Secretary would \nroutinely extend that term to 45 months, due to the decline in grain \nquality that would consequently occur. However, I wanted to ensure that \nfarmers possess as much flexibility as possible in deciding when to \nmarket their product.\n\n[[Page S11432]]\n\n  Again, with this bill, I hope to provide farmers with another \nmarketing tool to help them get the best price possible on the market. \nOur farm families are hurting, and we must help. In addition to \nintroducing this bill, I want to again call upon Agriculture \nAppropriations conferees to complete their work without adding new \nissues. Relief to farmers must be passed as soon as possible.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to working with my colleagues on the \nAgriculture Committee to pass my bill in the near future.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 1636.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) It is in the mutual interest of the United States and \n     the countries of sub-Saharan Africa to promote broad-based \n     economic development and equitable trade and investment \n     policies in sub-Saharan Africa.\n       (2) Many sub-Saharan African countries have made notable \n     progress toward democratization in recent years.\n       (3) Despite the enormous political and economic potential \n     in Africa, Africa has the largest number of the poorest \n     countries in the world, with an average per capita income of \n     less than $500 annually. Thirty-three of the 41 highly \n     indebted poor countries (HIPC) are located in sub-Saharan \n     Africa.\n       (4) A plan for sustainable, equitable development for, and \n     trade with, Africa must recognize the different levels of \n     development that exist between countries and among different \n     sectors within each country.\n       (5) Sub-Saharan Africa is inordinately burdened by \n     $230,000,000,000 in bilateral and multilateral debt whose \n     service requirements--\n       (A) now take over 20 percent of the export earnings of the \n     sub-Saharan African region, excluding South Africa; and\n       (B) constitute a serious impediment to the development of \n     stable democratic political structures, broad-based economic \n     growth, poverty eradication, and food security.\n       (6) The United Nations Declaration of Human Rights \n     guarantees the right to food, shelter, health care, \n     education, and a sustainable livelihood, as well as rights to \n     political freedoms.\n       (7)(A) The key principles guiding any United States \n     economic policy toward sub-Saharan Africa should include \n     those repeatedly identified by African governments, including \n     the priorities laid out in the ``Lagos Plan'' developed by \n     the finance ministers of the sub-Saharan African countries in \n     coordination with the Organization for African Unity.\n       (B) The overriding priority expressed in the ``Lagos Plan'' \n     is freedom for each African country to self-determine the \n     economic policies that--\n       (i) suit the needs and development of their people;\n       (ii) help achieve food self-sufficiency and security; and\n       (iii) provide broad access to potable water, shelter, \n     primary health care, education, and affordable transport.\n       (8) Fair trade and mutually beneficial investment can be \n     important tools for broad-based economic development.\n\n     SEC. 4. DECLARATIONS OF POLICY.\n\n       Congress makes the following declarations:\n       (1) Economic relations between sub-Saharan Africa and the \n     United States must be oriented toward benefiting the majority \n     of the people of sub-Saharan Africa and of the United States.\n       (2) Congress endorses the goals stated in the Lagos Plan \n     developed by sub-Saharan African Finance Ministers in \n     cooperation with the Organization for African Unity.\n       (3) In developing new economic relations with sub-Saharan \n     Africa, the United States should pursue the following:\n       (A) Strengthening and diversifying the economic production \n     capacity of sub-Saharan Africa.\n       (B) Improving the level of people's incomes and the pattern \n     of distribution in sub-Saharan Africa.\n       (C) Adjusting the pattern of public expenditures to satisfy \n     people's essential needs in sub-Saharan Africa.\n       (D) Providing institutional support for transition to \n     functioning market economies in sub-Saharan Africa through \n     debt relief.\n       (E) Supporting environmentally sustainable development in \n     sub-Saharan Africa.\n       (F) Promoting democracy, human rights, and the strength of \n     civil society in sub-Saharan Africa.\n       (G) Assisting sub-Saharan African countries in efforts to \n     make safe and efficacious pharmaceuticals and medical \n     technologies as widely available to their populations as \n     possible.\n\n     SEC. 5. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) for the majority of people in sub-Saharan Africa to be \n     able to benefit from new trade, investment, and other \n     economic opportunities provided by this Act, and the \n     amendments made by this Act, the pre-existing burden of \n     external debt of sub-Saharan African countries must be \n     eliminated; and\n       (2) only significant debt relief will allow operation of \n     local credit markets and eliminate distortions currently \n     hindering development in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n     SEC. 6. SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA DEFINED.\n\n       In this Act, the terms ``sub-Saharan Africa'', ``sub-\n     Saharan African country'', ``country in sub-Saharan Africa'', \n     ``sub-Saharan African countries'', and ``countries in sub-\n     Saharan Africa'' refer to the following:\n       Republic of Angola (Angola)\n       Republic of Benin (Benin)\n       Republic of Botswana (Botswana)\n       Burkina Faso (Burkina)\n       Republic of Burundi (Burundi)\n       Republic of Cameroon (Cameroon)\n       Republic of Cape Verde (Cape Verde)\n       Central African Republic\n       Republic of Chad (Chad)\n       Federal Islamic Republic of the Comorors (Comoros)\n       Democratic Republic of Congo (DROC)\n       Republic of the Congo (Congo)\n       Republic of Cote d'Ivoire (Cote d'Ivoire)\n       Republic of Djibouti (Djibouti)\n       Republic of Equatorial Guinea (Equatorial Guinea)\n       Ethiopia\n       State of Eritrea (Eritrea)\n       Gabonese Republic (Gabon)\n       Republic of the Gambia (Gambia)\n       Republic of Ghana (Ghana)\n       Republic of Guinea (Guinea)\n       Republic of Guinea-Bissau (Guinea-Bissau)\n\n[[Page S11433]]\n\n       Republic of Kenya (Kenya)\n       Kingdom of Lesotho (Lesotho)\n       Republic of Liberia (Liberia)\n       Republic of Madagascar (Madagascar)\n       Republic of Malawi (Malawi)\n       Republic of Mali (Mali)\n       Islamic Republic of Mauritania (Mauritania)\n       Republic of Mauritius (Mauritius)\n       Republic of Mozambique (Mozambique)\n       Republic of Namibia (Namibia)\n       Republic of Niger (Niger)\n       Federal Republic of Nigeria (Nigeria)\n       Republic of Rwanda (Rwanda)\n       Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe (Sao Tome and \n     Principe)\n       Republic of Senegal (Senegal)\n       Repulbic of Seychelles (Seychelles)\n       Republic of Sierra Leone (Sierra Leone)\n       Somalia\n       Republic of South Africa (South Africa)\n       Republic of Sudan (Sudan)\n       Kingdom of Swaziland (Swaziland)\n       United Republic of Tanzania (Tanzania)\n       Republic of Togo (Togo)\n       Republic of Uganda (Uganda)\n       Republic of Zambia (Zambia)\n       Republic of Zimbabwe (Zimbabwe)\n\n  TITLE I--CANCELLATION OF DEBT OWED BY SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN COUNTRIES\n\n     SEC. 101.

ENCOURAGING MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL TRADE AND \n                   INVESTMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) A mutually beneficial United States Sub-Saharan Africa \n     trade policy will grant new access to the United States \n     market for a broad range of goods produced in Africa, by \n     Africans, and include safeguards to ensure that the \n     corporations manufacturing these goods (or the product or \n     manufacture of the oil or mineral extraction industry) \n     respect the rights of their employees and the local \n     environment. Such trade opportunities will promote equitable \n     economic development and thus increase demand in African \n     countries for United States goods and service exports.\n       (2) Recognizing that the global system of textile and \n     apparel quotas under the MultiFiber Arrangement will be \n     phased out under the Uruguay Round Agreements over the next 5 \n     years with the total termination of the quota system in 2005, \n     the grant of additional access to the United States market in \n     these sectors is a short-lived benefit.\n       (b) Treatment of Quotas.--\n       (1) Kenya and mauritius.--Pursuant to the Agreement on \n     Textiles and Clothing, the United States shall eliminate the \n     existing quotas on textile and apparel imports to the United \n     States from Kenya and Mauritius, respectively, not later than \n     30 days after each country demonstrates the following:\n       (A) The country is not ineligible for benefits under \n     section 502(b)(2) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. \n     2462(b)(2)).\n       (B) The country does not engage in significant violations \n     of internationally recognized human rights and the Secretary \n     of State agrees with this determination.\n       (C)(i) The country is providing for effective enforcement \n     of internationally recognized worker rights throughout the \n     country (including in export processing zones) as determined \n     under paragraph (5), including the core labor standards \n     enumerated in the appropriate treaties of the International \n     Labor Organization, and including--\n       (I) the right of association;\n       (II) the right to organize and bargain collectively;\n       (III) a prohibition on the use of any form of coerced or \n     compulsory labor;\n       (IV) the international minimum age for the employment of \n     children (age 15);

ANTICORRUPTION EFFORTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Corruption and bribery of public officials is a major \n     problem in many African countries and represents a serious \n     threat to the development of a functioning domestic private \n     sector, to United States business and trade interests, and to \n     prospects for democracy and good governance in African \n     countries.\n       (2) Of the 17 countries in sub-Saharan Africa rated by the \n     international watchdog group, Transparency International, as \n     part of the 1998 Corruption Perception Index, 13 ranked in \n     the bottom half.\n       (3) The Organization for Economic Cooperation and \n     Development (OECD) Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign \n     Public Officials in International Business Transactions, \n     which has been signed by all 29 members of the OECD plus \n     Argentina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, and the Slovak Republic \n     and which entered into force on February 15, 1999, represents \n     a significant step in the elimination of bribery and \n     corruption in international commerce.\n       (4) As a party to the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery \n     of Foreign Public Officials in International Business \n     Transactions, the United States should encourage the highest \n     standards possible with respect to bribery and corruption.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the United States should encourage at every opportunity the \n     accession of sub-Saharan African countries, as defined in \n     section 6, to the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of \n     Foreign Public Officials in International Business \n     Transactions.\n\n     SEC. 602. REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN \n                   INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND COMPETITION LAW.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) since the onset of the worldwide HIV/AIDS epidemic, \n     approximately 34,000,000 people living in sub-Saharan Africa \n     have been infected with the disease;\n       (2) of those infected, approximately 11,500,000 have died; \n     and\n       (3) the deaths represent 83 percent of the total HIV/AIDS-\n     related deaths worldwide.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) it is in the interest of the United States to take all \n     necessary steps to prevent further spread of infectious \n     disease, particularly HIV/AIDS; and\n       (2) individual countries should have the ability to \n     determine the availability of pharmaceuticals and health care \n     for their citizens in general, and particularly with respect \n     to the HIV/AIDS epidemic.\n       (c) Limitations on Funding.--Funds appropriated or \n     otherwise made available to any department or agency of the \n     United States may not be obligated or expended to seek, \n     through negotiation or otherwise, the revocation or revisions \n     of any sub-Saharan African intellectual property or \n     competition law or policy that is designed to promote access \n     to pharmaceuticals or other medical technologies if the law \n     or policy, as the case may be, complies with the Agreement on \n     Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights \n     referred to in section 101(d)(15) of the Uruguay Round \n     Agreements Act.\n\n     SEC. 603. EXPANSION OF THE UNITED STATES AND FOREIGN \n                   COMMERCIAL SERVICE IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States and Foreign Commercial Service (in \n     this section referred to as the ``Commercial Service'') plays \n     an important role in helping United States businesses \n     identify export opportunities and develop reliable sources of \n     information on commercial prospects in foreign countries.\n       (2) During the 1980's, the presence of the Commercial \n     Service in sub-Saharan Africa consisted of 14 professionals \n     providing services in 8 countries. By early 1997, that \n     presence had been reduced by one-half to 7, in only 4 \n     countries.\n       (3) Since 1997, the Department of Commerce has slowly begun \n     to increase the presence of the Commercial Service in sub-\n     Saharan Africa, adding 5 full-time officers to established \n     posts.\n       (4) Although the Commercial Service Officers in these \n     countries have regional responsibilities, this kind of \n     coverage does not adequately service the needs of United \n     States businesses attempting to do business in sub-Saharan \n     Africa.\n       (5) Because market information is not widely available in \n     many sub-Saharan African countries, the presence of \n     additional Commercial Service Officers and resources can play \n     a significant role in assisting United States businesses in \n     markets in those countries.\n       (b) Appointments.--Subject to the availability of \n     appropriations, by not later than December 31, 2000, the \n     Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Assistant Secretary \n     of Commerce and Director General of the United States and \n     Foreign Commercial Service, shall take steps to ensure that--\n       (1) at least 20 full-time Commercial Service employees are \n     stationed in sub-Saharan Africa; and\n       (2) full-time Commercial Service employees are stationed in \n     not less than 10 different sub-Saharan African countries.\n       (c) Reports to Congress.--Not later than 1 year after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, and each year thereafter for 5 \n     years, the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the \n     Secretary of State, shall report to Congress on actions taken \n     to carry out subsection (b). Each report shall specify--\n\n[[Page S11438]]\n\n       (1) in what countries full-time Commercial Service Officers \n     are stationed, and the number of such officers placed in each \n     such country; and\n       (2) the effectiveness of the presence of the additional \n     Commercial Service Officers in increasing United States \n     exports to sub-Saharan African countries.\n\n                           TITLE VII--OFFSET\n\n     SEC. 701. PRIVATE SECTOR FUNDING FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT \n                   BY NASA RELATING TO AIRCRAFT PERFORMANCE.\n\n       The Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space \n     Administration may not carry out research and development \n     activities relating to the performance of aircraft (including \n     supersonic aircraft and subsonic aircraft) unless the \n     Administrator receives payment in full for such activities \n     from the private sector.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mr. Breaux, Mr. McCain, Mr. Hollings, \n        and Mr. Rockefeller):\n  S. 1639. A bill to authorize appropriations for carrying out the \nEarthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 1977, for the National Weather \nService and Related Agencies, and for the United States Fire \nAdministration for fiscal years 2000, 2001, and 2002; to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n            earth, wind, and fire authorization act of 1999\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Earth, \nWind, and Fire Authorization Act of 1999. This legislation would \nauthorize three public safety entities: the National Earthquake Hazard \nReduction Program (NEHRP), the National Weather Service and related \nagencies of the national Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and \nthe U.S. Fire Administration for fiscal years (FY) 2000, 2001, and \n2002. Each of these entities have important science and technology \nsafety programs which serve as a powerful example of the types of \nresearch that Federal Government should be investing its scarce \nresources in--the safety and protection of the American public.\n  Weather forecasts are an indispensable element of our everyday lives. \nAs Hurricane Floyd ravaged the eastern coast of the United States last \nweek, millions of Americans from the southern tip of Florida to the \nports of Boston tuned into their local weather channels to obtain the \nlatest information from the National Weather Service (NWS). They \nevaluated the very safety of their homes, possessions, and loved ones \nbased upon televised data. Numerous organizations including schools, \npublic transportation, and local businesses were also captivated by NWS \nforecasts to determine the potential of Hurricane Floyed to threaten \nthe safety of its citizens.\n  The Earth, Wind, and Fire Authorization Act of 1999 authorizes the \nNWS at $617.9 million in FY 2000, $651.9 million for FY 2001, and \n$687.7 million for FY 2002. Atmospheric Research is authorized at \n$173.3 million in FY 2000, $182.8 million in FY 2001, and $192.8 \nmillion in FY 2002. And the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and \nInformation Service (NESDIS) is authorized at $103 million for FY 2000, \n$108.8 million for FY 2001, and $114.7 million for FY 2002. NESDIS \nprovides for the procurement, launch, and operation of the polar \norbiting and geostationary environmental satellites, as well as the \nmanagement of NOAA's environmental data collections.\n  Also in the news today is the recent earthquake in Taiwan. The \ntremendous loss of lives and property has been beyond our \ncomprehension. I am pleased to authorize a federal research program \nthat targets these natural disasters. NEHRP combines research, \nplanning, and response activities conducted within each of the four \nspecified agencies; Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), U.S. \nGeological Survey (USGS), National Science Foundation (NSF), and \nNational Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The ultimate \ngoal of this multi-agency program is to protect lives and property.\n  The NEHRP is authorized at the following levels ($ millions):\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                FY2000   FY2001   FY2002\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFEMA.........................................     19.8     20.9     22.0\nUSGS.........................................     46.1     48.6     51.3\nNSF..........................................     29.9     31.5     33.3\nNIST.........................................      2.2      2.2      2.4\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  The mission of the U.S. Fire Administration is to enhance the \nnation's fire prevention and control activities, and thereby \nsignificantly reduce the nation's loss of life from fire while also \nachieving a reduction in property loss and nonfatal injury due to fire.\n  The bill, which authorizes the Fire Administration for $46.1 million \nin fiscal year 2000, $47.6 million for fiscal year 2001, and $49 \nmillion for fiscal year 2002, provides for collection, analysis, and \ndissemination of fire incidence and loss data; development and \ndissemination of public fire education materials; development and \ndissemination of better hazardous materials response information for \nfirst respondents; and support for research and development for fire \nsafety technologies.\n  With this authorization, our local and state firefighters will \ncontinue to have assess to the training from the National Fire Academy \nnecessary to allow them to better perform their jobs of saving lives \nand protecting property.\n  The authorization levels detailed above in each independent programs \nare based upon an overall 5.5 percent increase for research programs \nfor FY 2001 and 2002 over the President's FY 2000 budget request to be \nconsistent with the Federal Research Investment Act.\n  Mr. President, there are some additional concerns that the committee \nwill continue to address as we proceed to move this legislation. They \ninclude the proper role of the NWS and the commercial weather service \nindustry, and several employee-related concerns.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I join my colleague Senator Frist in \nintroducing this bill to authorize the atmospheric programs of the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Fire \nAdministration, and the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program \n(NEHRP) through FY 2002. These agencies are doing important work to \nprotect public safety through prediction, education, and mitigation \nefforts.\n  This bill authorizes the ``dry'' side of NOAA, the Fire \nAdministration, and NEHRP at the President's requested level for FY \n2000. The Senate-passed Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations bill \nprovided additional monies for the Weather Service and atmospheric \nresearch within NOAA, and Senator Frist has agreed to revise this \nauthorization bill during the Commerce Committee's consideration to \nreflect this additional support.\n  As many of you know, I have been trying to put the ``O'' back in NOAA \nfor years, so it is interesting to be co-sponsoring a bill which \nauthorizes only the ``dry'' side of NOAA. My support for the ``wet'' \nprograms of NOAA has not waned. Senator Frist, Senator Breaux, and I \nhave also been working with Senators Kerry and Snowe to craft a bill \nwhich will authorize all of the programs of NOAA.\n  NOAA is doing some important work. We need only look at their \nsuperior warnings during and after Hurricane Floyd to see that the \nNational Weather Service directly impacts the lives of Americans every \nday. Every weather report heard on the Weather Channel, CNN, and local \naffiliates was based on information provided by NOAA. The agency worked \nwith emergency managers, the private sector, and the public to make \nsure that its predictions and warnings were heard and could save lives \nand property.\n  NOAA's atmospheric scientists are also at work to help us understand \nwhat our weather might be like not just next week but also next year or \nin the next decade. NOAA is trying to understand long-term climate \nchange, as well as seasonal patterns like El Nino and La Nina. \nMeanwhile, NOAA's satellite operations keep our eyes in the sky in \nworking order and help us understand and predict the path of large \nsystems like hurricanes.\n  I especially appreciate the hard work that the Weather Service has \nundertaken in its modernization. While this is still a work in \nprogress, NOAA has improved warning times and accuracy while \nundertaking a difficult streamlining process. I wonder if Congress may \nhave asked NOAA to do too much with too little and am glad that the \nWeather Service has been able to fulfill its important mandate even \nwhere we might have cut too close to the bone.\n  Mr. President, while I hope each of us are benefitting from the \nforecasts and warnings of the Weather Service, I hope that far fewer of \nus have to interact with this nation's fire service. The United States \nhas over 2 million fires annually. Each one can devastate a\n\n[[Page S11439]]\n\nfamily or business. I should know. This August I lost my home in \nCharleston, South Carolina. The statistics--approximately 4500 deaths, \n30,000 civilian injuries, more than $8 billion in direct property \nlosses, and more than $50 billion in costs to taxpayers each year--do \nnot tell the whole story. A fire can take away a lifetime of things \nthat have true value only to the person who has suffered the loss. The \ntragic thing is that most of these fires are preventable.\n  The bill would authorize the United States Fire Administration which \nprovides invaluable services--such as training, data, arson assistance, \nand research of better safety equipment and clothing--to the more than \n1.2 million paid and volunteer firefighters throughout the nation. I \nhope the Fire Administration will work quickly to resolve the \noutstanding recommendations of the Blue Ribbon Panel so that they can \nonce again focus on reducing losses from fire and meet new challenges \nlike medical emergencies, hazardous spills, and even acts of terrorism. \nThe Strategic Plan called for in Section 302 of the bill should lay out \na road map for this process.\n  Finally, the bill would authorize the programs of the NEHRP. While \nmost people only think of California as having earthquakes, all or \nparts of 39 states--populated by more than 70 million people--have been \nclassified as having major or moderate seismic risk. In 1886, an \nearthquake leveled my hometown of Charleston. Estimates of the strength \nof the Charleston quake range from 7.0 to 7.6 on the Richter Scale. Of \nparticular interest and concern about east coast quakes is that there \nis no known geological origin for them. This fact underscores the \npossibility of unpredictable seismic activity in the United States.\n  What we do know though is that the loss of life and property from \nearthquakes can be considerable. That is what NEHRP is here for. It is \na Federal interagency program--with participation from the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency, the U.S. Geological Service, the National \nScience Foundation, and the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology--designed to help minimize the loss of life and property \ncaused by earthquakes. It is supports scientific research on the \norigins of earthquakes, and funds engineering research to make \nbuildings and other structures more seismically resistant. NEHRP also \ndisseminates this technical information to the states and helps states \nand localities prepare for earthquakes. NEHRP focuses on helping states \nprepare for earthquakes, in contrast to Federal disaster response \nprograms that help states after a major event.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion the public safety programs authorized in \nthis bill--the Weather Service, fire safety, and earthquake \npreparedness--protect the lives and property of every American citizen. \nProtecting public safety is one of the first and most important \nfunctions of government, and I am hopeful that my colleagues will join \nme in supporting these programs and this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE:\n  S. 1640. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the \nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to protect pension \nbenefits of employees in defined benefit plans and to direct the \nSecretary of the Treasury to enforce the age discrimination \nrequirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 with respect to \namendments resulting in defined benefit plans becoming cash balance \nplans; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n        pension benefits protection and preservation act of 1999\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Pension \nBenefits Protection and Preservation Act of 1999, a bill that will \nprotect the hard earned pensions of millions of American workers.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is long past due because big \ncompanies across America have been deserting their traditional defined \nbenefit pension plan which promised a fair retirement to their long-\ntime workers in favor of new ``cash-balance plans'' which promise less \nto loyal employees and more to CEO's who are already receiving record \nsalaries, stock options and benefits. It is simply unfair for companies \nto discriminate against the very workers who have made those companies \nso successful.\n  Older employees who have been forced into these cash-balance plans \nare finding their eventual pensions cut by 20-50 percent, and sometimes \neven more. This conversion technique is saving corporate America \nbillions of dollars, but it is older workers who are paying the price. \nThe technical and actuarial issues of cash-balance conversions may be \ncomplex, but what is simple is that Congress must act now to put \ntransition safeguards in place to protect the retirement security of \nthe American worker.\n  Earlier this week, the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee heard testimony from long-time IBM employees who were shocked \non July 1, 1999, to find that the accrued balance in their pension \nplans had been slashed up to 50 percent overnight. Why? Because IBM \ndecided to join the corporate conversion parade and convert its defined \nbenefit pension plan that had promised a secure retirement to IBM \nemployees into a plan that left trusted employees both insecure and \nembittered. IBM employees, including those in my state of Minnesota, \nused their knowledge of the Internet to organize, to communicate and to \nultimately win major, but not fully adequate, concessions from IBM. But \nmost employees of most companies don't have that kind of on-line \nsophistication. And no employees should have to rely on protests in \norder to preserve what they have already earned.\n  That is why I am introducing this legislation. The Pension Benefits \nProtection and Preservation Act of 1999 offers a comprehensive approach \nto the difficulties of employees faced with cash-balance conversions. \nThis measure will ensure fair treatment of American workers by \nrequiring disclosure, pension plan choice, elimination of the ``wear-\naway'' of pension benefits, and enforcement of the Age Discrimination \nand Employment Act.\n  Workers have a right to know how much of a pension they will receive \nwhen an employer unilaterally changes its pension play. My bill \nrequired a detailed disclosure at least 45 days before a plan \nconversion becomes effective, if that conversion significantly reduces \nthe pension benefits of employees. This gives employees adequate time \nto compare the benefits they would receive under the old plan with \nthose of the new.\n  That time to compare plans is critical because my bill penalizes \nemployers who significantly reduce employee pension benefit unless \nemployees are able to knowledgeably choose between old and new plans. \nEmployers who do significantly reduce benefits and fail to allow choice \nwill be liable for an excise tax equal in amount to 50 percent of the \nsurplus in the pension fund of the company. What the threat of this \npenalty does is to direct pension monies where they belong--into the \nretirement benefits that employees receive, not into shareholder \npockets or stock options of highly paid CEO's.\n  The Pension Benefits Protection and Preservation Act of 1999 also \neliminates the ``wearing-away'' of employee's accrued pension benefits \nby preventing company pension plans from giving participating employees \nan opening account balance in their ``new'' plan that is lower than \ntheir already accrued pension benefits to date under the old plan. \nUnder my bill, companies will no longer be able to engage in that \ntactic; instead, they will be required to continue to pay into workers' \npension accounts without regard to the amount of pension benefits \nworkers have accrued under their old plan.\n  Finally, the bill directs the Secretary of the Treasury to enforce \nthe existing pension age discrimination law enacted in 1986.\n  Mr. President, 25 years ago this month ERISA, the Employee Retirement \nSecurity Act, was enacted. Congress passed ERISA to put an end to \nbroken pension promises and to protect working men and women. Twenty-\nfive years later what we see instead is ERISA neither adequate--nor \nadequately enforced--enough to protect workers' pensions.\n  Pension funds belong to the workers, not the employer, and we must \nput in place a strong safety net to prevent those funds from being \nraided in the guise of being improved. That is why I am introducing the \nPension Benefits Protection and Preservation Act of 1999 today, and \nthat is why I am asking my\n\n[[Page S11440]]\n\ncolleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 1641. A bill to amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act \nof 1974, Public Health Service Act, and the Internal Revenue Code, of \n1986 to require that group and individual health insurance coverage and \ngroup health plans provide coverage of cancer screening; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.\n\n\n                 cancer screening coverage act of 1999\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill \nto require health insurance plans to cover screening tests for cancer. \nThe bill requires plans to cover screening tests that are currently \navailable and for which there is broad consensus on their value. To \naddress future changes in scientific knowledge and medical practice, \nthe bill allows the Secretary to change the requirements upon the \nSecretary's initiative or upon petition by a private individual or \ngroup. This bill is a companion to H.R. 1285, introduced by \nRepresentatives Carolyn B. Maloney and Sue Kelly.\n\n  A major way to reduce the number of cancer-related deaths and \nincrease survival is to increase screening rates. The American Cancer \nSociety predicts that the annual cancer death rate this year--563,100 \nAmericans--will equal five Boeing 747 jumbo jets crashing every day for \na year. Because early detection can save lives, requiring plans to \ncover detection tests can decrease the number of people who die each \nyear from cancer.\n  To put cancer deaths in perspective, the number of Americans that die \neach year from cancer exceeds the total number of Americans lost to all \nwars that we have fought in this century. The American Cancer Society \nestimates that over 1 million new cancer cases will be diagnosed in the \nUnited States this year, including 132,500 in California.\n  Despite our increasing understanding of cancer, unless we act with \nurgency, the cost to the United States is likely to become unmanageable \nin the next 10-20 years. The incidence rate of cancer in 2010 is \nestimated to increase by 29 percent for new cases, and cancer deaths \nare estimated to increase by 25 percent. Cancer will surpass heart \ndisease as the leading fatal disease in the U.S. by 2010. With our \naging U.S. population, unless we act now to change current cancer \nincidence and death rates, according to the September 1998 report from \nthe Cancer March Research Task Force, we can expect over 2.0 million \nnew cancer cases and 1.0 million deaths per year by 2025. Listen to \nthese startling statistics:\n  One out of every four deaths in the U.S. is caused by cancer.\n  This year approximately 563,100 Americans are expected to die of \ncancer--more than 1,500 people a day.\n  There have been approximately five million cancer deaths since 1990.\n  Approximately 12 million new cancer cases have been diagnosed since \n1990.\n  The National Cancer Institute estimates that approximately 8.2 \nmillion Americans alive today have a history of cancer.\n  One out of every two men, one out of every three women will be \ndiagnosed with cancer at some point in their lifetime.\n  Too many Americans die each year from cancer. The tragedy is that we \nhave tools available which can prevent much unnecessary suffering and \ndeath. Early detection--finding cancer early before it has spread--\ngives a person the best chance of being treated successfully. Early \nscreening for breast, cervical, prostate, and colorectal cancer can \nincrease survival rates. Having insurance coverage for cancer \nscreenings is a major way of encouraging people to get examinations and \ntests.\n  Screening examinations, if given on an appropriate schedule by a \nhealth care professional, have proven their value. Screening-accessible \ncancers, such as cancers of the breast, tongue, mouth, colon, rectum, \ncervix, prostate, testis, and skin, account for approximately half of \nall new cancer cases. The five-year relative survival rate for these \ncancers is about 81 percent. According to the American Cancer Society, \nif all Americans participated in regular cancer screening, this rate \ncould increase to more than 95 percent. For example, people can have \ncolon cancer long before they know it. They may not have any symptoms. \nPatients diagnosed by a colon cancer screening have a 90 percent chance \nof survival while patients not diagnosed until symptoms are apparent \nonly have a 8 percent chance of survival.\n  Finding cancers in their early stages can mean that treatment is less \nexpensive. Treatment of breast, lung, and prostate cancers account for \nover half of annual medical costs, which by National Institutes of \nHealth estimates is $37 billion annually.\n  A colon cancer screening costs approximately $125-$300.00. If a \npatient is not diagnosed with colon cancer until symptoms are apparent, \ncare during the remaining 4-5 years of life can cost up to $100,000. \nSimilarly, the initial average cost of treating rectal cancer that is \ndetected early is about $5,700. This is approximately 75 percent less \nthan the estimated $30,000-$40,000 it costs to treat rectal cancer that \nis further along in its development.\n  The cost of lost productivity due to cancer is $11 billion annually, \nwhile the cost of lost productivity due to premature death is $59 \nbillion annually. We can't afford not to screen.\n  Insurance coverage is a major determinant in whether people obtain \npreventive screenings. In short, when screenings are covered by plans, \npeople are more likely to get them. In California, screening rates for \ncervical and breast cancer are lower for uninsured women, who are less \nlikely to have had a recent screening and more likely to have gone \nlonger without being screened than women with coverage.\n  According to a University of California-Los Angeles Center for Health \nPolicy Research study from February 1998, in California women ages 18-\n64, 63 percent of uninsured women had not had a Pap test during 1997 \nversus 40 percent of insured women. Additionally, approximately 67 \npercent of uninsured Californian women ages 30-64 had not had a \nclinical breast examination during 1997, compared to 40 percent for \ninsured women in the same age group.\n  In 1997, Congress added cancer screening coverage under Medicare for \ncertain cancers, such as breast and cervical. Medicare beneficiaries \nnow receive cancer screenings without having to pay out-of-pocket for \nsuch tests. Americans under the age of 65 who are privately insured \ndeserve the same health care. Under Medicaid, preventive services are \noptional benefit. States can choose to cover them or not so coverage \nvaries state to state.\n  All Americans deserve access to cancer screening, regardless of \nwhether one has health insurance because they are an employee of the \nDepartment of Defense, a Medicare beneficiary, or a veteran. Certainly \nindividuals who have private health insurance through their employers--\n56 percent of Californians have private health insurance--should be \nguaranteed access to life-saving and life-prolonging cancer screenings. \nOffering coverage for cancer screening simply makes good sense.\n  The bill requires plans to cover screenings according to current \nguidelines:\n  Annual mammograms for women ages 40 and over and for women under 40 \nwho are at high risk of developing breast cancer.\n  Annual clinical breast exams for women ages 40 and over and for women \nbetween the ages of 20 and 40 who are at high risk of developing breast \ncancer.\n  Clinical breast exams every three years for women who are between the \nages of 20 and 40 and are not at high risk for developing breast \ncancer.\n  Annual pap tests and pelvic examinations for women ages 18 and over \nor women who are under the age of 18 and are or have been sexually \nactive.\n  Screening procedures for men and women ages 50 and over or under age \n50 and at high risk for developing colorectal cancer, including annual \nscreening fecal-occult blood test and screening flexible sigmoidoscopy \nevery 4 years.\n  Men and women at high risk for colorectal cancer (in any age group) \nmay receive a screening colonoscopy every 2 years.\n  Annual digital rectal examination and/or annual prostate-specific \nblood test for men ages 50 and over or males who are at high risk.\n  The bill authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \nmodify coverage requirements to reflect changes in medical practice or \nnew scientific knowledge, based both on the\n\n[[Page S11441]]\n\nSecretary's own initiative or upon petition of an individual or \norganization.\n  Cancer touches virtually every American in some way. The \nComprehensive Cancer Screening Act can be one way to alleviate the fear \nand reality of cancer felt by millions of Americans. We all want to \nbelieve that when a family member is diagnosed with cancer, he or she \nwill get care of the highest quality and that their medical team will \nconquer this disease. Early detection, while it does not prevent cancer \nfrom occurring, can stop cancer before it spreads, extend life, reduce \ntreatment costs, and improve the quality of life for cancer patients. \nBy requiring private health plans to cover cancer screening as a \npreventive measure, my bill is cost effective and could ease the cancer \nburden felt by America due to lost productivity related to cancer \ndeaths and illness.\n  It is long past due for this Congress to send a strong message to \ninsurance companies. Cancer screening is an important prevention \nmeasure and should be covered under all insurance plans. America cannot \nafford not to screen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url":

Mr. President, 6 months ago today on March 24, \n1999, the United States and its allies launched Operation Allied Force \nin the Balkan region. To commemorate this event, I am submitting a \nresolution expressing the sense of the Senate that the men and women \nassigned to and employed by Eglin Air Force Base should be recognized \nand commended for their participation in, and efforts associated with, \nthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) Operation Allied Force.\n  The personnel of the Air Armament Center at Eglin Air Force Base \ndeveloped and provided many of the munitions, technical orders, \nexpertise and support equipment utilized by NATO during the air \ncampaign. Specifically, the two thousand pound Joint Direct Attack \nMunition (JDAM) was the first weapon dropped in the operation. \nAdditionally, the Air to Ground 130 (AGM 130) standoff missile enabled \nF15E Strike Eagle aircrews to attack targets with precision from a \ndistance of forty miles.\n  The reliable performances of the JDAM and AGM 130 enabled combat air \ncrews to complete bombing missions accurately, effectively, and with \nreduced risk to crews. The result was zero casualties among NATO air \npersonnel.\n  The availability of these arms was the result of the vision of the \nAir Armament Center personnel who recognized years earlier that these \nmunitions would be important to American armament.\n  The brave service personnel from Eglin Air Force Base--and their \nfamilies--sacrificed much in support of Operation Allied Force. We \nexpress our deepest gratitude to them. We recognize that their efforts \nallowed NATO to conduct an air war with no American combat casualties, \nyet with a devastating effect on our adversaries.\n  We commit to maintaining the technological superiority of American \nair armament as a critical component of our nation's capacity to \nconduct and prevail in warfare while minimizing casualties.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/24/senate-section/article/S11442-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 186--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING \n    REAUTHORIZING THE ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ACT OF 1965\n\n  Mr. LOTT (for himself, Mr. Gregg, and Mr. Coverdell) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was ordered placed on the calendar:\n\n                              S. Res. 186\n\n       Whereas the fiscal year 2000 Senate Budget Resolution \n     increased education funding by $28,000,000,000 over the next \n     five years, and $82,000,000,000 over the next ten years, and \n     the Department of Education received a net increase of \n     $2,400,000,000 which doubles the President's requested \n     increase;\n       Whereas compared to the President's requested levels, the \n     Democratically controlled Congress' appropriations for the \n     period 1993 through 1995 reduced the President's funding \n     requests by $3,000,000,000, and since Republicans took \n     control of Congress, Federal education funding has increased \n     by 27 percent;\n       Whereas in the past three years, the Congress has increased \n     funding for Part B of Individuals with Disabilities Education \n     Act by nearly 80 percent, while the Administration's fiscal \n     year 2000 budget only requested a 0.07 percent increase which \n     is less than an adjustment for inflation, and Congress is \n     deeply concerned that while the Administration has provided \n     rhetoric in support of education of the disabled, the \n     Administration's budget has consistently taken money from \n     this high priority program to fund new and untested programs;\n       Whereas Congress is not only providing the necessary funds, \n     but is also reforming our current education programs, and \n     Congress recognizes that significant reforms are needed in \n     light of troubling statistics indicating--\n       (1) 40 percent of fourth graders cannot read at the most \n     basic level;\n       (2) in international comparisons, United States 12th \n     graders scored near the bottom in both mathematics and \n     science;\n       (3) 70 percent of children in high poverty schools score \n     below even the most basic level of reading; and\n       (4) in mathematics, 9 year olds in high poverty schools \n     remain two grade levels behind students in low poverty \n     schools;\n       Whereas earlier in 1999, the 106th Congress took the first \n     step toward improving our Nation's schools by passing the \n     Education Flexibility and Partnership Act of 1999, which \n     frees States and local communities to tailor education \n     programs to meet the individual needs of students and local \n     schools;\n       Whereas the 1999 reauthorization of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 will focus on increasing \n     student achievement by empowering principals, local school \n     boards, teachers and parents, and the focus should be on \n     raising the achievement of all students.\n       Whereas Congress should reject a one-size-fits all approach \n     to education, and local schools should have the freedom to \n     prioritize their spending and tailor their curriculum \n     according to the unique educational needs of their children;\n       Whereas parents are the first and best educators of their \n     children, and Congress supports proposals that provide \n     parents greater control to choose unique educational \n     opportunities to best meet their children's educational \n     needs.\n       Whereas every child should have an exceptional teacher in \n     the classroom, and Congress supports efforts to recruit, \n     retrain, and retain high quality teachers;\n       Whereas quality instruction and learning can occur only in \n     a first class school that is safe and orderly;\n       Whereas Congress supports proposals that give schools the \n     support they need to protect teachers and students, remove \n     disruptive influences, and create a positive learning \n     atmosphere; and\n       Whereas success in education is best achieved when \n     instruction focuses on basic academics and fundamental \n     skills, and students should no longer be subjected to untried \n     and untested educational theories of instruction, rather our \n     Nation's efforts should be geared to proven methods of \n     instruction. Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the Sense of the Senate--\n       (1) this Congress has taken strong steps to reform our \n     Nation's educational system and allowed States, local schools \n     and parents more flexibility and authority over their \n     children's education; and\n       (2) the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965 will enable this Congress to continue \n     its efforts to send decision making back to States, local \n     schools and families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/24/senate-section/article/S11442-2", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11442-S11443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 187--TO EXPRESS THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING \n                           EDUCATION FUNDING\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Harkin, and Mrs. Murray) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was ordered placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n                              S.

Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 5121 et seq.);\n       Whereas Hurricane Floyd is responsible for the known deaths \n     of 65 people;\n       Whereas 45 people are confirmed dead in North Carolina, \n     with many people still missing;\n       Whereas 4 people were killed in New Jersey, 2 people in New \n     York, 6 people in Pennsylvania, 4 people in Virginia, 2 \n     people in Delaware, 1 person in Connecticut, and 1 person in \n     Vermont;\n       Whereas as the flood waters recede, the death toll is \n     expected to increase;\n       Whereas the rainfall resulting from Hurricane Floyd has \n     caused widespread flooding in North Carolina along the Tar \n     River, the Neuse River, and the Cape Fear River, among other \n     rivers, in Connecticut along the Still River, and in Virginia \n     along the Nottoway River and the Blackwater River;\n       Whereas some of the rivers are expected to remain at flood \n     stage for more than a week;\n       Whereas the floods are the worst seen in North Carolina in \n     80 years;\n       Whereas the flood level on the Tar River exceeds all \n     previous records by 9 feet;\n       Whereas flood waters engulfed cities such as Tarboro, North \n     Carolina, Franklin, Virginia, Bound Brook, New Jersey, and \n     Danbury, Connecticut;\n       Whereas tens of thousands of people have fled to shelters \n     scattered throughout North Carolina, South Carolina, New \n     York, New Jersey, and Virginia;\n       Whereas thousands of people remain isolated, surrounded by \n     water, in their homes in North Carolina and Virginia;\n       Whereas approximately 50,000 homes have been affected by \n     the hurricane, and many of those homes will ultimately be \n     condemned as uninhabitable;\n       Whereas water supplies in New Jersey, New York, North \n     Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia have been severely \n     disrupted, and, in many cases, wells and private water \n     systems have been irreparably contaminated;\n       Whereas hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses have \n     lost electric power, telephone, and gas service as a result \n     of Hurricane Floyd;\n       Whereas there have been road washouts in virtually every \n     State struck by Hurricane Floyd, including 900 road washouts \n     in North Carolina alone;\n       Whereas many farmers have suffered almost total crop \n     losses; and\n       Whereas small and large businesses throughout the region \n     have been gravely affected: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. NEED FOR ASSISTANCE FOR VICTIMS OF HURRICANE \n                   FLOYD.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the victims of Hurricane Floyd deserve the sympathies \n     of the people of the United States;\n       (2) the President, the Director of the Federal Emergency \n     Management Agency, the Secretary of Agriculture, the \n     Secretary of Transportation, the Secretary of Commerce, and \n     the Director of the Small Business Administration are to be \n     commended on their efforts to assist the victims of Hurricane \n     Floyd;\n       (3) the Governors of Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, \n     Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, \n     South Carolina, and Virginia are to be commended for their \n     leadership and coordination of relief efforts in their \n     States;\n       (4) the National Guard, the Army, the Marine Corps, the \n     Navy, and the Coast Guard have provided heroic assistance to \n     the people of the afflicted areas and are to be commended for \n     their bravery;\n       (5) the Red Cross, the Salvation Army, and other private \n     relief organizations have provided shelter, food, and comfort \n     to the victims of Hurricane Floyd and are to be commended for \n     their generosity and invaluable aid; and\n       (6) additional assistance needs to be provided to the \n     victims of Hurricane Floyd.\n\n     SEC. 2. FORMS OF ASSISTANCE FOR HURRICANE FLOYD VICTIMS.\n\n       To alleviate the conditions faced by the victims of \n     Hurricane Floyd, it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     President should--\n       (1) work with Congress to provide necessary funds for--\n       (A) disaster relief administered by the Federal Emergency \n     Management Agency;\n       (B) disaster relief administered by the Department of \n     Agriculture;\n       (C) disaster relief administered by the Department of \n     Commerce;\n       (D) disaster relief administered by the Department of \n     Transportation;\n       (E) disaster relief administered by the Small Business \n     Administration; and\n       (F) any other disaster relief needed to help rebuild \n     damaged homes, provide for clean water, renourish damaged \n     beaches and protective dunes, and restore electric power; and\n       (2) prepare and submit to Congress a report that analyzes \n     the feasibility and cost of implementing a program to provide \n     disaster assistance to the victims of Hurricane Floyd, \n     including assistance in the form of--\n       (A) direct economic assistance to agricultural producers, \n     small businesses, and displaced persons;\n       (B) an expanded loan and debt restructuring program;\n       (C) cleanup of environmental damage;\n       (D) small business assistance;\n       (E) repair or reconstruction of private homes;\n       (F) repair or reconstruction of highways, roads, and \n     trails;\n       (G) provision of safe and adequate water supplies; and\n       (H) restoration of essential utility services such as \n     electric power, telephone, and gas service.\n Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, on September 14, Hurricane Floyd \nbegan making its way up the eastern coast, leaving in its path \nunprecedented destruction. The hurricane made landfall\n\n[[Page S11444]]\n\nat the mouth of the Cape Fear River in North Carolina on September 16 \nand brought with it strong winds and torrential downpours. To date, \nHurricane Floyd is responsible for 65 deaths, 45 in North Carolina \nalone.

SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The American people know that a strong public education \n     system is vital to our Nation's future and they \n     overwhelmingly support increasing the Federal investment in \n     education.\n       (2) The funding level for the Subcommittee on Labor, Health \n     and Human Services, and Education of the Committee on \n     Appropriations of the Senate has been reduced to pay for \n     other programs.\n       (3) The current allocation for the Subcommittee on Labor, \n     Health and Human Services, and Education of the Committee on \n     Appropriations is 17 percent below fiscal year 1999 levels.\n       (4) The 17 percent reduction in Head Start will result in \n     142,000 children not being served.\n       (5) The 17 percent reduction will cost school districts the \n     funds for 5,246 newly hired teachers.\n       (6) The 17 percent reduction will deprive 50,000 students \n     of access to after-school and summer school programs.\n       (7) The 17 percent reduction in funding for the Individuals \n     with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) will make it far more \n     difficult for States to provide an appropriate education for \n     students with disabilities by reducing funding by more than \n     $880,000,000.\n       (8) The 17 percent reduction will deprive 2,100,000 \n     children in high-poverty communities of educational services \n     to help them do well in school and master the basics.\n       (9) The 17 percent reduction will result in 1,000 fewer \n     school districts receiving support for their initiatives to \n     integrate technology into their classrooms.\n       (10) The 17 percent reduction will deny nearly 200,000 \n     disadvantaged and middle-income students access to counseling \n     and educational support to help them succeed in college.\n       (11) The 17 percent reduction will reduce funds provided to \n     schools to improve school safety by nearly $100,000,000.\n       (12) The 17 percent reduction will cause 100,000 students \n     to lose their Federal Pell Grant awards.\n       (13) No action has been taken in the Senate on the \n     Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and \n     Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2000.\n       (14) There are only 5 legislative work days left before the \n     end of fiscal year 2000.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Senate should increase the Federal investment in \n     education, including providing--\n       (A) $1,400,000,000 for the second year of the initiative to \n     reduce class sizes in early grades by hiring 100,000 \n     qualified teachers;\n       (B) an increase in support for programs that recruit, \n     train, and provide professional development for, teachers;\n       (C) $600,000,000 for after-school programs, thereby \n     tripling the current investment;\n       (D) an increase, not a decrease, in funding for the Safe \n     and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act of 1994;\n       (E) an increase in funding for part A of title I of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 for children \n     from disadvantaged backgrounds, and an increase in funding \n     for reading and literacy grants under part C of title II of \n     such Act;\n       (F) an increase, not a decrease, in funding for the \n     Individuals with Disabilities Education Act;\n       (G) funding for a larger maximum Federal Pell Grant award \n     for college students, and an increase in funding for \n     mentoring and other need-based programs;\n       (H) an increase, not a decrease, in funds available to help \n     schools use technology effectively in the classroom and \n     narrow the technology gap; and\n       (I) at least $3,700,000,000 in Federal resources to help \n     communities leverage funds to modernize public school \n     facilities; and\n       (2) the Senate should stay within the discretionary \n     spending caps and avoid using the resources of the social \n     security program by finding discretionary spending offsets \n     that do not jeopardize important investments in other key \n     programs within the jurisdiction of the Subcommittee on \n     Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education of the \n     Committee on Appropriations of the Senate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  ROBB (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 1791\n\n  Mr. ROBB (for himself, Mr. Warner, and Mr. DeWine) proposed an \namendment to the bill, H.R. 2684, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING AERONAUTICS RESEARCH.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) Every aircraft worldwide uses and benefits from NASA \n     technology.\n       (2) Aeronautical research has fostered the establishment of \n     a safe, affordable air transportation system that is second \n     to none.\n       (3) Fundamental research in aeronautics is not being \n     supported anywhere in the country outside of NASA.\n       (4) The Department of Transportation predicts that air \n     traffic will triple over the next twenty years, exacerbating \n     current noise and safety problems at already overcrowded \n     airports. New aeronautics advancements need to be developed \n     if costs are to be contained and the safety and quality of \n     our air infrastructure is to be improved.\n       (5) Our military would not dominate the skies without \n     robust investments in aeronautics research and development.\n       (6) Technology transferred from NASA aeronautics research \n     to the commercial sector has created billions of dollars in \n     economic growth.\n       (7) The American aeronautics industry is the top \n     contributor to the U.S. balance of trade, with a net \n     contribution of more than $41 billion in 1998.\n       (8) Less than ten years ago, American airplane producers \n     controlled over 70% of the global market for commercial \n     aviation.\n       (9) America's dominance in the world's civil aviation \n     market is being challenged by foreign companies like Airbus, \n     which now has approximately 50% of the world's civil aviation \n     market, and is aiming to capture 70%.\n       (10) The rise of foreign competition in the global aviation \n     market has coincided with decreases in NASA's aeronautics \n     research budget and a corresponding increase in European \n     investment.\n       (11) NASA's aeronautics laboratories have the research \n     facilities, including wind tunnels, and technical expertise \n     to conduct the cutting-edge scientific inquiry needed to \n     advance state-of-the-art military and civil aircraft.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the United States should increase its commitment to \n     aeronautics research funding.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      FEINSTEIN AMENDMENT NO. 1792\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI (for Mrs. Feinstein) proposed an amendment to the bill, \nH.R. 2684, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___.

Mr. President, I rise to warn the Senate of \nintensifying harassment against government whistleblowers. This trend \nthreatens Congress'\n\n[[Page S11446]]\n\nright to know, and preserves secrecy that shields bureaucratic \nmisconduct. From the IRS to the State Department, retaliation is \nincreasing against government employees who blow the whistle on \nwrongdoing by high government officials.\n  How did we get here? In the view of this Senator, one of the major \nproblems has been the judicial activism of the Federal Circuit Court of \nAppeals, which has jurisdiction over challenges by government employees \nto illegal retaliatory acts, and which has grossly misinterpreted \nexisting federal laws. To illustrate my concerns, I am enclosing for \nthe Record a New York Times editorial; and a Federal Times article by \nthe Government Accountability Project about the most extreme Federal \nCircuit precedent, involving Air Force whistleblower John White. This \nprecedent could functionally cancel both the whistleblower law and the \nCode of Ethics.\n  I have no intention of passively acquiescing to the judicial \nequivalent of contempt of Congress.\n  The material follows:\n\n                 [From the New York Times, May 1, 1999]\n\n                    Helping Whistle-Blowers Survive\n\n       Jennifer Long, the Internal Revenue Service agent who \n     nearly lost her job two weeks ago after publicly blowing the \n     whistle on abuses at the agency, was rescued at the last \n     minute by the intervention of an influential United States \n     Senator. But the fact that her employers had no inhibitions \n     about harassing her is clear evidence that the laws \n     protecting whistle-blowers need to be strengthened. As they \n     stand, these laws merely invite the kind of retaliation that \n     Mrs. Long endured.\n       A career tax auditor, Mrs. Long was the star witness at \n     Senate Finance Committee hearings convened in 1997 by William \n     Roth of Delaware to investigate complaints against the IRS. \n     She was the only IRS witness who did not sit behind a curtain \n     and use a voice-distortion device to hide her identity. She \n     accused the agency of preying on weaker taxpayers and \n     ignoring cheating by those with the resources to fight back. \n     She has since said that she was subjected to petty \n     harassments from the moment she arrived back at her district \n     office in Houston. Then, on April 15 of this year, she was \n     given what amounted to a termination notice, at which point \n     Mr. Roth intervened with the IRS commissioner and saved her \n     job--at least for now.\n       Had he not intervened, Mrs. Long's only hope of vindication \n     would have been the remedies provided by the Civil Service \n     Reform Act of 1978 and the Whistle-Blower Protection Act of \n     1989. These two statutes prescribe a tortuous and uncertain \n     appeals process that in theory guarantees a whistle-blower \n     free speech without fear of retaliation, but in practice is \n     an exercise in frustration. Despite recent improvements, only \n     a handful of Federal employees, out of some 1,500 who \n     appealed in the last four years, have prevailed in rulings \n     issued by the Government's administrative tribunal, the Merit \n     System Protection Board. Overwhelmingly, the rest of the \n     cases were screened out on technical grounds or were settled \n     informally with token relief.\n       A few prominent whistle-blowers have won redemption outside \n     the system. Frederic Whitehurst, the chemist who was \n     dismissed after disclosing sloppiness and possible dishonesty \n     in the Federal Bureau of Investigation's crime laboratory, \n     won a sizable cash settlement because he had a first-class \n     attorney who mounted an artful public relations campaign. \n     Ernest Fitzgerald, the Pentagon employee who disclosed \n     massive cost overruns, survived because he was almost \n     inhumanly persistent and because his cause, like Mrs. Long's, \n     attracted allies in high places. But the prominence of an \n     issue does not guarantee survival for the employee who \n     discloses it. Notra Trulock, the senior intelligence official \n     at the Energy Department who tried to alert his superiors to \n     Chinese espionage at a Government weapons laboratory, has \n     since been demoted.\n       Senator Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican, has been \n     seeking ways to strengthen the 1989 law with the help of the \n     Government Accountability Project, a Washington advocacy \n     group that assists whistle-blowers. One obvious improvement \n     would be to give whistle-blowers the option to press their \n     claims in the Federal courts, where their cases could be \n     decided by a jury. To guard against clogging the system with \n     frivolous litigation, the cases would first be reviewed by a \n     nongovernment administrative panel. But the point is to give \n     whistle-blowers an avenue of appeal outside the closed loop \n     in which they are now trapped.\n       A reform bill along these lines passed the House in 1994 \n     but died in the Senate. With Mrs. Long's case fresh in mind, \n     the time has come for both Houses to re-examine the issue.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Federal Times, July 26, 1999]\n\n            Court Turns Whistleblower Act Into Trojan Horse\n\n                            (By Tom Devine)\n\n       In a stunning act of extremism, the Federal Circuit Court \n     of Appeals has functionally thrown out two statutes \n     unanimously passed by Congress: the Code of Ethics for \n     Government Service and the Whistleblower Protection Act.\n       The decision, Lachance vs. White, reflects unabashed \n     judicial activism to overturn unanimous congressional \n     mandates.\n       The case involves an Air Force whistleblower, John White.\n       In 1992, he was moved and stripped of duties after \n     successfully challenging as gross mismanagement a local \n     command's Quality Education System, a bureaucratic turf \n     builder camouflaged as reform by micromanaging and imposing \n     de facto military accreditation on participating \n     universities.\n       Experts inside and outside the government agreed with \n     White.\n       The Air Force canceled the program after a scathing report \n     by its own experts found the program counterproductive for \n     education and efficiency.\n       Whistleblowing doesn't come any better than this.\n       The Merit Systems Protection Board three times ruled in \n     White's favor, each time challenged on technicalities by the \n     Office of Personnel Management.\n       But the appeals court decided it knew better.\n       The court concocted a hopelessly unrealistic standard for \n     whistleblowing disclosures to pass muster.\n       The court said a whistleblower must have had a ``reasonable \n     belief'' that he was revealing misconduct.\n       This ``reasonable belief'' is the prerequisite to be \n     eligible for reprisal protection, the court found.\n       At first glance, the court's definition of ``reasonable \n     belief'' is almost boringly innocuous: ``could a \n     disinterested observer with knowledge of the essential facts \n     reasonably conclude . . . gross mismanagement?''\n       But the devil is in the details. The court warmed up by \n     establishing a duty of loyalty to managers.\n       ``Policymakers have every right to expect loyal, \n     professional service from subordinates,'' the court said.\n       So much for the Code of Ethics, which is on the wall of \n     every federal agency since unanimous passage in 1980: ``Put \n     loyalty to the highest moral principles and to country above \n     loyalty to persons, party or government department.''\n       The court decreed that whistleblowing does not include \n     ``policy'' disputes.\n       But that's not what Congress said in 1994 amendments to the \n     whistleblower protection law: ``A protected disclosure may . \n     . . concern policy or individual misconduct.''\n\n\n                            a cruel illusion\n\n       Most surreal is the court's requirement for MSPB to conduct \n     an independent ``review'' to see if it was reasonable for the \n     employee to believe he revealed misconduct.\n       And whistleblowers must overcome the presumption that \n     government agencies act ``correctly, fairly, in good faith'' \n     and legally unless there is ``irrefragable'' proof otherwise.\n       What's ``irrefragable''? My dictionary defines it as \n     ``[i]ncapable of being overthrown; incontestable, undeniable, \n     incontrovertible.''\n       This means if disagreement is possible, the whistleblower's \n     belief is unreasonable and eligibility for legal protection \n     vanishes.\n       Not content to render the Whistleblower Protection Act a \n     bad joke, the Court turned it into a Trojan Horse, \n     instructing the board to violate it routinely by searching \n     for evidence that the whistleblower has a conflict of \n     interest as part of its review.\n       Amendments to the whistleblower law in 1994 outlawed \n     retaliatory investigations--those taken because of protected \n     activity.\n       These developments are no surprise.\n       Before Chief Judge Robert Mayer's arrival on the court, he \n     served as deputy special counsel when his office tutored \n     managers and taught courses on how to fire whistleblowers \n     without getting caught.\n       Mayer's actions helped spark the Whistleblower Protection \n     Act's birth.\n       Now under his leadership, the Federal Circuit is killing it \n     with a sternly obsessive vengeance.\n       Under current law, there is no way out in the courts.\n       Except for unprecedented Supreme Court review, the Federal \n     Circuit Court of Appeals has a monopoly on judicial review of \n     whistleblower decisions by the MSPB. As long as it persists, \n     the Whistleblower Protection Act's promise will be a cruel \n     illusion.\n       Congress has a clear choice: passively institutionalize its \n     ignorance of executive branch misconduct, or restore its and \n     the public's right to know.\n       The solution is no mystery:\n       Pass a legislative definition of ``reasonable belief'' \n     overturning all the nooks and crannies of this case.\n       Give federal workers the same access to the court that is a \n     private citizen's right--jury trials and an all-circuits \n     judicial review in appeals courts.\n       It is unrealistic for the government to expect federal \n     employees with second-class rights to provide first-class \n     service to the public.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/24/senate-section/article/S11446-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11446-S11447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              EIGHTH ANNIVERSARY OF UKRAINIAN INDEPENDENCE\n\n Mr. KENNEDY.

They declared their independence,\n\n[[Page S11447]]\n\nas did other peoples of the former Soviet Union, fulfilling the wishes \nof generations of Ukrainians.\n  Eight years have now passed since that dramatic time, and Ukraine and \nU.S.-Ukrainian relations are stronger than ever. We now have a U.S.-\nUkraine Joint Commission, chaired by Vice President Gore and President \nKuchma, which seeks to improve bilateral relations on a wide range of \nissues.\n  A significant part of this effort is the sister city project to help \nUkrainian communities develop more effective local government. I'm \nproud that the City of Lowell in Massachusetts is a sister city with \nthe Ukrainian city of Berdiansk in this worthwhile project.\n  I especially commend the members of the Ukrainian-American community \nfor their constant courage and commitment in championing the cause of \nUkrainian independence over the years. They never gave up this \nstruggle, even during the darkest days of the Cold War. They can be \nproud of their achievements. Their efforts in recent years have made \nUkraine the third largest annual recipient of U.S. assistance. I'm \nprouder than ever to support their impressive efforts.\n  I also commend the Ukrainian-American community for its ongoing work \nto help American high school students understand that the Great Famine \nof the 1930s was a man-made terror-famine, used by Stalin to suppress \nthe Ukrainian people. Millions of Ukrainians died in this great crime \nagainst humanity.\n  Sadly, the twentieth century has been filled with too many of these \nmassive crimes. We must never forget the atrocities that have been \ninflicted on millions of citizens in other lands, including the \nUkrainian people. We must do all we can to build a better world in the \nyears ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/24/senate-section/article/S11447-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE FOR MS. LINDA COLEMAN\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the \nexceptionally distinguished service of Ms. Linda Coleman, who is \nleaving Federal Service on September 30, 1999, after 30 years. She has \nbeen the mainstay within the Office of the Chief of Legislative \nLiaison, United States Army for the past 20 years. It is a privilege \nfor me to recognize the many outstanding achievements she has provided \nthe Congress, the United States Army and our great Nation.\n  Linda Coleman has worked for every Member of the Congress as the \nSecretary of the Army's legislative liaison within the Army's House \nLiaison Division, Congressional Inquiry Division, and Programs \nDivision. Initiative, caring service, and professionalism are the terms \nused to describe Linda Coleman. She has been instrumental in providing \ninformation and explaining the diverse programs within the United \nStates Army. Ms. Coleman is an expert in coordinating the interface \nbetween the Secretary and Chief of Staff of the Army and Members of \nCongress. She is an expert at cutting through the red tape of the \nbureaucracy without losing sight of the fact that taking care of the \nsoldier is the ultimate goal. I have never known of an instance in \nwhich Ms. Coleman would back away from doing the right thing for the \nArmy, the soldier or family members, or the Congress she served.\n  Ms. Coleman has earned a reputation on Capitol Hill as someone who \ncould be relied upon to respond to inquires in a responsive, \nprofessional manner. She expanded the Army's understanding of Congress \nand the Army's role in the legislative process through continuous \ninteraction with Members of Congress and the Army's leadership. Ms. \nColeman established procedures to assist in informing and explaining \nthe Army to Congress. Ms. Coleman prepared the Army's senior leaders \nfor all of their meetings with Members of Congress. For each meeting, \nshe prepared the Army senior leader with detailed information on the \nissues and the interests of the Members of Congress involved in the \nmeetings. Ms. Coleman has been the ``go to'' person in Army Legislative \nLiaison. When Members of Congress had a really complex issue, the \nlegislative action officers and assistants would go to her for advice.\n  Ms. Coleman is able to communicate effectively with both military \nofficials and Congressional staff members and has developed superb \nworking relationships.

Mr. President, I rise today to call the attention \nof my colleagues to an article published in the New York Times on \nSeptember 21, 1999. The article describes the efforts by the people of \nEast Peoria, Illinois, to combat racism and hatred in the aftermath of \nBenjamin Smith's shooting rampage during the July 4 weekend. Mr. Smith, \na former member of the so-called World Church of the Creator, targeted \nJews, African-Americans, and Asian-Americans, killing two and wounding \nnine before shooting himself. Matthew Hale, a self-proclaimed white \nsupremacist who established the World Church of the Creator, set up its \nheadquarters in East Peoria.\n  Mr. President, it would have been easy for the citizens of East \nPeoria to simply move on with their lives, dismissing this incident as \nan aberration and passively hoping that future acts of racial hatred \nwould not plague their community. But the citizens of East Peoria are \nembracing a proactive approach to combating hatred, fostering \ntolerance, and celebrating diversity. Mayor Charles Dobbelaire recently \nannounced the creation of a Human Relations Commission, which will \nguide East Peoria in their campaign to combat hate and teach tolerance.\n  While we can prosecute crimes motivated by hatred, we unfortunately \ncannot legislate hate out of the human heart. Each of us has a \nresponsibility to speak out against racism and embrace our differences, \nrather than use them as a wedge to divide our communities. I ask that \nmy colleagues join me in recognizing the commendable efforts made by \nthe citizens of East Peoria to combat racial hatred and promote \ntolerance and that an article from the New York Times be inserted in \nthe Congressional Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n             [From the New York Times, September 21, 1999]\n\n                   A City Takes a Stand Against Hate\n\n                             (By Jo Thomas)\n\n       East Peoria, Ill.--For years, the hard-working residents of \n     this mostly white town on the eastern bank of the Illinois \n     River did not take seriously the white supremacist views of \n     Matthew F. Hate, 27, the son of a retired local policeman.\n       They recall trying to ignore his leaflets and appearances \n     on public-access television. When he set up the headquarters \n     of the World Church of the Creator in his parents' home, some \n     thought it was a joke.\n       But after the July 4 weekend, when Benjamin Smith, a former \n     World Church member, went on a two-state rampage against \n     Jews, blacks and Asian-Americans, killing two and wounding \n     nine before shooting him-self, the laughter stopped.\n       ``We were sickened,'' said Dennis Triggs, 54, the City \n     Attorney. ``We had the sense that benign neglect must come to \n     an end.''\n       Mr. Triggs called Morris Dees, co-founder of the Southern \n     Poverty law Center, a nonprofit civil rights organization, to \n     ask what East Peoria could do.\n       Mr. Dees sent Mr. Triggs and Mayor Charles Dobbelaire, 59, \n     a copy of the center's publication ``Ten Ways to Fight \n     Hate,'' and advised city leaders to do two things: Speak out \n     immediately and form a broad-based coalition on race issues.\n       Mr. Dees also put leaders in touch with the Rev. David \n     Ostendorf, a United Church of Christ minister in Chicago who \n     leads the Center for a New Community, a group dedicated to \n     fighting white supremacist ideas and organizations in the \n     Midwest.\n       Mr. Ostendorf, who believes that ``the only way this \n     movement is going to be stopped is if communities stand up \n     and say no and organize to oppose it,'' added a stop in East \n     Peoria to a civil rights tour that retraced Mr. Smith's \n     deadly trip through Illinois and Indiana.\n       On July 22, with members of Mr. Ostendorf's caravan and 200 \n     local residents present, the Mayor announced that East \n     Peoria, which has only a few dozen nonwhites in its \n     population of 23,400 would set up a Human Relations \n     Commission ``to guide us in combating hate and teaching \n     tolerance.''\n       ``We will not surrender the minds of our young to Matt \n     Hale,'' Mr. Dobbelaire continued.\n       ``I know that still today there are those who believe we \n     should not attract attention\n\n[[Page S11448]]\n\n     to the hatemongers,'' he said. ``They believe that if we \n     quietly go about our everyday life, those who preach hate \n     will fade slowly into the night. I ask you this: If we do not \n     speak out, loud and clear, when the hate messages spewing \n     forth from this so-called church lead to death, then when do \n     we speak out?''\n       Mr. Dobbelaire's speech was followed by a prayer vigil in \n     front of the Hale family home. On the other side of the \n     ordinary, tree-lined street, a neighbor had posted a sign \n     saying ``Hate Has No Home here.''\n       The Mayor, who grew up in East Peoria and said racial \n     issues rarely crossed his mind, appointed a new Human \n     Relations Commission on Aug. 17.\n       ``We're in this for the long haul,'' he said.\n       East Peoria has survived severe blows before, the worst \n     being the closing of a Caterpillar tractor plant that had \n     been its economic cornerstone. But it has enjoyed a comeback \n     in recent years, with a new riverboat casino and jobs in \n     entertainment, tourism and service industries.\n       The idea that their town might be seen as some kind of hate \n     capital horrified the Mayor and the human relations \n     commissioners.\n       ``This is really causing a bad image for our tri-county \n     area, not just East Peoria.'' said David Mingus, the \n     commission chairman. ``It's unfortunate and unrealistic. Our \n     towns are good town.''\n       Mr. Mingus, 48, a mental health professional, said the \n     commission intended to take a broad look at diversity and \n     tolerance.\n       ``We will keep it open to all areas,'' he said. ``It's \n     something nobody has on the scope all the time. We have to \n     change attitudes.''\n       Anthter member of the commission, Charles Randle, 53, who \n     is black, said he had lived in an upscale neighborhood of \n     East Peoria for 17 years with no difficulty. But Mr. Randle \n     said he could not forget the searing experience of childhood \n     on a cotton plantation in Mississippi, where two of his \n     brothers, then young boys, were jailed for supposedly \n     whistling at a white woman. To escape that life, their \n     father, a sharecropper, moved his wife and 10 children to \n     Peoria, where he worked at a slaughterhouse and then started \n     a series of successful family businesses.\n       Mr. Randle, the director of economic development for \n     Illinois Central College, said he saw the Human Relations \n     Commission as a chance for East Peoria ``to step outside the \n     box and look around.''\n       Other communities have made similar efforts.\n       In Boise, Idaho, several years ago, the state's image began \n     to worry the staff at Hewlett-Packard, said Cindy Stanphill, \n     the company's diversity and staffing manager.\n       ``When we recruit, people know about Idaho potatoes and the \n     Aryan nations,'' Ms. Stanphill said. ``The image does not \n     necessarily represent the reality, but you have to deal with \n     both.''\n       For three years, the Hewlett-Packard staff has tried to \n     find ways to insure that people they recruit and employ in \n     Boise feel welcome at work and in the community. Staff  \n     members are now trying to organize an Idaho Inclusiveness \n     Coalition, a group of major employers and human rights \n     groups to promote tolerance and celebrate diversity.\n       In Pennsylvania, the state's Human Relations Commission has \n     helped more than 50 communities form groups to do something \n     about hate. One group stated in Boyertown, a historically \n     all-white community northwest of Philadelphia where the Ku \n     Klux Klan distributed recruitment literature once a month.\n       Residents formed a unity coalition and asked citizens to \n     pledge 5 cents to 50 cents for each minute the Klan spent in \n     town. The money went to civil rights groups and helped \n     organize the town's first rally to honor the Rev. Dr. Martin \n     Luther King Jr.\n       The head of the local Klan complained that the group, which \n     was collecting $1,051 an hour, was using the Klan's name to \n     raise money, said Louise Doskow, a member of the coalition. \n     But the group persisted. ``We have raised over $11,000,'' Ms. \n     Doskow said. ``We did it every month for 13 months, then they \n     didn't show up again for a year. One person came to the \n     corner at the end of June, so we did another collection.''\n       The experiences of these communities and others, collected \n     by Jim Carrier, a former reporter for The Denver Post, have \n     been added to an updated version of ``Ten Ways to Fight \n     Hate.'' Mr. Carrier said the Southern Poverty Law Center \n     would distribute a million free copies of the booklet and a \n     companion, ``Responding to Hate at School.'' The booklets \n     will go to every school principal, mayor and police chief in \n     the nation, as well as to human rights groups, religious \n     leaders and interested citizens.\n       One group profiled, Coloradans United Against Hatred, \n     formed after an African immigrant was murdered by a skinhead \n     in 1997. Seeing the use of the Internet by hate groups, the \n     group set up its own Web site to offer an alternative.\n       ``Are we making a huge impact?'' said Anita Fricklas, the \n     Colorado director of the American Jewish Committee, which \n     helped underwrite the project. ``It's hard to know. But an \n     impact? Definitely.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/24/senate-section/article/S11448-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11448-S11449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNITION OF ALASKA QUARTERLY REVIEW\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, two years ago I rose to \nhighlight a publication of the University of Alaska, Anchorage when it \nwas honored as ``one of the nation's best literary magazines.'' Today, \nI rise to again call the Senate's attention to the continuing praise \nfor the Alaska Quarterly Review. Specifically, I rise to praise its \nlatest issue, Alaska Native Writers, Storytellers & Orators, The \nExpanded Edition.\n  The literary journal, now in its 18th year, for its summer-fall issue \nhas published a 400-page volume including more than 80 original works, \nmany by Alaska Natives. The volume could win my praise simply for \ntaking the step of publishing 15 classic Native stories in both English \nand in traditional Alaska Native languages. You see, in June 1991, I \nintroduced the Alaska Native Languages Preservation Act (S. 1595). The \nbill, which became law in 1992 and was implemented in 1994, was \ndesigned to provide grants to Alaska Native groups and media for \nlanguage preservation projects, including research, preservation and \ninstruction to teach Alaska's traditional languages to younger Natives.\n  There are 20 original Native languages spoken in Alaska--more than \n155 nationwide--but only two of them, Siberian Yup'ik and Central \nYup'ik are healthy.'' That means they continue to be spoken by Native \nchildren. Thus 18 of the Alaska Native languages face extinction by \n2055, unless more is done to preserve them. For example, only a single \nspeaker of Eyak, a language spoken only in the Copper River Delta in \nAlaska, is still alive to pass the unique sounds of the language on to \nnew speakers.\n  Thus the new effort by the review's Executive Editor and Founding \nEditor Ronald Spatz of Anchorage would win my praise simply because it \nhas published stories in Eyak, Haida, Tlingit, Tsimshian, Ugangan, \nAlutiiq, Central Yup'ik, St. Lawrence Island Yup'ik, Inupiaq and \nDena'ina. But the issue has done much more for classic and modern \nliterature and for the preservation of Alaska's Native history and \ntraditions.\n  Through its stories, short stories, oral histories, folk tales and \npoems, the literary magazine has taken a giant step to convey Alaska's \nrich and diverse Native cultures. It pays tribute to the Native \nlanguage speakers and tradition bearers that keep their cultures alive \nthrough their stories and through their words. And over the years \nAlaskans have learned that one of the best ways to protect the social \nfabric of Native Alaskans is to protect their culture, thus maintaining \nNative residents' pride in their history and their heritage.\n  Kirkus Reviews, in its Aug. 1, 1999 review of the journal called it, \n``quite a tidy little omnibus of poems, oral histories, folk tales and \nstories by Native Alaskans. . . . Sociologists and folklorists will be \nparticularly grateful for the bibliography and source notations, and \nthose unfamiliar with Alaskan culture, will find in the very extensive \ncommentaries a useful orientation to what remains a largely unknown \nworld. . . . offering as they do a glimpse into the history of our Last \nFrontier.''\n  This is certainly not the first time that the review has won literary \npraise. Since its inception at the Anchorage campus of the University \nof Alaska in 1982, the Alaska Quarterly Review (AQR) has served as an \ninstrument to give voice to Alaska writers and poets, while also \npublishing the best of material from non-Alaskan authors. While the AQR \nis firmly rooted in Alaska, it maintains a national perspective--\nbridging the distance between the literary centers and Alaska, while \nalso sharing an Alaskan perspective. This balanced presentation of \nviews has earned AQR local, regional and national/international \nrecognition over the years.\n  In June 1997 the Washington Post book review section, Book World, \ncalled it ``one of the nation's best literary magazines.'' Bill Katz in \nthe Library Journal said ``AQR is highly recommended and deserves \napplause.'' While Patrick Parks in the Literary Magazine Review said, \n``It is an impressive publication, comprising as diverse and rewarding \nan aggregation of work as a reader is likely to find in any literary \njournal.''\n  The review has won a host of national awards including a 1999 Beacon \nBest award, a 1997 O. Henry Award, a 1996 award from Scribner for Best\n\n[[Page S11449]]\n\nAmerican Poetry, and the 1995 Andres Berger Award from Northwest \nWriters Inc., plus literally a dozen other awards and mentions.\n  I rise today to honor the publication, not just because of its many \nawards, but because many Alaskans still do not understand or appreciate \nthe breadth and scope of the publication and how important it has \nbecome as a gateway for Alaskan authors to win recognition from a wider \nliterary audience.\n  I want to thank the University of Alaska Board of Regents and the \nleadership of the University of Alaska Anchorage for supporting the \npublication. Alaska's university system continues to face difficult \neconomic times because of falling Alaska State revenues. It has taken a \ntremendous commitment to academic excellence to continue the funding \nnecessary to permit the review to be a quality publication and artistic \nsuccess. The University deserves great credit for its efforts at \npromoting the publication in these difficult financial times. It is \nbecause of the need for more revenues for the University to permit it \nto reach the highest level of greatness that I continue to press for \nthe University to finally gain its full land-grant entitlement that it \nshould have received at its founding. The University of Alaska Land \nGrant Bill, still pending full Senate consideration, would greatly help \nthe University gain the economic means to support such important \nendeavors. But more on that at another time.\n  I also want to thank and again publicly recognize the work of Mr. \nSpatz. A recent recipient of the 1999 Edith R. Bullock Award for \nExcellence--the most prestigious award bestowed by the University of \nAlaska Foundation, Mr. Spatz is a professor and chair of the University \nof Alaska Anchorage's Department of Creative Writing and Literary Arts \nand has been involved with the UAA's honors program. A film maker and \nwriter, besides editor, Mr. Spatz wrote a series of illuminating notes \nin the current volume. He was joined in shaping it by Contributing \nEditors Jeane Breinig, assistant professor of English at the University \nof Alaska Anchorage, and by Patricia Partnow, vice president of \nEducation at the Alaska Native Heritage Center. A final thank you must \nbe provided to the National Endowment for the Arts, which provided a \nHeritage and Preservation Grant that helped pay the costs of \npublication of the expanded edition.\n  Mr. President, Alaska, in fact all of America, is far richer \nartistically because of the review's presence. It truly is a window for \nAmericans to view society in Alaska at the close of the 20th Century, \nand a worthy stage for the serious works of all writers as we enter the \n21th Century. That is particularly the case with this edition. I \ncommend it and its contributors for its many achievements, and I know \nall members of the U.S. Senate join me in wishing it continued \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/24/senate-section/article/S11449-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NATIONAL HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of \nNational Hispanic Heritage Month. In my own state of New Jersey, we \ncelebrate and recognize the proud history of a people who have a deep \naffinity to faith, a strong work ethic, and commitment to family \nvalues. Hispanic Americans share a diverse ancestry with countries \nspanning Europe, Africa, and South and Central America, and close \ncultural ties to Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America, South America, \nand Spain. This diversity has brought variety and richness to the \nAmerican mosaic and has strengthened our national character with \ninvaluable perspective, experiences, and values.\n  For countless years, Hispanic Americans have played an integral role \nin all walks of life and made our country stronger. Whether it is in \nthe entertainment industry, business, medicine or public service, the \ncontributions of Hispanic Americans cannot be understated. I am proud \nto represent a state with a large concentration of Puerto Ricans, \nCubans, Dominicans and immigrants from countless countries in South and \nCentral America.\n  In counties such as Hudson, Essex, Passaic, Union, Camden, Atlantic \nand Cumberland, Hispanic Americans have been contributing to my state's \ndiversity for years. In our state legislature, we are proud to have \nfour members of the General Assembly of Hispanic Heritage with Wilfredo \nCaraballo, Raul ``Rudy'' Garcia, Nilsa Cruz-Perez and Nellie Pou. At \nthe county level, we have three distinguished members of the Board of \nChosen Freeholders with Nidia Davila-Colon, Silverio Vega, and Neftali \nCruz in Hudson County. And at the local level, countless Cuban \nAmericans, Puerto Ricans and Central and Southern Americans have \nachieved the office of council person and mayor. New Jersey was \nespecially proud to elect its first Hispanic member of the House of \nRepresentatives with the election of Representative Robert E. Menendez, \nwho also serves in the House leadership.\n  Through my own Italian heritage, I share a special bond with people \nof Hispanic descent. When Christopher Columbus set sail to discover \nthis continent, it was done so with the financial support of Spain. \nHundreds of years later, the Hispanic heritage continues to be an \nimportant and critical aspect of our national accomplishments. Hispanic \nAmericans comprise eleven percent of the nation's population. In just a \nfew years, Hispanic Americans will be the largest ethnic group in the \nUnited States. Their commitment to this country has not gone unnoticed. \nWhether it is serving in our Armed forces or through their growing \neconomic consumer strength, Hispanic Americans are indeed thriving and \nintertwined in the fabric that is this great country.\n  Activism is important to creating a sense of personal responsibility \nfor one's community. The Hispanic American community embodies this \nconcept, and should be commended for successfully instilling it in \nothers. The contributions of Hispanic Americans has spread to other \ncommunities in a manner that transcends racial and ethnic differences, \nand I am confident they will continue to grow as a vital component of \nlife in New Jersey and indeed the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/24/senate-section/article/S11449-2", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11449-S11450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         OIL ROYALTY VALUATION\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to state for the record \nthat, had I been able to, I would have voted against the Hutchison \namendment to the Interior appropriations bill, which proposed to \ncontinue a moratorium on revising Interior regulations governing how \nmuch oil companies pay for oil drilled on public lands and resources. I \nregret that previous commitments prevented my availability to be in the \nSenate for this critical vote.\n  This issue seems fairly straightforward. Oil companies are required \nto pay royalties for on- and off-shore oil drilling. Fees are based on \ncurrent law which clearly states that ``the value of production for \npurposes of computing royalty on production . . . shall never be less \nthan the fair market value of the production.'' Revenues generated from \nthese royalties are returned to the federal treasury. However, for many \nyears, oil companies have been allowed to set their own rates.\n  In the past, I have supported similar amendments which extended a \nmoratorium on rulemaking while affected parties were involved in \nnegotiations to update the regulations. However, this process has been \nstalled for years, with little possibility of reaching resolution \nbecause these legislative riders imposing a moratorium on regulation \nchanges have created a disincentive for oil companies to agree to any \nfee increases, resulting in taxpayers losing as much as $66 million a \nyear.\n  Who loses from this stalemate? The taxpayers--because royalties \nreturned to the federal treasury benefit states, Indian tribes, federal \nprograms such as the Historic Preservation Fund and the Land and Water \nConservation Fund, and national parks.\n  I supported cloture twice to end debate on this amendment because I \nbelieve we should vote on the underlying amendment to allow a fair and \nequitable solution of royalty valuation of oil on federal lands. On the \nfinal vote, however, I would have opposed the Hutchison amendment to \ncontinue this moratorium because I believe we should halt the process \nby which oil companies can set their own rules and determine how much \nthey pay the taxpayers for the use of public assets. I do not support a \nstructure which only serves to benefit big oil companies and allows \nthem to continue to be subsidized by the taxpayers.\n  We should seek fairness for each and every industry doing business on \npublic\n\n[[Page S11450]]\n\nlands using public assets, and we should insist that same treatment be \napplied to oil companies. Fees that are assessed from drilling oil on \npublic lands are directed back to the federal treasury and these fees \nshould reflect the true value of the benefit oil companies receive.\n  We have a responsibility, both as legislators and as public servants, \nto ensure responsible management of our public lands and a fair return \nto taxpayers. That responsibility includes determining a fair fee \nstructure for oil drilling on public lands. Despite passage of this \namendment which continues this moratorium for yet another year, I hope \nthat we can reach a reasonable agreement to ensure proper payment by \noil companies for utilizing public resources.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/24/senate-section/article/S11450-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11450-S11451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nRECOGNIZING THE MAY 13, 1999, SPEECH OF HANS W. BECHERER, CHAIRMAN AND \n       CEO OF DEERE AND COMPANY BEFORE THE DES MOINES ROTARY CLUB\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to recognize and \nenter into the Record a recent speech presented to the Des Moines \nRotary Club by Hans Becherer, Chairman and CEO of Deere and Company. \nHis remarks are insightful and provide a long term outlook from one of \nthe leaders in our agricultural community. The speech is entitled, \n``All Farming is Global''.\n\n       Today I'd like to discuss some of the major trends that \n     will help shape agriculture as it moves into the new century \n     and millennium. This is of particular importance to Iowa \n     since almost one-fourth of the state's population works in \n     the agricultural complex . . . and 90% of the land area is \n     devoted to farms.\n       Farming remains critical to John Deere, as well. Although \n     we've diversified a good deal in recent years, both in \n     product breadth and geographic reach, farm machinery remains \n     our flagship business . . . and the domestic farmer our \n     number one customer.\n       Needless to say, the farm sector is struggling right now \n     due to depressed grain and livestock prices. As a result, \n     North American retail demand for farm equipment is expected \n     to be off 25% or so this year with lesser reductions in \n     Europe. Accordingly, we're making aggressive cutbacks in our \n     production in order to adjust inventories and bring more \n     balance to the market.\n       One farmer, on an Internet message board devoted to Deere, \n     recently summed it up this way: ``The quality of the green \n     tractor is there,'' he said. ``The quality of the green money \n     to pay for it isn't.''\n       Thus far, that seems to be a fair assessment of the \n     situation.\n       Of course, the farm economy was in good shape heading into \n     this downturn, from the standpoint of debt levels and land \n     values, and will likely prove quite resilient. There's \n     nothing to suggest this will be a rerun of the 1980s.\n       Moreover--the next year or two aside--the future of farming \n     looks extremely promising for the long run.\n       That's what I'd like to focus on this afternoon--less the \n     problems of the present, than the promise of the future.\n       Of the key forces dictating change in agriculture today, \n     the most important ones concern increasingly open markets and \n     freer trade; the explosive growth in technology, which is \n     transforming the entire economy these days; plus, the \n     continuing importance of environmental issues.\n       Let's take a closer look at these issues now.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       As a first point, farming is becoming far more market-\n     oriented.\n       Most of us, I suspect, believe in free trade and open \n     agricultural markets. We feel farmers in Iowa have a lot to \n     gain from such a situation. We have, after all, some of the \n     world's best farmland literally in our backyards, plus an \n     excellent distribution system for getting crops to market, \n     and access to highly productive farm machinery.\n       Just what does an open market, increasingly free of \n     controls and restrictions, mean to the farm sector?\n       Mostly, it will accelerate trends already under way--\n     putting a premium on large, efficiently run operations that \n     are able to make the most of today's technology and fast-\n     moving markets.\n       Less-regulated farming will have a positive impact in terms \n     of overall economic efficiency--and it's likely a plus for \n     the nation's agricultural complex as a whole. It certainly \n     gives U.S. farming a leg-up in a global market, something \n     that works to Iowa's benefit.\n       As for the decline in smaller farms, this very definitely \n     marks the passing of an era, which many find a source of \n     regret. But it's a process that has been in motion for some \n     time: Even in the robust economic environment of the last few \n     years, Deere was selling less than half as many tractors and \n     combines to the domestic market as in the early 1970s. The \n     number of U.S. farms has contracted by one-third (from 3 to 2 \n     million) over this time, with a similar pattern seen in Iowa.\n       I should point out that some small operators will do quite \n     well in tomorrow's less-regulated market. These are the ones \n     who devote themselves to a type of management-intensive, or \n     niche, agriculture, such as growing organic crops. Still, it \n     will take quite an entrepreneurial breed to overcome the \n     economies of scale that are becoming more and more a part of \n     farming.\n       Along the same lines, a more open agricultural climate \n     means farming will become more internationally focused and \n     geared to exports. Indeed, the farmer of the future will have \n     to be a man of the world.\n       And that's definitely a plus for Iowa.\n       Agriculture has always been regarded as the most basic of \n     local enterprises. And rightly so: What could be more a part \n     of our communities than our own soil? Farming, moreover, \n     has constituted the soul of rural life in our country for \n     over 200 years, and been widely associated with the \n     virtues of honesty and hard work that built America.\n       But in truth, ladies and gentlemen, all farming is global.\n       Every ear of corn, or pod of soybean produced in Iowa makes \n     an impact on the world market . . . and affects farmers in \n     faraway places such as Australia and Argentina.\n       Similarly, every drop of rain that falls on Brazil's \n     creddados . . . has an effect on Iowa's farms and fields.\n       Legislation approved in Berlin and Brussels . . . is felt \n     by farmers in Burlington and Belle Plaine.\n       Soybean prices went into a nosedive awhile back . . . not \n     because of a leap in supply or a lag in demand, but because \n     the Brazilian currency lost one-quarter of its value over-\n     night. Brazil, of course, is a major soybean producer and \n     exporter. That action alone shaved roughly a dollar a bushel \n     off bean prices.\n       Global trade, manifested by exports, has become a mainstay \n     for our nation's farmers. Roughly one-fourth of farm receipts \n     today come from overseas sales. And Iowa is right in the \n     thick of things, being the nation's number-two exporter of \n     agricultural commodities ( $4B year) after California.\n       Farm exports will drop this year due to the economic \n     travails of the developing world and are down almost 20%--or \n     $10 billion--from their peak. But this is almost surely a \n     short-lived phenomenon . . . and completely at odds with the \n     long-range picture.\n       The world's fundamentals--namely, strong population growth, \n     improved diets and more open trade policies--all point to \n     U.S. farming, and Iowa agriculture, being an export-driven, \n     growth-intensive business with solid prospects well into the \n     future.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Farming will get more competitive, too, as farmers scramble \n     to add value to their crops and gain an edge in productivity, \n     yields and costs.\n       Technology--my second point--will help them get there. \n     Technology, of course, has been the story in agriculture \n     since the days of Cyrus McCormick's reaper . . . John Deere's \n     plow . . . and the Waterloo Boy tractor. Forerunners of \n     modern-day combines and cotton-pickers weren't far behind.\n       The cultural effect of ever-more productive machinery goes \n     well beyond the farm. It's what transformed our society into \n     an industrial power since it takes so much less physical \n     labor to feed our population today. The average farmer gets \n     as much done by 9 a.m. now as in a full day in the post-war \n     1940s. Over this time, crop production has nearly tripled \n     from virtually the same amount of farmland. Especially \n     noteworthy, farm-labor's role in the agricultural process has \n     dropped by more than two-thirds during this time.\n       What accounts for such improvements? Technology, mostly . . \n     . in the form of better seeds and fertilizer, as well as--\n     indeed--more sophisticated farm machinery.\n       As important as technology has been to farming's past . . . \n     it's fair to say we haven't seen anything yet. Genetically \n     modified seeds . . . plus precision, or satellite-guided, \n     farming and other, almost unimaginable, advances in \n     information technology . . . put farming on a truly exciting, \n     high-tech plain for the new century.\n       Going forward, in fact, a farmer's biggest problem will not \n     be having access to technology, but figuring out how to apply \n     it to his best advantage. ``What we're trying to do here,'' \n     one farmer recently said at a precision-farming conference, \n     ``is create knowledge out of chaos.''\n       Meeting this need--helping farmers bridge the gap between \n     information and intelligence--may constitute a promising \n     business opportunity in its own right. Deere recently formed \n     a new business unit--John Deere Special Technology Group--to \n     help supply solutions to these challenges.\n       One of the unit's most exciting new ventures is the \n     VantagePoint network, a kind of silo in cyberspace. More to \n     the point, VantagePoint is an Internet-based data-warehouse \n     subscription service that allows farmers to collect, store, \n     and reference a full array of data about their farming \n     operation--such as yield and seed population. Subscribers can \n     also see aggregated data from neighboring areas. VantagePoint \n     functions as a server to contain this information . . . and, \n     as an interface, to organize and present the data in creative \n     and useful ways.\n       As for the Internet itself, we believe it adds an important \n     new dimension to the selling process, which should work to \n     the benefit of our John Deere dealers . . . by helping them \n     provide even more responsive service and counsel.\n\n[[Page S11451]]\n\n       A number of dealers have their own websites. Many more are \n     listing used equipment on a company-sponsored site called \n     MachineFinder-dot-com, launched late last year. Roughly 6,000 \n     pieces of equipment, mostly tractors and combines, are \n     presently available over MachineFinder . . . and about 15,000 \n     users have registered for the site.\n       What ever the future of MachineFinder and other emerging \n     Internet-related services, one can safely assume that \n     technology will play as big a role in the  success of \n     tomorrow's farmers as the weather or government policies.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       As technology makes farmers more productive, it's also \n     helping them be good stewards of the soil, the air and the \n     water. That's the third area I'd like to touch on today.\n       Outside of large hog lots--which is certainly a newsworthy \n     issue in Iowa--the environmental side of farming doesn't grab \n     many headlines. But it's quite a factor in the farming \n     process . . . and seems likely to stay that way.\n       Regulation, for one thing, will see to it that farmers \n     remain serious about limiting emissions . . . preserving the \n     soil . . . and controlling the run-off of chemicals and \n     waste. Some of the proposals you hear about would even limit \n     the hours farmers spend in their fields, based on dust \n     restrictions. Noise abatement is an emerging concern. And \n     water quality seems likely to be the next big area of \n     regulatory focus.\n       All this, of course, adds cost and complexity to the \n     farming process. But many of the very things that make \n     farmers environmentally sensitive . . . are actually fiscally \n     sensible. That is, they help farmers become more productive \n     and profitable.\n       New engines are cleaner-burning and more efficient. \n     Precision farming helps farmers cut down on input costs. New \n     sprayers apply herbicides with laser-like precision, cutting \n     down on waste and over-spray.\n       All that's good for the environment, of course. But it's \n     also beneficial for the farmer's bottom line.\n       Iowa's farmers are truly among the unsung heroes in today's \n     environmental movement. For without modern fertilizers, \n     herbicides and machinery . . . without high-yield production \n     practices . . . and without the tremendous yield gains we've \n     seen over the years . . . an additional one-million square \n     miles of our nation (all the land east of the Mississippi \n     River, in size) would need to be plowed under and made into \n     cropland, merely to equal present levels of grain production.\n       That's no less than three miles the amount of land \n     currently devoted to farming. It's fair to say, moreover, \n     that these new fields would come at the direct expense of \n     forested areas and other land now serving as wildlife habitat \n     or as part of our natural watershed.\n       Clearly, farmers have done quite a job of safeguarding our \n     natural resources, while meeting the world's growing need for \n     food. Nevertheless, tomorrow's increasingly formidable \n     environmental pressures will require an even more intensive \n     commitment on their part.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Regardless of the challenges ahead for agriculture, I \n     assure you that Deere remains firmly committed to providing \n     solutions to our customers' needs and customers in our case \n     go far beyond the farm.\n       Over the last several years, John Deere has worked hard to \n     achieve a good deal of diversification in our operations. \n     We've done so not by plunging into altogether-new businesses, \n     but by applying the lessons learned from generations of \n     dealing with farmers to a broader range of customers.\n       Our view is that the characteristics of our Waterloo-made \n     tractors, or Des Moines cotton pickers--such as durability \n     and reliability--work just as well for construction \n     equipment, such as Dubuque-made backhoes.\n       The same goes for our new skid-steer loaders, Gator utility \n     vehicles, golf and turf equipment or the full range of lawn-\n     care machinery now being offered in green and yellow.\n       Similarly, our Des Moines-based credit operation owes its \n     success not to the fact that the money it lends goes farther \n     than anyone else's . . . but because of the integrity and \n     service that has long been associated with the John Deere \n     name. (John Deere Credit, incidentally, is quite a successful \n     enterprise in its own right, normally adding 20% or so to the \n     company's overall net income.)\n       Moreover, it is these non-ag operations that have been the \n     focus of major investment programs of late . . . and which \n     we're counting on to help us achieve more consistency in our \n     profits whenever the farm economy weakens.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       None of which, in any way, dampens our enthusiasm for \n     farming.\n       Because despite some of the challenges I've mentioned--and \n     the current downturn is very real and painful--the future for \n     agriculture looks good.\n       Darned good, in fact.\n       Regardless of Indonesia's financial problems . . . the \n     world still has 10,000 new mouths to feed every hour, and, \n     again, will need three times today's grain output within 50 \n     years.\n       No matter what's ahead for Brazil's real or Russia's ruble \n     . . . a good deal of money will be spent on the increased \n     consumption of meat--which is a primary driver of demand for \n     grain.\n       Beyond the Third World's growing pains . . . the global \n     farm population, now over 40%, will shrink as industrial \n     growth creates new opportunities and higher living standards. \n     This will make Iowa's contribution to the world food supply \n     all the more important.\n       True, these things may take shape more slowly than we \n     expected, but the fundamental trends are headed in the right \n     direction.\n       All point . . . to a promising future . . . for a globally \n     attuned . . . technologically astute . . . environmentally \n     aware . . . agricultural sector--such as exists in Iowa and \n     surrounding states.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/24/senate-section/article/S11451-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. ROTH.

Mr. President, earlier this week we have heard again the \nchiming of the celestial clock, the autumnal equinox sounded the \narrival of fall and the harvest season. In Washington, the skies today \nare sapphire blue and they look like parchment marked only with wispy \nglyphs of aircraft contrails. The air is crisp and the air is clear, \nwith none of the steaminess that burdened our torrid summer days. \nEvenings serve up the glorious gradations of vivid colors from a \npalette only God could paint. Night comes earlier and night is cooler. \nThe hum of air conditioners is giving way to the weight of blankets on \nthe bed. In the words of Humbert Wolfe:\n\n\n[[Page S11453]]\n\n\n       Listen! The wind is rising,\n       and the air is wild with leaves.\n       We have had our summer evenings,\n       now for October eves!\n\n  The year is advancing, cycling into its season of greatest abundance \nas crops mature and are harvested--such crops as they are. I have to \nadd that, in the light of the terrible drought that has afflicted the \neastern part of the United States, from Vermont to Tennessee. But as \nthe crops, such as they are--mature and are harvested against the \ncoming of winter. Branches are bent over with crisp apples and \nsucculent pears, foretelling the apple butter festivals to come.\n  Mr. President, we have great apple butter festivals in West Virginia. \nGo to Berkeley Springs in Morgan County, just an hour and a half's \ndrive from here. Go to the apple butter festival there. And there are \napple butter festivals in other parts of West Virginia.\n  In my backyard, the squirrels and the chipmunks are gathering, and I \nplay a little game with those squirrels and chipmunks. My wife, Erma, \nalways sees to it that I have a large bag of peanuts. And when I look \nout the window and see squirrels, I go to the door, softly unlock the \ndoor, but the squirrels, they hear. And when they hear the little \nnoises at the door they perk up, they sit up on their haunches and they \nlook at the door, and then they break out into a run. They run to the \ndoor--my door, my door that opens on the back porch of my house--they \nrun to the door because they sense that there is about to be a peanut \nthat will emerge from a tiny crack when the door is opened. And they \npounce upon that peanut.\n  The chipmunk also runs for the peanut. Sometimes he wins and gets \nthere first, but many times he doesn't get there first, and I can just \nsense the disappointment on his little face as he becomes very excited \nand runs here and there, thither and yon, looking for a peanut which \nthe squirrel was first to get. So I throw out another peanut and the \nchipmunk gets that one.\n  The squirrels and chipmunks are gathering and storing acorns and \npeanuts and every bit of corn and birdseed that they can steal from my \nfeeders. Erma and I average about 40 pounds of bird food a week that we \nput in our bird feeders.\n  The tomato plants--aha, my tomato plants, great farmer that I am--I, \nevery year, put out a half-dozen tomato plants. This year was a \nterrible year for tomatoes. The tomato plants that I cultivate in my \nbackyard are straining under their last load of ruby jewels. But the \njewels have been so slow this year to become ruby-colored. They remain \ngreen. And, of course, Mr. President, you might understand the greed \nwith which I approach those succulent fruits from the tomato plant. But \nthey have suffered this year not only from the heat, but also from the \ndrought, and then from the recent heavy rains.\n  I am a fortunate farmer. My little crop is grown for pleasure, in the \nmain. I try to furnish my own table and that of any of the \ngrandchildren who happen to come by. My little crop is grown for \npleasure. My clay pots have not been cracked by this summer's record \ndrought, nor flooded by Hurricane Floyd. Many farmers upon whose labors \nmy winter table depends have not been so fortunate, of course. Crops \nand livestock throughout the Nation have been buffeted by rather \nexceptional weather conditions this year, and particularly in the \neastern part of the United States, from Tennessee to Vermont.\n  Come November, farmers are likely to be saying prayers--and I should \nthink they probably have already been saying prayers--prayers of relief \nbecause, indeed, there were some rains still left in the heavens.\n  In our conference committees, Senators are working to provide \nassistance to our family farmers, so that they might be able to recover \npartially, at least, from this disastrous year and return to oversee \nthe plowing and the calving, the planting and the lambing, the pruning \nand the blossoming once again, rather than giving up on their most \nhonorable and arduous careers.\n  I have no doubt that the distinguished Senator who presides over the \nSenate this afternoon with a degree of dignity and skill, that is so \nrare as a day in June, knows what I am talking about because he comes \nfrom Wyoming and there are farmers there and farms. He knows when I \ntalk about calving, lambing, pruning, planting, and plowing, these are \nnot strange, alien words to him.\n  I hope that we will succeed in our efforts here in the Senate and \nspeed up this relief to our farmers. It is much needed, and it should \nbe on its way without delay. Those people are suffering.\n  The march of the seasons also brings us nearer to the close of the \nyear. This year, that event has a special import. We have just begun--I \nbelieve it was yesterday--on the 100-day countdown to a calendar change \nthat has spawned many nicknames, Y2K being one of the most common in \nthe United States.\n  The concern over computer glitches caused by the date change \ncertainly warrants our attention and corrective action. But the hype \nover Y2K and its alias, the ``millennium bug,'' has spawned a misguided \nperception regarding the true beginning of the third millennium since \nthe birth of our Lord. It is a small but irritating example of sloppy, \ncareless media reporting and advertising that reject the role of \ninformer and educator in favor of following the popular trend. This \ntrend might be termed ``the odometer theory,'' in which the physical \nact of watching all the nines roll over to zeros on a car's odometer \nbecomes a symbolic ritual unrelated to how well the car is or is not \nrunning. Watching 1999--1-9-9-9--roll over to 2-0-0-0 may be a rare \nevent that warrants a new year's party, but it does not truly signify \nanything except a new year.\n  To be formal, accurate, and correct, we must not confuse, as so many \nare presently confusing, January 1, 2000, with the beginning of the new \nmillennium, which it is not. January 1, 2000, does not begin the new \nmillennium, unless we wish history to say that the second millennium \ncontained only 999 years.\n  When the Christian calendar, observed in the United States and, \nindeed, in most of the world, was established in the 6th century by the \nScythian monk, chronologist, and scholar Dionysius Exiguus, died A.D. \n556, he began his calendar with January 1, year 1. Thus, the third \nmillennium will begin on January 1, 2001, not 2000. Not 2-0-0-0. So \nforget it. The coming year of 2000 is not the beginning of the next \nmillennium. It is only the end of the current millennium. And this \ncoming January is not the beginning of the 21st century. The year 2000 \nmerely closes out the 20th century. Otherwise, we lose a year somewhere \nalong the line--a good old fiddle tune. Somewhere along the line, we \nare going to throw away a year.\n  This may be the new math, but according to the old math, there are \n100 years in every century for it to be a complete century, and there \nare 1,000 years in every millennium to complete a millennium. So let's \nbe more accurate.\n  We may party, we may think, we may say the millennium begins next \nyear. So on December 31 of this year, when the clock strikes 12 \nmidnight, there are those who may wish to bring out the champagne and \nsay: Ah, this is the new millennium!\n  It is not. We may party like it is, this December, but I caution \neveryone against living it up as if the world were going to end or you \nmay face a very embarrassing morning after.\n  I thank you, Mr. President, for allowing me a few minutes to set the \nrecord straight. There it is. Unless the new math says that 999 years \nconstitute a millennium, and that 99 years constitute a century, unless \nthat is a given, we have to wait another year before the beginning of \nthe third millennium.\n  Let's set the record straight on that score. It may seem like a small \nthing, just a little thing, the cranky ranting of a cranky older \nfellow. The Bible says ``the little foxes that spoil the vines.'' I am \ntalking about one of those little foxes.\n  I am confident that others share my desire for accuracy, and my \nsuspicion that reporters and commentators and public figures who fail \non a fact so readily checked may be sloppy with other facts as well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S11454]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/24/senate-section/article/S11452-5", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11452-S11454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE CLOSE OF THE YEAR\n\n  Mr. BYRD.
