Mr. President, I rise today to support the Foster \nCare Independence Act. I am a cosponsor of the foster care bill that \nwas originally introduced in the Senate by our colleague, the late \nSenator John Chafee. Mr. President, this bill is an enormously \nimportant piece of legislation. It provides the means for States to \nsupport some of our most vulnerable children--teens who are facing the \ntenuous position of being dropped from foster care support for the \nsimple reason that they are turning 18.\n  For many young people, the transition to adulthood is an exciting \ntime of newfound independence. These young people navigate this \nchallenging time with the help and support of their parents and family, \nsecure in the knowledge that a ``safety net'' awaits them at home.\n  This momentous transition can be much more daunting, however, for the \n20,000 foster children who make the difficult shift from foster care to \nindependence and adulthood. Research has shown that these children--who \naverage four homes in the final 7 years of their foster care--face many \nchallenges when their benefits end and they are left on their own at \nthe age of 18.\n  Today, there are more than 500,000 children in foster care throughout \nthe United States--young people wrenched from the security of their \nhomes by death, abuse, or other tragedy. For these children, foster \nparents offer the only support they know, and the abrupt end of care \ncan make transition to adulthood all the more important. We are asking \nthese teens to move out of their foster care and immediately become \nproductive members of society--yet we forget that older foster kids \nface the same growing pains faced by teens in more stable homes. They \nare struggling with growing up, struggling with establishing their \nindependence, and struggling to mature and develop their personal \nidentity. But this struggle is made exponentially more difficult when \nthe teens must also face the struggle of housing, poverty, and \nunemployment.\n  In 1986, Congress created the Independent Living Program to address \nthe transitional needs of foster children as they reach the age when \nthey are asked to live independently. Studies of teens who are forced \nto abruptly leave foster care have found that they have a significantly \nhigher-than-normal rate of school dropouts, out-of-wedlock births, \nhomelessness, health and mental health problems, poverty, and \nunemployment. One 1998 study of former foster care youth by researchers \nat the University of Wisconsin-Madison found that more than 40 percent \nof interviewed youth had been homeless, incarcerated, or had received \npublic assistance since leaving State care. This same study found that \nduring the 12- to 18-month period after leaving care, 44 percent of \nformer care youths had difficulty obtaining medical care due to a lack \nof medical insurance and the high cost of care.\n  These foster children deserve a safe, stable, and nurturing \nenvironment in order for them to become productive, self-sufficient \nmembers of society. The Foster Care Independence Act will expand \nIndependent Living Program services to provide this support for foster \nchildren who are 18 to 21 years old and are still learning valuable \nlife skills. This bill will enable teens between the ages of 18 and 21 \nto successfully shift from foster families into independent adulthood. \nThis bill will help teens during this important transition by doubling \nIndependent Living Program funding and expanding access to Medicaid \nhealth care and mental health services through their 21st birthday.\n  Foster children frequently lack a sense of permanency and the skills \nthat are essential to becoming self-reliant and productive adults. \nThrough State-administered Independent Living Programs, foster children \nwill be able to obtain mentoring and personal support. The expanded \nprogram will assist older foster care adolescents in obtaining a high \nschool diploma and/or secondary education; career exploration; and \npreventative health services. They may also use this program to develop \nvital daily living skills such as budgeting, locating and maintaining \nhousing, and financial planning.\n  We expect much of our youth because they are the future of our \nNation. In turn, we must be willing to give them the support they need \nto learn, grow, and transition to productive and stable adult lives. \nThe Foster Care Independence Act provides these crucial services for \nAmerica's older foster children. As Congress works to conclude the \nfirst session of the 106th Congress, it is essential that the Senate \necho the broad, bipartisan support given to this bill by the U.S. House \nof Representatives--which recently passed a companion bill by a vote of \n380-67--and give these older foster children the stability they \ndeserve.\n  Mr. President, we have all heard the old adage ``an ounce of \nprevention is worth a pound a cure.'' Surely this rings true for \nhelping our older foster children in their transition to adulthood. I \ncan think of no better tribute to Senator Chafee, in tribute to his \nmemory and to his life's work as an advocate of America's children, to \nname this bill in honor of him. And for this reason I rise today in \nsupport of the bill and I ask my colleagues to vote for this \ntremendously important piece of legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/12/03/senate-section/article/S15227-3", "month": "12", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15227-S15228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     CONTINUED REPORTING OF INTERCEPTED WIRE, ORAL, AND ELECTRONIC \n                           COMMUNICATIONS ACT\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is \ntoday considering H.R. 3111 to exempt from automatic elimination and \nsunset certain reports submitted to Congress that are useful and \nhelpful in informing the\n\n[[Page S15228]]\n\nCongress and the public about the activities of federal agencies in the \nenforcement of federal law. Senator Hatch and I offer as an amendment \nto H.R. 3111 the text of a bill, S. 1769, which I introduced with \nChairman Hatch on October 22, 1999 and which passed the Senate on \nNovember 5, 1999. This amendment will continue and enhance the current \nreporting requirements for the Administrative Office of the Courts and \nthe Attorney General on the eavesdropping and surveillance activities \nof our federal and state law enforcement agencies.\n  For many years, the Administrative Office (AO) of the Courts has \ncomplied with the statutory requirement, in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2519(3), to \nreport to Congress annually the number and nature of federal and state \napplications for orders authorizing or approving the interception of \nwire, oral or electronic communications. By letter dated September 3, \n1999, the AO advised that it would no longer submit this report because \n``as of December 21, 1999, the report will no longer be required \npursuant to the Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995.'' I \ncommend the AO for alerting Congress that their responsibility for the \nwiretap reports would lapse at the end of this year, and for doing so \nin time for Congress to take action.\n  The AO has done an excellent job of preparing the wiretap reports. We \nneed to continue the AO's objective work in a consistent manner. If \nanother agency took over this important task at this juncture and the \nnumbers came out in a different format, it would immediately generate \nquestions and concerns over the legitimacy and accuracy of the contents \nof that report.\n  In addition, it would create difficulties in comparing statistics \nfrom prior years going back to 1969 and complicate the job of \ncongressional oversight. Furthermore, transferring this reporting duty \nto another agency might create delays in issuance of the report since \nno other agency has the methodology in place. Finally, federal, state \nand local agencies are well accustomed to the reporting methodology \ndeveloped by the AO. Notifying all these agencies that the reporting \nstandards and agency have changed would inevitably create more \nconfusion and more expense as law enforcement agencies across the \ncountry are forced to learn a new system and develop a liaison with a \nnew agency.\n  The system in place now has worked well and we should avoid any \ndisruptions. We know how quickly law enforcement may be subjected to \ncriticism over their use of these surreptitious surveillance tools and \nwe should avoid aggravating these sensitivities by changing the \nreporting agency and methodology on little to no notice. I appreciate, \nhowever, the AO's interest in transferring the wiretap reporting \nrequirement to another entity. Any such transfer must be accomplished \nwith a minimum of disruption to the collection and reporting of \ninformation and  with complete assurances that any new entity is able \nto fulfill this important job as capably as the AO has done.\n\n  The amendment would update the reporting requirements currently in \nplace with one additional reporting requirement. Specifically, the \namendment would require the wiretap reports prepared beginning in \ncalendar year 2000 to include information on the number of orders in \nwhich encryption was encountered and whether such encryption prevented \nlaw enforcement from obtaining the plain text of communications \nintercepted pursuant to such order.\n  Encryption technology is critical to protect sensitive computer and \nonline information. Yet, the same technology poses challenges to law \nenforcement when it is exploited by criminals to hide evidence or the \nfruits of criminal activities. A report by the U.S. Working Group on \nOrganized Crime titled, ``Encryption and Evolving Technologies: Tools \nof Organized Crime and Terrorism,'' released in 1997, collected \nanecdotal case studies on the use of encryption in furtherance of \ncriminal activities in order to estimate the future impact of \nencryption on law enforcement. The report noted the need for ``an \nongoing study of the affect of encryption and other information \ntechnologies on investigations, prosecutions, and intelligence \noperations.'' As part of this study, ``a database of case information \nfrom federal and local law enforcement and intelligence agencies should \nbe established and maintained.'' Adding a requirement that reports be \nfurnished on the number of occasions when encryption is encountered by \nlaw enforcement is a far more reliable basis than anecdotal evidence on \nwhich to assess law enforcement needs and make sensible policy in this \narea.\n  The final section of this amendment would codify the information that \nthe Attorney General already provides on pen register and trap and \ntrace device orders, and require further information on where such \norders are issued and the types of facilities--telephone, computer, \npager or other device--to which the order relates. Under the Electronic \nCommunications Privacy Act (``ECPA'') of 1986, P.L. 99-508, codified at \n18 U.S.C. 3126, the Attorney General of the United States is required \nto report annually to the Congress on the number of pen register orders \nand orders for trap and trace devices applied for by law enforcement \nagencies of the Department of Justice. As the original sponsor of ECPA, \nI believed that adequate oversight of the surveillance activities of \nfederal law enforcement could only be accomplished with reporting \nrequirements such as the one included in this law.\n  The reports furnished by the Attorney General on an annual basis \ncompile information from five components of the Department of Justice: \nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the United \nStates Marshals Service and the Office of the Inspector General. The \nreport contains information on the number of original and extension \norders made to the courts for authorization to use both pen register \nand trap and trace devices, information concerning the number of \ninvestigations involved, the offenses on which the applications were \npredicted and the number of people whose telephone facilities were \naffected.\n  These specific categories of information are useful, and the \namendment would direct the Attorney General to continue providing these \nspecific categories of information. In addition, the amendment would \ndirect the Attorney General to include information on the identity, \nincluding the district, of the agency making the application and the \nperson authorizing the order. In this way, the Congress and the public \nwill be informed of those jurisdictions using this surveillance \ntechnique--information which is currently not included in the Attorney \nGeneral's annual reports.\n  The requirement for preparation of the wiretap reports will soon \nlapse so I am delighted to see the Senate take prompt action on this \nlegislation to continue the requirement for submission of the wiretap \nreports and to update the reporting requirements for both the wiretap \nreports submitted by the AO and the pen register and trap and trace \nreports submitted by the Attorney General.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/12/03/senate-section/article/S15228-1", "month": "12", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15228-S15229]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n DIGITAL THEFT DETERRENCE AND COPYRIGHT DAMAGES IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1999\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate is today passing an \nimportant bill, H.R. 3456, which is the Hatch-Leahy-Schumer ``Digital \nTheft Deterrence and Copyright Damages Improvement Act of 1999.'' This \nlegislation should help our copyright industries, which in turn helps \nboth those who are employed in those industries and those who enjoy the \nwealth of consumer products, including books, magazines, movies, and \ncomputer software, that makes the vibrant culture of this country the \nenvy of the world.\n  This legislation has already traveled an unnecessarily bumpy road to \nget to this stage of final passage, and it should be sent promptly to \nthe President's desk.\n  On July 1, 1999, the Senate passed four intellectual property bills, \nwhich Senator Hatch and I had joined in introducing and which the \nJudiciary Committee had unanimously reported. Each of these bills (S. \n1257, the text of which is considered today as H.R. 3456; S. 1258, the \n``Patent Fee Integrity and Innovation Protection Act''; S. 1259, the \n``Trademark Amendments Act''; and S. 1260, the ``Copyright Act \nTechnical Corrections Act'') make important improvements to our \nintellectual\n\n[[Page S15229]]\n\nproperty laws, and I congratulate Senator Hatch for his leadership in \nmoving these bills promptly through the Committee and the Senate.\n  Three of those four bills then passed the House without amendment and \nwere signed by the President on August 5, 1999. The House sent back to \nthe Senate S. 1257, the ``Digital Theft Deterrence and Copyright \nDamages Improvement Act,'' with two modifications which I will describe \nbelow. Working with Senator Hatch and our colleagues in the House, we \nagreed upon additional revisions in the bill, which was then introduced \nas H.R. 3456 and passed by the House yesterday in time for Senate \nconsideration before the end of this congressional session.\n  I have long been concerned about reducing the levels of software \npiracy in this country and around the world. The theft of digital \ncopyrighted works and, in particular, of software, results in lost jobs \nto American workers, lost taxes to Federal and State governments, and \nlost revenue to American companies. A recent report released by the \nBusiness Software Alliance estimates that worldwide theft of \ncopyrighted software in 1998 amounted to nearly $11 billion. According \nto the report, if this ``pirated software has instead been legally \npurchased, the industry would have been able to employ 32,700 more \npeople. In 2008, if software piracy remains at its current rate, 52,700 \njobs will be lost in the core software industry.'' This theft also \nreflects losses of $991 million in tax revenue in the United States.\n  These statistics about the harm done to our economy by the theft of \ncopyrighted software alone, prompted me to introduce the ``Criminal \nCopyright Improvement Act'' in both the 104th and 105th Congresses, and \nto work for passage of this legislation, which was finally enacted as \nthe ``No Electronic Theft Act of 1997,'' Pub. L. 105-147. The current \nrates of software piracy show that we need to do better to combat this \ntheft, both with enforcement of our current copyright laws and with \nstrengthened copyright laws to deter potential infringes.\n\n  The Hatch-Leahy-Schumer ``Digital Theft Deterrence and Copyright \nDamages Improvement Act'' would help provide additional deterrence by \namending the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. Sec. 504(c), to increase the \namounts of statutory damages recoverable for copyright infringements. \nThese amounts were last increased in 1988 when the United States \nacceded to the Berne Convention. Specifically, the bill would increase \nthe cap on statutory damages by 50 percent, raising the minimum from \n$500 to $750 and raising the maximum from $20,000 to $30,000. In \naddition, the bill would raise from $100,000 to $150,000 the amount of \nstatutory damages for willful infringements.\n  Courts determining the amount of statutory damages in any given case \nwould have discretion to impose damages within these statutory ranges \nat just and appropriate levels, depending on the harm caused, ill-\ngotten profits obtained and the gravity of the offense. The bill \npreserves provisions of the current law allowing the court to reduce \nthe award of statutory damages to as little as $200 in cases of \ninnocent infringement and requiring the court to remit damages in \ncertain cases involving nonprofit educational institutions, libraries, \narchives, or public broadcasting entities.\n  Finally, the bill provides authority for the Sentencing Commission \nexpeditiously to fulfill its responsibilities under the ``No Electronic \nTheft Act,'' which directed the Commission to ensure that the \nguidelines provide for consideration of the retail value and quantity \nof the items with respect to which the intellectual property offense \nwas committed. Since the time that this law became effective, the \nSentencing Commission has not had a full slate of Commissioners \nserving. In fact, we have had no Commissioners since October, 1998. \nThis situation was corrected on November 10th with the confirmation of \nseven new Commissioners.\n  As I noted, the House amended the version of S. 1257 that the Senate \npassed in July in two ways. First, the original House version of this \nlegislation, H.R. 1761, contained a new proposed enhanced penalty for \ninfringers who engage in a repeated pattern of infringement, but \nwithout any scienter requirement. I shared the concerns raised by the \nCopyright Office that this provision, absent a willfulness scienter \nrequirement, would permit imposition of the enhanced penalty even \nagainst person who negligently, albeit repeatedly, engaged in acts of \ninfringement. Consequently, the Hatch-Leahy-Schumer bill, S. 1257, that \nwe sent to the House in July avoided casting such a wide net, which \ncould chill legitimate fair uses of copyrighted works. Instead, the \nbill we sent to the House would have created a new tier of statutory \ndamages allowing a court to award damages in the amount of $250,000 per \ninfringed work where the infringement is part of a willful and repeated \npattern or practice of infringement. The entire ``pattern and \npractice'' provision, which originated in the House, was removed from \nthe version of S. 1257 sent back to the Senate.\n  Second, the original House version of this legislation provided a \ndirection to the Sentencing Commission to amend the guidelines to \nprovide an enhancement based upon the retail price of the legitimate \nitems that are infringed and the quantity of the infringing items. I \nwas concerned that this direction would require the Commission and, \nultimately, sentencing judges to treat similarly a wide variety of \ninfringement crimes, no matter the type and magnitude of harm. This was \na problem we avoided in the carefully crafted Sentencing Commission \ndirective originally passed as part of the ``No Electronic Theft Act.'' \nConsequently, the version of S. 1257 passed by the Senate in July did \nnot include the directive to the Sentencing Commission. Nevertheless, \nthe House returned S. 1257 to the Senate with the same problematic \ndirective to the Sentencing Commission.\n\n  I appreciate that my House colleagues and interested stakeholders \nhave worked over the past months to address my concerns over the \nbreadth of the proposed directive to the Sentencing Commission, and to \nfind a better definition of the categories of cases in which it would \nbe appropriate to compute the applicable sentencing guideline based \nupon the retail value of the infringed upon item. A better solution \nthan the one contained in the ``No Electronic Theft Act'' remains \nelusive, however.\n  For example, one recent proposal sought to add to S. 1257 a direction \nto the Sentencing Commission to enhance the guideline offense level for \ncopyright and trademark infringements based upon the retail price of \nthe legitimate products multiplied by the quantity of the infringing \nproducts, except where ``the infringing products are substantially \ninferior to the infringed upon products and there is substantial price \ndisparity between the legitimate products and the infringing \nproducts.'' This proposed direction appears to be under-inclusive since \nit would not allow a guideline enhancement in cases where fake goods \nare passed off as the real item to unsuspecting consumers, even though \nthis is clearly a situation in which the Commission may decide to \nprovide an enhancement.\n  In view of the fact that the full Sentencing Commission has not had \nan opportunity for the past two years to consider and implement the \noriginal direction in the ``No Electronic Theft Act,'' passing a new \nand flawed directive appears to be both unnecessary and unwise. This is \nparticularly the case since the new Commissioners have already \nindicated a willingness to consider this issue promptly. In response to \nquestions posed at their confirmation hearings, each of the nominated \nSentencing Commissioners indicated that they would make this issue a \npriority. For example, Judge William Sessions of the District of \nVermont specifically noted that:\n\n       If confirmed, our first task must be to address Congress' \n     longstanding directives, including implementation of the \n     guidelines pursuant to the NET Act. Congress directed the \n     Sentencing Commission to fashion guidelines under the NET Act \n     that are sufficiently severe to deter such criminal activity. \n     I personally favor addressing penalties under this statute \n     expeditiously.\n\n  I fully concur in the judgment of Chairman Hatch that the Sentencing \nCommission directive provision added by the House should be stricken. \nThe House addressed these concerns by doing just that in the new \nversion of the bill, H.R. 3456, which was introduced and passed by the \nHouse yesterday in time for Senate consideration before the end of this \nsession.\n  This bill represents an improvement in current copyright law, and I \ncommend its final passage.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/12/03/senate-section/article/S15230-1", "month": "12", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S15230]]\n                         ZACHARY FISHER TRIBUTE\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I come before my colleagues today \nto pay tribute to a great American and dear friend, Mr. Zachary Fisher. \nZach led an extraordinary life that included service to his fellow man \nand to our country. He was a major philanthropic benefactor for the men \nand women of the United States Armed Forces. His generosity was shared \nwith numerous non-profit organizations and foundations including causes \nsuch as Alzheimer's Disease, military retiree housing, and educational \nbenefits for our men and women in uniform.\n  When the United States entered World War II in 1941, Zach was \nineligible to serve in the armed forces due to a serious knee injury \nsustained in a construction accident. ``I could have cried,'' he said, \nrecalling the day he was told he did not pass the Marine Corps \nphysical. ``I wanted to go defend my country.''\n  Nevertheless, determined to do his part, he aided the U.S. Army Corps \nof Engineers in building coastal fortifications at home. Following the \nwar, Zach, along with his brothers, earned an international reputation \nas a leader in the construction industry. Zach spent the rest of his \nlife doing good deeds for his country, turning the wealth he earned as \na developer into good will for the men and women of the armed services.\n  In 1978, Zach founded the Intrepid Museum Foundation to save the \nhistoric and battle-scarred aircraft carrier Intrepid. Through his \nefforts the vessel became the home of the Intrepid Sea Air Space \nMuseum, which opened in New York City in 1982. Zach went on to \ncontribute more than $25 million for the establishment and operation of \nthe Museum, a tribute to the thousands of military men and women who \nhave served and continue to serve our country.\n  In addition to founding the Intrepid Museum, Zach and his wife \nElizabeth also formed the Fisher Armed Services Foundation to provide \ncontributions to families who survive the death of a loved one in the \narmed service. Since then, the Foundation has supported hundreds of \nfamilies of military personnel.\n  The Foundation also provides scholarship funds to active duty and \nformer service members as well as their families. Since 1987, hundreds \nof students have received significant scholarships to further their \neducation. In 1990, the Fishers began the Fisher House Program, \ndedicating more than $15 million to the construction of housing for \nfamilies of hospitalized military personnel. The houses are designed to \nprovide all the comforts of home and allow families to support one \nanother through their difficult times.\n  The Presidential Medal of Freedom Award, the highest honor that can \nbe awarded a United States citizen, was presented to Zachary Fisher by \nPresident Clinton in 1998. Fisher was awarded the Medal for his \nsteadfast and generous support of the U.S. military. His support of the \nmilitary was also recognized this year as legislation, which I had the \nhonor of sponsoring in the Senate designating Zachary Fisher as an \nhonorary veteran of the United States Armed Forces. Zach was only the \nsecond person ever to receive such a designation. In addition, Zach was \nalso awarded the Congressional Medal of Freedom.\n  Sadly, Zach lost his long battle with cancer on June 4, 1999. Zach \nwas truly the friend of the everyday soldier. He will be dearly missed \nand remembered for his selfless devotion to United States service \nmembers and their families. Zachary Fisher was a great man who leaves \nbehind a legacy that will continue to better the lives of American men \nand women for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/12/03/senate-section/article/S15230-2", "month": "12", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15230-S15231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        GEORGIA BOARD OF REGENTS\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise before you today to \nrecognize the outstanding achievements and hard work of the Georgia \nBoard of Regents. This dedicated group of men and women has committed \nitself to improving higher education in the state of Georgia and I am \nproud of their accomplishments. As John F. Kennedy said, ``Our progress \nas a nation can be no swifter than our progress in education.''\n  Over the past five years, the Regents have developed a commitment to \nbring the Georgia higher education system into the new millennium \nthrough strategic planning and sweeping vision. In October of 1994, \njust as Dr. Stephen Porch was officially inaugurated as the University \nSystem's ninth Chancellor, the Board adopted the first step of a new \nprogram, ``Access to Academic Excellence for the New Millennium.'' The \nBoard called for Georgia's public colleges and universities to be \nrecognized for first-rate education, leading edge research and \ncommitted public service. The Board's new statement took into account \ninput from various student groups, University and Regent presidents, \nand leaders in the education community.\n  Later that same year, the Regents adopted a new set of guiding \nprinciples to serve as the foundation for future policy making and \nmodified the affiliated graduate degree structure. This cleared the way \nfor institutions throughout the state to offer graduate programs \nautonomously, collectively, or under shared authority.\n  In March of 1995, Chancellor Porch introduced another new policy \ndirection to address the need for ``co-reform'' of public education in \nthe state. This reform was an effort to recognize that all sectors of \neducation are fundamentally linked and that improvement in one sector \nrequires a comprehensive effort of all sectors. Governor Miller's \nsupport of this initiative became a critical element in its success and \nhe appointed a statewide Council to implement the directive.\n  Throughout 1995, the Board of Regents continued to see successes in \nits effort to improve the delivery of education throughout Georgia. In \nJune, the Board introduced a new admissions policy with the goal of \nbreaking the cycle of low admissions expectations and inadequate \ncollege preparation. The new admissions policy aimed to make such \nchanges in two ways: fostering more effective preparation of students \nbefore they are accepted for admission; and broadening the admissions \nevaluation process to look beyond single quantitative measures such as \nstandardized test scores.\n  In 1996, the Board approved the framework for a new core curriculum, \njust eight months after the first meeting of the Advisory Committee \nmeeting. The committee was charged with redesigning the original core \ncurriculum--a redesign that focused on a multidisciplinary effort that \nmaximizes the resources of a particular institution.\n  All of these efforts came together in December of 1997 when the Board \ngave final approval on the University System's new admissions policy. \nThis approval included policy on admissions for students without a high \nschool diploma and outlines specific courses that fulfill the College \nPreparatory Curriculum requirements.\n\n  In August of 1998, Chancellor Porch began a tour of all 34 System \ninstitutions. He travelled to update faculty, staff, students and \nelected officials as well as local communities on the progress the \nUniversity System had made over the past four years, and the work that \nremains to be done to create a more educated Georgia.\n  By this fall, the members of the Georgia Board of Regents saw the \nfruits of their labor. SAT scores of students entering the University \nSystem were up, and a survey of state business leaders showed their \nsatisfaction with the quality of the University had increased from two \nyears prior. Plans to increase access to technology were drafted, and \nan effort to be even more responsive to the educational, economic and \nfiscal needs of the state was committed. As Ben Franklin once said, \n``An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest.'' How true \nthat is.\n  I once heard Marian Wright Edelman of the Children's Defense Fund say \nthat ``service is the rent each of us pays for living.''
