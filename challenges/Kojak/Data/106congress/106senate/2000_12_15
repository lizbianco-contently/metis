Among them in this long line of distinguished \nindividuals will be Charles S. Robb.N O T I C E\n\nEffective January 1, 2001, the subscription price of the \nCongressional Record will be $393 per year or $197 for six months. \nIndividual issues may be purchased for $4.00 per copy.

This price increase is necessary based \nupon the cost of printing and distribution.                          \n                                    Michael F. DiMario, Public \nPrinter\n\n[[Page S11808]]\n\n\n  We started our careers together when he served in the Marine Corps. \nThat was back during the period of Vietnam. I was then serving--for \nover 5 years--as Under Secretary and Secretary of the Navy. I was \nprivileged, of course, to serve with the Presiding Officer's father, \nSenator Chafee. At the time he was Secretary of the Navy; I served as \nhis Under Secretary.\n  Senator Robb had served his tour in Vietnam in 1961 through 1970 and \nthen he remained in the Marine Corps Reserves from 1970 to 1991. I was \nprivileged to wear the marine green during the Korean conflict and \nserved for a very brief period in the Marines. However, I assure \nMembers that the career of Senator Robb was far more distinguished than \nthe career of the senior Senator, myself. I am pleased to acknowledge \nthat. He then went on to serve as Lieutenant Governor from 1977 to \n1981, and Governor from 1982 to 1986.\n  His two terms in the Senate began in 1988. He has been a Member of \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee, a committee which I have been \nprivileged to chair since 1993. Throughout this distinguished record, \nit has been my good fortune to share a very warm friendship with the \nSenator and with his lovely wife and his children. We all know when we \ntake the oath of office as U.S. Senator, the family plays the key role. \nI could not count the number of times I have been in matters relating \nto the Senate, trips relating to the Senate, our frequent \njoint appearances throughout the Commonwealth of Virginia these many \nyears, beginning back when he was Lieutenant Governor, and there was \nMrs. Robb, a daughter of a most distinguished American public servant, \nformer President Lyndon Johnson and a former Member of the Senate.\n\n  So I wish him well. It was a difficult task in this past election. He \nrespects both of us as marines. We have duties to perform. I hope the \nRecord reflects that I performed that responsibility I felt very \nsincerely was necessary, but I did it in a spirit that preserved our \nfriendship.\n  When I think back on his work, I think of the many times Senator Robb \ncame from that side of the aisle to this side of the aisle to join \nothers in working on pieces of legislation which he felt, and indeed \nothers felt, were in the best interests of this country. He was a \nbridgebuilder. He served that purpose on the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee. He stood by my side as chairman these past 2 years, \nsupported me, I think, almost in every instance. And he had very keen \ninsight into the life of the men and women of the Armed Forces who \nserve today. He worked very hard on their behalf.\n  I hope history will reflect that his contributions directly benefited \nthose who serve today and who will serve tomorrow. He also was quite \nactive in working with me on the retirement benefits, particularly the \nmedical benefits, for those who have served in years past.\n  Virginia is privileged to have one of the greatest shipyards--we like \nto think the greatest shipyard--in America. We have the naval shipyard \nas well as private shipyards. In those yards are built some of the \nfinest ships that sail the seven seas today on behalf of our Navy. \nSenator Robb was always there to work with not only me but a strong \nbipartisan Virginia congressional delegation, Senate and House, on \nmatters of national defense since our State is privileged to be \npreeminent in the field of national defense, having a number of the \nmajor bases and a number of men and women in uniform who are stationed \nthere. Of course, the Pentagon is the core of this complex throughout \nVirginia. But there was Senator Robb on all occasions, and particularly \nas it related to our naval shipbuilding program.\n\n  I am joined on the floor today by two very able members of my staff. \nAnn Loomis is the chief of our legislative staff; Susan Magill, with \nwhom I consulted early this morning in preparing these remarks, is my \nchief of staff. They would want it known that, through the years, the \nstaff working relationship between Senator Robb's office and my office \nwas always excellent. We looked upon our duties as serving the \nCommonwealth of Virginia and the people of that State; therefore, our \nstaffs did everything they could to prepare the two Senators to meet \nthat challenge and that responsibility.\n  He is a man of principle. I think that is unquestioned by those of us \nwho watched him. Indeed, at times we differed on very fundamental \npolicy issues, and that is reflected in our voting records. But he was \nalways a man of principle and he stood by those principles. As I \nlistened to him, my reaction sometimes bordered on disbelief because I \nso disagreed with him, but he stood by those principles no matter what \nthe cost to his professional career as a public servant. He stood by \nwhat he believed.\n  So I say to my good friend, I shall remember him in many ways but \nabove all for his friendship and his always senatorial courtesy. As we \nlaugh around here and joke: The title senior Senator and perhaps a \ndollar or so will get you a cup of coffee. But he never tried one-\nupmanship and he always addressed me as his senior in the Senate. I \nthank him. I wish him and his family well in their next career. I am \nconfident there are many challenges that await this distinguished \nAmerican public servant.\n  I note my distinguished friend from Pennsylvania is on the floor. I \nyield the floor at this time, and I thank the Chair for his indulgence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11808-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11808]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              SENATOR ROBB\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment \nabout the pending appropriations bill on Labor, Health and Human \nServices, and Education, which comes from the appropriations \nsubcommittee which I chair. There has been an extraordinarily rocky \nroad for this bill this year. I think it is very regrettable that on \nDecember 15 we are still debating that bill and the entire package is \nas yet unsettled, although hopefully it will be resolved before the end \nof the day. But there have been many days when we have been hopeful \nabout resolving matters before the end of the day and that has not \noccurred.\n  Without going into the background on prior years, it has been a very \ndifficult matter to get the bill on Labor, Health and Human Services, \nand Education to the President for signature and to resolve the \ncontroversies. This year, my ranking member on the subcommittee, \nSenator Tom Harkin, and I have worked as partners on this matter. When \nhe chaired the subcommittee, I was ranking, or when I have chaired the \nsubcommittee, he has been ranking. Both of us understand--and have for \na long time--that if you want to get something done in Washington, you \nhave to cross party lines. That is more true today than ever. It will \nbe even more true in the 107th Congress when we have a 50-50 split.\n  But we brought that bill to conclusion on the Senate vote on June 30 \nof this year, which tied the record going back to 1976. We completed a \nconference report on July 27, the last Thursday before we adjourned for \nthe Republican convention and the August recess. We did that with a lot \nof extra effort, hard work by our staffs led by Bettilou Taylor on my \nstaff, so we could get the bill to the President right after Labor Day. \nThere is no use sending it in August, but we were prepared to submit it \nto the President the day after Labor Day.\n  We had met the President's figure of $106 billion, which was a $10 \nbillion increase over the program authority from last year. We did that \nbecause the experience in the past had been that when we quarreled with \nthe President about the total figure, invariably there were add-ons at \nthe end when the issue\n\n[[Page S11809]]\n\nwent beyond September 30 into October or November.\n  Candidly, it was difficult to get the Republican caucus to agree to \n$106 billion in the Senate and in the House, but we did that. But in \npresenting the bill, the conference report, we had some priorities \nwhich were somewhat different from those of the President. We had, for \nexample, added $2.7 billion for the National Institutes of Health \nbecause we thought that was a very high priority item. We had also made \nsome changes on the $2.7 billion which the President had requested for \nschool construction and additional teachers, giving him that money but \nadding a provision that if the local boards of education wanted to use \nthe money for something else after fulfilling very stringent \nrequirements, that they could use it for local control.\n  When we sat down to negotiate with the White House, the President and \nthe Democrats in the House upped the ante and asked for an additional \n$6 billion. From my way of thinking, that was totally unacceptable \nbecause we had provided the $106 billion which the President had \ninitially requested. After all, it is the congressional prerogative to \nset the priorities on appropriations. That is spelled out in the \nConstitution. The President has to sign the bill but we have the lion's \nshare of responsibility, in my view, to establish the priorities.\n\n  Those negotiations degenerated--at least in my opinion--until there \nwas an inclination by some in the conference to pay $114 billion. I \nrefused to be a party to that amount of money because I had fought hard \nto raise the figure to $106 billion and I felt there would be no \ncredibility in what I would present as chairman of the subcommittee if \nI would be a will-o'-the-wisp and raise it to any figure to satisfy the \ndemands of the White House and the House Democrats. There was a \ntentative agreement of $114 billion and I declined to sign any \nconference report which reflected that figure.\n  Ultimately that arrangement broke down. Now we have come to the point \nwhere the negotiations have produced a figure of $108.9 billion, which \nis still more than the $106 billion we had originally projected, but in \nthe spirit of accommodation, trying to finish the business of the \nCongress, I am prepared to go along with that figure although very \nreluctantly.\n  There have been changes in the bill which I find totally \nunacceptable. The National Institutes of Health has had an increase of \n$2.7 billion over fiscal year 2000, which had been in all along, now \ncut by $200 million to $2.5 billion. I believe that the National \nInstitutes of Health is the crown jewel of the Federal Government. It \nmay be the only jewel of the Federal Government. We have added almost \n$9 billion to the funding on NIH in the last five cycles. The Senate, \nin one of the first years under my chairmanship, came in at the figure \nof a $950 million increase. The House would not go along. We \ncompromised out at $907 million. The next year we added $1 billion; the \nyear after, $2 billion; the year after that, $2.3 billion, which was \ncut a little on an across-the-board cut. This year we put in $2.7 \nbillion, now reduced to $2.5 billion. But we have a total of almost $9 \nbillion added in these last five cycles and they have made tremendous \nstrides on the most dreaded diseases--Parkinson's and Alzheimer's and \ncancer and heart ailments and the whole range.\n  It is my hope in the future that whoever chairs the subcommittee will \nhave better cooperation on all sides to present the bill to the \nPresident before the fiscal year ends. I think, had that been done, we \ncould have mustered a very strong position that our priorities were \nsuperior to what the President had in mind, and that if he were going \nto veto the bill, we ought not to be fearful of his veto but we ought \nto accept it as his view and then take the case to the American public. \nI think, had the bill been submitted to the President on September 5, \nwe would have won that fight. Or if we had not won it outright, we \nwould have compromised in terms so we wouldn't be here on December 15, \nstill arguing about this Labor-HHS-Education bill as the principal \nsource of contention.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Specter pertaining to the introduction of S. 3280 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I again thank my distinguished ranking \nmember, Senator Jay Rockefeller, who works collaboratively on veterans \naffairs matters and all members of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. It \nis a committee which has worked in a bipartisan way. It has a very \nexcellent staff, with staff director Bill Tuerk. I thank the staff for \ntheir assistance and commend to the public and the Congressional Record \nthe legislation which has been passed during the 106th Congress.\n  I know my time has expired, and I note the presence on the floor of a \ndistinguished Senator, Ms. Collins. I yield the floor. I was about to \nsay ``another distinguished Senator,'' but I modified that to ``a \ndistinguished Senator.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, before the Senator from Pennsylvania \nleaves the floor, if that is his intention, I thank him for the \nexceptional job he has done in ensuring that we do have funding \nincreases for critical programs such as those at the National \nInstitutes of Health.\n  I heard the Senator from Pennsylvania, the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, describe it as the crown jewel of the Federal Government, \nand I totally agree with his comments. He has also been an advocate for \nmore education funding, combined with more flexibility. I wish we had \nfollowed his advice earlier this year and sent the appropriations bill \ndown to the White House, completing his work in a very timely fashion \nback in July, I believe it was.\n  I commend the Senator for being an outstanding chairman. I am a great \nadmirer of his and appreciate all of his hard work.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I express my thanks to Senator Collins. \nWe work very closely together with a very distinguished group of \nSenators--Senator Jeffords, Senator Snowe, and who is the fifth member? \nYes, Senator Chafee, who is presiding.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the importance \nof the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program known as LIHEAP in \nhelping low-income Maine families cope with the high cost of our long \nMaine winters.\n  As Callie Parker from Little Deer Isle, Maine, so eloquently \ntestified before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee earlier this year, heating your home during a Maine winter is \na matter of life and death. When the cold reaches into the very marrow \nof one's bones, when a glass of water you left on a night stand freezes \nduring the night should your furnace go out, you simply cannot get by \nwithout heat.\n  Unfortunately, not everyone has enough money to buy the fuel \nnecessary to heat their home. Far too many Maine families have had to \nchoose whether to buy groceries or to pay their rent or mortgage or to \nkeep warm. These are choices that no one should be forced to make, but \nunless we increase funding for energy assistance now, these choices \nwill become increasingly common.\n  Winter has not even officially begun, although you would not know \nthat in the area of the country from which the Presiding Officer and I \ncome. The high price of fuel and cold temperatures have already driven \na record number of households in Maine to seek home heating assistance. \nAlready the Community Action Program agencies in Maine have identified \n28,000 households in need of LIHEAP funds to get through this winter. \nThat compares to only 10,000 applicants at this time last year; in \nother words, it has more than doubled the amount of households seeking \nthis kind of assistance. Another 19,000 families are waiting to be \nreviewed by the CAP agencies.\n\n[[Page S11810]]\n\n  The problem is, there is simply not sufficient money. As this chart \nshows, a Maine winter exacts a steep toll. Today, in Maine, a gallon of \nhome heating oil, on average, costs $1.56. Last year at this time, home \nheating oil in Maine went for $1.03 a gallon--and we thought that was \nvery high. That number is high because just two years ago the average \nprice of home heating oil in Maine was just 78 cents a gallon. In \nshort, home heating oil prices have increased by 100 percent in just \ntwo years. For the 75 percent of Mainers who rely on home heating oil \nto keep their homes warm, this is a steep price to pay indeed. Those \nheating their homes with natural gas also are facing difficulties. \nConsumer prices for natural gas have shot up over 50 percent compared \nto last year.\n  As the second column on this chart shows, last year Maine's CAP \nagencies distributed an average of $488 to each household. That was the \naverage LIHEAP benefit. Despite the rising costs of fuel, this year the \nMaine CAP agencies are able to distribute an average benefit of only \n$350.\n  So you see the situation we have, Mr. President, and see why it is \nsuch a problem. We have the price of home heating oil far higher than \nlast year, and more than double what it was two years ago. The high \ncost of fuel has put more strain on more families, and as a result many \nmore households need assistance. That has caused the average LIHEAP \nbenefit to be cut significantly.\n  What does this mean? When the price of oil is 50 percent higher than \nlast year, and the LIHEAP benefit is $138 less than last year, it means \nthat people are not able to buy very many gallons of oil to heat their \nhomes. Last year's LIHEAP benefit purchased 474 gallons of home heating \noil. This year's benefit will purchase less than half that amount--a \nmere 224 gallons of oil.\n  So we have the worst of all situations. We have the price of home \nheating oil at record highs; we have the benefit amount having to be \ncut to less than last year's; and the result is that low-income \nfamilies are able to purchase far less home heating oil.\n  And this year's winter is already shaping up to be colder than last \nyear's. Mainers will need more oil to keep warm this winter, not less. \nWhen the furnace remains silent no matter how far you turn the \nthermostat dial, we need to be there to put oil in the tank.\n  The bottom line is we need to provide more assistance to more \nfamilies.\n  The legislation before us today will provide an extra $300 million in \nLIHEAP assistance to be used this winter. And that is very helpful. It \nis almost a 30-percent increase above last year's funding level. I know \nhow hard Senator Specter and Senator Stevens have fought for this \nsignificant increase. I thank them for their efforts on behalf of the \nthousands of Maine residents who will benefit greatly from these much \nneeded funding increases. Yet it simply is not enough. With the price \nof fuel 50 percent higher this year than last, and with almost three \ntimes as many families in need of LIHEAP assistance this year compared \nto just 1 year ago, even a 30-percent increase will only go so far. It \nis certainly needed, and we are grateful for it, but we are still going \nto have a shortfall.\n  I am also concerned and disappointed that by placing the year 2002 \nfunding for LIHEAP on the chopping block, the Clinton administration \nlacked the foresight to realize the obvious: This is not our Nation's \nlast winter. There will be another winter next year; I can guarantee \nit. We must lay the groundwork now to allow the planning to occur that \nwill ensure that people stay warm next year, too.\n  By eliminating the ``advance appropriation'' for LIHEAP for the next \nfiscal year, this appropriations bill has not laid any of the necessary \ngroundwork for next year's winter. That will contribute to a supply \ncrunch next fall, I fear.\n  I call on the President and the congressional leadership to make \nLIHEAP a top priority, not only this year but next year as well. I am \npleased to see and applaud the language that was included in the \nmanagers' statement pledging to fund LIHEAP in the next fiscal year at \nthis year's level or at a greater level. I would have preferred to see \na commitment for advance funding, but I know the conferees will keep \nthe commitment they have made.\n  Finally, I pledge my personal efforts to ensure that low-income \nfamilies in Maine and throughout the Nation stay warm through our long \nwinters.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, seeing no one seeking recognition, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is informed we are in \na period of morning business with speakers not to exceed 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I do not see others seeking the floor.

Mr. President, during the past year there has been an \nextraordinary amount written and spoken in this country about the death \npenalty--actually more than I can recollect having seen before. We have \nlearned that the system of administering capital punishment is gravely \nflawed, and that scores of people have ended up on death row, often for \nmany years, even though they were completely innocent of the crime for \nwhich they were sentenced to death.\n  We have seen how the justice system has serious flaws at every stage, \nand especially if the accused is poor, as are most criminal defendants \nwho are sentenced to death. Lawyers defending people whose lives are at \nstake are often inexperienced or incompetent, and poorly paid. Two \nthirds of death penalty trials nationwide are marred by serious \nconstitutional errors, according to reviewing courts.\n  We have seen public support for the death penalty decrease \nsignificantly. It is still over 50 percent nationally, but it falls \nbelow 50 percent if the alternative is life in prison with no \nopportunity for parole.\n  We have seen Governor Ryan of Illinois appoint a commission of \nexperts, both supporters and opponents of capital punishment, to \ndetermine whether the death penalty can, under any circumstances, be \nadministered reliably so innocent people will never be executed. The \nfindings and recommendations of that commission will be important for \nthe entire country.\n  In Virginia, a State with many people on death row, the legislature \nrecently took note of the growing concerns surrounding capital \npunishment, and decided to review the administration of the death \npenalty in Virginia where there have been serious mistakes.\n  In October, the Virginia Governor pardoned Earl Washington, a \nmentally retarded farmhand, after new DNA tests cleared him of the rape \nand murder that once brought him within 9 days of execution.\n  Just this morning, the Washington Post reported that DNA tests had \ncleared another death row inmate--unfortunately, too late to be of any \nhelp. Before dying of cancer earlier this year, Frank Lee Smith spent \n14 years on Florida's death row for a rape and murder that it now \nappears he did not commit.\n  I have introduced legislation with Senators Gordon Smith, Susan \nCollins, and 12 other Senators, to address some of these most egregious \nflaws. I have spoken many times about our bill, the Innocence \nProtection Act, which we plan to pursue in the 107th Congress.\n  Our legislation addresses the horrendous problem of innocent people \nbeing condemned to death. But today I want to mention briefly a related \nissue which is illustrated by a case in Texas, the State which this \nyear has executed more people than any other State in the post-war era.\n  The Supreme Court stayed the execution of Johnny Paul Penry on \nNovember 16, 2000, less than four hours before he was scheduled to die \nby lethal injection in Texas. The Court has now scheduled the case for \nargument.\n\n[[Page S11811]]\n\n  Johnny Penry, who in 1979 raped and murdered a 22 year old woman, has \nbeen on death row for twenty years. He committed a terrible crime; \nthere has never been any doubt about that. But besides the crime \nitself, what makes Johnny Penry's case so disturbing is that he has an \nIQ of 56. What that means is that he has the intelligence of a 6-year \nold child.\n  Mr. President, 11 years ago the Supreme Court ruled that it is not \ncruel and unusual punishment to execute the mentally retarded. I \ndisagree with that decision. But more importantly, despite the Supreme \nCourt ruling, 13 States with capital punishment and the Federal \nGovernment have forbidden execution of the mentally retarded, and a \nclear majority of Americans oppose the practice.\n  The State Senator who in 1998 sponsored Nebraska's bill to prohibit \nexecution of the mentally retarded later said that it should not have \nbeen necessary because ``no civilized, mature society would ever \nentertain the possibility of executing anybody who was mentally \nretarded.''\n  Executing the mentally retarded is wrong; it is immoral. People with \nmental retardation have a diminished capacity to understand right from \nwrong. As Justice Brennan wrote:\n\n       The impairment of a mentally retarded offender's reasoning \n     ability, control over impulsive behavior, and moral \n     development . . . limits his or her culpability so that, \n     whatever other punishment might be appropriate, the ultimate \n     penalty of death is always and necessarily disproportionate \n     to his or her blameworthiness.\n\n  Proponents of the death penalty argue that it ``saves lives,'' but \nexecuting the mentally retarded cannot be justified on the grounds of \ndeterrence. Let me again quote Justice Brennan, writing in 1989:\n\n       The very factors that make it disproportionate and unjust \n     to execute the mentally retarded also make the death penalty \n     of the most minimal deterrent effect so far as retarded \n     potential offenders are concerned. Intellectual \n     impairments in logical reasoning, strategic thinking, and \n     foresight, the lack of the intellectual and developmental \n     predicates of an ability to anticipate consequences, and \n     impairment in the ability to control impulsivity, mean \n     that the possibility of receiving the death penalty will \n     not in the case of a mentally retarded person figure in \n     some careful assessment of different courses of action. In \n     these circumstances, the execution of mentally retarded \n     individuals is nothing more than the purposeless and \n     needless imposition of pain and suffering.\n\n  People with mental retardation are also more prone to make false \nconfessions simply to please their interrogators, and they are often \nunable to assist their lawyer in preparing a defense.\n  We saw this with Earl Washington, who had an IQ of 69. Arrested for \nbreaking into a neighbor's home during a drinking spree and hitting her \nwith a chair, Washington readily confessed to a series of unsolved \nmurders that he could not have committed.\n  Beyond all of this, executing the mentally retarded severely damages \nthe standing of the United States in the international community. The \nUnited Nations has long condemned this practice. Just last year, the \nU.N. Commission on Human Rights called on nations ``not to impose the \ndeath penalty on a person suffering from any form of mental disorder.'' \nWe should join the overwhelming majority of nations who do not execute \nthe mentally retarded.\n  Johnny Penry suffered relentless and severe physical and \npsychological abuse as a child, spends his time in prison coloring with \ncrayons and looking at comic books he cannot read, and still believes \nin Santa Claus. I remember reading that when they stayed his execution \nhe said, ``Does this mean I'm not allowed to have the special meal I \nwas supposed to have?''--The last meal of the condemned man. He could \nnot possibly have assisted meaningfully in his own defense.\n  No one can excuse Johnny Penry's crime, and no one suggests that he \nshould be set free. But the question is what is the appropriate \npunishment for a defendant who is mentally retarded.\n  Neither our Constitution nor our national conscience permits the \nexecution of a 6-year-old child for committing a heinous crime, and \nneither should we execute a person with the mental capacity of a 6-\nyear-old. It offends the very idea of justice.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, first I inquire, is there any limitation on \nthe length of time to speak?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senator from Virginia \nthat we are in a period for morning business with Senators to speak not \nto exceed 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ROBB. I do not believe I will exceed 5 minutes, but I ask \nunanimous consent to proceed for such time as I may use, consistent \nwith the order for morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBB.

Mr. President, I thought I would take this opportunity for \njust a very few minutes to say thank you. I will be leaving the Senate \nat the end of this Congress. I had assumed, as many of our colleagues \nhad, that this would be the last day of the session. That assumption is \nvery much in question at this point. I just left a conference with \nmembers of my caucus, and there are clearly some deeply held \nconvictions and passions that are still unresolved. It may be that we \nwill be here for hours or days. I hope that is not the case, but there \nfrequently are at this particular time in the session those who hold \nconvictions and beliefs so deeply that they do not believe under any \ncircumstance they should leave any stone unturned or any avenue \nunexplored to advance those convictions and beliefs.\n  While some of those issue are being resolved, I want to take a minute \nto say thank you, first of all, to the people of Virginia who were kind \nenough to honor me with 12 years of their representation in the Senate \nof the United States.\n  I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have given to me \nand my wife Lynda and members of our family an experience we will \ntreasure for the rest of our lives. The personal interaction with \ncolleagues has been a part of the Senate experience that I will always \nenjoy, remember, and revere. I express to colleagues again on both \nsides of the aisle how much I appreciate the many considerations they \nhave shown me.\n  I understand my senior colleague from Virginia took the floor while \nwe were in the caucus. I did not hear his words, but I appreciate his \ncooperation on many issues, and I appreciate his friendship. We have \nhad some differences; certainly, we have had some political \ndifferences; but the degree of cooperation between our offices has \nalways been good and strong when it came to working on behalf of our \nCommonwealth.\n  The Senate is, for many of us, like a family. That sentiment has been \nexpressed before. It is an extended family, and I say to all of those \nmembers of that extended family a very sincere thank you. I thank the \nfloor staff and the officers of the Senate for the cooperation that has \nbeen extended to me over the past 12 years.\n  I thank the Cloakroom staff from both sides, particularly my own \nCloakroom, who work so closely with us on a regular basis to make sure \nthe institution functions, and that we are here when necessary in order \nto conduct the nation's business.\n  I express my appreciation to all of those who make this institution \nwork. Some of them are visible, such as our friends of the Capitol \nPolice who are here around the clock in a position, as we learned to \nour regret and sorrow, to put their lives on the line to provide safety \nand security.\n  There are many other officers of the Senate and employees of the \nSenate who are not as visible to the public, but are just as crucial to \nthe operation of the Senate. The employees who work for the Architect \nof the Capitol who take care of many of the duties that are required to \nmake the institution run. We see and work with them on a daily basis. \nMany of them have extended courtesies and kindnesses to me over a long \nperiod of time that I will long remember.\n  There are the many often unheralded folks who help with the phones, \nwho operate the Capitol switchboard, who handle the maintenance, and \nwho work in the food service we do not see but\n\n[[Page S11812]]\n\nwho make it possible for all of us to do our jobs as effectively as \npossible. These people keep the institution functioning, like the \nmaintenance crews who make the repairs and changes that are frequently \nrequired and who always seem able to accommodate--all of their good \nwill is very much appreciated.\n  I thank the pages, too, who work and do all of the things they are \nrequired to do during the daytime and then get their studies done at \nnight. We frequently see them working on their studies at the same time \nthey are helping to make life a little easier for us.\n  I also express my appreciation to the committee staffs, the \nprofessional staffs who work with each of the committees and help me \nand all of you on a regular basis. We develop personal friendships with \nmany of these individuals whom we will long remember.\n  Finally, I want to say a very personal thank you to the members of my \nown staff. I have been extraordinarily well served by some very able \nprofessionals who have served their Commonwealth and their country in \nways that I will always appreciate and for which they can always be \nvery proud.\n  There have been many, and I am not going to attempt to list them all. \nIt occurred to me that maybe, because I have been so fortunate and so \nwell served, I should mention the names only of those who have been \nwith me continuously helping and assisting me my entire term in the \nSenate, serving with me over the last 12 years. Two of those \nprofessionals actually have been with me through my gubernatorial \nservice: Pat Mayer and Susan Albert, now Susan Albert Carr as of last \nweekend, have been with me for the full 12 years and then some. Matt \nMcGowan, Jim Connell, JoAnn Pulliam, Anne Geyer, Debbie Lawson-Goins, \nand Jim O'Quinn have all been kind enough to provide for me the kind of \nprofessional staff assistance that has made my job easier. We will \nremain friends. The members of my staff have helped make this an \nexperience I will cherish.\n  I have undoubtedly left out a number of individuals whom I want to \nthank and I have tried to thank.\n  I also thank the people who have made this a very good experience for \nmy wife Lynda, particularly the prayer groups. She has been associated \nwith several of those. I understand she gets to continue her membership \nin the prayer groups and the spouses group, even though I will become a \nformer Member and will leave these premises.\n  Mr. President, I say to all of my colleagues that they are a group of \nprincipled, compassionate, caring men and women, many of them friends. \nWe may have disagreements. Some of those are principled disagreements. \nIn fact, I just attended what may be the last Democratic conference \ncalled by our leader. I say once again, I heard members express in \npassionate terms their commitment to doing what they believe is in the \nbest interest of their State and the Nation, and I think that is \nsomething that may not always be apparent. Again, that occurs on both \nsides of the aisle. I am particularly grateful to many who have \ndemonstrated the courage to stand up and be counted when it was not \nalways politically popular.\n  Finally, I want to make a brief comment about the leadership. I thank \nthe majority leader for the courtesies he and the members of his staff \nhave extended to me.\n  I conclude with a special note of thanks to someone I consider an \nextraordinary leader, who is kind enough to be here for these couple of \nminutes, Tom Daschle, the current Democratic and minority leader who \nwill become on January 3 through January 20 the majority leader. As a \npoint of personal privilege, I look forward to that time.\n\n  He and the team that he has put together have been exceptional \nleaders. I see the distinguished whip Harry Reid on the floor, as well. \nThey have led by example. They have led by inclusion. And they have led \nby listening. They have been friends. They have been effective. They \nhave been leaders in the truest sense in that they have caused us to \nwant to work with them to make the institution run and to get the job \ndone.\n  So, Mr. President, to you, as a personal friend, and as a \nrepresentative of our colleagues, and to all of our friends who have \nbeen kind to me and have supported some of the things I have done over \nthe years, may I express my profound thanks.\n  I take leave of the Senate proud to have had the opportunity to serve \nin this great institution.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will use my leader time, if I may, at this time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11812-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11812-S11814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SENATOR CHARLES ROBB\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Robb on his \nremarks. I thank him very much for sharing them with all of us.\n  These past elections brought our caucus nine new members and we hope \nmany new opportunities to address America's priorities. But they also \nhanded us a great disappointment, the loss of our friend and colleague, \nChuck Robb.\n  I am appreciative of the opportunity that I had just now to listen to \nSenator Robb, maybe for the last time on this Senate floor. I had \nfeared he might leave without giving us a chance to thank him for his \nremarkable service to the Senate. It would have been like him to do so; \nhe is an enormously modest man.\n  In an editorial the day before the election, the Washington Post \nwrote:\n\n       Even in the final days of a nip-and-tuck campaign, Senator \n     Chuck Robb seems uncomfortable singing his own praises. While \n     some voters may find this quality refreshing, Senator Robb's \n     reluctance to tout his accomplishments hides them too \n     effectively in a tight race.\n\n  Chuck Robb's reluctance to promote himself--his commitment to sound \npolicies over sound bites--may have cost him reelection, but they have \nearned him the respect of his peers and this Nation.\n  In 12 years in this Senate--and for 8 years before that as Lieutenant \nGovernor and then Governor of Virginia--Chuck Robb rarely spoke about \nhimself. He has always been more comfortable speaking on behalf of \nothers--the people whose voices too often are not heard at all.\n\n  Today, on what we hope could be the last day of this Senate, I want \nto say just a few things about him that he will not say about himself, \njust to remind us what a good man--what a good man--with whom it has \nbeen our good fortune to work.\n  As we all recall, he was elected to the Senate in 1988, with the \nlargest vote total for any office in Virginia's history. It was the \nfirst time in 22 years that Virginia had not sent a Republican to the \nSenate.\n  He has spent his Senate career working for Virginia and for what he \ncalls the ``long-range, big picture, important issues'': national \nsecurity, a balanced budget, education, and civil rights--for all \nAmericans.\n  He is a member of the Finance Committee and the Joint Economic \nCommittee. He is the only Member of the Senate ever to serve \nsimultaneously on all three national security committees: Intelligence, \nArmed Services, and Foreign Relations.\n  He is a former member of the Budget and Commerce Committees, as well \nas the Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs, where he cochaired a task \nforce that declassified and released vast quantities of information on \nmissing U.S. service members.\n  Quietly, with little fanfare, he has provided a steady leadership \nthat has helped keep our Nation safe and move us forward.\n  He is a lifelong fiscal conservative.\n  In 1993, he voted for the deficit reduction plan that launched the \nstrongest economic recovery in our Nation's history. He remains an \nimportant part of the Senate's economic conscience, always reminding us \nthat our job isn't finished, that we must pay down our national debt.\n  He has been a tireless fighter for education, the chief sponsor of \nour proposal to help States and local school districts build and \nrenovate 6,000 schools.\n  He fought to reduce class sizes by hiring 100,000 teachers and to \nmake America's schools safer and stronger.\n  He helped create new partnerships to connect every school in America \nto the Internet.\n  He is as hard a worker as you will find in this body.\n  In 12 years as a Senator, incredibly, he has missed only 10 votes.\n\n[[Page S11813]]\n\n  As chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in 1991 \nand 1992, Chuck Robb shattered fundraising records and ended his term \nwith the strongest majority for our party in 20 years.\n  He cares deeply about the values on which our party is founded. But \nthere are values he holds even more dearly than party loyalty. A \nreporter asked him recently who his political heroes are. He listed \ntwo. One was the late Bill Spong, another thoughtful, effective \nVirginian, who served one term in this Senate and was the first \nsouthern Senator from a State covered by the Voting Rights Act to vote \nfor the act.\n  He said his other political hero was a man we all knew, our friend, \nJohn Chafee, ``because he worried about women's health, poor children, \nand the environment, and reached across party lines to find \nsolutions.''\n  Reaching across party lines, being willing to work and look in new \nplaces for new solutions--that is something Senator Robb has done his \nentire life.\n\n  He grew up in a Republican family. He is a founder and past chairman \nof the centrist Democratic Leadership Committee, and one of the \noriginal architects for what we now know and call ``the third way'' in \npolitics.\n  His ground-breaking ideas on the changing economy, new models of \ngoverning, and other ideas helped transform political thinking--not \nonly in this country but in England and in nations all over the world.\n  Quietly, modestly, throughout his career, he has tried to reach \nhonest, bipartisan compromise on an array of issues.\n  Here in the Senate, he has worked closely with his colleague, Senator \nWarner, on issues of importance to Virginia and our national security.\n  As a member of our caucus' Centrist Coalition, he has helped us all \ntry to find a middle ground.\n  I would be sorry to see Chuck Robb leave the Senate at any time. The \nfact that he is leaving now--when we so desperately need people who are \nable to see beyond the usual party divisions--makes his leaving doubly \nsad.\n  Chuck Robb only lost one other political contest in his life, when he \nran for senior class president at the University of Wisconsin at \nMadison. Speaking about that loss later to a reporter, he said it gave \nhim something important. As he put it: ``I needed a little taking down. \nAnybody who goes too long without some setback in life tends to lose an \nimportant perspective.''\n  One of the things Chuck Robb came to understand about himself back \nthen was how much he loved this Nation and how much he felt he owed it.\n  It was that sense of patriotism that compelled him to enter the \nMarines after graduating from college. It was that sense of patriotism, \ntoo, that made him volunteer to go to Vietnam. He didn't have to go; he \ncould have served stateside. In fact, the Pentagon brass would have \npreferred it. They worried about what might happen if a President's \nson-in-law were taken captive and used to extract concessions from the \nUnited States. But Chuck Robb insisted.\n  In April of 1968, 2 months after the Tet offensive, he landed in \nVietnam, commander of an infantry company. Two weeks later, he was in \ncombat.\n  In Vietnam, he earned the Bronze Star with the Combat V, the \nVietnamese Cross of Gallantry with the Silver Star, and the rank of \nmajor.\n  Most people who knew him, including his extraordinary wife Lynda, \nexpected Major Robb to make a career of the military. And he did remain \nin the Marine Reserves for a long period of time, all the way until \n1991, serving a total of 34 years in uniform.\n  But he also found another way to serve his Nation.\n  In 1977, the people of Virginia chose Chuck Robb as their Lieutenant \nGovernor--the only Democrat elected that year to statewide office. Four \nyears later, they made him Virginia's 64th Governor--the first \nVirginian Democrat elected Governor in 16 years.\n  As Governor, he championed many of the same causes he would later \nfight for in this Chamber. He invested $1 billion in Virginia's \nschools--without raising taxes.\n  He fought for civil rights.\n  As President, his father-in-law, Lyndon Johnson, appointed the first \nAfrican American to the U.S. Supreme Court--Thurgood Marshall.\n  As Governor, Chuck Robb appointed the first African American to the \nVirginia Supreme Court, as well.\n  He signed the legislation adding Martin Luther King's name to a State \nholiday that had formerly honored only Confederate Civil War heroes.\n  His fellow Governors recognized his exceptional talents. He served as \nchairman of the Southern Governors' Association and the Democratic \nGovernors' Association.\n  He chaired the Education Commission of the States and the Council of \nState Governments.\n  Even during the toughest political fights of his life, Chuck Robb did \nnot like to tell people these things about himself.\n  When others praised him for his accomplishments, he was always quick \nto say that it was ``we'' who deserved the praise, not ``he.''\n  His genuine modesty is one of the things that makes Chuck Robb a \nSenator's Senator.\n  Another is his courage to fight for principle, even when he knows it \nwill cost him politically. Chuck Robb has done that over and over and \nover again in this Chamber.\n  One instance I will always remember came last March when he stood on \nthis floor and explained--in a deeply personal, eloquent way--why he \nopposed amending our Constitution to make flag burning a crime.\n  As someone who saw too many good men die for what our flag \nrepresents, he said he felt a sense of revulsion when he saw the flag \ntreated disrespectfully.\n  But--in Senator Robb's words--``they died for liberty and tolerance, \nfor Justice and equality. They died for that which can never burn. They \ndied for ideals that can only be desecrated by our failure to defend \nthem.''\n  Someone once asked Senator Robb why he took such politically risky \nstands--especially in an election year.\n  He said that--because he had been in combat--``I thought that I could \nspeak out on some issues with less concern about the downside than some \nother Senators might have to think about.''\n  I don't know if he was right in that calculation.\n  I do know this: On this day in 1791, the Bill of Rights was ratified \nwhen Virginia approved it.\n  One reason it has never once been weakened--in all these years--is \nthe brave and principled stand of Virginia's Senator, Chuck Robb.\n  There are many things about the next Senate which I look forward to.\n  I deeply regret, however, that Chuck Robb will not be with us. His \ndeparture is a loss not only for our caucus but for this entire Senate \nand for our Nation.\n  Our Senate family will also deeply miss Lynda Johnson Robb, who is \nhere today.\n  She has given so much to our Nation throughout her life. And she \ncontinues to serve America as the National Chair of Reading is \nFUNdamental, and as Vice Chairman of America's Promise, the national \nservice partnership.\n  Last week, Chuck and Lynda celebrated their 33rd wedding anniversary. \nI'm sure I speak for all of us when I say we wish them belated \ncongratulations--and best wishes on their future endeavors.\n  In that same interview in which Senator Robb listed his political \nheroes, he was also asked: What is your most inspirational quotation?\n  He cited the words of Teddy Roosevelt:\n\n       The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the \n     arena--whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood . . . \n     who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions--and \n     spends himself on a worthy cause--who at best, if he wins, \n     knows the thrill of high achievement--and if he fails, at \n     least he fails while daring greatly--so that his place will \n     never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither \n     victory, nor defeat.\n\n  Throughout his career, Chuck Robb has lived up to those words.\n  He has been in the arena.\n  He has fought for worthy causes.\n  And he has inspired us all to be better Senators.\n  I am proud to call him a friend. We will all miss him.\n  Let me also take this opportunity to say thank you, and best wishes, \nto our other fellow Senators who will not be rejoining us next year: On \nour side of the aisle: Senator Dick Bryan, Senator Bob Kerrey, Senator \nFrank Lautenberg, and Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan.\n\n[[Page S11814]]\n\n  And our friends across the aisle. . . . Senators Abraham, Ashcroft, \nGorton, Grams, Mack, and Roth.\n  It's an honor to have served with all of them. I wish them well in \nall of their future pursuits.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on behalf of all the Democratic Senators, I \nexpress our appreciation for the kind words about our friend Chuck \nRobb. I sent him a note after the election, and he, of course, in his \ntypical fashion responded. But I so much appreciate the Democratic \nleader covering his extraordinary life. One thing the leader didn't \nmention is that he is really a son of the West. He was born in Arizona. \nOf course, he went to high school in Fairfax and did a great job there.\n  One reason I so admire Chuck Robb--and the leader touched upon that--\nis his military record. I have not served in the U.S. military. I look \nat Chuck Robb with so much admiration. He went to the jungles of \nVietnam. He didn't have to go, but he did. Not only did he go there, \nbut he served in combat and was given a medal for valor. That says it \nall about Chuck Robb.\n  Chuck Robb's service for the 12 years he has been in the Senate has \nbeen one of valor. We have asked him to take credit for things he did, \nand he would not take credit. We have asked him to come forward on \nissues in which maybe he just had some tangential involvement. He said: \nNo, that is not my legislation; I am not going to do it.\n  He is a man of great integrity. As the leader indicated, he doesn't \npromote himself. Of course, he doesn't do that.\n  But the thing I admire about Chuck Robb more than any other--more \nthan his public service and more than his military record--is how he \ntreats and talks to his family. He has three daughters and a wonderful \nwife.\n  With a heavy heart, I look at Chuck Robb here on the Senate floor for \none of the last times. My life is better because of Chuck Robb. He has \nmade me look better personally. He is a man of great integrity and a \nman of character. I will never forget the things he has done for me \npersonally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I would like to thank Senator Robb. He \nis truly one of the most honorable individuals I have ever met in my \nlife. I thank him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I will just take one minute to thank my \nfriends and colleagues for their eloquent and very greatly appreciated \nwords. I have never been very good at showing emotion. I am not very \ngood at saying thank you. But I want you to know that your words, your \nfriendship, your leadership and your example have always been \nappreciated well beyond my ability to express it.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11814-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, during the last few moments, several of \nour colleagues gave tribute to our friend. He is my friend and is \nsomeone so many of us admire here in the Senate. He is someone who has \nmade a difference in this body and this country with his deep \ncommitment to public service.\n  Reference was made this afternoon to Senator Robb and his service in \nVietnam. He fought for our country and served in the Armed Forces. \nBecause of his strong beliefs and commitments to the values of the \nNation, he made it his responsibility to respond to the Nation's call.\n  This is a real reflection of the strong commitment and the basic \nintegrity of this extraordinary Senator and friend. He fought in \nVietnam for the values he believed in deeply. He came back to this \ncountry served as a distinguished Governor of a great State, the State \nof Virginia. And he continued that service in the Senate.\n  Chuck Robb was a neighbor of mine. We have lived as neighbors for a \nnumber of years. He and Lynda have been good and valued friends over a \ngreat many years.\n  I have enjoyed working with him in the area of education. He has a \nfierce passion to try to make sure every child in this country is going \nto have a good quality education. Even though he is not a member of the \neducation committee, he mastered this subject and also provided very \nimportant leadership in it.\n  I think so much of what is included in this dual appropriations \nlegislation--which we hope we will have an opportunity to address in \nthese next several hours and days--is really a tribute to the strong \nstands he took on good quality education for the children not just of \nVirginia but the children of this country.\n  I think he was always concerned about the balance between the \nexpenditures and what the economy could stand. He is in every respect a \nfiscal conservative. He believed deeply in making sure we had a budget \nthat was going to reflect our values, but also that we were going to \ntake care that our resources were going to be well spent in the \nnational interest.\n  Finally, I want to mention an additional field where his leadership \nwas very much in evidence; that is, in knocking down the walls of \ndiscrimination in all of the forms and shapes that have been presented \nin recent years. That is a defining issue for our country. America will \nnever be America until we free ourselves from all types and all forms \nof discrimination.\n  There was never a battle in any of the areas involving discrimination \nin which Chuck Robb was not a leader. I will miss him on this Senate \nfloor.\n  I join with my other colleagues in paying tribute to his service to \nthe Senate, but most importantly to his State and also to our Nation. \nHe has a great opportunity in the future for continued service. I think \nall Members in this body wish him well and look forward to \nopportunities of work with him closely again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I rise to comment on a development \nthat took place in my State this week. It was with great sadness that I \nheard of the phasing out of the Oldsmobile line of cars within the \nGeneral Motors family. Over the last 105 years, Oldsmobile has been a \nLansing, MI, and a State institution and, obviously, a national and \ninternational one as well. It was started 105 years ago when Ransom Eli \nOlds of Lansing, MI, teamed with Frank Clark, the son of a small \ncarriage shop operator, to achieve what many believed impossible. They \nsuccessfully produced a self-contained gasoline-powered carriage, and \nwith it Oldsmobile was officially born in 1897.\n  Throughout its history, Oldsmobile has enjoyed a number of firsts: \nthe first assembly line; and with the production of the curved dash, \nthe first mass producer of gasoline cars; in 1905, two Oldsmobiles \nfinished the very first transcontinental race from New York to \nPortland, OR, in 45 days; in 1940, models featured the Hydra-Matic \ndrive, making this lineup the first vehicles with fully automatic \ntransmissions; in 1966, Oldsmobile introduced the Toronado, the first \nmodern-day front-wheel drive car; in 1974, that Toronado became the \nfirst American car to offer a driver's side airbag.\n  Millions of Americans have come to love their Oldsmobiles. An Olds \nconvertible was the standard for transporting a Homecoming queen or a \nfloat parade when I was growing up. And an Oldsmobile sedan was the \nepitome of the middle-class family dream. All of this was made possible \nby the hard work and the commitment to affordable quality that was the \nhallmark of Oldsmobile in that division of General Motors.\n  On a personal level, I have a special stake in all of this, as well. \nNot only did I grow up in Lansing, MI, the home of Oldsmobile, but for \nalmost 20 years my dad worked on the line at the Oldsmobile main \nassembly plant there. It is\n\n[[Page S11815]]\n\nwhere he got his start, where my family came to truly appreciate how \nmuch the automobile industry means, not just to families such as ours \nbut to our State, and especially how much the Oldsmobile meant to \nMichigan--Lansing, in particular.\n  I am sad, therefore, to see the Oldsmobile go, as we have known it, \nbut I am confident General Motors will continue to make quality, safe \nautomobiles for generations to come. As we bring down the curtain on \nthe Oldsmobile, I rise today to offer my praise to that company, to \nthose who started it, and their families and descendents who still \nremain in the Lansing area and in Michigan; also, to all those workers \nwho, as my father, worked over the years for that Oldsmobile division \nof General Motors. I think each and every one of them took to their \njobs a great satisfaction, a commitment to hard work, and a tremendous \npride in the craftsmanship that went into making the automobile for \nmany generations one of this country's favorite lines of vehicles.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I inquire of the Chair, are we still in \nmorning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senator from Michigan we \nare in a period of morning business until the hour of 2:30.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11815-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11815]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      PROUD ARAB AMERICAN HERITAGE\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I will comment briefly on a matter of \nrelevance both personally to me and to my State. Since the election, as \na consequence of my defeat, I have heard from a number of people from \nthe Arab American community, both in Michigan and across the United \nStates. As a Lebanese American myself, I have been very proud to be, at \nleast for the last several years, the only Arab American Member of this \nChamber.\n  A number of folks from that community expressed their disappointment \nin the results of the campaign. I take the floor today to thank so many \npeople who have been in touch, but also to make several points that I \nhope will be heard by members of the community, to be taken into \naccount as they consider the results of this election, as well as the \nfuture.\n  First, I note that in recent years I believe the Arab American \ncommunity has become a key part of the American political process. The \nparticipation of the community has continued to increase both in my \nState of Michigan as well as across the country. Not only are people \nvoting in greater numbers as a percentage of the community, and for \nmany taking the first step of participating in the elections, but their \nactivism in Michigan and other States has grown considerably. I take \ngreat pride in seeing that happen.\n  In addition, we have seen a number of Arab Americans rise to \nleadership positions at the local level of government all the way up to \nstatewide offices. In the Congress itself we have several Members of \nArab heritage on the House side who were elected in the most recent \ncampaigns.\n  Much of this progress, I think, has translated into progress on \nissues of importance to the Arab American community in the last 6 \nyears. I have been proud during my term in the Senate to have worked on \nbehalf of a number of important issues relevant to the community. One \nhas been to see the travel ban to Lebanon lifted in 1997, which has \nopened more opportunities for better relations between the United \nStates and Lebanon, and also for more commercial activity between the \ntwo countries.\n  This Chamber passed a resolution decrying intolerance toward people \nof Islamic faith in this country, a much needed statement, I think, for \nthe Congress to make so we can be on record consistently as opposing \nintolerance toward people of any religious faith. We have supported \nimportant programs that have affected the Middle East. One that we have \nworked on in our office with Senator Feinstein and others is the Seeds \nof Peace Program, which I believe will have a long-term and positive \nimpact on the relationships between countries in the Middle East, \nincluding Lebanon, Israel, Jordan, Egypt, Yemen, as well as the \nPalestinians.\n  I think the potential for the future is even greater. I think it is \nvery likely in the area of public policy that the people from the Arab \nAmerican community will rise and play an ever active role and a greater \nrole, as they have done in other fields of endeavor. In America's \nbusiness community, we have many Arab American leaders today who are \nheading up important companies from one end of the country to the \nother. In sports and entertainment and the arts, we likewise have seen \nArab Americans excel. In education, the same is true. Indeed, the level \nof educational attainment by young people of Arab American background \ncontinues to be one of the most important components of the Arab \nAmerican ethnic communities' contribution to the United States.\n  I am very proud of my heritage. I have talked to many other Members \nof this Chamber about my background over the years. I am glad to have \nhelped in a small way--to have played a role in moving forward some of \nthe policy objectives I mentioned a few minutes ago. I hope, to some \nextent, that has helped encourage others in their own communities, \nStates, or even perhaps at the Federal level to do so, as well.\n  Recently in Dearborn, MI, home to the largest concentration of Arab \nAmericans in the United States, I was approached by a woman who had a \nyoung son in the seventh grade, saying how happy he was to know a \nSenator shared his Arab American heritage. I hope that in my brief \ncareer in the Senate maybe there are others who have similarly sparked \nan interest in government because they happen to be part of that same \ncommunity to which I belong.\n  My message is to praise the community, especially, but also to say to \nany who have harbored a sense of disappointment with the results of the \nelection, I hope that disappointment will not be long standing. It \ncertainly isn't the case for myself. I encourage people in the \ncommunity to continue to play an active role in politics. Obviously, \nour political process inevitably produces success and failure from \nelection to election.\n  For people new to the process, sometimes they misunderstand and treat \na setback as something that should discourage future involvement. I \nhope that across the Arab American community, and especially for those \nwho first got active in the political process with this election, that \nthey will continue to play an active role, even increase their \ninvolvement, and hopefully encourage others to do likewise. That would \nbe invaluable to the community, and certainly from my point of view, it \nwould be the preferable outcome.\n  My grandparents came a century ago from Lebanon, where they left \nbehind everything to risk their fortunes on America. As is the case \nwith people not just from the Arab American community but so many other \nimmigrant communities, they came here with very little in the way of \nmaterial possessions, but they came with a great deal of desire and \nenergy and the hope that by working hard and playing by the rules they \ncould make a contribution.\n  As I have said to the others on this floor in the past, they did not \nnecessarily come here assuming they would have a grandson who would be \nin the Senate, but they wanted to live in a country where that was \npossible. Indeed, that is what our country always will be. And I think \nit always will. I am proud to have had the opportunity to fulfill, \nprobably in the utmost way, the hopes that were brought here by my \ngrandparents when they arrived.\n  I think, as I look back on my service in the Senate, perhaps more \nthan anything else, will be the source of pride that I take with me as \nI leave the Chamber today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I did want to take a moment, as someone\n\n[[Page S11816]]\n\nwho has been involved in immigration issues over some 38 years in the \nSenate, and someone who has worked with colleagues in a bipartisan way. \nI wanted to let my friend from Michigan know something which I hope he \nalready does know. I wanted to share the great respect I have for him \nand his leadership on immigration issues, as the chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Immigration.\n  Immigration issues bring out, really, the best and the worst in our \ncolleagues. These are emotional issues for many of us. We have a Senate \nand House of Representatives that have strong views on these issues. \nHis hand has been a steady, guiding one of leadership over this period \nof time, and one I thought showed enormous sensitivity in helping to \nguide immigration policy in a way that respects the strong tradition of \npeople in this Nation to acknowledge and continually work to remedy the \nvery significant inequities that are still a part of our policy.\n  I also point out what I think all of us in this body remember, his \nstrong leadership in helping us work through the skill shortage in our \nhigh-tech industries. He led the Judiciary Committee and the Senate in \nthe development of that program. What certainly impressed me during \nthat period of time was his constant willingness to look at different \nideas, different approaches, and differing views, and to always try to \nreach out to find some common understanding in these areas in order to \nmove the process forward--a real legislator.\n  I know he is proud of many different aspects of his service in the \nSenate, but I wanted to express from this side of the aisle the \naffection and friendship of those of us who have worked with him in \nsome very important areas of public policy, and the high regard and \nrespect we have for him. We are hopeful that we'll have a chance to \nwork with him on public policy in the future.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, if I might, I thank the Senator from \nMassachusetts for his kind remarks. I had occasion a couple of days ago \nto speak to the Senate. At that time I expressed publicly my thanks to \nhim. He was not in the Chamber at the time, so I reiterate it here. We \nworked, I think, in a very constructive way on a number of issues as \nmembers of the Subcommittee on Immigration and on a variety of other \nissues he has mentioned here as well. I thank him for his remarks \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I expect to support the omnibus \nlegislation that will implement the final appropriations agreement for \nthis Congress because it makes the kinds of investments in education, \nhealth, and work opportunities that are needed by all American \nfamilies. In the long run, only through these basic investments can we \npreserve our capacity to keep our nation strong. I commend my \ncolleagues for their diligence in crafting legislation that respects \nthe highest priorities of the American people. Senator Harkin and \nSenator Specter have shown the power of bipartisan cooperation \nthroughout their work on this legislation. We have all benefitted from \nthe example and leadership of Senator Stevens and Senator Byrd as well.\n  While this legislation is not perfect and certainly is no substitute \nfor the unfinished work of the 106th Congress, it is good for the \nAmerican people, and it shows what is possible when we resolve to work \ntogether. In this sense, it offers considerable hope for the 107th \nCongress.\n\n\n                               EDUCATION\n\n  In the critical area of education and the nation's schools, this \nappropriations agreement is a resounding victory for parents and \ncommunities across the country. Congress has lived up to its commitment \nto increase education funding. We are taking a giant step forward to \nensure that children across the country receive the support they need \nto succeed in school and to make college more affordable for every \nqualified student. I'm proud to highlight a few of the key education \naccomplishments.\n\n  For the first time, communities across the country will qualify for \nover $1.2 billion in federal aid to address their most urgent school \nbuilding repair needs, such as fixing roofs, plumbing and electrical \nsystems, and meeting fire and safety codes.\n  Schools across the country will receive $1.623 billion, a 25 percent \nincrease over last year, to continue hiring and training new teachers \nto reduce class sizes in the early grades. This year's funding increase \nwill place 8,000 more teachers in classrooms, placing the goal of \n100,000 new teachers well within reach.\n  Teacher quality will improve as well this year. Schools will receive \n$485 million, a 45 percent increase over last year, to help teachers \nimprove their skills through professional development activities, \nreducing the number of uncertified and out-of-field teachers.\n  Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which helps \ndisadvantaged students master the basics and achieve to high standards, \nis increased by $506 million, for a total of $8.4 billion.\n  We know that children are most likely to engage in risky behavior in \nthe hours just after school. Congress has responded by increasing \nsupport for after-school programs by 87 percent this year, to $851 \nmillion. This increase will help more children stay out of trouble \nafter school and get extra help with their schoolwork.\n  The bill also provides an additional $91 million, for a total of $225 \nmillion, to support state and local efforts to turn around low-\nperforming schools.\n  Vocational and technical education programs received $1.240 billion, \na $48 million increase, to improve programs that give students skills \nthey need in order to meet the demands of the new high tech workforce.\n  College students will also receive much needed support under this \nbill. The GEAR UP programs will receive $295 million, an increase of \n$95 million, and TRIO programs will receive $730 million, a $85 million \nincrease, to help more low-income and minority middle and high school \nstudents prepare for college and succeed in college.\n  Of all high school students in Boston, 80 percent of them now are \ntied into colleges. We have 12 different colleges that are tied into \nthe high schools, where they are not just taking the individuals who \nshow promise, which the TRIO Program does and does with extraordinary \nsuccess, but to try to take the whole class together and move the whole \nclass up. It is a relatively new concept and one which has worked very \nsuccessfully in the several pilot areas where it has been tried. We are \nfinding extraordinary response, positive response from colleges that \nengage in this undertaking, and extraordinary response from the \nschools. I think it will be one of the more important programs to \nenhance academic achievement for high school students.\n  This legislation will also enable more undergraduate and graduate \nstudents to pay for college through part-time work assistance because \nthe Federal Work Study program received a $77 million increase.\n  This bill also strengthens Pell Grants, enabling many more students \nto take advantage of them. The maximum grant is increasing by $450--\nfrom $3,300 to $3,750. Because there are so many young people who, even \nthough they are eligible for the maximum Pell Grant, just couldn't make \nit with the lower maximum, this is perhaps the most important \neducational enhancement we have. It recognizes that many children are \nadvantaged in their academic achievement and accomplishment but \ndisadvantaged in the amount of resources they have.\n\n\n                             Early Learning\n\n  As we strengthen our commitment to quality education at the \nelementary, secondary, and college levels, a strong body of research \nchallenges us to broaden our commitment to education as well. Education \nis a continuum that begins at birth and continues long after \ngraduation. On the birth-to-kindergarten side, we have much work to do. \nFor the sake of each child, the nation, and our education system \nitself, all children must have access to the early learning \nopportunities that will enable them to enter school ready to learn.\n  Today, 12 million children under age five have mothers who work \noutside the home. Yet many of these children are assigned to waiting \nlists instead of quality early learning programs because federal \nfunding isn't adequate to meet existing needs, and more and more \nparents are accepting the responsibility of work under welfare reform.\n\n[[Page S11817]]\n\n In Massachusetts, 14,000 children are wait-listed, as are 200,000 \nchildren in California. Today's minimum wage for a full-time worker is \n$10,720 per year. This doesn't begin to cover the cost of quality early \nlearning opportunities, which can be as high as ten thousand dollars a \nyear.\n  All of us remember a number of years ago when the Governors, \nRepublicans and Democrats, met in Charlottesville and announced goals \nfor the Nation in education. Their first goal is to have children ready \nto learn when they enter kindergarten and first grade, to build the \nskills they bring to school. The skills that little children need to \ndevelop as infants and toddlers self-confidence, self-awareness, some \ndegree of self-esteem, inquisitiveness in academics, and, interestingly \nenough, a sense of humor.\n  Eleven years ago, Senator McCain and I introduced the Military Child \nCare Act, which turned military child care into an early learning model \nfor the nation. Today's legislation takes three important steps toward \nbuilding on that success in civilian America.\n  First, it increases federal child care subsidies by 69 percent, \nenabling states to remove 150,000 children from waiting lists next \nyear. This increase was very much patterned upon the child care \ninitiatives of our colleague, Senator Dodd, and I am deeply grateful \nfor his leadership on this issue.\n  Next, this legislation enables 70,000 of the nation's most at-risk \nchildren to participate in Head Start, which is highly regarded because \nit delivers the promise of early learning so effectively. The \nlegislation also begins implementing the Early Learning Opportunities \nAct, which Senator Stevens, Senator Jeffords, and Senator Dodd and I \nsupported over the past two years. This new law provides for parental \neducation and support services, increased collaboration among early \nleaning providers, and incentives to improve the quality of early \nlearning services. Its goal is to help the nation build an effective \ninfrastructure of local councils to help each community evaluate how \nbest to put the research on infant and toddler brain development into \npractice.\n  The Head Start Program, the Early Head Start Program, and the new \nEarly Learning Opportunities Act included in this appropriations bill \nwill improve early learning in important ways. The Carnegie Commission \nand other experts who have studied the development of a child's brain \nin the early years, and made a series of recommendations. With this \nlegislation we are beginning now to follow up on these recommendations \nby investing in children at early ages. That is extremely important.\n  These steps show important momentum toward turning the research on \nchildren's brain development into sensible national policy, and we \nshould build on this momentum in the next Congress. We can learn much \nmore from the military's experience with early learning. We can build \nthese lessons into the Child Care and Development Block Grant when it \nis reauthorized in the next Congress. We can pass additional \nlegislation to turn the current patchwork of federal child care and \nearly learning programs into a seamless structure directed at one \ngoal--quality services to ensure that children enter school ready to \nlearn. We also must continue expanding Head Start until it is available \nto all children who need it.\n\n  The health funding in this bill is also a win for the American \npeople.\n\n\n                       GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION\n\n  I will now address the excellent work that has been done under the \nbalanced budget act, or BBA, programs, in particular the funding level \nfor pediatric graduate medical education. This is not an area that has \na history of proper federal attention. Last year, it received $40 \nmillion and virtually no funding prior to that time.\n  The Medicare Program has provided the funding for the training of \nmuch of the American medical personnel who, without question, are the \nbest trained medical personnel in the country. It was funded through \nthe Medicare system. The area of pediatrics never made it, so these \nchildren's hospitals, which train the majority of pediatricians, had to \nprovide the additional training services and educational services \nwithout the support available to every other physician training \nprogram.\n  That has been significantly corrected with this legislation. There \nare over 50 major children's hospitals across this country that will \nbenefit from this program. We can be sure that as a result of today's \nwork, the part of the medical profession that is focused upon caring \nfor children will be significantly advanced, and I commend the \nappropriators for this.\n  I am particularly pleased with the funding level for pediatric \ngraduate medical education. The legislation allocates $235 million to \nsupport medical education costs incurred by freestanding children's \nhospitals. This figure is nearly a 500 percent increase over last \nyear's appropriation of $40 million, and puts us much closer to fully \nfunding the program.\n  This program was created last year to address the historical \ninequities in federal support for graduate medical education activities \noccurring at independent children's hospitals. Until last year, the \nfederal government has paid for hospital costs related to physician \ntraining from Medicare. However, because children's hospitals generally \ntreat very few Medicare patients, they were historically and \ndramatically underpaid for teaching activities. Prior to enactment of \nthis program, children's hospitals were given just \\1/200\\th of the \nfederal support for teaching activities that other teaching hospitals \nreceived.\n  Children's hospitals, which represent less than one percent of all \nhospitals in the country, train approximately 30 percent of the \nnation's pediatricians and the majority of many pediatric specialists. \nIt is long past time for the federal government to support these \nactivities. Next year, it is my hope that we will achieve permanent, \nfull funding for this essential program.\n  Children's hospitals around the country will benefit from the \nincreased funds in this legislation. It will enable these important \ninstitutions to continue to be regional and national referral centers \nfor children around the country. It will support new and continuing \nresearch activities that benefit children and adults alike. And, most \nimportantly, it will help assure a steady supply of pediatricians and \npediatric specialists to treat the nation's children now and in the \nfuture.\n  With approximately 200 full-time employees in training at any one \ntime, Boston Children's Hospital has the largest teaching program among \nindependent children's hospitals. It has a top-notch faculty, and \nprovides excellent teaching, research and patient care. These funds \nwill assure its continued contribution to health of children in \nMassachusetts, the nation, and the world.\n\n\n                     NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH\n\n  This bill also includes an increase of 13 percent for the National \nInstitutes of Health, raising the NIH budget to more than $20 billion. \nThese new resources will enable NIH to increase its support for the \nmedical research that is urgently needed to develop new cures for the \ndiseases that afflict millions of Americans.\n  Massachusetts is a leader in medical science. It receives more than \none out of every ten dollars that NIH spends on research grants--more \nthan any other state except California--and Boston receives more NIH \ngrant money than any other city in the nation.\n  Last year alone, doctors and scientists in Massachusetts were awarded \nmore than $1.5 billion in research grants from NIH. The new \nappropriations bill will increase this already impressive total by more \nthan $180 million, so that Massachusetts will receive an estimated $1.7 \nbillion in NIH research grants in the coming year.\n  NIH supports essential research across the state. In Boston, research \nsupported by NIH very recently discovered an important relationship \nbetween the immune system and the brain that may lead to better \ntreatments for diseases like multiple sclerosis. In Worcester, NIH \nfunds are helping to build a new center for cancer research that will \nbecome a leader in this important field. In Cambridge, NIH will help \nsupport a major new center to study the nervous system, so that we can \nbetter understand brain diseases like Alzheimer's, schizophrenia and \ndepression. NIH grants are essential for funding the basic research \nthat is often considered too risky to be funded by private companies, \nand ensure that the results of this work are available to all \nresearchers.\n\n[[Page S11818]]\n\n  The investment that NIH makes in medical research is the foundation \non which the nation's thriving biotechnology industry is built. More \nthan 250 biotech companies in Massachusetts provide good jobs for \nthousands of professionals across the state, and contribute millions of \ndollars every year to the state's economy. New partnerships between \nuniversities and biotechnology companies form almost every day, \nembarking research ideas from the academic world to be developed \nrapidly into new medical breakthroughs that will improve the health of \npatients across the nation.\n  By helping develop new cures for deadly diseases and by fostering the \nimportant new industry of biotechnology, the renewed commitment to the \nNIH that we make here today is an investment that will pay dividends \nnow and for many years to come.\n\n\n                       Balanced Budget Reform Act\n\n  This legislation provides ``financial CPR'' for hospitals, home \nhealth agencies, nursing homes, and other important Medicare providers \naround the country. It also takes important steps to improve access to \nhealth care through CHIP and Medicaid, though more is needed.\n  Nearly one million senior citizens and persons with disabilities \ndepend on Medicare to provide high-quality care in Massachusetts. The \nhealth care industry is a critical component of the state economy. \nToday, we are saying that help is on the way.\n  The Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP Beneficiary Improvement and \nProtection Act is the most significant relief package since passage of \nthe Balanced Budget Act in 1997. Medicare spending will total $30 \nbillion over five years, and spending for Medicaid and the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program will total $6 billion. In fact, the net cost \nof the entire package is likely to be closer to $15 billion over five \nyears, because of the offsetting effect of savings achieved by a \nforthcoming regulation limiting the ability of states to obtain union \nfunded Medicaid payments.\n  The savings from the Medicaid regulation should be used to expand \ncoverage to low-income populations. I strongly support the provider \nrelief in this package, but I am disappointed that the Republican \nleadership opposed bipartisan efforts to enable states to extend health \nbenefits to low-income pregnant women and children who are legal \nimmigrants, but who would otherwise be eligible for CHIP and Medicaid. \nIn addition, the Republican leadership refused to include the \nbipartisan Grassley-Kennedy Family Opportunity Act, which would have \nenabled children with disabilities to obtain or maintain health \ncoverage through Medicaid.\n\n  Massachusetts providers have estimated that they will receive \napproximately $450 million--close to half a billion dollars--over the \nnext five years as a result of this legislation. While it is the most \nsignificant step Congress has taken to date to restore the unintended \ncuts made by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, this Congress failed to \nfinish the job, and we will be back at it again in the 107th Congress.\n  The record budget surpluses now and projected for the years ahead are \nlargely due to the savings achieved by cutting Medicare payments in the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997. Those cuts were expected to total $116 \nbillion over five years, and nearly $400 billion over ten years--more \nthan double the amount ever enacted in any previous legislation.\n  In reality, these cuts are now estimated to total $200 billion over \nfive years and more than $600 billion over 10 years. These excessive \ncuts, combined with low payments from private payors and Medicaid \nprograms, have placed many outstanding health care institutions at \nrisk, and threaten quality of care for millions of elderly, disabled \nand low-income Americans.\n  In Massachusetts, two out of every three hospitals are losing money \non patient care. Community hospitals across the state are struggling to \nsurvive. Key providers are questioning whether to participate in HMOs, \nand HMOs are deciding to cut benefits and trim service areas.\n  Twenty-five percent of home health agencies in the state no longer \nserve Medicare patients, and 20 agencies have closed their doors since \nthe BBA was enacted. The remainder see fewer patients, and see them \nless often.\n  Forty-three nursing homes have closed in Massachusetts since 1998. \nOne in four are in bankruptcy. One in seven nursing positions are \nunfilled, because Massachusetts nursing homes are unable to compete for \nstaff.\n  Congress has been slowly restoring these Medicare cuts year-by-year. \nIn 1998, we included $1.65 billion in the FY99 Omnibus Appropriations \nbill for Medicare home health agencies as a stop-gap measure. The \nBalanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 restored $16 billion over five \nyears. And the legislation we are voting on today takes an even more \nsignificant step toward fixing the problems created by the BBA. But it \ndoes not finish the job. In fact, it contains new cuts for hospitals \nand nursing homes. Clearly, we will need to revisit this issue in the \n107th Congress. There is no need to turn funding for entitlement \nprograms into an annual appropriations process, but that is precisely \nwhat this annual exercise has unfortunately become.\n  In addition to the much-needed provider relief contained in this \nlegislation, it also includes two other important improvements in \nMedicare benefits. First, it requires Medicare coverage of drugs that \nare not usually self-administered by a patient. This change restores \nand preserves coverage for certain drugs that are vital for senior \ncitizens and persons with debilitating chronic illnesses. This \nprovision will ensure that in determining whether a drug is usually \nself-administered, HCFA should only consider whether a majority of \nMedicare patients with the disease or condition actually administer the \ndrug to themselves, reversing a contrary 1997 policy. This improvement \nwill help assure that millions of elderly and disabled Americans have \ncontinued access to life-saving and life-improving drugs.\n  Second, the bill improves coverage for immunosuppressive drugs for \nMedicare patients who have had an organ transplant. These drugs are \nneeded to prevent rejection of the transplanted organ. Assuring \npermanent coverage will improve the quality of life for transplant \npatients, and assure a wiser use of scarce resources and scarce organs \nby helping patients to remain healthy after transplantation.\n\n\n                           CHIP AND MEDICAID\n\n  This legislation also includes several provisions that are important \nto working families whose children are eligible for CHIP or Medicaid.\n  First, the legislation includes a redistribution mechanism to assure \nuse of the funds allocated to insure low-income children through CHIP \nand Medicaid. The formula is fair, and it allows all states to benefit \nfrom unspent FY98 dollars in a manner that will assure continued \nenrollment of eligible children. Those states that have been slow to \nspend their initial CHIP allocation will now have additional time to \nspend their FY98 funds by reaching out and enrolling more children in \nthese programs. Those states that spent all of their FY98 dollars \nbecause they were able to get their programs up and running early will \nobtain additional funds to continue their momentum. The result is a \nwin-win for America's children.\n  The legislation also enables states to immediately enroll uninsured \nchildren who are potentially eligible for CHIP or Medicaid in the \nproper program, while awaiting confirmation of actual eligibility. This \nstep is important for improving enrollment rates. Unfortunately, the \nbill limits its applicability to children found only through outreach \nin primary and secondary schools. There is bipartisan support for a \nbroader proposal that would have extended presumptive eligibility to a \nvariety of other programs where uninsured eligible children or their \nparents are likely to be identified, including child care resource \ncenters, child support agencies, housing agencies, and homeless \nshelters. We will pursue this and other CHIP and Medicaid outreach and \nenrollment improvements next year.\n  Finally, the legislation extends for one additional year the \nTransitional Medical Assistance program, which allows families who are \nleaving welfare for work to maintain Medicaid coverage during the \ntransition. Most post-welfare jobs do not offer health insurance. We \nmust do all we can to see that ``ending welfare as we knew it'' does \nnot contribute to America's already shameful uninsured rate.\n\n[[Page S11819]]\n\n                   LOW INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE\n\n  I'm pleased that this year's final budget agreement includes $1.4 \nbillion to help families heat their homes this winter under the Low \nIncome Home Energy Assistance Program. Massachusetts needs this 28 \npercent increase in its block grant to help more families cope with \nhigher heating costs this winter. Combined with LIHEAP emergency funds \nthat the Clinton Administration has already made available in \nanticipation of this winter's needs, I am hopeful that the regular and \nemergency LIHEAP funding contained in this budget deal should enable \nlow-income families to heat their homes throughout the winter that is \nalready upon us. I regret that this year's budget agreement does not \ncontain expected advance funding for the winter of 2002, so that \nfamilies can plan ahead for heating assistance next year. I intend to \ndo all I can to see that Congress corrects this omission as part of a \nsupplemental spending bill early next year or as part of the broader \nnational energy policy reevaluation likely to begin in the new \nCongress. For this winter, though, today's budget agreement remains a \nsignificant step forward for LIHEAP and the families who depend on it.\n\n\n                         NEW MARKETS INITIATIVE\n\n  The New Markets Initiative is another key bipartisan agreement \nincluded in this legislation. I am pleased that the Congress has joined \nPresident Clinton in his efforts to revitalize those communities that \nhave been left behind at this time of record prosperity, and I commend \nSpeaker Hastert for his leadership in reaching this agreement.\n\n  This initiative increases the low-income housing tax credit, which is \nlong overdue in light of its strong bipartisan support. With the \ngrowing regional and national economy, housing prices are rising faster \nin Massachusetts than in any other state. We must increase production \nin new affordable housing units to meet the overwhelming demand, and an \nincrease in the credit is critical. The agreement also accelerates the \nprivate activity bond cap, which will also support increased \ndevelopment of affordable housing, as well as industrial development.\n  The initiative also creates 40 Renewal Communities and 9 new \nEmpowerment Zones--all of which provide tax incentives for development \nin those parts of the country that have struggled while others have \nprospered.\n  Overall, this final budget agreement includes so many major \nachievements--from Class Size reduction to Pediatric Graduate Medical \nEducation to dislocated worker assistance to New Markets development--\nthat the value of each part will only become apparent over time. Yet \neven as we celebrate the progress made by this legislation, we must \nalso recognize that it is only a small part of the work that the public \nexpects us to complete. I share the concern of many of my colleagues \nthat the unfinished agenda of the 106th Congress is so long.\n  We still lack a Patients' Bill of Rights, leaving HMO's free to \nsacrifice families' health needs in favor of their own economic \ninterests.\n  We still lack a prescription drug benefit for seniors, leaving our \nparents and grandparents vulnerable to drug-company extortion for drugs \nthey need to stay alive.\n  We still lack a plan to reduce medical errors, leaving thousands of \nhospital patients to die needlessly each year.\n  We still lack a fair minimum wage, leaving people who work full time \nall year in difficult jobs to raise their children in poverty.\n  We still lack common-sense gun laws, leaving school children \nvulnerable to ambush.\n  We still lack strong laws against hate crimes, leaving the most \nvulnerable people in our society open to the most brutal acts \nimaginable.\n  We still lack basic fairness in many of our immigration laws, leaving \nour proud heritage and noble ideals out in the cold with so many \nhuddled masses.\n  We still lack the most basic protection for women's work, leaving \nmore women to raise their children in poverty because they consistently \nearn less than their male colleagues.\n  We still lack a plan to protect people's privacy in the digital age, \nleaving our medical, consumer, and other personal information exposed \nto market demands.\n  Also left unresolved are major Medicare and Social Security reforms \nthat must be enacted now if we are to avoid a crisis for the seniors of \n2025 and beyond. I also believe that we should still address how to \nprovide some tax relief for many families who bear a particular \nfinancial burden because they need to provide long term care for their \nloved ones.\n  Every item on this list remains of vital importance to the nation. I \nmust elaborate on a several of them.\n  Unfortunately, the leadership of the 106th Congress turned its back \non America's families who are raising children with disabilities. The \nFamily Opportunity Act has sweeping bipartisan support in both \nchambers, including more than three-fourths of the Senate. There is no \nreason that this legislation should not have become law this year. \nAlthough Congress let American families down this year, I look forward \nto working with Senator Grassley again next year to ensure that no \nfamily in this nation has to turn down jobs, turn down raises, or give \nup custody of their disabled child to get the health care each child \ndeserves.\n\n  Few issues touch Americans more deeply than quality health care for \nthemselves and their loved ones. This Congress failed to fulfill its \nresponsibility to act on three great health issues. It did not pass a \nstrong, effective patients' bill of rights to end the abuses of managed \ncare and other insurance programs. It did not provide coverage of \nprescription drugs under Medicare. And it did not significantly expand \ninsurance coverage for the uninsured. Now it is up to the new Congress \nthat will assemble in January to do better. These three issues should \nbe top priorities.\n  Prompt passage of a patients' bill of rights is critical for every \none of the 161 million Americans with private health insurance \ncoverage. Every day that Congress fails to act more patients suffer.\n  A survey by the School of Public Health at the University of \nCalifornia found that every day--each and every day--50,000 patients \nendure added pain and suffering because of their actions of their \nhealth plan. For 35,000 patients, needed care is delayed, or even \ndenied all together. Thirty-five thousand patients have a specialty \nreferral delayed or denied. Thirty-one thousand patients are forced to \nchange doctors. Eighteen thousand patients are forced to change \nmedications because of HMO abuses.\n  A survey of physicians by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the \nHarvard School of Public Health found similar results. Every day, tens \nof thousands of patients suffer serious declines in the their health as \nthe result of the action--or inaction--of their health plan.\n  Whether the issue is diagnostic tests, specialty care, emergency room \ncare, access to clinical trials, availability of needed drugs, \nprotection of doctors who give patients their best possible advice, or \nwomen's ability to obtain gynecological services--too often, in all \nthese cases, HMOs and managed care plans make the company's bottom line \nmore important than the patient's vital signs. These abuses should have \nno place in American medicine. Every doctor knows it. Every patient \nknows it. And in their hearts, every member of Congress knows it.\n  The House passed a Patient Bill of Rights--the Norwood-Dingell bill--\nthat effectively addressed these abuses. A solid bi-partisan majority \nof Congress supported the legislation. It is endorsed by 300 groups \nrepresenting doctors, nurses, patients and advocates for women, \nchildren, and families. But in the Senate, it has been blocked by the \ninsurance industry and the Republican leadership. The new Senate, the \nnew Congress, and the new President have an obligation to pass this \nlegislation into law.\n  This is an issue which hopefully, given the strong voting and \ninterests of our colleagues and their constituents, we will be able to \nresolve in a bipartisan way during the next Congress.\n  The Congress' failure to provide prescription drug coverage to our \nnation's senior citizens is also unacceptable. Senior citizens need a \nstrong drug benefit under Medicare. They earned it by a lifetime of \nhard work. They deserve it. And Congress and the new President owe it \nto them to act.\n  Too many elderly Americans today must choose between food on the \ntable\n\n[[Page S11820]]\n\nand the medicine they need to stay healthy or to treat their illnesses. \nToo many senior citizens take half the pills their doctor prescribes, \nor don't even fill needed prescriptions --because they can't afford the \nhigh cost of prescription drugs.\n  Too many seniors are paying twice as much as they should for the \ndrugs they need, because they are forced to pay full price, while \nalmost everyone with a private insurance policy benefits from \nnegotiated discounts. Too many seniors are ending up hospitalized--at \nimmense cost to Medicare--because they aren't receiving the drugs they \nneed at all, or can't afford to take them correctly. Pharmaceutical \nproducts are increasingly the source of miracle cures for a host of \ndread diseases, but millions of senior citizens are being left out and \nleft behind because Congress fails to act.\n\n  The crisis that senior citizens face today will only worsen if we \nrefuse to act, because insurance coverage continues to go down, and \ndrug costs continue to go up.\n  Twelve million senior citizens--one third of the total--have no \nprescription drug coverage at all. Surveys indicate that only half of \nall senior citizens have prescription drug coverage throughout the \nyear. Coverage through employer retirement plans is plummeting. \nMedicare HMOs are drastically cutting back. Medigap plans are priced \nout of reach of most seniors. The sad fact is that the only senior \ncitizens who have stable, reliable, affordable drug coverage are the \nvery poor on Medicaid.\n  Prescription drug costs themselves are out of control. Since 1996, \ncosts have grown at double-digit rates every year. Last year, the \nincrease was an unacceptable 16 percent, while the increase in the CPI \nwas only 2.7 percent. No wonder access to affordable prescription drugs \nhas become a crisis for so many elderly Americans\n  In the face of this declining coverage and soaring cost, more and \nmore senior citizens are being left out and left behind. The vast \nmajority of the elderly are of moderate means. They cannot possibly \nafford to purchase the prescription drugs they need if serious illness \nstrikes.\n  Fifty-seven percent of seniors have incomes below $15,000 a year, and \n78 percent have incomes below $25,000. Only 7 percent have incomes \nabove $50,000 a year. The older they are, the more likely they are to \nbe in poor health--and the more likely they are to have very limited \nincome to meet their health needs.\n  Few if any issues facing the next Congress are more important than \ngiving the nation's senior citizens the health security they have been \npromised. The promise of Medicare will not be fulfilled until Medicare \nprotects senior citizens against the high cost of prescription drugs, \nin the same way that it protects them against the high cost of hospital \nand doctor care.\n  Despite the gaps in Medicare and the abuses of many private insurance \nplans, those who have insurance coverage from these sources are still \nmore fortunate than the 43 million of their fellow citizens who have no \nhealth insurance at all.\n  It's a national disgrace that so many Americans find the quality of \ntheir health determined by the quantity of their wealth. In this age of \nthe life sciences, the importance of good medical care in curing \ndisease and improving and extending life is more significant than ever. \nDenying any family the health care they need is unacceptable.\n  Every other industrialized society in the world except South Africa \nachieved that goal in the 20th century--and under Nelson Mandela and \nThabo Mbeki, South Africa has taken giant steps toward universal health \ncare today. But in our country, the law of the jungle still too often \nprevails. Forty-three million of our fellow citizens are left out and \nleft behind when it comes to health insurance.\n  The dishonor roll of suffering created by this national problem is a \nlong one.\n  Children fail to get a healthy start in life because their parents \ncannot afford the eyeglasses or hearing aids or doctor's visits they \nneed.\n  A young family loses its chance to participate in the American dream, \nwhen a breadwinner is crippled or dies because of lack of timely access \nto medical care.\n  A teenager is condemned to go without a college education, because \nthe family's income and energy are sucked away by the high financial \nand emotional cost of uninsured illness.\n\n  An older couple sees its hope for a dignified retirement dashed, when \nthe savings of a lifetime are washed away by a tidal wave of medical \ndebt.\n  Even in this time of unprecedented prosperity, more than 200,000 \nAmericans annually file for bankruptcy because of uninsured medical \ncosts. And the human costs of being uninsured are often just as \ndevastating.\n  In any given year, one third of the uninsured go without needed \nmedical care.\n  Eight million uninsured Americans fail to take the medication that \ntheir doctor prescribes, because they cannot afford to fill the \nprescription.\n  Four hundred thousand children suffer from asthma but never see a \ndoctor. Five hundred thousand children with recurrent earaches never \nsee a doctor. Another five hundred thousand children with severe sore \nthroats never see a doctor.\n  Thirty-two thousand Americans with heart disease go without life-\nsaving and life-enhancing bypass surgery or angioplasty--because they \nare uninsured.\n  Twenty-seven thousand uninsured women are diagnosed with breast \ncancer each year. They are twice as likely as insured women not to \nreceive medical treatment before their cancer has already spread to \nother parts of their bodies. As a result, they are 50 percent more \nlikely to die of the disease.\n  Overall, eighty-three thousand Americans die each year because they \nhave no insurance. The lack of insurance is the seventh leading cause \nof death in America today. Our failure to provide health insurance for \nevery citizen kills more people than kidney disease, liver disease, and \nAIDS combined.\n  Passage of the CHIP program in 1997 opened the door of health \ninsurance to a large majority of the 10 million uninsured children--but \ntoo many children eligible for CHIP and Medicaid have still not been \nenrolled. Legislation I sponsored with Congressman John Dingell would \nhave substantially increased enrollment of eligible children in CHIP. \nIt would have encouraged states to make more children eligible, and \nwould have provided assistance to the low and moderate income uninsured \nparents of these uninsured children. This legislation received a vote \nof the majority of the members of the Senate, but it was defeated on a \nprocedural motion.\n  Today, our opportunity to end these millions of American tragedies is \ngreater than ever before. Our prosperous economy gives us large new \nresources to invest in meeting this critical need. Recently, some \nRepublicans in Congress have finally joined Democrats in urging our \ncountry to meet the challenge of providing health coverage to the 43 \nmillion Americans who are left out and left behind. President-elect \nGeorge Bush and Vice President Al Gore both campaigned on a pledge to \nexpand health insurance coverage for the uninsured. I regret that this \nCongress did not take substantial steps to end this American tragedy, \nbut it should be at the top of the agenda of the new Congress and the \nnew Administration.\n  The minimum wage ranks at the top of the list as well. Our leader, in \na meeting of our Democratic caucus, indicated this afternoon that one \nof his great disappointments in this session is failing to provide an \nincrease in the minimum wage for the 13 million Americans who need and \ndeserve an increase. The last time we increased it was 1997. We have \nhad unparalleled economic prosperity before and since. We have had \nrecord low unemployment. We have had stability in inflation. It is \ninexcusable that we have not increased the minimum wage for these \nworkers. I am strongly committed to working with our colleagues to \naddress that situation in the new Congress.\n  I join our Democratic leader in expressing my deep disappointment in \nthe failure of this Congress to increase the minimum wage. A fair \nincrease is long overdue. It is urgently needed to improve the lives of \nover ten million hard-working, low-wage earners in this country. It is \nshameful that Congress is holding the increase hostage to tax cuts for \nthe wealthy. It is even more shameful that Congress recently acted to \nraise its own pay for the third time\n\n[[Page S11821]]\n\nin four years--yet they have not found time in the past three years to \ngive any pay increase at all to the lowest paid workers.\n\n  The long period of inaction comes at a time when the country as a \nwhole is enjoying unprecedented prosperity--the longest period of \neconomic growth in the nation's history and the lowest unemployment \nrate in three decades. In these strong economic times, Congress should \nnot be acting like Scrooge.\n  Millions of low income workers have dedicated their lives to building \nthis strong economy. Yet, in many cases they have been forced to labor \nfor increasingly longer and longer hours, with less and less time to \nspend with their families, and without sharing fairly in the nation's \nprosperity. Poverty has almost doubled among full-time, year-round \nworkers since the late 1970s--from about 1.5 million then to almost 3 \nmillion in 1998--and an unacceptably low minimum wage is part of the \nproblem.\n  Minimum wage employees working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, earn \nonly $10,700 a year--$3,400 below the poverty line for a family of \nthree. At that rate, minimum wage workers now fail to earn enough to \nafford adequate housing in any area of this country. Waitresses, \nteacher's aides, child care workers, elder care workers and all other \nemployees deserve to be paid fairly for the work they do. No one who \nworks for a living should have to live in poverty.\n  By failing to increase the minimum wage, Congress has broken its \npromise to American workers. We are denying them just compensation for \ntheir many contributions to building a strong nation and a strong \neconomy.\n  We have broken our promise to women, since 60 percent of minimum wage \nearners are women.\n  We have broken our promise to people of color, because 16 percent of \nthose who would benefit from a minimum wage increase are African \nAmerican and 20 percent of those who would be helped are Hispanic.\n  We have broken our promise to children, because 33 percent of minimum \nwage earners are parents with children. In America today, 4.3 million \nchildren live in poverty, despite living in a family where someone \nworks full-time, year-round.\n  And we have broken our promise to the American family, because too \nmany parents are required to spend more and more time away from their \nfamilies to make ends meet. On average, Americans are working 416 more \nhours in 1999 then they were in 1979.\n  Each year we fail to act on the minimum wage, families across the \ncountry fall farther behind. As the result of not implementing the \ndollar increase we first proposed three years ago, when the clock \nstrikes midnight on the December 31st, minimum wage workers will have \nlost over $3000 because of the inaction by Congress. Today, the real \nvalue of the minimum wage is now $2.90 below what it was in 1968. To \nhave the purchasing power it had in 1968, the minimum wage would have \nto be at least $8.05 an hour today, not $5.15.\n  We will never give up or give in on this issue, because it is an \nissue of fundamental fairness. We will be back next year with a new \nbill to raise the minimum wage. I hope that the new Congress will act \nas quickly as possible to pass a fair increase that reflects the losses \nsuffered as the result of our shameful inaction this year.\n  President-Elect Bush has emphasized many of these priorities, and I \nlook forward to working with him. The lesson of the legislation before \nus today is that when we fail to consider each other's ideas, only \ngridlock results--but when we work together for the nation's good, the \nresult is the kind of progress that makes us all proud to serve the \nAmerican people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham).

Mr. President, 3 years ago, during a visit by a \nconstituent, I met a young man from southern New Jersey named Kevin \nO'Donnell. I have shared his story with the Senate before. But on this \nday, having met with some success, I share it with you again.\n  Five years ago, Kevin was 31 years old. He was a young father, a \nhusband of a lovely woman, and in perfect health. He took his daughter \nskiing one day and upon returning home felt a pain in his leg. It \ncontinued over a period of time, bothering him, so he went to visit the \ndoctor. You can only imagine the shock when this perfectly healthy \nyoung man--father of this little girl--discovered he had been stricken \nwith ALS, known to most of us as Lou Gehrig's disease.\n  Since that day, Kevin O'Donnell's wife and daughter have watched the \nlife flow out of his body. Going from a healthy young man, they watched \nhim lose control of his legs and arms, the ability to speak, and even \nthe ability to breathe. Life simply evaporated from Kevin O'Donnell's \nbody.\n  When he came in to see me those years ago, he had a very simple \nrequest--so logical I could not conceive of an argument against it. \nWhile he was waiting to die, not only was his life leaving him but the \nfinancial security of his family. Nursing care, medical assistance, \nthings to ease the pain, to maintain some dignity in life, to provide \nrelief for his wife and his family, were costing thousands of dollars.\n  But under the rules of Medicare, he could not begin to receive any \nassistance for 2 years. The life expectancy for 90 percent of ALS \nsufferers is only 3 years, 4 years. Most of the people who have ALS do \nnot live beyond the waiting period in Medicare to get help. This never \ncould have been anticipated. It never could have been even imagined by \npeople in Medicare when these regulations were written. And because \nthere is no other disease quite like it, the regulations have never \nbeen changed.\n  A person can have heart disease or cancer, and they may be at great \nrisk, but they can live 2 years. With the right treatment, they can \nlive 5, 10, 20 years; at least the chances are always good. With ALS, \nthe outcome of the disease is nearly certain that the life expectancy \nis not long and most will not live to ever see their first dollar of \nGovernment help.\n  I brought this cause to many of my colleagues in the Congress. There \nare 28 Members in the Senate--16 Democrats and 12 Republicans--and over \n280 Democrats and Republicans in the House of Representatives who have \njoined in this effort to help those people around the country who are \nstricken with Lou Gehrig's disease.\n  Today, I rise to thank Senator Lott and Speaker Hastert for their \ngenerous help, and Congressman Gephardt, Senator Daschle, Senator Byrd, \nSenator Reid--the bipartisan leadership--for offering some help to \nthose who suffer from this disease in this country.\n  But most importantly, I am also very indebted to President Clinton, \nwho made this a critical priority in budget negotiations. Specifically, \nI thank members of the White House staff, Chris Jennings and Rich \nTarplin, who, under the President's direction, fought to give some help \nto these Lou Gehrig's disease patients.\n  I have spoken on this floor many times about this cause. For me, this \nwas a victory that was going to be won before this session of Congress \nended--no matter what.\n  When I began this effort some years ago, I stood outside the Senate \nChamber with people in wheelchairs, stricken with ALS, in a variety of \nconditions. As I stand here today to declare victory, I am mindful of \nthe fact that most of those who stood with me when this effort began \nare now deceased. With their own lives, they proved the\n\n[[Page S11822]]\n\nimportance of the legislation. They said they could not live the 2 \nyears to ever receive the Medicare assistance to help ease the \nfinancial burden on their families. Most of them proved it with their \nlives.\n  Today, the CBO estimates that there are 17,000 ALS patients waiting \nto become eligible for Medicare. With the passage of this bill, their \nwait will end, and with it the anguish of calculating how to afford the \n$250,000 in annual medical bills while they are also dealing with the \nanguish of their disease.\n  For me, it is the end of a long fight, where I can tell Kevin \nO'Donnell: You began it, you fought it, and we won. And in your victory \ncomes relief for 17,000 people just like you.\n  To all my colleagues who have helped, I give you my most sincere \nthanks and leave you with the words of former President Thomas \nJefferson, in 1809, who said about service in Government:\n\n       The care of human life and happiness . . . is the first and \n     only legitimate object of good government.\n\n  Mr. President, there is relief for ALS patients in this bill. That is \ngood government.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11822-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is with great sorrow, but also great \npride, that this Senate retires one of its most eloquent, learned, and \nsuccessful Members--the senior Senator from New York, Daniel Patrick \nMoynihan.\n  I have known my distinguished colleague for over two decades, \nadmiring his compassion, his dedication, and his acumen on key issues, \nfrom environmental protection to social, racial, and economic justice \nfor all. It has been an honor and education to have worked with him on \nthe critical issues of eradicating poverty, elevating human rights, and \npromoting peace around the world. He and I have also worked together \ncloser to home, protecting and restoring the precious waters of Lake \nChamplain--a glacially-carved jewel of New England that spans 120 \nnorthern miles between our neighboring states, half claimed on my side, \nhalf claimed on his.\n  Twenty-four years of distinguished service in the United States \nSenate would be a legacy in and of itself for any man. Yet my \ncolleague, Senator Moynihan, has done so much more. He served our \ncountry for a full twenty years in the Naval Reserve, with three years \nof active Navy duty at the end of the second World War. He has been a \nFulbright Scholar and a professor of government at Harvard University. \nHe has the unique distinction of serving in four successive \nPresidential administrations--the only person in American history to \nhave ever done so. He represented our country as a distinguished \nAmbassador to India, a representative to the United Nations, and \nPresident of the U.N. Security Council. He has served on countless \npublic and private sector commissions, committees, and panels, \naddressing issues from education to science to finance. Most recently, \nhe chaired the Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government \nSecrecy--a key commission that examined our nation's secrecy laws and \nled to his authorship of ``Secrecy: The American Experience.'' This \nbook joins the seventeen other works of literature that my friend and \ncolleague has written or edited.\n  What I will miss in many ways are those special times we would have \nwhen some Members would gather in the Senate dining room and a person \nwould bring up a question of history; then we would receive a tutorial \nfrom Professor Moynihan. I see my good friend, the deputy Democratic \nleader, on the floor, the Senator from Nevada, smiling because he knows \nwhat those were like. I recall a couple times when we had so many \nDemocrats and Republicans crowded into the Democratic part of the \ndining room to hear Senator Moynihan tie together something from the \ntime of Franklin Roosevelt through Ronald Reagan, to the current time, \nand show what the connection was, somebody would have to call up to the \nSenate Chamber and explain, keep the rollcall going a bit longer; at \nleast a quorum of the Senate has to hear the end of this story before \nwe can come to vote.\n  My good friend will be missed in the Senate, but I wish him well and \nenvy him the time he will now have to spend with his lovely wife of 44 \nyears, Liz, his three wonderful children, and his precious \ngrandchildren. I join the entire Senate and this Nation in wishing \nSenator Moynihan well in his new life and commending him for his \ntireless dedication and service to the people of this country and our \nworld.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11822-3", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LINCOLN HIGHWAY STUDY ACT OF 1999\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n           DILLONWOOD GIANT SEQUOIA GROVE PARK EXPANSION ACT\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, last January we were told that Senator Bob \nKerrey was going to retire from the Senate this year. I remember saying \nto him that I wished it were not so, but knowing Bob as well as I did, \nI understood the reasons.\n  Bob Kerrey has been an invaluable Member of this body. He has \nadvocated for improvements in education. He has worked in a bipartisan \nway to reform Medicare and has been willing to speak up about the \nthings necessary to reform it. He has helped to improve the lives of \nfarmers in Nebraska. And he has been a forceful voice on America's role \nthroughout the world.\n  But I understand and respect his desire to fulfill those spiritual \nneeds that are often ignored in politics and to focus more on his \npersonal and family life. As a proud father and grandfather, I, too, \nwant to spend time with family. So we can all respect and appreciate \nhis decision, though we are going to miss his candor, his wit, and his \nstrong advocacy for families and children in the Senate. I will miss \none who was willing to stand up on the most explosive issues of our \ntime and speak out forthrightly, whether popular or not.\n  He served this country well as a member of the elite Navy Seals in \nVietnam, was Governor of Nebraska, and a U.S. Senator for two terms.\n  I once heard him refer to it modestly as ``whatever,'' but the \n``whatever'' was the Congressional Medal of Honor he earned for service \nin Vietnam. It is a testament to his strength in the face of adversity \nand intense love he has for this country. It is a call he brought with \nhim to the Senate.\n  A photograph I took once sticks in my mind. It was of Bob Kerrey at \nthe Inaugural, standing--suit, tie, overcoat, hat--and around his neck \nwas something that very few Americans ever got to wear, the \nCongressional Medal of Honor. It is not something about which any of us \never heard Bob brag. But it has been my experience that people who win \nthe Congressional Medal of Honor are really never the people who do \nbrag.\n  I thought that here, in these extraordinary times of our Nation's \nhistory, every 4 years the Inauguration of a President, what Bob was \nsaying was: I am standing up as an American saying how proud we are of \nthis democracy as we go forward with our form of government--a \ngovernment and a country he risked his life to defend.\n  What has he accomplished at this short time? Vice chairman of the \nSenate Select Committee on Intelligence where he protected and defended \nour national security interests and fought for issues from encryption \nto better intelligence. As cochairman of the IRS restructuring \ncommittee, Bob spearheaded reform legislation designed to improve the \nrelationships between taxpayers and the IRS, something that affects \nevery single American. On the Agriculture Committee, he and I fought \nhard to protect family farmers in our Nation. Even if we had regional \ndifferences which might divide us, his advocacy was always so strong, \nyou had to listen.\n  His next move is north, actually getting a little closer to my home, \nwhere he is going to become president of the New School University in \nNew York. The New School has a reputation for intellectual freedom and \ninnovation, the belief that education can be used as a tool to produce \npositive changes in society. There cannot be a better leader for the \nNew School. This really is a case where the Senate's loss is the New \nSchool's gain.\n  I first met Bob Kerrey when he was running for the Senate and I went \nout to Nebraska as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee to \ncampaign for him along with the Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Jim Exon. \nWhen we went out--Bob Kerrey probably won't mind me mentioning this--we \nwere using Willie Nelson's airplane. Bob Kerrey was the former Governor \nof Nebraska, extremely popular, well known, running for the U.S. \nSenate; Jim Exon, then the senior Senator of Nebraska, former Governor; \nand of course in farm country, I was there wearing my hat as chairman \nof the Senate Agriculture Committee.\n  We flew up to a small town in Nebraska in Willie Nelson's airplane. \nThe tail insignia was well known. When we got off that airplane, a huge \ncrowd was gathered. We thought: Boy, this is it: Former Governor \nKerrey, Senator Jim Exon, Chairman Patrick Leahy. Man, no wonder they \nturned out.\n  As we got off the plane, they kept looking and kept looking, until \nfinally it was obvious we were all off the plane. There was a look of \ndisappointment in the crowd. Finally, somebody expressed the \ndisappointment: Where's Willie Nelson? I thought you guys had Willie \nNelson with you.\n  But, notwithstanding the fact that I was partially responsible for \ndisappointing the crowd, Bob Kerrey's abilities and brilliance were so \nwell known in Nebraska that he survived my campaigning for him and he \nwon that seat resoundingly and served his second term. We have been \nfriends ever since.\n  I admire him as I have admired few people in my public career. I hate \nto see him go.\n  As I said, I was saddened to learn that Bob Kerrey was retiring from \nthe Senate this year. Bob Kerrey has been an invaluable Member of this \nbody, advocating for improvements in education, working to reform \nMedicare, and helping to improve the lives of farmers in Nebraska. But \nI understand and respect his desire to fulfill spiritual needs that are \noften ignored in politics and to focus more on his personal and family \nlife. As a proud father and grandfather, I know what it's like to long \nto spend time with family. We can all respect and appreciate his \ndecision, though we will miss his candor, his wit, and his strong \nadvocacy for families and children in the Senate.\n  Bob Kerrey has served his country well as a member of the elite Navy \nSEALs in Vietnam, as Governor of Nebraska, and as a United States \nSenator for two terms. Though I once heard him refer to it modestly as \n``whatever,'' the Congressional Medal of Honor he earned for service in \nVietnam is a testament to his strength in the face of adversity and an \nintense love for this country, qualities he has brought with him to the \nSenate.\n  In this body, he has accomplished a great deal in a short time. As \nthe vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Bob \ncontinued to protect and defend our national security interests, \nfighting for strong encryption measures. As a co-chairman of the IRS \nRestructuring Committee, Bob spearheaded reform legislation designed to \nimprove the relationship between taxpayers and the IRS. On the \nAgriculture Committee, Bob and I fought hard together to protect family \nfarmers in our Nation. Though regional differences sometimes divided \nus, I respected Bob's strong advocacy for farmers in Nebraska.\n  Bob's next move is north, where he will plan to become president of \nNew School University in New York. The New School has a reputation for \nintellectual freedom, innovation and the belief that education can be \nused as a tool to produce positive changes in society. I could not \nthink of a better leader for the New School. The Senate's loss is their \ngain.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11823-2", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11823-S11824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SENATOR CHUCK ROBB\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier today Senator Chuck Robb of \nVirginia spoke on this floor. I worked with him. I have admired him \nsince he came to the Senate over 12 years ago. I talked with this \nformer marine at the time my own son joined the Marine Corps and was \ntouched that he always asked for progress reports on his career in the \nMarines.\n  He is only the fourth person from the State of Virginia to serve as \nboth Governor and U.S. Senator, and he came to Washington ready to \nbuild on a distinguished career in public service. In 1961, he joined \nthe Marines as an infantry company commander in Vietnam, saw combat, \nand was in harm's way time and time again. He demonstrated the kind of \ndetermination and stamina that would characterize his political career. \nIn Vietnam, people depended on his leadership for their life, \nliterally. He then served Virginia as Lieutenant Governor and Governor \nbefore being elected to the U.S. Senate. In fact, it is fair to say his \ntenure as Governor laid the basis for Virginia to become such a leader \ntoday in the high-tech industry.\n  During his time here in Washington, he has shown his dedication and \nconcern for our men and women in the military, fighting for a strong \ndefense\n\n[[Page S11824]]\n\nwhile advocating fiscal responsibility. He has been a proponent for \nimprovement in our Nation's public schools, fighting for more teachers, \nincreased school construction, and school safety. He has also been a \nchampion against discrimination. He led the fight to end injustice to \nAfrican American farmers who faced discrimination by the Agriculture \nDepartment and voted against moves to end affirmative action programs \nby the Federal Government. In all these things, he showed the same \ndedication to his country in a legislative position that he had shown \nto his State in his executive position as Governor, as a member of the \nArmed Services Committee, Foreign Relations and Finance Committees, and \nthe Joint Economic Committee and Select Committee on Intelligence. He \nserved this body, the Senate, so well, and in turn our whole Nation.\n  I think of the tough political battles he has faced. I think of the \ndifficult votes during his time in office, how he had to balance the \ninterests of his State with the well-being of the Nation. But I can \nremember so many times on this floor when a vote would come up where, \npolitically, Chuck Robb could have ducked and ran and voted a different \nway. He did not, anymore than he would have when he was in combat in \nVietnam. He would stay on the floor, he would state his position, and \nyou would see the marine; you would see the character; you would see \nthe steel. He would stand up and do what his conscience told him was \nthe right thing.\n  Mr. President, I pay tribute to a man I have worked with and admired \nsince he came to the Senate over twelve years ago. As only the fourth \nperson from the state of Virginia to serve as both Governor and U.S. \nSenator Chuck Robb came to Washington ready to build on a distinguished \ncareer in public service. Beginning in 1961 when he joined the Marines, \nand through his days as an infantry company commander in Vietnam, Chuck \nRobb demonstrated the kind of determination and stamina that would \ncharacterize his political career. He later served Virginia as \nLieutenant Governor and Governor before being elected to the United \nStates Senate.\n  During his time here in Washington he has shown his dedication and \nconcern for our men and women in the military, fighting for a strong \ndefense while advocating fiscal responsibility. He has been a proponent \nfor improving our nation's public schools, fighting for more teachers, \nincreased school construction and school safety. He has also been a \nchampion in the battle to end discrimination. He led the fight to bring \njustice to African American farmers who had faced discrimination by the \nAgriculture Department, and he voted against a move to end affirmative \naction programs by the federal government.

Mr. President, you know I think the world of all my \ncolleagues. The distinguished Chair right now is one of my best friends \nin the Senate and one who deserves congratulations on--actually, they \ndidn't have to have an election in his State; he wins by so much. I \nlove being with him, as I do my dear friend from Nevada, the deputy \nDemocratic whip. But I hope that neither of my colleagues takes it at \nall personally when I say I would probably rather be at home with my \nfamily at this time of the year. But then I suspect they would, too. I \nhope this means we are soon to wrap things up, possibly this evening or \nSunday or Monday or sometime. We seem to be in a situation where \nwrapping up the session is like wrapping up the Presidential election \nthis year. I am beginning to feel a little bit like a hanging chad of \nsome sort.\n  I thought of some of the other terms that have been used, but I am \nafraid sometime somebody might pull that out of context and I will be \nreminded that I will not be forgiven for what I may say because of my \nIrish nature.\n  Let us hope we can wrap it up. I say that also for the sake of the \nPresident-elect and the leadership, both Republican and Democrat, in \nthe Senate. All of us have a lot of work to do before January 3 when \nthe Senate comes back into session with a number of new Senators and in \na unique situation of a 50-50 Senate.\n  Governor Bush and former Secretary Cheney need time to work with the \nRepublicans in the Senate and the House as they put together their \nadministration. Of course, I hope and expect they will also be in \ncontact with those of us on this side of the aisle. There is a lot \nfacing this Nation, and we have to work on that.\n\n\n                            VISIT TO IRELAND\n\n  I was privileged this week to spend 48 hours out of the country with \nsome other Members of the Senate and the House accompanying President \nClinton on a visit to the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. It \nwas remarkable to see how people reacted to the President. He was \naccompanied by one of our Senators-elect, in this case the Senator-\nelect from New York, Hillary Rodham Clinton, although I think she was \nthere more in her capacity as First Lady.\n  It was interesting to see the reaction of the people in Ireland, both \nin the Republic and in Northern Ireland, both in the Catholic community \nand the Protestant community. The President was greeted as he should \nbe, as a hero in Ireland because more than any President perhaps since \nJohn Fitzgerald Kennedy, he has shown a real interest in Ireland.\n  He has become personally and intimately involved in trying to stop \nthe sectarian damage, carnage, killings, and murders in Northern \nIreland. He sent our distinguished former colleague and former majority \nleader of the Senate, George Mitchell, on countless trips to Northern \nIreland helping to broker the peace agreement which became known as the \nGood Friday accords.\n  Whether it was standing in the small town on the northern border of \nthe Republic of Ireland, bordering Northern Ireland, a town of just a \nfew thousand people but where 50,000 to 60,000 people from the whole \narea came and stood in the cold, the rain, and the fog for hour after \nhour waiting for the President and those accompanying him to arrive, \nand then giving him a hero's welcome and not wanting him to leave.\n  I saw the faces of those people. I saw the children who looked out to \nhim with hope in their eyes. I saw the older people who said he sought \nto bring prosperity to this area because he helped us stop the fighting \nthat goes back and forth across the border. He has brought hope for our \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  I saw the same thing in Northern Ireland in Belfast the next day \nwhere those who had been sworn enemies a few years ago were joining in \nmeetings with the President, encouraging him to stay involved and \nasking him to please come back even after his Presidency. It had to be \nan emotional time for President Clinton, but it was very much for the \npeople there.\n  I talked with several who again told me he brought hope for them and\n\n[[Page S11825]]\n\nbrought an understanding that their children could live in a world they \nhad not known, a world where they could go to school, where they would \nnot be defined by their religion but defined by who they are.\n  What an improvement that was and how grateful I am for the \nopportunity to have been there, not just as an Irish American but one \nwho holds deeply our sense of freedom, our sense of democracy, and our \nsense that people do not get excluded because of their religious faith \nor their ethnic background or who their parents were but are included \nbecause they are human beings and because they have intrinsic worth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11825-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RETIREMENT OF SENATOR RICHARD H. BRYAN\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, with my dear friend from Nevada, Senator \nReid, on the floor, I want to talk about his colleague, also my friend, \nRichard Bryan, who announced his plans to retire from the Senate. When \nhe did, he said very simply and earnestly: It's time to come home.\n  I have known Dick and Bonnie Bryan since they came here. I say Dick \nand Bonnie Bryan because, like Marcelle and me, we think of them as one \nperson because usually at events outside work, when you see one you see \nthe other. In fact, that is what I cherish about both my colleagues \nfrom Nevada. I cherish their family life.\n  Dick said it is time to go home, and I am disappointed to learn we \nare going to lose a good humored and skillful colleague. As a \nVermonter, I have to empathize with that deep-rooted impulse to go \nhome. Everything Dick Bryan has accomplished here paves the way for his \nreturn to a better Nevada, something all of us hope for because all of \nus will leave this body at one time or another.\n  Most of the time, the strength of our Nation stood resolutely with \nthe welfare of Nevada in Senator Bryan's mind. As Democratic cochair of \nthe Senate National Guard Caucus, he blocked unwise and unjustifiable \ncuts in our citizen-soldier force. He brought us together so the \nGuard's voice could be heard, and his persistence has positioned this \ninvaluable force to prepare for the new, continually emerging strategic \nlandscape. Under his watch, Nellis Air Force Base became a national \ntreasure, where our best, most skilled pilots mastered the art of war \nso that our country would never have to call on them for the real \nthing.\n  Senator Bryan guaranteed the credibility of the institution of the \nSenate. I think of the Senate as being the conscience of the Nation, \nand we should be the guardians of it. Those who abused the public's \ntrust and the powers of office, as Senators knew they would, received \nintense scrutiny when Senator Bryan chaired the Ethics Committee in \n1993 and 1994. None of us will forget his calm and dexterous handling \nof numerous sensitive investigations, something he could do because he \nwas trusted by both Republicans and Democrats to do the right thing.\n  It had to be one of the most difficult times, requiring arduous work \nby any Senator, but never once did any of us hear Senator Bryan \ncomplain about the difficult task, nor did he swerve from the steady \ncourse toward fairness and justice.\n  Indeed, in so many areas, Richard Bryan made a difference whether in \npreserving the fragile desert environment or modernizing our commercial \naviation system. The list is long, and if he stayed, he would have \naccomplished even more.\n  Senator Bryan has made a choice that deserves only accolades and \nrespect. He is going home, and Nevada is a fortunate State for it. It \nis also fortunate that he has left his partner, Harry Reid, here to \ncarry on his battles. My wife Marcelle and I wish Dick and his wife \nBonnie all the best, but I am going to miss some of our late night \nconversations and some of the humor and good will he has shown to all \nSenators.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11825-2", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11825-S11826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have just spoken to Senator Daschle. We \nhave been communicating with our colleagues on the other side of the \nCapitol. I understand the Senate will shortly receive from the House \nthe appropriations bill containing the final appropriations measures, \nand we hope to have some agreement on how to proceed shortly.\n  We will notify Senators and hotline that information. Once Senator \nDaschle arrives on the floor, hopefully we can move forward with that. \nIn the meantime, there are just a couple of bits of information for our \ncolleagues about the remainder of this session and the dates for \nactivities we will have next year.\n  Of course, we hope to have the sine die adjournment resolution here \nshortly.\n  Senator Daschle and I jointly will have resolutions thanking the \nofficers of the Senate, the staff of the Senate who do just a \nmagnificent job on our behalf and on behalf of the American people \nquite often during long and weird hours. They really do a magnificent \njob, and we thank all of them for what they do.\n  Also, I see Senator Reid is here, the assistant Democratic leader. He \nhas really made a difference since he has been in his leadership \nposition. He is always calm and always diligent. He works on both sides \nof the aisle. I want to acknowledge that and thank him for all of his \nwork. I will not overdo it now because I don't want to get him into \ntrouble as we approach the last few minutes of the session.\n  I want to inform the Members of some important dates and events of \ninterest concerning the beginning of the 107th Congress. I see Senator \nDaschle is here. He can communicate with the staff. I will run over \nthese dates quickly, and then we can visit.\n  Of course, at 12 noon on Wednesday, January 3, the 107th Congress \nwill convene with an immediate live quorum, to be followed by the \nswearing-in ceremonies for the newly elected Senators.\n  I want to emphasize that. That is on January 3. It is at 12 noon. \nThere will be a live quorum, and all Senators are required by law, if \nthey want to be sworn in and receive pay, to be here for that occasion.\n  On Saturday, January 6, the Senate will proceed as a body to the Hall \nof the House of Representatives for the official counting of the \nelectoral college votes.\n  The Senate has passed a resolution that would move that to January 5, \nwhich would be a Friday, instead of Saturday, January 6. The House has \nnot yet passed that resolution. But they have indicated that they may \npass a resolution changing the date to Friday, January 5, for the \ncounting of the electoral college votes. We will let all of our \ncolleagues know exactly about that.\n  I believe we are required to proceed at 1 p.m. on either Friday, \nJanuary 5, or, as it now stands, January 6. We will make that clear \nlater on. Senators will be notified if there is a date change, if and \nwhen it is confirmed.\n  Of course, Inauguration of the 43rd President of the United States \nwill occur at 12 noon on Saturday, January 20.\n  Furthermore, because a Senate committee is a continuing body, \ncommittees may begin working on committee nominations on January 5 or \n6. Senator Daschle and I will be working on that. But there is the \npossibility, between January 3 and the Inauguration, that there could \nbe some committee hearings on nominations. We will have to work through \nthat. Of course, it will depend on the receipt of those nominations \nonce the investigations have been completed. We will work through what \ncommittees and how that will be handled. Members who might be involved \nwill be notified as early as possible, and hopefully that will be even \nbefore the end of the year.\n\n  Votes on confirmations may take place even on Saturday, January 20. I \nbelieve that has been the case in the past--if not January 20, \ncertainly beginning on Monday, January 22. We will want to move forward \nvery quickly on actually confirming the nominations. Senators will be \nfurther notified on January 3.\n\n[[Page S11826]]\n\n  Regarding the Cabinet nominations schedule, when we receive those \nnominations, again we will work together on what that schedule may be.\n  Again, I want to thank the Senate officers, Senators, and leadership \non both sides of the aisle for what I believe has been a very \nproductive session and for the dedication of Senators to the American \npeople.\n  I see Senator Daschle is here. We have some resolutions we can do if \nwe have a break here in a moment. Then we will have some that we want \nto do at the very end of the session.\n  At this point, I yield the floor if Senator Lautenberg wishes to make \nany comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG.

Mr. President, I want to be sure before I go into my \nremarks that neither of the leaders, the majority leader or the \nDemocratic leader, is waiting for some floor time for some special \nthings they want to go ahead with because I hope not to cover every day \nof the 18 years I have served here.\n  But I do want to make some remarks about this moment in time --a \nmoment that I have kind of looked at with some amount of trepidation \nbecause this is the end for me, at the bottom of the ninth inning, and \nwe have a couple of things to do before it is pretty much all over.\n  I am probably speaking now for the last time in the U.S. Senate. \nAfter 18 years as a Member of this institution, some time ago I made a \nreluctant decision to step down--not to try again after three terms. \nAnd, to be perfectly honest, there are those moments when I look at \nthat decision not to run for a fourth term with considerable regret. \nThis has been an incredible experience--an experience that so few ever \nget to have and such a worthwhile thing to do.\n  While my friends, the Democratic leader and the Democratic whip, are \non the floor, I want to express to each one of them how deep my \nappreciation is for the cooperation and the ability to work together on \nissues of concern--not just for my State but for the country at large--\nand how helpful Senator Daschle, our leader, has been; and my good \nfriend Harry Reid from Nevada, the only State that really competes with \nNew Jersey in the hospitality of the gaming industry. I hope we will \ncontinue to do more business than Nevada.\n  In all seriousness, these are States that have a certain kinship that \nis not always easy to recognize because our coast is far larger than \ntheir coast, and sometimes we differ on issues but never on intent.\n  This is a job that has been the highlight of my life, next to my \nfamily--my children, my grandchildren, eight of them; the oldest is \nseven. I want to make sure they understood what their grandfather did \nwhen he was spending time in Washington. They are too young to really \nknow what the job is about. But they know who the President of the \nUnited States is. Some of them knew because the oldest one is seven. \nThere are eight of them, obviously, and one is just 2 months old. The \nlittle one could not understand what I have done. I was lucky and \nbrought all of them down for Father's Day. I was able to take them to \nthe White House and take some pictures with the President. They will \nlook at these pictures one day and say, OK, that is where our \ngrandfather spent his time when we didn't see much of him. I hope they \nwill feel the same kind of pride and love for country as I do.\n  This job, one of some 1,850 people who ever served in the Senate, is \nsuch an honor to have. It is such an exciting place to be. I look at my \ndesk now as a reminder of why I had this desk moved as my seniority \nimproved from the far corner next to where it is now. I brought it with \nme wherever I went. It was a fairly easy task. I don't want the \ncitizens to think I had people put to work for little reason; just a \ncouple of screws lift out of the floor and we move it over here.\n  When I think of my parents and what this country meant to my \ngrandparents when they brought my parents as little children to these \nshores, I open the desk. As everyone here knows but the public probably \ndoesn't, there is something one could call ``graffiti'' in these \ndesks--a signature, a carving, a writing in indelible ink that gives a \nname and the State that the individual represented. I never got \ndiscouraged about this job, but anytime I needed a little stimulation \nabout how important the work we were doing was outside of the \nlegislative routine, I looked in this desk and I seen ``Truman, \nMissouri.'' Harry Truman sat at this desk when he served in the Senate. \nIt is such an honor for me to be able to fill the seat, not the shoes, \nas they say.\n  Every day I came to work here was a privilege, even when the day \ndidn't turn out as one expected. The people of New Jersey sent me here \nto accomplish things that affected their lives and their families, and \nit is not easy to relinquish those duties. I hope they will believe \nthat Frank Lautenberg served them honestly and diligently. I will leave \nit to them to mark the report card to see how we did.\n  My service was a way for me to give something back. I had a \nsuccessful business career, and I spent 30 years doing that, but there \nwas something more that was needed as far as my life was concerned. I \nam so grateful my grandparents, in their wisdom in the earliest part of \nthe last century, decided to pack up bag and baggage--they didn't have \nmuch baggage, I can tell you that; all they had was the spirit and \ndesire to live free--and come to this country, my mother a year old \nfrom Russia, and my father 6 years old from Poland. They believed so \nmuch in America. They were so sensitive about things. For my \ngrandparents, whose native tongues were reflective of the country they \ncame from, anything but English was almost prohibited in the house. \nThey wanted to talk English. They wanted to speak the language that \ntheir friends and their neighbors believed should be used as Americans. \nNow we understand people can live in multiple cultures and continue to \ntreasure the language that they or their parents had before they came \nto America. In those days, any indication they could get that they were \ntruly Americans meant so much.\n  So they came and worked hard, with no education. My father went to \nthe sixth grade only; he had to help his parents. But they never \ndreamed their children would have the opportunities that were so robust \nand so fulfilling.\n  I spent 30 years in the computer business, running a company called \nADP, Automatic Data Processing. The company started with two boyhood \nfriends of mine. We started without any money of our own, without any \noutside financing. The company today has 33,000 people and is one of \nAmerica's best performing companies in terms of its products and the \nstock market's response.\n  I got there because this government was there to render service to \nour people. The one thing that bothers me when we get into political \ncampaigns and speeches are made on the stump and people talk about the \ngovernment and how small it ought to be and why it is too big and the \nloaded bureaucracies, I can't stand it. Honest to goodness, I work with \nthe people who populate this place day in and day out--not the Senators \nexclusively but those who work here on both sides, Democrat and \nRepublican. I see how diligent they are in trying to get their day's \nwork done and how committed they are in the service of the people. I \nrespect them. Of course, those whom I have gotten to know in my office, \nI love them as well. One develops a respect and almost a reverence for \npeople who will come in and go to work at 8 o'clock or 9 o'clock in the \nmorning and stay; if we stay until 2 o'clock in the morning, they stay \nuntil 2 o'clock in the morning. For many years, until very recently, \nthere was never any compensation for overtime; that was considered part \nof the job. For those in the management of the office, and the \nleadership position among the staff, there is still nothing like \novertime. They do it because they feel the responsibility. It has made \nan enormous difference in the way we conduct ourselves.\n\n  Mr. President, the bottom line view that I bring is one that has \ndeveloped as a result of the opportunities that were afforded me. I \nknow I probably have said it too many times, but I ask my colleagues to \nindulge me once again when I talk about my family.\n  My father died a very young man, at age 43. I had enlisted in the \nArmy and\n\n[[Page S11827]]\n\nwas given the benefit of the GI bill. The GI bill made the difference \nin my life, enabling me to use the knowledge and programs I studied and \nlearned to start a business that became an industry. It is the \ncomputing industry, as contrasted to the computer industry, the \nhardware industry. To me it was a great example of the way government \ncan empower individuals and families to improve their lives.\n  It is a lesson I will never forget. The education I got through the \nGI bill set the foundation for me to build that business. When I look \nat what happened with ADP and the number of people it has put together, \n33,000 employees, processing paychecks for 33 million people across our \ncountry and others.\n  When I was finishing my 30th year in business, I thought there were \nother things I ought to try to do to help pay back what I thought was a \nunique opportunity. I wanted to make sure that it continued to exist \nfor others, as well. I came to the Senate. I ran in 1982 and was \nelected then. I brought what was a fairly unique perspective because \nthere weren't, at that time, as there are now, so many businesspeople \nwho came from not having had an elective office experience but came in \nfresh from the business to the Senate.\n  When I got here, my goals were to try again to permit people to think \nindependently, to make sure that the rights and the freedoms we enjoyed \nwould be protected, to make sure there would be an opportunity for \nthose who could learn without having, necessarily, the financing to do \nit. That is what the GI bill taught me. It has been my hope that people \nwould understand that these opportunities must continue to exist. That \nis why we have these discussions about investing in education, making \nsure children have the appropriate nutrition, and that people can count \non getting their health protected when they have a problem, or at least \nmaking certain as they grow and mature that they know they don't have \nto worry about an illness wiping out not only their assets but also \ndemolishing their health.\n\n  Just so everybody knows, I am going to take some time here. \nTherefore, it may take a little time for me to do the whole story. I \nsee the majority leader either looking at me so anxious to hear the \nwhole story that he wanted to ask me what it was.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the distinguished Senator from New Jersey \nwould yield, perhaps that is a good point. Yes, I would like to hear \nthe story uninterrupted. If the Senator would allow us to do a little \nbit of leadership business--one of which, or both of which I know the \nSenator would be very interested in--I ask, with the agreement of the \nSenator from New Jersey, that his statement appear in the Record as if \nuninterrupted, and the exchange with Senator Daschle, our colloquy, \nappear after his remarks.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am happy to cooperate because I have a sense that \nthe subject to be included in their remarks is one with which I have \nintense fascination.\n  I am happy to yield to the distinguished leaders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is it the majority leader's intention the \nSenator from New Jersey will hold the floor, following the business?\n  Mr. LOTT. That would be my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield to Senator Daschle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11827-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11827-S11828]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE OMNIBUS APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, although there are a lot of good things \nin the bill we are about to debate, there is one glaring omission--\nlegislation to provide Amtrak with the authority to issue tax credit \nbonds for capital improvements. This bonding authority is critical to \nAmtrak's future and to the economic health of the northeast and many \nother areas of the country.\n  I have discussed this issue with members of my caucus. We had a very \nspirited discussion in our caucus this morning, and I know how strongly \nthey support Amtrak and this legislation. We are very disappointed this \nprovision was not included in this otherwise praiseworthy legislation. \nAmtrak supporters will not give up on passing it. In order to help them \nsecure enactment of this important measure next year, the majority \nleader and I have discussed and agreed on how best to proceed. I yield \nthe floor to allow the majority leader to describe what that \nunderstanding is at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the Democratic leader for his fine \nwork on this issue. I know there is a lot of passion, a lot of support \nfor Amtrak. But let me remind my colleagues, I am one of those \nsupporters. I have been an active supporter of the national rail \npassenger system and was very much involved a couple of years ago when \nwe passed the Amtrak legislation. I had some strong opposition on our \nside of the aisle. I think we need it.\n  Now, I must confess one of the reasons I think we need it is I want \nus to have good service, not just in the northeast but I also would \nlike to have access from my own State of Mississippi to be able to get \nto Atlanta and Washington and Boston, and we are the beneficiaries of \nAmtrak service. I think we have to do it. I have pledged if it can't \nrun efficiently, if it cannot run without going into debt, at some \npoint we may want to say we just can't do that and decide what is going \nto be the successor program.\n  But I also think it is guaranteed and doomed to failure if we don't \ngive it an opportunity to succeed. If you don't have modern equipment, \nif you don't have the new fast trains, if you don't have a rapid rail \nsystem, it will not work.\n  So I support this legislation. I want to commit to our colleagues \nhere that I will join with Senator Daschle in cosponsoring this \nlegislation next year. We will work together to get the appropriate \nhearings in the Finance Committee and hopefully in the Commerce \nCommittee, too--even though this bill is under the Finance subcommittee \njurisdiction because of the tax aspects of it--but the Amtrak part of \nit, of course, would fall under Commerce. I am on both committees and \nSenator Daschle will probably be on the Finance Committee, too. We will \nwork with the ranking member and the chairman to get hearings and move \nthis legislation.\n  I cannot guarantee we will have the votes or that it will not be \nfilibustered or that we can break a filibuster, but I think it is the \nright thing to do. I might just add, the chairman of the Amtrak board, \nGovernor Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin, has been very actively involved. \nHe supports this legislation. He has called me personally about this \nlegislation. He really cares about it.\n  When we talk about bipartisanship, transportation is an issue on \nwhich we have been able to work together in a bipartisan way, whether \nit is roads, AIR-21, TEA-21, Amtrak, rapid rail system. We can do it \nagain.\n  Maybe we can improve on this bill. We talked about that in an \nexchange yesterday. Maybe there are some things we can do, some tweaks \nthat would make it better and resolve some of the concerns. And we will \ntry to do that. I am prepared to make that commitment. I believe we can \ndo it early next year. I am not talking about having it languish; I am \ntrying to get movement on it in the first 3 months, 6 months of the \nsession, so those who have reservations can offer amendments and we \nwill vote on them. Hopefully, we can get it done, and I commit to do \nthat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have long been a supporter of Amtrak. I \nwas chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation \nbefore my friend, Mr. Lautenberg, swore to support and defend the \nConstitution of the United States against all enemies of the United \nStates, foreign and domestic. I was for it then. I am for it now. We \nhad some problems in connection with putting this measure into this \nbill. I don't need to go into those problems here.\n  But I want to assure Mr. Biden and I want to assure Mr. Lautenberg, \nand assure both leaders, that I will do anything I can next year to \nsupport this legislation. I am a cosponsor of the bill, and I will do \nmy best to help enact it at the earliest possible date in the coming \nCongress. Like the distinguished majority leader, I can't guarantee \nanything except that I will do\n\n[[Page S11828]]\n\nmy best to be helpful. Certainly on the Appropriations Committee, if \nthere is an appropriations item, as always, I will support it. Amtrak \ncomes to West Virginia. It comes 3 days a week. I wish it came more \noften.\n  But I support Amtrak as much as anybody in this Chamber. We don't \nhave large airports in West Virginia; all we have is highways. We \ncertainly are grateful for and certainly very supportive of the limited \namount of rail transportation we have. We used to have the Hilltopper; \nwe used to have the Mountaineer in West Virginia. I have been a \nsupporter of the Cardinal longer than I can remember.\n  So Senators may be reassured that I shall do everything I can within \nmy power next year to be helpful.\n  The principal cosponsors, Mr. Lautenberg and Mr. Biden, made a strong \ncase for the importance of this vital legislation. It will be a central \npart of our efforts to ensure that our Amtrak system not only is \nmaintained but is also able to make necessary improvements in the \nfuture to ensure its continued success.\n  I thank all Senators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have been here, not as many years by far \nas most everyone on this floor right now, but it is not often that you \nsee the two leaders and our longtime leader Senator Byrd, stand and say \nthey will support a piece of legislation. I have never seen it happen \nbefore. I think this is to show the intensity of the feelings of the \npeople who support this legislation, led by Senator Joe Biden. So I am \nreally pleased it appears at this stage that the three leaders, Senator \nLott, Senator Daschle, and Senator Byrd, have agreed to do this.\n  I was at lunch today with Senator Hollings, who is the ranking \nDemocrat on the committee of jurisdiction that may have something to do \nwith this, the Commerce Committee. He said he will do everything he can \nto move this matter along. I know I will. Senator Specter, on the other \nside of the aisle, said he would do anything possible to move this \nalong. This is a rare occasion in the Senate that you see this much \nsupport for a piece of legislation.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could ask my colleagues to defer just a \nmoment, Senator Daschle and I would like to get one more unanimous \nconsent agreement in. Then I would like to yield to the Senators who \nare on their feet.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, may I, with all due respect, remind \nthe majority leader and the President that I yielded time based on the \nfact that I would recover the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. There is no question about it. I thought perhaps the \nSenator would want to comment, too, on what has just transpired. But I \ndo want to include in the Record the fact that Senator Stevens also has \nassured our colleagues, and has reminded me again, he also commits, as \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, his continued support for \nAmtrak.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11828-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11828-S11829]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. LOTT. With that, I do understand the Senate will shortly receive \nfrom the House the appropriations bill containing the final \nappropriations measures. I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding \nreceipt of the papers, the Senate proceed to vote immediately on \nadoption of the conference report and, following passage, there be 40 \nminutes of explanation to be equally divided between the two leaders, \nwith 20 minutes additional under the control of Senator Byrd, 45 \nminutes under the control of Senator Graham of Florida, and 10 minutes \nof Senator Lott's time to be controlled by Senator Specter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I want to, before the majority leader \nleaves the floor, thank him.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could confirm, the unanimous consent \nwas agreed to?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No objection was heard. I recognized the \nSenator from Delaware thinking he wished to object.\n  Is there objection?\n  Mr. BIDEN. No, I beg your pardon, I do not wish to object or seek \nrecognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under parliamentary procedure, the Senator \nfrom New Jersey has the floor. He yielded it to the majority leader and \nthe Democratic leader for the conduct of certain items of business. \nFollowing that point, Senators seeking to speak will have to receive \nthe approval or approbation of the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator to yield me a very brief \ntime.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the Chair for that \nrecollection. I will be happy to yield to our friend from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Before the majority leader leaves the floor, I want to \npersonally thank him. I want to thank the minority leader, the \nDemocratic leader, and I guess most of all I want to thank Senator Byrd \nand Senator Stevens as well.\n  I have been here for 28 years. I have never once come to the floor to \nthreaten to engage in an extended debate on a matter. I did that this \nmorning in our caucus. I am not suggesting my colleagues responded \nbecause I did that. I am suggesting that I believed my colleagues who \nare on their feet felt extremely strongly about what was about to \nhappen; that is, Amtrak cannot make it through the year 2001 and meet \nthe obligation that has been imposed upon it without being brought up \nto speed, figuratively and literally, in terms of equipment, track, and \nthe like.\n  When this proposal that had 56 cosponsors and passed in another \nvehicle with 60-some votes and with 260-some votes in the House was not \ngoing to be included in this omnibus bill, I must tell my colleagues, I \nwas very upset.\n  In light of the fact that the leadership of the Appropriations \nCommittee of the Senate as a whole and of the Commerce Committee, at \nleast on one side of the Commerce Committee, have indicated to me they \nwill introduce and move rapidly, as best they can, funding for Amtrak--\nI will not take the time to go into what it all does and what it \nmeans--then that is good enough for me. I will withdraw any attempt to \ndelay consideration of this final bill.\n  Also, I know Senator Moynihan and Senator Lautenberg are leaving. \nSenator Lautenberg has been Mr. Amtrak. Senator Lautenberg, since he \nhas been here, in large part because of his disposition and in no small \npart because of the particular position of authority he occupied on the \nAppropriations Committee, has been--I ride a train every day and people \nsay to me: You know, Joe, thanks for defending Amtrak.\n  I say: No, don't thank me, call Senator Lautenberg. I literally say \nthat because it is true.\n  Also on the floor is a Senator who is Mr. Transportation. He has \ngiven us all a lesson, as only he can, for the past 18 years on the \nnecessity of Amtrak not merely in the Northeast corridor, but there is \nno alternative in this Nation to not have a mass transit interstate \nsystem.\n  I want everybody to understand--again, I will put something in the \nRecord; I won't take the time now--this is not just parochially \nimportant to the Senators from Delaware, New Jersey, Vermont, \nMassachusetts, all of whom are on the floor. This is important to \nFlorida; it is important to the Southeast corridor; it is important to \nOregon, Washington, Nevada. This is the only alternative we have.\n  It seems to me, after discussion with the men I have named today--the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia, the Senator from Mississippi, \nthe Senator from North Dakota, and others--that we are all singing from \nthe same hymnal now. There seems to be for the first time in my \nrecollection, I say to my friend from New York who is standing, a \ngenuine acknowledgment that there is no transportation scheme in \nAmerica that will serve America without a major component of it being a \nrapid transit interstate system for passengers.\n  I am looking forward to this being the first bipartisan effort next \nyear. I sincerely hope the incoming President will understand our \nregional needs.\n  I conclude by saying I thought federalism was about one section of \nthe\n\n[[Page S11829]]\n\nNation helping other sections of the Nation that, in fact, had needs \nbut needed additional assistance. There would be no water flowing in \nArizona were it not for the people of Massachusetts, the people of New \nYork, the people of New Jersey, Delaware, and other States subsidizing \nthat water extensively to the tune of probably somewhere above $16 \nbillion over time, and we should do that.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. The Arizona project.\n  Mr. BIDEN. We should do that. I get the feeling--maybe because it is \nthe Christmas season and I want to believe it--there is a growing \nrecognition that rail service in our neck of the woods, as well as \nother parts of the country, are as essential to our interests as water \nis to the far west. It is as essential.\n  I thank my colleagues for their commitment and absolutely close by \nsaying to Senator Byrd that I appreciate the fact that he understands, \nmaybe better than anyone in this place, when another colleague cares \nabout an issue that he believes is absolutely indispensable for his \nregion. I thank him for acknowledging that.\n  I thank him for his--it is no new commitment; he has always been \ncommitted to Amtrak--acknowledgment of that and for his continued \npledge of commitment to Amtrak. With this combination of the majority \nleader, the Democratic leader, the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, and the \nranking member of the Commerce Committee, if we cannot get it done, \nthen shame on us.\n  I thank all of my colleagues. Sorry to have taken so much time, but \nas my colleagues said all day, this is a big, big, big, big deal to me \npersonally, to my State, and I think to the Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the current situation, the Senator from \nNew Jersey has the floor. He has yielded to the majority leader and the \nDemocratic leader to conduct business. If they are through with their \nbusiness, the Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, with their indulgence, we do have a couple \nmore consent requests, plus we may need to modify the earlier \nagreement.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am happy to yield to the majority \nleader for conducting further business provided, of course, that the \nrecognition continues. I thank the Presiding Officer for being so \ncareful in his statement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11829-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11829]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n PROVIDING FOR SINE DIE ADJOURNMENT OF THE SECOND SESSION OF THE 106TH \n                                CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the technical continuing resolution, H.J. Res. 133.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the joint resolution by \ntitle.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (H.J.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe read the third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, all without intervening action, motion, or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The joint resolution (H.J. Res. 133) was read the third time and \npassed.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have one further clarification. It seems \nthere is an objection, notwithstanding the receipt of the papers, that \nwe have a vote and then go to debate, but we are working on an \narrangement that will allow us to proceed with debate and get some \ncertainty about how the vote will be dispensed with. We should be able \nto get that clarified in a few minutes. I would hate to ask the Senator \nto yield again in a few minutes, but in view of the importance of the \nissue, I might do that. For now, that is all the business Senator \nDaschle and I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nJersey has the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, again with it understood that I retain the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Jersey. He is \nvery gracious in doing so. I know he wants to make some important \ncomments that summarize his 18 years of work and commitment on this \nissue. He is generous to allow us to intervene.\n  I join in thanking the majority leader and the minority leader, \nSenator Daschle, Senator Reid, particularly Senator Byrd and Senator \nStevens for responding to the request of a number of us from our \nregion. I thank Senator Biden and Senator Lautenberg for their \nleadership again on this issue.\n  There was a lot of passion in our caucus earlier this afternoon, and \nthe minority leader listened to all of us very carefully. Our caucus, I \nmust say, was united in its commitment to the notion that those of us \nwho cared about this issue needed to have some kind of response on the \nfloor that indicated where we will go. I am grateful for this response.\n  The commitment on the floor openly, as it has been given, to proceed \nas we will proceed, particularly from the distinguished ranking member \nof the Appropriations Committee and the chairman, is as good a \ncommitment as one can get in the Senate.\n  We have 56 sponsors of this legislation today in the Senate. With the \nnew Senators coming in, I am absolutely confident we will have more \nthan 60 sponsors of this legislation. I look forward to building on the \nlegacy of Senator Moynihan and Senator Lautenberg and completing what \nis absolutely essential for this country, which is a rail system of \nwhich the Nation can be proud.\n  I am very grateful to all those who have made this effort. I \nparticularly say about the Senator from New Jersey and the Senator from \nNew York, the two of them will be so missed with respect to their \nleadership and the vision they have expressed with respect to \ntransportation issues as a whole, but particularly for those of us in \nthe Northeast, what voices they have been in the Senate with respect to \ntheir vision for how we can more inexpensively and capably move people \nfrom here to\n\n[[Page S11830]]\n\nthere and increase the productivity of our country. I pledge, along \nwith my other colleagues, to build on their example and on that vision. \nThe day will come when we will all have a better transportation network \nas a consequence of their leadership.\n  Mr. President, I know that every member of the Congress is anxious to \nend this session and get back to our states. We all have work to do and \nfamilies waiting to celebrate the holidays. However, my colleagues \nSenator Lautenberg and Senator Biden are right to be angry and \nfrustrated with this legislation.\n  There is a small but extremely significant item missing from this \nlegislation--the High-Speed Rail Investment Act. The Act would allow \nAmtrak to sell $10 billion in bonds over the next decade and provide \ntax credits to bondholders in lieu of interest payments. Amtrak would \nuse this money to upgrade existing rail lines to high-speed rail \ncapability. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the bill \nwould cost just $95 million over 2 years. Over 5 years, the bill would \nstill cost only $762 million.\n  The High-Speed Rail Investment Act has 56 co-sponsors in the Senate. \nThis is not a partisan issue. It is not a regional issue. It is not an \nurban issue. The High-Speed Rail Investment Act has the support of the \nNational Governors Association, the U.S. Conference of Mayors and the \nNational Conference of State Legislatures. Nineteen newspapers, from \nthe New York Times and Providence Journal, to the Houston Chronicle and \nSeattle Post Intelligencer, have called for the enactment of this \nlegislation.\n  Let me explain why so many people and organizations support this \nlegislation:\n  It is in our national interest to construct a national infrastructure \nthat is truly intermodal. Rail transportation helps alleviate the \nstress placed on our environment by air and highway transportation. It \nis a sad fact that America's rail transportation, and its lack of a \nnational high-speed rail system, lags well behind rail transportation \nin most other nations--we spend less, per capita, on rail \ntransportation than Estonia, Myanmar, and Botswana.\n  There is a compelling need to invest in high-speed rail. Our highways \nand skyways are overburdened. Intercity passenger miles have increased \n80 percent since 1988, but only 5.5 percent of that has come from \nincreased rail travel. Meanwhile, our congested skies have become even \nmore crowded. The result, predictably, is that air travel delays are up \n58 percent since 1995.\n  In the air travel industry, bad weather in one part of the country \nvery often results in delays in other parts of the country. There is \nconsumer demand for more flights. But we know that our skyways and air \ntraffic control systems are finite and that the system is overloaded.\n  Amtrak ridership is on the rise. More than 22.5 million passengers \nrode Amtrak in Fiscal Year 2000, a million more than the previous year. \nFY 2000 was the fourth consecutive year that ridership has increased. \nWe should welcome that increased use and support it by giving Amtrak \nthe resources it needs to provide high-quality, dependable service.\n  High-Speed Rail Investment Act is critical to the future of Amtrak. \nFor half the cost of constructing the new Woodrow Wilson Bridge linking \nMaryland and Virginia, we can create 10 high-speed rail corridors in 28 \nstates. For the cost of the St. Louis Airport expansion, we can improve \nintercity transportation in 28 states. In October we passed a $58 \nbillion transportation appropriations bill for this fiscal year. What \nwe are talking about today is an additional $95 million over the next \ntwo years, which will leverage $2 billion in funding. This is a sound \ninvestment.\n  There is an alarming misconception among some members of this body \nand around the country that Amtrak is a money pit, where taxpayer \ndollars simply disappear. Nothing could be further from the truth. In \nfact, the federal government has invested $380 billion in our highways \nand $160 billion in airports since Amtrak was created. By contrast, the \nfederal government has spent only $23 billion on Amtrak. We have spent \njust 4 percent of our transportation budget on rail transportation in \nthe last 30 years.\n  Those who criticize Amtrak for not ``turning a profit'' employ a \ndouble standard--a double standard that is misleading, unfair and \nunwise. Between 1985-1995, this country spent $17 billion more on \nfederal highways than it raised through the federal gas tax and highway \ntrust fund. During the same period, the nation spent $30 billion more \non aviation expenditures than it received through the aviation trust \nfund. By their misguided logic, there can be only one solution: since \nneither of those trust funds operated at cost, we should eliminate \nthese programs. That's nonsense. So why are we failing to adequately \ninvest in rail transportation?\n  Mr. President, high-speed rail is a viable transportation \nalternative. There is a large and growing demand for rail service in \nthe Northeast Corridor. Amtrak captures almost 70 percent of the \nbusiness rail and air travel market between Washington and New York and \n30 percent of the market share between New York and Boston. High-speed \nrail will undoubtedly increase that market share.\n  These new trains, like the Acela Express that debuted in the \nNortheast this year, currently run at an average of only 82 miles per \nhour, but with track improvements, will run at 130 miles per hour.\n  As a Nation, we have recognized the importance of having the very \nbest communication system, and ours is the envy of the world. That \ninvestment is one of reasons our economy is the strongest in the world. \nAnd we should do the same for our transportation system. It should be \nequally modern and must be fully intermodal. And in order to do that, \nwe must invest in rail transportation, invest in Amtrak and be certain \nto include this inexpensive legislation in the last bill of the 106th \nCongress.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, before I yield, and I will continue to \ndo so throughout the night, I say to my friends, my colleagues from \nMassachusetts and Delaware, that I am grateful for their comments. I am \nsure we will see, and I am particularly grateful to the majority leader \nand Democratic leader, an Amtrak bill on the floor early in the next \nsession. I am sorry I will not be here, but in the meanwhile, I will \nyield to the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, again I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11830-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT VITIATED\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I will not require more than a few \nmoments to thank my friend from New Jersey and express confidence in \nthe Senators\n\n[[Page S11831]]\n\nfrom Massachusetts and Delaware who have just spoken, to thank the \ndistinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee and my revered \nfriend, the ranking member, the Senator from West Virginia, and the \nmajority leader.\n  May I say, sir--something we often lose sight of--this is a national \nissue and ought to be addressed by the Congress. We are the only major \nindustrial state in the world that has not sought to recreate and \nrevivify its rail system in the last generation.\n  The Committee on Environment and Public Works in the last 20 years \nhas turned to this. In 1989, we passed the Intermodal Surface \nTransportation Efficiency Act, calling for just such measures--later \nthe Transportation Efficiency Act. We created financial instruments and \nthe possibility of investments to be involved.\n  We can do this. We are on the verge of it. To miss it at this moment \nwould be to miss a moment in history for which I think we will not be \nhappy. But I am so confident, from what I have heard today, that I \nleave the Senate yet more proud of having been here 24 years, thanking \nall--thanking particularly the Presiding Officer for his friendship and \nleadership in so many important matters.\n  I yield the floor with great satisfaction of what has just \ntranspired. If this is the kind of mode we enter into in January, there \nis much to expect from the 107th.\n  Thanks to my friend from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New York.\n  The majority leader made a private statement to me, which I will \nstate publicly. He said, as we ready for my departure, bipartisanship \nis breaking out all over. And I am not quite sure how that is meant. \nBut I yield up to 3 minutes to the Senator from Pennsylvania, with the \nunderstanding I retain the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the distinguished Senator from New Jersey for \nyielding to me. I compliment him for his leadership on Amtrak generally \nand especially on this current plan for financing.\n  I support Amtrak and believe the proposal to provide this additional \nfunding is very much in the national interest. I think it is a very \nsalutary thing, as some have already commented, that we have people \nextending their hands across the aisle on a matter of great national \nimportance.\n  The Senator from Delaware, I think, characterized the situation very \naptly when he talked about federalism; and that is, one region helping \nanother region.\n  There is no doubt that those of us who live in the eastern corridor--\nand I am a beneficiary of Amtrak. It is 1 hour and 37 civilized minutes \nfrom Washington, DC, to 30th Street Station in Philadelphia. But it is \nmore than my convenience; it is the infrastructure of the country.\n  I think this is very good for the country that we are going to be \nmoving ahead with this legislation next year, and a very good sign for \nthe 107th Congress that hands are being extended across the aisle to \nshow bipartisanship. If this carries forward in the next year \ngenerally, it will be very good for the American people.\n  I, again, thank my colleague from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for not only \nhis comments but for his help. He is someone we counted on to work so \nclosely with us, to bring seriously a bipartisan aspect to the \nprotection that we are looking for to make sure that Amtrak--the \nnational goal for railroading all across this country--will be able to \ncontinue.\n  It is obvious to me, as we have listened to the comments, that unless \nthese investments are made now, or very soon, we will be unable to \nfulfill the objectives of having Amtrak as a self-sufficient entity \noperating with its operating budget met by the revenues that it \nderives. The funds that we will be able to get from this proposed bond \nissue will enable it to make the capital investment it so desperately \nneeds.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11831-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11831-S11832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SERVING IN THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, one of the things I wanted to do, as I \ntried to plan my Senate objectives, was to make sure the children of \nour country were as protected as they could be by legislation that we \ndeveloped in the Congress.\n  Under Republican leadership, when President Reagan was the President \nin 1984--Elizabeth Dole was the Secretary of Transportation--we were \nable to write a bill and create a law that made the 21-year-old \ndrinking age the minimum drinking age for serving liquor across the \ncountry. Since that time, 17,000 families have been spared the need to \nmourn the loss of a child.\n  Mr. President, 17,000 youngsters, that is enough to fill a large \narena. If one looked at the number of young people who would fill that \narena, you would say: My Lord, are we lucky that these children have \nlived and will survive to their adulthood and through their full life \nbecause we were able to restrict their access to alcohol.\n  Therefore, it was appropriate, toward the later days of my career, \nthat we were able to add another item of protection by lowering the \nblood-alcohol level to .08, a standard which will save an additional \n500 to 700 lives a year. President Clinton recently signed that into \nlaw, as well. So I am pleased with the fact we were able to get that \ndone. My team and I worked very hard to make that happen. It took \nseveral years for it to be accomplished, but accomplished it was.\n  A large part of that accomplishment, I must say, was because of our \ndistinguished friend and leader--I think they would have a reference in \ntotalitarian governments, but I mean it in the kindest way--as a leader \nfor life, that Senator Byrd has brought to us, not only with his \nknowledge, his understanding of the process, but he is virtually the \nhistorian of the Senate. The thing that has always amazed me is he can \ndo it virtually from memory, and bring us all to our senses about how \nwe conduct ourselves and how we process legislation. I am not only so \ndelighted and honored to have been able to serve with him as a mentor \nbut as a friend as well.\n  We learn on a continuing basis in this place that Senator Byrd is \nsomeone to whom we can always turn, not only to understand his thinking \non issues, and the decisions that he provides, but also his leadership.\n  We saw it manifest again this day because he wanted to help us out of \nthe dilemma with which we were struggling, to find a way to get Amtrak \nthe strength and resources that it needs, but reminding us at this \nmoment there were so many things in front of us that it was not the \ntime, but nevertheless was helpful in his reassurance that he, too, \nwould help process this early in the next Congress. I just am sorry I \nwill not be here to see the day when that takes place.\n  But I am grateful for the friendship and guidance that the \ndistinguished senior Senator from West Virginia has given me, and all \nof us, over these many years.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am happy to yield to the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for his \nremarks. I shall miss him. We shall all miss him. He has served on the \nAppropriations Committee, and served well, served as chairman of the \nTransportation Appropriations Subcommittee, and served well.\n  He has the highest interests of the Nation always at heart. He has \nbeen a very capable Senator. He is never one to forget his obligations, \nhis responsibilities, his duties to the people who have sent him here. \nI have considered it to be a great honor and high privilege to serve \nwith the Senator. I shall miss him. I am sure he will continue to serve \nhis country in some way.\n  But I do hope the Senator will come back and visit with us from time \nto time. May the Creator of the universe, Father of all of us, watch \nover and guide Frank Lautenberg and his family. He is so proud of his \nfamily. He often speaks of his children, his grandchildren. I know they \nlove him. He will always be in our recollection. May heavenly angels \nalways attend him in whatever he endeavors.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n\n[[Page S11832]]\n\n All of us look to him for his guidance and wisdom.\n  I have said about Senator Byrd in the past that he is a model for \nwhat a computer might do, and he does it without all of the transistors \nand switches and chips, and all of that. If anyone doubts Senator \nByrd's capacity, let them attend one of his lectures on the kings of \nEngland or the development of government in the Roman Empire. One will \nbe astounded. I have always felt a little bit like a student when I \nlistened to Senator Byrd. I thank him for his warm comments.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, will the Senator from New Jersey yield to \nme for a question of him?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am happy to yield to our colleague from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. First of all, I thank the Senator from New Jersey for his \nadvocacy and his strong and heartfelt support about the need for a \nviable railway system in the Northeast and around America. There has \nbeen no one in this body who has been more committed to that \nproposition than the Senator from New Jersey. I congratulate him. As I \nsaid before, we will miss him very much in this body.\n  I would like to make one additional comment, if I may, to the Senator \nfrom New Jersey.\n  We will go through a regular process next year to bring up an \nauthorization bill for Amtrak which would then be followed by \nappropriations.\n  I objected to an appropriation this year because it was $10 billion \nover 10 years stuck into an appropriations bill for which there had \nnever been a hearing. I hope the Senator from New Jersey can understand \nthat.\n  The second point is, I urge the Senator from New Jersey to consider \nthat we have to make a fundamental choice about the national rail \nsystem in America--not just an east coast rail system but a national \nrail system.\n  There are many countries in the world, including European countries, \nthat regularly subsidize their railway systems. I understand that. I \ndon't dispute it. Perhaps that decision has to be made in the United \nStates of America and in the Congress of the United States with the \ncooperation of the administration.\n  I remind the Senator from New Jersey that a few short years ago the \ndecision was made to make Amtrak completely independent. Maybe that was \nnot a wise decision.\n  Last year, Amtrak lost, I think, 900 million and some dollars, and \nwill lose another $900 million, or so.\n  I think we need to make a fundamental decision: Is it a high enough \nnational priority?\n  I am not prepared to make a decision yet that the taxpayers of \nAmerica should subsidize a rail system for America. I think the Senator \nfrom New Jersey would agree with me that the west coast needs one \nprobably almost as much as the east coast does.\n  We need to make a fundamental decision about what the Government's \nrole will be in a national railway system, and then we need to decide \nto what degree it is subsidized.\n  I think a strong argument can be made by anyone who has tried to fly \nto Newark, or to LaGuardia, or Kennedy lately that they recognize the \ndifficulties in relying simply on air transportation. I think an \nargument can be made. But I think it deserves full debate and \ndiscussion.\n  I thank the Senator from New Jersey. I understand his disappointment \non this issue. But I would like to make a personal commitment that his \nspirit will live on, and we will fully examine and fully ventilate this \nissue and try to come up with a proposal that will satisfy the needs of \nhis constituents and Americans all over this country. Again, I say that \nwith profound admiration and respect for the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Could I make one final comment? I hope to get a recorded vote on this \nbill. I will be recorded as voting against it for the usual reasons, \nand will have a statement included in the Record.\n  I thank the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for \nhis laudatory comments. It is nice to hear that one will be missed. We \nhaven't discussed the degree, but nevertheless being missed counts.\n  I wish to say one thing in response to the thoughtful statement of \nthe Senator from Arizona about Amtrak and a national railroad. I am \nglad that he did it because I misunderstood. Frankly, perhaps it is \nsomething I thought I heard the Senator from Arizona say in times past \nabout the fact that he would resist advancing resources to Amtrak. I \nthink it was described in terms of a ``cash guzzler,'' if I am correct \nin that recognition. But I am glad to hear the Senator from Arizona.\n  Let it not ever be mistaken that Senator John McCain and I have had \nsome differences on the floor and off the floor, but the fact is that I \nbelieve there is mutual respect. Certainly, I respect him for his \ncontributions to America and for his contributions to this body.\n  If anyone has any doubts about John McCain's capacity to deliver a \nmessage, one only need to look at the recent election to see that with \nvery limited resources John McCain was able to influence the direction \nof policy that we are going to be witnessing in the next \nadministration.\n  But I also hope that Senator John McCain, the Senator from Arizona, \nand the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold, will be able to \naccomplish something that has been lingering over this place. It is \noverdue. It has been talked about forever, and it has never been \naccomplished. The reason I made a decision to leave this body that I \nlove dearly was because I didn't want to go out and raise that money.\n  The Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. \nFeingold, have done a masterful job in working inch by inch to get to \nthe place where we examine as a proposal for the near future, I hope, \nhow we ought to finance Senate races. I think the moment is near at \nhand. I hope that examination, frankly, obviously without my \nparticipation, will be taken. I will be encouraging you from the \nsidelines.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, will the Senator yield again?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Boy, I could really carve out a few chips if I were \ngoing to remain here. I am happy to yield, provided I recover the \nfloor.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11832-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11832-S11833]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         EXECUTIVE NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, one note on these nominations and \nappointments:\n  I understand that United States Presidents have for years had the \nability to recess appoint nominations. I know of many instances going \nback at least to the 1950s. I also understand that many majority \nleaders--including Senator Byrd and Senator Mitchell--have had words of \ncaution for Presidents of the United States when they were majority \nleader with respect to recess appointments. I know that this majority \nleader, as well as Senator Byrd, are very much concerned about recess \nappointments--especially appointments to the Federal judiciary--\nduring a period of time after we adjourn sine die, or at the beginning, \nfrankly, of the year right as we go into the new administration. \nCongress has seen this area to continue to erode. I think we need to \ndeal very aggressively with it. The Vacancy Act that Senator Byrd has \nworked on is something about which we need to be very serious. I hope \nthis administration will heed these words of caution and understand the \nconcerns of the whole Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I would be glad to yield the floor before we return it to \nSenator Lautenberg, if I might.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey has the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, you do that job perfectly with \ndiligence, for the record.\n\n[[Page S11834]]\n\n  I am happy to yield. In fact, I would be afraid not to yield to our \ndistinguished Senator, my friend from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator. I will \nnot speak long.\n  Mr. President, the distinguished majority leader has made reference \nto recess appointments. Let me read what is in the Constitution. I read \nfrom section 2 of article II of the Constitution:\n\n       The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies \n     that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting \n     Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next \n     Session.\n\n  Having been the majority leader in the Senate earlier in my years \nhere, I have been very careful to caution Presidents not to make recess \nappointments during the recess of the Senate unless there is indeed an \nemergency that arises.\n  That is the purpose of this. That provision in the United States \nConstitution is not put in there to enable any President, Republican or \nDemocrat, to play games with the Senate, or to attempt to do a one-\nupmanship simply because the Senate is out of session.\n  I hope that Presidents, Democratic and Republican, will be very \ncareful in filling a vacancy that ``may happen'' during a recess. That \nis the way the Constitution reads.\n\n  I hope there is no effort to take advantage of those words by \nappointing someone to fill vacancies that have been in existence for \nsome time. I especially hope that no administration will attempt to \nfill a Federal judgeship during the recess of the Senate. After all, a \nFederal judgeship is an appointment for life. That is not an \nappointment just until the end of the next session. Federal judgeships \nare, through the Constitution, for life tenure if they conduct \nthemselves appropriately while in office.\n  I want to say this: I am opposed to judgeship appointments during a \nrecess. I hope that any President will proceed very cautiously and not \nattempt to take advantage of the situation by appointing judgeships \nduring the recess of the Senate.\n  How long will this Senate be in recess?\n  Mr. LOTT. I say to the Senator from West Virginia, I believe we will \nbe in recess slightly over 2 weeks, probably 17 days, until the new \nCongress comes in on January 23.\n  Mr. BYRD. I can only see through my own eyes, but I don't consider \nthat to be too long a time to await the appointment of a Federal \njudgeship or any other office, unless it should be Secretary of Defense \nor perhaps Secretary of State. But it is certain that there is no need \nto fill judgeships during this 2 weeks, or whatever it is. We will be \nback here. I will not support any administration, Democratic or \nRepublican, that attempts to fill Federal judgeships while the Senate \nis in recess. I think that is playing politics. We all play politics \nsome, but we are fooling around a little too deeply with the fountain \nof politics. I hope we don't poison that well by attempting to pull a \nfast one here. Is that what the Senator is talking about?\n  Mr. LOTT. I understand, of course, that is a possibility. We have not \nbeen notified of any recess appointments or any Federal judicial \nappointment during this recess period. However, I note it has been done \nin the past, and there has been some suggestion it could occur during \nthe next 6 weeks before the next Inauguration.\n  I want to check on exactly what would be the situation. I understand \neven a Federal judge's term would expire, depending on when it \nhappened, at the end of the Congress, but there would be tremendous \npressure then to reappoint that person. I agree with the Senator that \nany appointment of a Federal judge during a recess should be opposed, \nregardless of who they are or whether it is Republican or Democrat. I \ncommit myself now to remember that when there is a Republican \nadministration, as well as a Democratic administration.\n  I do know there were Federal judges back in the early 1950s appointed \nby President Eisenhower. That was a mistake then, and it would be one \nnow. I understand that could be contemplated. This word of caution on \nyour behalf and on mine on behalf of the Senate, hopefully, will cause \nthat not to happen.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if the distinguished majority leader will \nyield further.\n  Mr. LOTT. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. I presume to offer the majority leader a suggestion, what I \nwould do if I were in his place. I would write to the President and \nurge that no such recess appointment be made, and put it in writing, \nmake a record of it. Furthermore, if I were the majority leader, I \nwould talk with the administration.\n  Mr. LOTT. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am not trying to tell the Senator what to do, but this is \na serious thing with me. As for the politics of it, I am not talking \nDemocratic politics or Republican. But there is such a thing as comity \nbetween the executive branch and the legislative branch. There is such \na thing as the Constitution, and I happen to hold a copy in my hand \nright now. There is also such a thing as the prerogatives of the \nSenate. I try to defend those prerogatives.\n  The Senator made a comment about recess appointments. I hope he will \nget some assurance. If there is any doubt in his mind--any doubt--that \nthis administration or any other is going to try to make a recess \nappointment, especially of a Federal judgeship, while the Senate is out \nfor these two or three weeks. I hope the Senator will get a commitment \nout of the administration, if he can, that that will not happen.\n  That is going pretty far, in my judgment--to appoint a Federal judge \nfor life ``during good behavior.'' I don't know whether there have been \njudges appointed during a recess of the Senate in the face of this \nprovision which I have just read, to wit:\n\n       The President shall have power to fill up all vacancies \n     that may happen during recess of the Senate by granting \n     commissions which shall expire at the end of their next \n     session.\n\n  That is all I have to say. I have been concerned about that, I say to \nthe distinguished majority leader. I have worked with the distinguished \nSenator from Tennessee, Mr. Thompson, and his committee, and a former \nSenator, who was the ranking member of that committee, John Glenn. We \nhammered out some legislation. I was concerned about the fact that the \nadministration was appointing people who stayed in those positions for \na year, for 2 years, for longer than 2 years, so we hammered out \nlegislation and passed it in the Senate--the Vacancies Act.\n  About 6 months ago, I asked Senator Thompson how the law was working. \nHe indicated he would get back to me in answering my question at some \npoint.\n  I just happened to be here on this floor, during the comments of the \nmajority leader and I can't stress too greatly my concern about recess \nappointments of Federal judges.\n  I hope the majority leader, if he will pardon my presumptuousness, \nwill try to get some understanding with the administration about that. \nThat is the way I always did when I was majority leader: I got some \nunderstanding.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I say to the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia, that is very good counsel. I will do that on a personal \nbasis. I will also follow an example that I believe has been carried \nout in the past by Senator Byrd, maybe even by Senator Dole: In \nwriting, get an understanding or some clarification. I will do that \nletter, and it will include this colloquy which just occurred.\n  I thank the Senator for his comments, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11834-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11834-S11837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume legislative session.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I suspect you are getting weary of \nissuing that statement.\n  Mr. President, just because I want to talk about 18 years of service \ndoesn't mean I have to take 18 hours to do it. I will try to \nconsolidate it.\n  I have been talking about things that meant so much to me in the \nSenate and about the honor given when one is elected to this office. \nToo often it is denigrated in the heat of battle for victory in \nelections and again criticism of government and the bureaucrats, and so \nforth. It gets to a point where I must say I am very defensive, \nparticularly for the staff who give so much of themselves to make \nthings happen.\n\n[[Page S11835]]\n\n  Part of the work we have done over these years has proven to be of \nbenefit. I hope I will be forgiven for taking some minutes to talk \nabout things that can happen. I am proud of the work I did on gun \nsafety, especially the law which takes guns away from domestic violence \noffenders who abuse their wives and their children. I am disappointed \nthat more wasn't done to close the gun show loophole which permits \npeople to buy weapons without any identification. I hope in the 107th \nCongress, with the new Members on both sides of the aisle, people who \ncome here with good credentials, with those who have been here in the \npast from the 106th Congress, we will pass that law.\n  Tobacco. Often when I am on an airplane, I am thanked by flight \nattendants and passengers for writing the ban on smoking in airplanes. \nIt was a move that changed our country's cultural attitude on smoking. \nThe tobacco industry has to understand that. I hope scientists have \nseen signs of understanding and cooperation that will lead them to work \nwith us, through the FAA, to try to come to some kind of reconciliation \nof the position they are in where smoking brings so much damage and \ncosts to our society. They are beginning to know that, and I hope they \ncome up with something to permit citizens to avoid the poisons, the \naddiction that results from cigarette smoking.\n  The Superfund is another program on which I worked fairly diligently \nfor a long time without success, so far, in terms of getting it \nreauthorized, as it should be with a tax income that has those \nresponsible, who could be responsible for that pollution, pay for the \ncleanups. We missed passing a bipartisan brownfields bill this year and \nhope that will take place next year.\n  As we have reviewed tonight, transportation is one of my deepest \ninterests. In working the bill to maintain our mass transit system, \nhighways, airports, and ports have been a top priority for me as \nchairman and ranking member of the Appropriations Transportation \nSubcommittee. I believe we will face a serious transportation crunch in \nthe future, as discussed, unless we develop high-speed rail wherever we \ncan throughout this country. That is why this passage of the High Speed \nRail Investment Act is so critical. And, once again, I thank the \nleaders for agreeing. I include the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, Senator Stevens, and the ranking member, Senator Byrd, for \ntheir willingness to cooperate getting that Amtrak bill in place next \nyear.\n\n  Also, I am delighted to have served with our friend, Senator Connie \nMack from Florida, who is also in the process of retiring from the \nSenate. He and I worked very hard to get passage of a bill that \npunishes those who would commit terrorist acts and to help the victims \nof terrorism. We came to a conclusion, before we left on our last \nbreak, that we will have these people receive compensation directed at \nhaving those nations that support terrorism pay for it. We are trying \nto get an understanding that, no matter what you do, if you support \nterrorism or you commit an act of terrorism, you are going to have to \npay for it, and pay severely.\n  I am proud of the work, also, I was able to do on the Budget \nCommittee, especially the 1997 balanced budget agreement that laid the \nfoundation for some of the surpluses we are now enjoying. I must say, \nwhen I walked across the lawn with the President of the United States \nand watched him sign that bill, I thought it was a moment I only wished \nmy parents could have seen.\n  I have served with many great men and women in the Senate. I have \nrespect for all of them. I cannot name them all at this time, but I do \nwant to mention some of the special ones. I worked with great majority \nand minority leaders. When I came here in 1983, Senator Howard Baker \nwas the majority leader. I found him to be one of the most honorable \npeople I have met. His word was his bond, and he taught me some early \nlessons when I asked him for a letter confirming a statement he had \nmade to me, a promise he had made to me about a piece of legislation. \nSo I said: May I have a letter to that effect? He said: If you need a \nletter from me, we are all in trouble.\n  I was startled for a moment. But I could see then that Senator Howard \nBaker was a man of his word, as I have seen with other leaders on both \nsides.\n  Senator Robert Byrd was minority leader when I came; later in the \n1980s, Senator George Mitchell, Senator Bob Dole, distinguished leaders \nof our two parties. In the 1990s, I had the privilege to work under the \nstewardship of Senator Trent Lott and my good friend Senator Tom \nDaschle, among the very good people who served in leadership roles. It \nis not an easy place to manage. I don't know whether there is ever \ngoing to be a school of hard knocks that is going to teach people how \nto run the Senate. But I think it has to be learning under fire with an \noccasional singeing here and there.\n  As a long-time member of the Appropriations Committee, I served under \nterrific leadership: Senator Hatfield, Senator Stennis, Senator \nStevens, and Senator Byrd. I don't think anyone of either party would \nquibble with my opinion that our friend Senator Byrd has been one of \nthe great Senators in the history of this Republic.\n  I have served for almost 16 years on the Senate Environment and \nPublic Works Committee. That committee was led by extraordinary \nleadership, Senators such as Bob Stafford, Lloyd Bentsen, Quentin \nBurdick, John Chafee, Pat Moynihan; and Bob Smith has taken over the \nreins there. Max Baucus is the ranking member, and their leadership has \nbeen excellent. We worked hard to get things done. The funny thing is, \nit seemed that a spirit of bipartisanship just emerged without it being \nput into a record book or a program design. It just worked that way.\n\n  I served on the Budget Committee. I did see Senator Pete Domenici \nhere. I did that for 16 years. I worked with the best. Pete Domenici is \nan outstanding chairman. We disagree on some of the policy things, but \nI wanted Senator Domenici to know how much I respected his work as \nchairman of the Budget Committee. I finally got his attention.\n  Senator Domenici and I had some disagreements--we had many \nagreements. But above all, we maintained respect for one another. That \neven developed, if I might describe it, as affection for one another, a \nrespect for the turn our lives have taken and the problems we both \nwould like to solve in our society.\n  We had Jim Exon, Jim Sasser, Senator Stevens, we had some really good \npeople--Lawton Chiles--who worked to chair these committees. There are \nothers who left us with a memory of some greatness: People such as Ted \nKennedy, Pat Moynihan, fighters such as Howard Metzenbaum, Dale \nBumpers, statesmen such as Joe Biden, Lloyd Bentsen, and my colleague \nBill Bradley; and American heroes such as Danny Inouye, Bob Dole, Bob \nKerrey, and John Glenn--people who paid, in many cases, steep prices \nfor their service to country.\n  We worked with Presidents from both parties. Despite our differences, \nI was able to get things done with Presidents Reagan and Bush. \nParticularly with President Reagan, as I noted, I was able to get the \nlegislation in place that raised the legal drinking age to 21. \nPresident Bush signed my legislation to ban smoking on all domestic \nairlines. I don't know whether that says something about the old saw \nthat divided leadership in the various parts of government maybe \nproduces good results. I wish I could have tried it all my way, but it \ndid not get to work. But the system does work.\n  I cannot leave this place with any criticism of the place not working \nor so forth. Sometimes the work goes slower than you would like. \nSometimes it is more painful than you would like. But the fact is, this \ninstitution of government does work, and the people across the country \nhave to know that, even as we looked at this kind of torturous process \nthat followed the election we just completed. We are on to a new \nPresidency. We are on to the hope for the next century, for the next \nadministration at least, that America will be able to continue to \nenforce its leadership in the world, not only militarily or \nfunctionally, but morally as well.\n  So, Mr. President, it has been quite a go that I have had, to use the \nexpression. I worked very hard for my State. I love New Jersey. I was \nborn there. We have had Members in Congress there from both parties, \nand we worked together on a variety of joint Federal and\n\n[[Page S11836]]\n\nState matters such as transportation, health care, and welfare. We had \nGovernors such as Tom Kean, Jim Florio, and the present Governor \nChristine Todd Whitman. We were able to put politics aside and work \ntogether for the good of the people of the State of New Jersey. I am \ndeeply grateful to the people of New Jersey. I thank them for putting \ntheir trust in me by sending me to the U.S. Senate for three terms. I \nhope I have made good on their trust and did the job they elected me to \ndo.\n  I welcome John Corzine, who is going to take this seat in the 107th \nCongress. He is a terrific fellow. He is going to do an excellent job, \nin my view. I was pleased to work with him in the election and, as a \nmatter of fact, through these past couple of weeks as well, to see if I \ncould be of help to him as he gets himself established, ready to take \non the assignments of the Senate as Senator from New Jersey.\n  I also extend my thanks to President Bill Clinton and Vice President \nAl Gore. Their leadership in the past 8 years has resulted in \nunprecedented growth and prosperity for our country. For that I am \ngrateful. Their leadership also helped us solve some of the problems \nthat beset the world, whether it was in Kosovo or Ireland, where \ndivision and torment and violence existed for so many years. It is \nworking its way slowly to a peaceful coexistence between the parties \nthere. President Clinton deserves enormous credit for that and our \nintervention in Kosovo to stop the killing and abuse of people there.\n  We look at the Clinton years as years of good government, of good \naccomplishment, to say President Clinton and Vice President Gore will \nbe remembered for the good things they brought to this country.\n  I thank my staff, perhaps the most loyal anyone could have, and many \nof them are here tonight and have stayed with me, as they say, to the \nend. Many of them have their own concerns, their own families, their \nown futures, their own careers to look after, but they stuck by, and we \ncontinued to get things accomplished--even this, though it is my last \nactive day as a Senator, though I will be a Senator until January 3. My \nstaff and I are showing we are still fighting to get things done.\n  I was pleased with the outcome for Amtrak. Our people have worked \nlong hours with great energy. They are talented, professional, bright, \nskilled people who are totally committed to our common view of public \nservice. Whether it was in my personal office, State offices, Budget or \nAppropriations Committees, my people made enormous contributions day in \nand day out, and my service has been enriched and made more effective \nby their contribution.\n  I have had some great people on the staff over the years who have \ndedicated their time and energy to advance our agenda. They have been \noutstanding public servants, anonymously serving the public interest, \nnot elected but just as dedicated as anyone who has been elected to \noffice.\n  I want to take a few minutes to name for the Record people such as \nEve Lubalin, my first legislative director, who served for many years \nas my chief of staff and campaign manager as well. She worked on so \nmany of our accomplishments in 17 years in my office.\n  Mitchell Oster worked on my 1982 campaign and later was my \nlegislative director. He was an excellent, smart, aggressive staffer.\n  A friend of mine who worked with me as a press secretary and State \ndirector is Jim McQueeny.\n  James Carville and Paul Begala managed my campaign in 1988. I hope \nthat was part of the propulsion that led them to the lofty positions \nthey had in campaign logistics and successes.\n  Karin Elkis has been on my staff since 1983.\n  Bruce King is the staff director of the Senate Budget Committee.\n  Sandy Lurie, my current chief of staff, has been on the staff for 10 \nyears and has been involved in so many of my initiatives.\n  Maggie Moran is my State director.\n  Dan Katz, my outstanding legislative director, has helped me with so \nmany public health issues.\n  Tom Dosh has worked for me for 18 years, skillfully running the \nadministrative and financial management side of all my offices.\n  And my long-time assistant Eleanor Popeck has worked for me for over \n35 years. She was with me as an assistant when I ran ADP and has worked \nin my Washington office and Newark office as well. She is an \noutstanding public servant. Her contributions have been significant.\n  Peter Rogoff has worked with me on the Appropriations Transportation \nSubcommittee for over 10 years and has assisted me with so many major \ntransportation accomplishments.\n  There are many others over the years, and I wish I had time to \nmention them all. That would be disagreeable with some of the people in \nthe Chamber. I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a list of \nmy key staffers over the years.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Staff Since January 1999 and Other Key Staff\n\n       Amy Abraham, Jeff Acconzo, Sharon Anderson, Nisha Antony, \n     Claudia Arko, Renee Ashe, Bill Ayala, John Bang, Lisa \n     Baranello, Frederic Baron.\n       Karyn Barr, Gabrielle Batkin, Steve Benson, Maggie \n     Bierwith, Patrick Bogenberger, Natalie Broadnax, Dana \n     Brookes, Aaron Brusch, Scott Campbell, Cathy Carpino.\n       Rock Chueng, Sally Cluthe, Todd Coleman, Bill Crawley, \n     Debbie Curto, Christy Davis, Sallie Derr, Nicole Di Lella, \n     Tom Dosh, Andrea Edwards.\n       Karin Elkis, Val Ellicott, Rob Elliott, Ron Eritano, Jim \n     Esquea, Kyra Fischbeck, Alex Formuzis, Alison Fox, Lorenzo \n     Goco, Lisa Haage.\n       Heidi Hess, Melissa Holsinger, David Hoover, Louis Imhof, \n     Dan Katz, Bruce King, Lisa Konwinski, Peter Kurdock, Lou \n     Januzzi, Andrew Larkin.\n       Vanessa Lawson, Josh Lease, Steve Leraris, Mada Liebman, \n     Julie Lloyd, Ruth Lodder, Eve Lubalin, Sander Lurie, Amy \n     Maron, Colleen Mason.\n       Denise Matthews, Katie Melone, Melissa Miller, Maggie \n     Moran, Courtenay Morris, Marty Morris, John Mruz, Sue Nelson, \n     Mark Nevins, Liz O'Donoghue.\n       Tony Orza, Deborah Perugini, Blenda Pinto, Lisa Plevin, \n     Michael Pock, Ellie Popeck, Peter Rogoff, Mike Rose, Nadine \n     Rosenbaum, Jon Rosenwasser.\n       Nikki Roy, Peter Saharko, Laurie Saroff, Dawn Savarese, \n     Jack Schnirman, Paul Seltman, Jeff Siegel, Retha Sherrod, \n     Tralonne Shorter, Lisa Singleton.\n       Monica Slater Stokes, Arvind Swamy, Beth Tarczynski, Keith \n     Totaro, Kathy Unzicker-Byrd, Chip Unruh, Raj Wadhwani, \n     Barbara Wallace, Mitch Warren, Sharon Waxman, Ted Zegers.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Finally, Mr. President, this is not a day without \nemotion. Eighteen years of my life have been spent here, 18 of the most \nsatisfying years one could imagine. Couple that with some 3 years in \nthe Army, and I have served the Government for 20 years.\n  I have enjoyed it all. It has been an incredible learning experience \nfor me, but I owe a special thanks to four people: My four children, \nEllen, Nan, Lisa, and Josh. I asked them in the early stages what they \nthought about my running for office. I was chairman of a very large \ncompany, and life was pretty good. They all agreed that it was \nsomething I ought to do. We did not realize at the time what kind of an \ninterference with normal family life it would be. It has taken lots of \ntime away from our enjoyment of doing things together.\n  I came to the Senate because I love them so dearly that I wanted to \nmake sure their lives would be safer and fuller. How was that to be \naccomplished? It was not by earning more assets and resources. I knew \nmy children and my grandchildren could never be as safe as I would like \nthem to be unless everybody's children were as safe as they should be \nby getting rid of violence in the streets, in the communities, in the \nneighborhoods, in the schools.\n  How does one do that? I could not single my kids out and say, OK, \nlet's make sure they are safe and protected. No, I had to say all \npeople's children have to be safe and protected, and that is what I \nhave tried to do here.\n  That was my inspiration. That outlined the goals I set for myself. \nThat is why I wanted to raise the drinking age, lower the blood alcohol \ncontent, get guns out of people's houses, reduce smoking in public \nareas, make sure toxic chemicals were known throughout the communities \nin the Right To Know Act, and make sure terrorists did not run freely \nthrough our society or through the world chasing American citizens, \nabusing them, killing them.\n  I tried. I have not accomplished all of those things, but a lot of \nthem have been accomplished. I wanted the highways to be safer and the \nskyways to be\n\n[[Page S11837]]\n\nsafer because of the belief I had that people around the country would \nshare my view on that.\n  Now the pictures are off the wall, the furniture is moved out, the \nday is closing for the end of my Senate service. I will acknowledge \nthat it was more than skills and knowledge that brought me here. Some \nof that was the pure good fortune of the people of New Jersey electing \nme the first time I went out to run for office. They did not know me \nfrom anybody else, but they looked at the record my company had and how \nwe built it from nothing to something important. They looked at my \nservice as commissioner of the Port Authority of New Jersey and New \nYork that controls the bridges, tunnels, terminals, and buildings in \nNew York that was an appointed post. People looked at me and said: \nWell, we don't know this guy, but it looks like he has done some things \ncorrectly. They saw pictures of my family. They know how devoted I am \nto them. I also was chairman of one of the largest charities of the \nworld for 3 years. They entrusted me with this seat, the New Jersey \nseat, that I occupied for 18 years. I always refrain from calling it \n``my seat'' because it is not; I filled it for a while.\n  In closing, I thank the occupant of the chair for the opportunities \nwe have had to share common goals and for his decency in reviewing \nthose with me and having an open mind on many of the issues. I thank my \nfriend from Nevada who stands as the guardsman of the floor in his \nassignment for the Democrats as the whip, and I note the respect I felt \nfor him when I saw how arduously he worked to protect his State from \nbecoming a nuclear dump, even when we struggled to find a place to put \nthat material --and we do have to find a place. The fact of the matter \nis, if we defend the interests of our States in concert with the \ninterests of our country, we will have done our jobs correctly.\n  I hope the legacy I leave will create a brighter future for the \npeople who sent me here, for my eight wonderful grandchildren, and for \nall of those I took the oath to serve.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11837-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11837-S11841]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMINISCENCE AND FAREWELL\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, on this last day of the 106th Congress I \nwould ask to be allowed a moment of reminiscence and farewell.\n  Come January 3--deo voluntus, as the Brothers used to teach us--I \nwill have served four terms in the United States Senate, a near quarter \ncentury. In our long history only one other New Yorker, our beloved \nJacob K. Javits, has served four terms. I had the fortune of joining \nthe Finance Committee from the outset, and served for a period as \nchairman, the first New Yorker since before the Civil War. I was also, \nat one point, chair of Environment and Public Works. I have been on \nRules and Administration for the longest while, and for a period was \nalso on Foreign Relations. Senators will know that it would be most \nunusual for someone to serve on both Finance and Foreign Relations at \nthe same time. An account of how this came about may be of interest.\n  The elections of 1986 returned a Democratic majority to the Senate \nand the Democratic Steering Committee, of which I was then a member, \nbegan its biannual task of filling Democratic vacancies in the various \nstanding committees. There are four ``Super A'' committees as we term \nthem. In order of creation they are Foreign Relations, Finance, Armed \nServices and Appropriations. With the rarest exceptions, under our \ncaucus rules a Senator may only serve on one of these four.\n  There were three vacancies on Foreign Relations. In years past these \nwould have been snapped up. Foreign Relations was a committee of great \nprestige and daunting tasks. Of a sudden however, no one seemed \ninterested. The Senate was already experiencing what the eminent \nstatesman James Schlesinger describes in the current issue of The \nNational Interest as ``the loss of interest in foreign policy by the \ngeneral public'' (p. 110). Two newly-elected Senators were more or less \npersuaded to take seats. At length the Steering Committee turned to me, \nas a former ambassador. I remained on Finance.\n  And so I served six years under the chairmanship of the incomparable \nClaiborne Pell of Rhode Island. I treasure the experience--the signing \nand ratification of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START I), the \nfinal days of the Cold War. But I continue to be puzzled and troubled \nby our inattention to foreign affairs. To be sure, the clearest \nachievement of this Congress has been in the field of foreign trade, \nwith major enactments regarding Africa, the Caribbean, and China. \nThese, however, have been the province of the Finance Committee, and it \nwas with great difficulty and at most partial success did Chairman Bill \nRoth and I make the connection between world trade and world peace. \nThis would have been self-evident at mid-century. I remark, and I \nbelieve there is a case, that any short list of events that led to the \nSecond World War would include the aftermath of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff \nof 1930. Indeed, in the course of the ceremony at which the President \nsigned the measure naming possible permanent normal trade relations \nwith China in connection with its admission to the World Trade \nOrganization, I observed that the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference, which \nconceived the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and \nanticipated an international trade organization, opened on the day I \njoined the Navy. For certain there was no connection, but my point was \nsimply that in the midst of war the Allies were looking to a lasting \npeace that might follow, and this very much included the absence of \ntrade wars.\n  But again, how to account for the falling-off of congressional \ninvolvement in foreign affairs. I offer the thought that the failure of \nour intelligence, in the large sense of term, to foresee--forsooth to \nconceive!--the collapse of the Soviet Union has brought forth a \npsychology of denial and avoidance. We would as soon not think too much \nabout all, thank you very much.\n  I have recounted elsewhere the 1992 hearings of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee on the START I Treaty. Our superb negotiators had mastered \nevery mind-numbing detail of this epic agreement. With one exception. \nThey had negotiated the treaty with a sovereign nation, the Union of \nSoviet Socialist Republics. Now they brought to us a treaty signed with \nfour quite different nations: Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. \nWhen asked when this new set of signatories was agreed to, the \nCommittee was informed that this had just recently taken place at a \nmeeting in Lisbon. An observer might well have wondered if this was the \nscenario of a Humphrey Bogart movie. The negotiators were admirably \nfrank. The Soviet Union had broken up in December 1991. Few, if any, at \ntheir ``end of the street'' had predicted the collapse. Let me correct \nthe record: None had.\n\n  As to the record, I would cite the 1991 article in Foreign Affairs by \nthe estimable Stansfield Turner. The Admiral had served as Director of \nCentral Intelligence and knew the record. He was blunt, as an admiral \nought. I cite a passage in Secrecy:\n  [Turner wrote,] ``We should not gloss over the enormity of this \nfailure to forecast the magnitude of the Soviet crisis. We know now \nthat there were many Soviet academics, economists and political \nthinkers, other than those officially presented to us by the Soviet \ngovernment, who understood long before 1980 that the Soviet economic \nsystem was broken and that it was only a matter of time before someone \nhad to try and repair it, as had Khrushchev. Yet I never heard a \nsuggestion from the CIA, or the intelligence arms of the departments of \ndefense or state, that numerous Soviets recognized a growing systemic \neconomic problem.'' Turner acknowledged the ``revisionist rumblings'' \nclaiming that the CIA had in fact seen the collapse coming, but he \ndismissed them: ``If some individual CIA analysts were more prescient \nthan the corporate view, their ideas were filtered out in the \nbureaucratic process; and it is the corporate view that counts because \nthat is what reaches the president and his advisors. On this one, the \ncorporate view missed by a mile. Why were so many of us insensitive to \nthe inevitable?\n  Just as striking is the experience of General George Lee Butler, \nCommander of the U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM) from 1990 to 1994. \nAgain to cite from Secrecy.\n  As the one responsible for drafting the overall U.S. strategy for \nnuclear\n\n[[Page S11838]]\n\nwar, Butler had studied the Soviet Union with an intensity and level of \ndetail matched by few others in the West. He had studied the footage of \nthe military parades and the Kremlin, had scrutinized the deployments \nof Soviet missiles and other armaments: ``In all, he thought of the \nSoviet Union as a fearsome garrison state seeking global domination and \npreparing for certain conflict with the West. The only reasonable \nposture for the United States, he told colleagues, was to keep \nthousands of American nuclear weapons at the ready so that if war broke \nout, Washington could destroy as much of the Soviet nuclear arsenal as \npossible. It was the harrowing but hallowed logic of nuclear \ndeterrence.'' But Butler began having doubts about this picture, upon \nwhich so much of U.S. foreign policy was based, by the time of his \nfirst visit to the Soviet Union, on December 4, 1988. When he landed at \nSheremetyevo Airport, on the outskirts of Moscow, he thought at first \nthat the uneven, pockmarked runway was an open field. The taxiways were \nstill covered with snow from a storm two days earlier, and dozens of \nthe runway lights were broken. Riding into downtown Moscow in an \nofficial motorcade, Butler noticed the roads were ragged, the massive \ngovernment buildings crumbling. He was astonished when the gearshift in \nhis car snapped off in his driver's hand. After pouring over thousands \nof satellite photos and thirty years' worth of classified reports, \nButler had expected to find a modern, functional industrialized \ncountry; what he found instead was ``severe economic deprivation.'' \nEven more telling was ``the sense of defeat in the eyes of the people. \n. . . It all came crashing home to me that I really had been dealing \nwith a caricature all those years.''\n  General Butler was right. More than he might have known. This fall \nformer National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski estimated that the \neconomy of ``Russia is one-tenth the size of America and its industrial \nplant is about three times older than the OECD average.'' The \npopulation has dropped from 151 million in 1990 to 146 million in 1999. \nInfant mortality is devastating. Far from overwhelming the West, it is \nproblematic as to whether Russia can maintain a presence east of the \nUral Mountains. If you consider that the empire of the Czars once \nextended to San Francisco we can judge the calamity brought about by \nsixty-some years of Marxist-Leninism.\n  And yet we did not judge. To say again, the United States government \nhad no sense of what was coming, not the least preparation for the \nimplosion of 1991.\n  In 1919, John Reed, a Harvard graduate, and later a Soviet agent \nwrote Ten Days that Shook the World, his celebrated account of the \nRussian Revolution, as it would come to be known, in October 1917. In \nno time these events acquired mythic dimension for intellectuals and \nothers the world over. At Harvard, Daniel Bell would patiently guide \nstudents through the facts that there were two Russian Revolutions; the \nfirst democratic, the second in effect totalitarian. But this was lost \non all but a few.\n  It would appear that the Soviet collapse was so sudden, we were so \nunprepared for it, that we really have yet to absorb the magnitude of \nthe event. It was, after all, the largest peaceful revolution in \nhistory. Not a drop of blood was shed as a five hundred year old empire \nbroke up into some twelve nations, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, \nGeorgia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, \nTurkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Ukraine, whilst formerly independent \nnations absorbed into the Soviet Bloc, Poland, the Czech Republic, \nLithuania, Latvia, Estonia et al., regained their independence. In the \naftermath there has been no book, no movie, no posters, no legend.\n  To the contrary, weak Russia grows steadily weaker--possibly to the \npoint of instability, as shown in the miserable events in Chechnya. We \nsee a government of former agents of the intelligence services and the \nsecret police. We see continued efforts at increasing armament. Witness \nthe sinking of the nuclear submarine Kursk. We see the return of the \nred flag. We see little engagement with the West, much less the East \nwhere China looms with perhaps ten times the population and far more \neconomic strength.\n  And the United States? Apart from a few perfunctory measures, and one \nserious, the Nunn-Lugar program, almost no response. To the contrary, \nat this moment we have, as we must assume, some 6,000 nuclear weapons \ntargeted on Russia, a number disproportionate at the height of the Cold \nWar, and near to lunacy in the aftermath. When, as Senator Lugar \nestimates, the Russian defense budget has declined to $5 billion a \nyear.\n  What is more, other than the highest echelon of the Pentagon, no \ndoubt some elements of the intelligence community, possibly the \nDepartment of State, no American knows what the targeting plan is. In \nparticular, Members of Congress, possibly with very few exceptions, do \nnot know. Are they refused information? Just recently, our esteemed \ncolleague, J. Robert Kerrey of Nebraska, wrote the Secretary of \nDefense, William S. Cohen, a former colleague of ours, to set forth the \nfacts of this insane situation.\n  There are signs that an open debate concerning nuclear weapons may be \nafoot. In The Washington Post recently, we learn of the response to a \nproposal by Stephen M. Younger, associate director of Los Alamos \nNational Laboratory and head of its nuclear weapons work, proposing a \ngreat reduction in the number of massive weapons now in our arsenal in \nfavor of smaller devices intended to deal with much smaller engagements \nthan those envisioned during the Cold War. The Post reports that we now \nhave some 7,982 warheads linked to nine different delivery systems, \nICBMs, SLBMs and bombers. These are scheduled to decline to 3,500, half \non Trident II submarines, under the Start II agreement. Younger argues \nthat still fewer are needed. Any one of which would wipe out any large \ncity on earth. It appears that other experts believe that a few dozen \nto several hundred of today's high-yield warheads would suffice to \nmanage the standoff with Russia or China. There is, perhaps more \nurgently, the matter of nuclear weapons in what are for some reason \nstill called Third World nations, a relic of Cold War usage. Nuclear \nstandoff has settled into the South Asian subcontinent. The prospect \nthat an ``Islamic Bomb'' will migrate westwards from Pakistan is real \nenough. It may be happening at this moment. The more then do we need \nopen debate. The more urgent then is Senator Kerrey's assertion that \nCongress be involved. His profound observation that ``Sometimes secrecy \nproduces its opposite; less safety and security.''\n  I have remarked on how little notice has been taken of the Russian \nrevolution of 1989-91. By contrast, the ``information revolution'' has \nbecome a fixture of our vocabulary and our pronouncements on the widest \nrange of subjects, and at times would seem to dominate political \ndiscourse. It might do well to make a connection as Francis Fukuyama \ndoes in the current issue of Commentary. In his review of a new book by \nGeorge Gilder with the suggestive title Telecom: How Infinite Bandwidth \nWill Revolutionize Our World, Fukuyama makes the connection.\n  Why, then, do those convinced that the revolution is already \ntriumphant shake their heads so sadly at those of us who ``just don't \nget it?'' True, people want to feel good about themselves, and it helps \nto believe that one is contributing to some higher social purpose while \npursuing self-enrichment. But it must also be conceded that the \ninformation-technology revolution really does have more going for it \nthan previous advances in, say, steam or internal combustion (or, one \nsuspects, than the coming revolution in biotechnology).\n  The mechanization of production in the 19th and early 20th centuries \nrewarded large-scale organization, routinization, uniformity, and \ncentralization. Many of the great works of imagination that accompanied \nthis process, from Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times to Aldous Huxley's \nBrave New World, depicted individuals subsumed by huge machines, often \nof a political nature. Not so the information revolution, which usually \npunishes excessively large scale, distributes information and hence \npower to much larger groups of people, and rewards intelligence, risk, \ncreativity and education rather than obedience and regimentation. \nAlthough\n\n[[Page S11839]]\n\none would not wish to push this too far, it is probably no accident \nthat the Soviet Union and other totalitarian regimes did not survive \nthe transition into the information age.\n  Is it possible to hope that we might give some serious thought to the \npossible connection? And to ask ourselves just how we measure up in \nthis regard?\n  That said, is it not extraordinary and worrying that of a sudden we \nfind ourselves in a state of great agitation concerning security \nmatters all across our government, from our nuclear laboratories at \nhome to embassies abroad to the topmost reaches of government? The late \nLars-Erik Nelson described it as ``spy panic.'' In the process the \npossibility emerges that our national security will be compromised to a \ndegree unimaginable by mere espionage. The possibility is that we could \ngrievously degrade the most important institutions of foreign and \ndefense policy--our capacity for invention and innovation--through our \nown actions.\n\n  Take the matter of the loss, and evident return in clouded \ncircumstances of two hard drives containing sensitive nuclear \ninformation from the Nuclear Energy Search Team at Los Alamos National \nLaboratory. This June, Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson asked two of \nour wisest statesmen, the Honorable Howard H. Baker, Jr., and the \nHonorable Lee H. Hamilton, to enquire into the matter. Here are the Key \nFindings of their report of September 25th.\n  While it is unclear what happened to the missing hard drives at Los \nAlamos National Laboratory, it is clear that there was a security lapse \nand that the consequences of the loss of the data on the hard drives \nwould be extremely damaging to the national security.\n  Among the known consequences of the hard-drive incident, the most \nworrisome is the devastating effect on the morale and productivity of \nLANL, which plays a critical national-security role for the Nation.\n  The current negative climate is incompatible with the performance of \ngood science. A perfect security system at a national laboratory is of \nno use if the laboratory can no longer generate the cutting-edge \ntechnology that needs to be protected from improper disclosure.\n  It is critical to reverse the demoralization at LANL before it \nfurther undermines the ability of that institution both to continue to \nmake its vital contributions to our national security, and to protect \nthe sensitive national-security information that is critical to the \nfulfillment of its responsibilities.\n  Urgent action should be taken to ensure that Los Alamos National \nLaboratory gets back to work in a reformed security structure that will \nallow the work there to be successfully sustained over the long term.\n  Almost alone among commentators, Lars-Erik Nelson pursued the matter, \ndescribing the interviews Senator Baker and Representative Hamilton had \nwith lab personnel.\n  They now report that ``the combined effects of the Wen Ho Lee affair, \nthe recent fire at [Los Alamos] and the continuing swirl around the \nhard-drive episode have devastated morale and productivity at [Los \nAlamos].\n  The employees we met expressed fear and deep concern over the . . . \nyellow crime-scene tape in their workspace, the interrogation of their \ncolleagues by . . . federal prosecutors before a grand jury and the \nresort of some of their colleagues to taking a second mortgage on their \nhomes to pay for attorney fees.\n  There is no denying that Lee and whoever misplaced the computer \ndrives committed serious breaches of security. But the resulting threat \nto our safety is only theoretical; the damage to morale, productivity \nand recruitment is real.\n  Employees were furious at being forced to take routine lie-detector \ntests, a requirement imposed on them by a panicky Secretary of Energy. \n. . .\n  Obviously, there is a need for security in government. A Los Alamos \nemployee gave Baker and Hamilton an obvious, easy solution. \nUnfortunately, it will be the one most likely to be adopted: ``The \nsafest and most secure way to do work is not to do any work at all.''\n  In the course of the Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government \nSecrecy (of which more later), a Commission member, then-Director of \nCentral Intelligence John M. Deutch, revealed to the American people \nthe extraordinary work of the VENONA project, an enterprise of the Army \nSecurity Agency during and after World War II. During the war the \nagency began to copy KGB traffic from and to the United States. On \nDecember 20, 1946, Meredith K. Gardner--I am happy to say still with \nus, buoyant and brilliant as ever--``broke'' the first. Dated 2 \nDecember 1944, it was a list of the principal nuclear scientists at Los \nAlamos. Bethe, Bohr, Fermi, Newman, Rossi, Kistiakowsky, Segre, Taylor, \nPenney, Compton, Lawrence and so on. The Soviets knew, and in time \nstole essentials of the early atom bomb. But what they could not do, \nwas to slow down or deter the work of these great men, who would take \nus further into the age of the hydrogen bomb. Next, their successors to \nyet more mind-bending feats. The Soviets could not stop them. Would it \nnot be the final triumph of the defunct Cold War if we stopped them \nourselves?\n\n  Do not dismiss this thought. If you happen to know a professor of \nphysics, enquire as to how many ``post-docs'' are interested in weapons \nresearch, given the present atmosphere. To work at one-third the salary \navailable elsewhere, and take lie detector tests.\n  And then there is intelligence. Nelson quotes a ``former top \nintelligence official'' who told him, ``If you're not taking secrets \nhome, you're not doing your job.'' And yet here we are harassing John \nM. Deutch, a scientist of the greatest achievement, a public servant of \nepic ability for--working at home after dinner. Would it be too far-\nfetched to ask when will the next Provost of the Massachusetts \nInstitute of Technology choose to leave the banks of the Charles River \nfor the swamps of the Potomac?\n  Now I don't doubt that, as opposed to an intelligence official, there \nare ambassadors who don't take their work home at night. Over the years \nthe United States has created a number of postings with just that \nattraction. But these are few. The great, overwhelming number of our \nambassadors and their embassy associates are exceptional persons who \nhave gone in harm's way to serve their country. I was ambassador to \nIndia at the time our ambassador to Sudan and an aide were abducted \nfrom a reception by Islamic terrorists, spirited away and murdered. \nSome days later the Egyptian envoy in New Delhi asked to see me. He had \na message from then-Egyptian President Anwar Sadat to tell me that \ntheir intelligence sources reported I would be next. It is a not \nuncommon occurrence. But nothing so common as taking work home, or \nworking in a--usually heavily armored--embassy limousine. Ask any \nformer ambassador to Israel. Our embassy in Tel Aviv is an hour's drive \nfrom the capital in Jerusalem. The drive up and back is routinely used \nto dictate memoranda of conversation, type them on a laptop. Whatever. \nThis fall, the superbly qualified, many would say indispensable \nambassador to Israel, Martin S. Indyk, was stripped of his security \nclearances for just such actions. I cite Al Kamen's account in The \nWashington Post.\n  Just the other day, ambassador to Israel Martin S. Indyk was deep \ninto the State Department doghouse for ``suspected violations'' of \nsecurity regulations. His security clearance was suspended, so he \ncouldn't handle classified materials. He needed an escort while in the \nState Department building. The department's diplomatic security folks \nwanted him to stay in this country until their investigation was \ncompleted.\n  At a White House briefing Monday, a reporter asked if Indyk could \n``function as ambassador? Do we have a functioning ambassador?''\n  ``Not at the moment,'' press secretary Jake Siewert said.\n  Allow me to cite a report by the redoubtable Jane Perlez, who was \njust recently reporting from Pyongyang on the psychotic security \nmeasures in the capital of North Korea. Eerily similar antics were to \nbe encountered on September 30, Ms. Perlez reported:\n\n State Dept. Unfreezes Hundreds of Promotions After Delay for Security \n                                 Review\n\n       Washington, Sept. 29.--A continuing security crackdown at \n     the State Department led to the freezing of promotions for \n     more than 200 senior officials, pending a review of their \n     security records, department officials said today.\n       The director general of the Foreign Service, Marc Grossman, \n     said he was assessing the promotion files for security \n     violations\n\n[[Page S11840]]\n\n     before sending the promotions to the White House, which then \n     dispatches them to Congress for approval.\n       The release of the list was delayed after the suspension of \n     the security clearance of one of the department's most senior \n     officials, Martin S. Indyk, ambassador to Israel, and a \n     sudden vigilance by Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, \n     who is under pressure from Congress on security problems.\n       This evening, the department said that ``under 10'' \n     officials had been barred from promotions after Mr. \n     Grossman's review of 400 candidates. The nearly 400 people \n     included 200 midlevel officials, whose promotions were \n     released today after a weeklong delay.\n       As word of the latest action spread through the department, \n     an assistant secretary of state complained at a senior staff \n     meeting this week that management faced ``rage'' in the \n     building and increasingly demoralized employees, according to \n     several accounts of the session.\n       Others, as well as diplomats abroad, complained of a \n     poisonous atmosphere in the department created, in part, by \n     security officials who grilled junior Foreign Service \n     officers about their superiors. One senior official said the \n     obsession with security had created a ``monster'' out of the \n     bureau of diplomatic security, which Congress generously \n     finances to the detriment of other areas of the department.\n       In a yet more eerie analogy, one department employee \n     described the situation as a ``security jihad.''\n       It doesn't stop. It accelerates! Just this month The \n     Washington Post reported the resignation of senior diplomats, \n     the suspension of another, the firing of a further two over \n     security matters.\n       J. Stapleton Roy, one of the nation's two most senior \n     foreign service officers and a three-time U.S. ambassador, \n     has resigned in protest after Secretary of State Madeleine K. \n     Albright suspended his deputy without pay and fired two other \n     long-time State Department officials over a missing top-\n     secret laptop computer. . . .\n       The departure of Roy and the reassignment of [Donald] \n     Keyser will rob the department of two of its top China \n     experts. The son of a missionary, Roy grew up in China, \n     returned to the United States to go to Princeton University, \n     then joined the foreign service. He later served as \n     ambassador to China, Indonesia and Singapore. Keyser had \n     served in Beijing three times, had been the State \n     Department's director of Chinese and Mongolian affairs, and \n     most recently held the rank of ambassador as a special \n     negotiator for conflicts in Nagorno-Karabakh and former \n     Soviet republics.\n       ``That's a lot of brainpower suddenly removed from the \n     State Department,'' said William C. McCahill, a recently \n     retired foreign service officer who served as the deputy \n     chief of mission in Beijing. ``Keyser is a brilliant analyst \n     and a person of great intellectual honesty and rigor. Stape \n     is the kind of person you want in INR, someone who can think \n     beyond today and tomorrow, who can think beyond established \n     policy.''--The Washington Post, December 5, 2000.\n\n  With some hesitation I would call to mind the purge of the ``China \nhands'' from the Department of State during the McCarthy era. As our \nCommission established with finality, there was indeed a Soviet attack \non American diplomacy and nuclear development during and after World \nWar II. There were early and major successes. The design of the first \natom bomb. But not much else, and for not much longer. The real \ndamage--the parallels are eerie--to American security came from the \ndisinclination of the intelligence community--then largely in the \nArmy--to share information with ``civilians.'' Specifically, documents \nobtained from the F.B.I. indicate that President Truman was never told \nof the Army Signals Security Agency's decryptions of Soviet cables \nduring and after the war. He thought the whole business of Communist \nspying was a ``red herring.'' In 1953 he termed Whittaker Chambers and \nElizabeth Bentley ``a crook and a louse.'' American diplomacy and the \nDepartment of State in particular were for years haunted by charges \nthey could readily have dealt with had they but known what their own \ngovernment knew. And who issued the instruction that the President was \nnot to be told? General Omar N. Bradley whom the President had made \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. (Admittedly it is hard to prove \na negative.) But I was reassured by an article in the Summer edition of \nthe ``Bulletin'' of the CIA's Center for the Study of Intelligence. In \nit, Deputy CIA historian Michael Warner votes with the judgment I \noffered earlier in my book ``Secrecy.''\n  What might it be that Secretary Albright needs to know today but has \nnot been told? A generation hence we might learn. If, that is, the \ncurrent secrecy regime goes unaltered.\n  For the moment, however, I have further distressing news for \nAmbassador Stapleton if he should have occasion to return to the \nDepartment of State main building for one or another reason. I have \njust received a copy of a letter sent to David G. Carpenter, Assistant \nSecretary of State for the Bureau of Diplomatic Security. Another \nrecently retired Ambassador, a statesman of large achievement and \nimpeccable reputation recently called at Main State, to use their term. \nHe was frisked at the entrance. He was allowed into the building, but \nassigned an ``escort,'' who accompanied wherever he went. Including, \nthe ambassador writes, ``the men's room.''\n  It is difficult not to agree with the Ambassador's assessment that \n``the `escort' policy is insulting and totally out of proportion to any \ndesired enhancement of security.'' But then so is so much of security \npolicy as it has evolved over the past sixty years.\n  What is to be done? Surely we must search for a pattern in all this. \nOur Commission proposed a simple, direct formation. Secrecy is a form \nof regulation.\n  In the previous Congress, legislation was prepared to embody the \nessentials of the Commission recommendations. All classified materials \nwould bear the name and position of the person assigning the \nclassification and the date, subject to review, that the classification \nwould expire. It is not generally realized, but apart from atomic \nmatters, under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and a few other areas \nthere is no law stipulating what is to be classified Confidential, \nSecret, Top Secret--and there are numerous higher designations. It is \nsimply a matter of judgement for anyone who has a rubber stamp handy. \nOur bill was unanimously reported from the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs, under the fine chairmanship of Senator Fred Thompson, with the \nfull support of the then-ranking Committee member, our revered John \nGlenn. But nothing came of it. The assorted government agencies, \ncovertly if you like, simply smothered it. The bureaucracy triumphed \nonce more. Thomas Jefferson's dictum that ``An informed citizenry is \nvital to the functioning of a democratic society'' gave way before the \nself-perpetuating interests of bureaucracy.\n  I am pleased to report that this year's Intelligence Authorization \nbill, which is now at the White House awaiting President Clinton's \nsignature, includes the Public Interest Declassification Act. The \nmeasure establishes a nine-member ``Public Interest Declassification \nBoard'' of ``nationally recognized experts'' who will advise the \nPresident and pertinent executive branch agencies on which national \nsecurity documents should be declassified first. Five members of the \nBoard will be appointed by the President and four members will be \nappointed by the Senate and the House.\n  The Board's main purpose will be to help determine declassification \npriorities. This is especially important during a time of Congress' \ncontinual slashing of the declassification budgets. In addition to the \nroutine systematic work required by President Clinton's Executive Order \n12958, the intelligence community is also required to process Freedom \nof Information Act requests, Privacy Act requests, and special searches \nlevied primarily by members of Congress and the administration.\n  There is a need to bring order to this increasingly chaotic process. \nThis Board may just provide the necessary guidance and will help \ndetermine how our finite declassification resources can best be \nallocated among all these competing demands.\n  My hope is that the Board will be a voice within the executive branch \nurging restraint in matters of secrecy. I have tried to lay out the \norganizational dynamics which produce ever larger and more intrusive \nsecrecy regimes. I have sought to suggest how damaging this can be to \ntrue national security interests. But this is a modest achievement \ngiven the great hopes with which our Commission concluded its work. I \nfear that rationality is but a weak foil to the irrational. In the end \nwe shall need character as well as conviction. We need public persons \nthe stature of George P. Shultz, who when in 1986 learned of plans to \nbegin giving lie detector tests for State Department employees, calmly \nannounced that the day that program began would be the day he submitted \nhis resignation as Secretary of State. And so of course it\n\n[[Page S11841]]\n\ndid not begin. And yet with him gone, the bureaucratic imperative \nreappears.\n  And so Mr. President, I conclude my remarks, thanking all my fellow \nSenators present and past for untold courtesies over these many years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11841-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11841-S11843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RETIREMENT OF SENATOR DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it saddens me to note that the Senate will \nsoon lose one of its most visionary and accomplished members, a great \nAmerican, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan.\n  It boggles the mind just to think of all of the important positions \nthat Pat Moynihan has held, including cabinet or subcabinet posts under \nfour presidents: John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, and \nGerald Ford. He served as Ambassador to India in the 1970's and then as \nU.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. He came to the United States \nSenate in 1977 already a scholar, author and public official of great \ndistinction and renown. In the 24 years he has spend here, he has only \ngreatly expanded his enormous reputation and body of work. Pat Moynihan \nis a Senator's Senator. Over the years, he has earned the respect of \nevery member of the Senate.\n  Pat Moynihan is a person who has shown tremendous vision throughout \nhis life. He has shown foresight about the importance of a strong \nfamily and about the importance of strong communities in America. He \nraised the critical important of these basic values and concerns about \nthe deterioration of these family values, long before others. He has \nshown great foresight about our Constitution. One of the highlights for \nme in my service in the Senate was joining Senator Moynihan and Senator \nRobert Byrd in fighting against the line item veto as a violation of \nour Constitution. And, he has shown great foresight about the world and \nthe role of the United States in international affairs. His work at the \nUnited Nations and in the Senate, as a former Chairman of the Senate \nSelect Committee on Intelligence, and as Chairman of the Finance \nCommittee have been marked by his perceptive, analytical, and worldly \nview on trade, foreign policy, and intelligence matters. Long before \nothers, Senator Moynihan was speaking of the economic and ultimately \nmilitary weaknesses of the Soviet Union and predicting its collapse.\n  It is virtually impossible to list all of Pat Moynihan's \naccomplishments in the U.S. Senate. Among the most lasting, however, \nwill be his efforts on behalf of architectural excellence in the \nnation's capital. He was a crucial force behind the return to greatness \nof the Pennsylvania Avenue corridor between the U.S. Capital and the \nWhite House, the restoration of Washington's beautiful, elegant, and \nhistoric Union Station, and the construction of the Thurgood Marshall \nJudiciary Building here on Capitol Hill.\n  The author or editor of eighteen books, Senator Moynihan has been at \nthe forefront of the national debate on issues ranging from welfare \nreform, to tax policy to international relations. His most recent book, \nwritten in 1998, ``Secrecy: The American Experience'' expands on the \nreport of the Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy \nof which he was the Chairman. This is a fascinating and provocative \nreview of the history of the development of secrecy in the government \nsince World War I and argument for an ``era of openness''.\n  At home in New York, in a state which is known for its rough and \ntumble politics, he has shown leadership again and again, demonstrating \nthe power of intellect and the ability to rise above the fray. That has \nbeen a wonderful contribution not just to New York but to all of \nAmerica.\n  As they leave the Senate family, which will never forget their huge \ncontribution, we salute Pat and Elizabeth Moynihan.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in the 211-year history of the United \nStates Senate, the State of New York has one of the richest and most \nstoried legacies.\n  Since 1789, New York has sent to the Senate 63 Senators. I have had \nthe distinct privilege of serving with four of them, most memorably, \nSenator Daniel Patrick Moynihan.\n  When the people of New York elected Pat Moynihan to represent them \nnearly 25 years ago, they sent to Washington a uniquely gifted and \ntalented man. Those are the reasons, Senator Moynihan is one of only \ntwo, out of 63 Senators from New York, to have been elected to four \nconsecutive terms in the United States Senate.\n  Senator Moynihan began his service to this nation more than 50 years \nago when he served in the United States Navy from 1944-1947--and he \nnever stopped being ``Mr. Public Servant.'' He served one governor, New \nYork's Averell Harriman, and four United States Presidents: two \nDemocrats, Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, and two Republicans, \nPresidents Nixon and Ford.\n  What a record. Pat Moynihan has given more than three quarters of his \nlife to his nation and his state. This country, the United States \nSenate, and New York are joyously thankful.\n  He has been a leader in so many areas that it challenges one to list \nthem all. But his impact on public architecture, monuments for future \ngenerations, are the hallmarks which this quiet gentleman reveres.\n  For over fifteen years now, I have had the privilege of serving with \nPat on the Senate's Environment and Public Works Committee. I have been \nfortunate to work closely with him and observe his tireless effort and \ncommitment to maintaining the architectural integrity of our great \npublic institutions.\n  Some 40 years ago, the Kennedy Administration made the decision to \nrevive Pennsylvania Avenue and restore the Federal Triangle. It was an \nextraordinary stroke of fortune that Pat Moynihan, a deputy to Labor \nSecretary Goldberg who played a primary role in the effort, had the \nresponsibility to draft a report that contained core ideas for \nredevelopment. The Federal Triangle, including the Ronald Reagan \nBuilding, and the Judiciary Building--to mention just a few--are \ndramatic evidence of his contributions that will live for years to come \nin the foundation of these magnificent buildings.\n  I cannot resist the temptation to recall that Senator Moynihan was \nfond of noting that it was Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon who \ninitially championed the idea of reviving the Federal Triangle and \nestablishing it as an international trade and cultural center. It took \na man of Pat Moynihan's talent, character and foresight to pick up and \nfinish that vision, started in the early 1930s, in such a grand manner.\n  I would be remiss were I not to take a minute to thank Senator \nMoynihan for his leadership and the personal courtesies he extended to \nme, as he took the initiative to name the departmental auditorium at \nthe Commerce Department building, the Andrew Mellon Auditorium. It \ntruly is a remarkable structure and aptly named.\n  Over 200 years ago, Pierre L'Enfant, as he laid plans for the new \nUnited States capital, could only hope that a man like Senator Moynihan \nwould one day work with such compassion and perseverance to keep alive \nthe true spirit and design envisioned in the original blueprints of \nGeorge Washington's federal city.\n  One of the most rewarding assignments in my own career in public \nservice, has been the opportunity to serve with Senator Moynihan as a \nmember of the Smithsonian's Board of Regents. The talented men and \nwomen who have served on the Board are unquestionably committed to the \narts and preserving this nation's cultural heritage. And I am certain, \nthat all of them who have served with him would agree that Pat \nMoynihan's leadership and guiding wisdom have been indispensable.\n  Beyond the physical monuments to his achievements, I will always \nremember Pat Moynihan for his humor, his intellect, his grace, his \neloquence, and his humility.\n  All of us here, before we cast the first vote, before we discharge \nthe first responsibility, take the oath of office. We solemnly commit \n``to support and defend the constitution. . . .'' ``Against all \nenemies. . . .'' we commit ``to bear true faith and allegiance'' and we \nundertake ``to faithfully discharge'' our duty. Senator Moynihan was a \nman of his word and here in the Senate he has always been true to his \nprinciples and true to his oath.\n  Pat Moynihan has been a giant in the Senate for some time. I only \nhope that the years ahead give him the time he has always wanted to do \nthose things he has never quite had the time to do.\n\n[[Page S11842]]\n\n  The Senate and the nation know Senator Moynihan as a true patriot, a \ngentlemen, and a statesman. His legacy is a remarkable gift we will \nbenefit from for years to come.\n  In closing, I would like to submit for the Record two articles that \nappeared in the Washington Post--one, written by George Will and the \nother by Benjamin Forgery. I ask to have printed in the Record these \narticles, so all citizens can read of the enormous contributions \nSenator Moynihan has made to this institution, his home State of New \nYork, and, indeed, this country.\n  The Nation's Capital--in the words that Navy men and women \nunderstand--bids you a final ``Well done, Sir. We salute you as the \nL'Enfant of this century.''\n  There being no objection, the material ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 17, 2000]\n\n                         Farewell, Mr. Moynihan\n\n                          (By George F. Will)\n\n       When this Congress ends, so will one of the broadest and \n     deepest public careers in American history. Daniel Patrick \n     Moynihan--participant in John Kennedy's New Frontier, member \n     of Lyndon Johnson's White House staff, Richard Nixon's \n     domestic policy adviser, Gerald Ford's ambassador to India \n     and the United Nations, four-term senator--will walk from the \n     Senate and political life, leaving both better for his having \n     been in them, and leaving all who observe them berefit of the \n     rare example of a public intellectual's life lived well--\n     adventurously, bravely and leavened by wit.\n       The intellectual polarities of his life have been belief in \n     government's ameliorative powers--and in William Butler \n     Yeats's deflation of expectations for politics:\n       Parnell came down the road, he said to a cheering man:\n       Ireland shall get her freedom and you will still break \n     stone.\n       Having served four presidents, Moynihan wrote that he did \n     not remember ever having heard at a Cabinet meeting ``a \n     serious discussion of political ideas--one concerned with how \n     men, rather than markets, behave.'' Regarding the \n     complexities of behavior, Moynihan has stressed the \n     importance of ethnicity--the Balkans, the Bronx, come to \n     that. Moynihan knew how wrong Marx was in asserting the lost \n     saliency of pre-industrial factors, such as ethnicity and \n     religion, in the modern age.\n       His gift for decorous disruptions was apparent early, when, \n     during a 1965 audience with Pope Paul VI, at a time when the \n     Church was reconsidering its doctrine of the collective guilt \n     of Jews for Christ's crucifixion, Moynihan, a Catholic, \n     shattered protocol by addressing the pope: ``Holy Father, we \n     hope you will not forget our friends the Jews.'' Later, an \n     unsettled member of the audience, the bishop of Chicago, \n     said, ``We need a drink.'' Moynihan said, ``If they're going \n     to behave like a Medieval court, they must expect us to take \n     an opportunity to petition him.''\n       During his U.N. service he decided that U.S. foreign policy \n     elites were ``decent people, utterly unprepared for their \n     work'' because ``they had only one idea, and that was \n     wrong.'' It was that the bad behavior of other nations was \n     usually a reaction to America's worse behavior. He has been a \n     liberal traditionalist, keeper of Woodrow Wilson's crusade \n     for lawful rather than normless dealings among nations.\n       ``Everyone,'' says Moynihan the social scientist, ``is \n     entitled to his own opinion but not his own facts.'' When in \n     1993 the Clinton administration's Goals 2000 asserted that by \n     2000 America's high school graduation rate would be 90 \n     percent and American students would lead the world in \n     mathematics and science achievements, Moynihan acidly \n     compared these goals to the old Soviet grain production \n     quotas. Of the projected 2000 outcome, Moynihan said: ``That \n     will not happen.'' It didn't.\n       Moynihan has written much while occupying the dark and \n     bloody ground where social science and policymaking \n     intersect. Knowing that the two institutions that most shape \n     individuals are the family and the state, he knows that when \n     the former weakens, the latter strengthens. And family \n     structure is ``the principal conduit of class structure.'' \n     Hence Moynihan's interest in government measures to \n     strengthen families.\n       Moynihan understands that incantations praising minimalist \n     government are America's ``civic religion, avowed but not \n     constraining.'' Government grows because of the ineluctable \n     bargaining process among interest groups that favor \n     government outlays that benefit them. And government grows \n     because knowledge does, and knowledge often grows because of \n     government.\n       Knowledge, says Moynihan, is a form of capital, much of it \n     formed by government investment in education. And knowledge \n     begets government. He says: Behold California's Imperial \n     Valley, unchanged since ``the receding of the Ice Age.'' Only \n     God can make an artichoke, but government--specifically, the \n     Bureau of Reclamation--made the valley a cornucopia. Time \n     was, hospitals' biggest expense was clean linen. Then came \n     technologies--diagnostic, therapeutic, pharmacological--that \n     improved health, increased costs and expanded government.\n       ``Not long ago,'' Moynihan has written, ``it could be \n     agreed that politics was the business of who gets what, when, \n     where, how. It is now more than that. It has become a process \n     that also deliberately seeks to effect such outcomes as who \n     thinks what, who acts when, who lives where, who feels how,'' \n     Moynihan appreciates the pertinence of political philosopher \n     Michael Oakshott's cautionary words: ``To try to do something \n     which is inherently impossible is always a corrupting \n     enterprise.''\n       The 14-year-old Moynihan was shining shoes on Central Park \n     West when he heard about Pearl Harbor. In the subsequent six \n     decades he has been more conversant with, and more involved \n     in, more of the nation's transforming controversies than \n     anyone else. Who will do what he has done for the \n     intellectual nutritiousness of public life? The nation is not \n     apt to see his like again, never having seen it before him.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Oct. 7, 2000]\n\n                 Moynihan's Legacy Is Written in Stone\n\n                          (By Benjamin Forgey\n\n       Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, on the edge of retirement as \n     the 106th Congress argues its way to a finish, tells the \n     story whenever he feels the audience is right. And why not? \n     It is a true-life Washington legend.\n       Time: Summer 1961. Place: The White House. Scene: A Cabinet \n     meeting with President John F. Kennedy. The nation's chief \n     policymakers are busily deliberating foreign affairs but \n     pause, Moynihan says, ``when the next-most-important issue in \n     government comes up--which, of course, is office space.''\n       That line always gets a laugh. Moynihan knows Washington \n     and knows what people think about Washington--one-liners at \n     the expense of the bureaucracy never miss. But what comes \n     afterward is the true beginning of the legend.\n       The president appoints Labor Secretary Arthur J. Goldberg \n     to co-chair ``something with the unpromising title of Ad Hoc \n     Committee on Federal Office Space.'' To Moynihan, then \n     Goldberg's 34-year-old deputy, falls the duty of finding out \n     exactly how much space is needed, and writing the report.\n       It is far-fetched to imagine a 15-page committee report \n     about government office space having much significance for \n     even 38 minutes after being written. This one, completed in \n     the spring of 1962, has had a far-reaching impact across 38 \n     years, for it contained, improbably, the genesis of a plan to \n     redevelop Pennsylvania Avenue.\n       The opportunistic idea was Goldberg's--he had decided to \n     try to do something about the avenue when surveying its \n     fragmented, decaying north side from a slow-moving limousine \n     during Kennedy's inaugural parade. But the brilliant words \n     were Moynihan's.\n       He vividly sketched the ``scene of desolation'' on the \n     northern side, opposite the impressive classic revival \n     buildings of the 1930s Federal Triangle. He sensitively \n     summarized the avenue's history, showing a rare understanding \n     of the crucial role assigned to it in Pierre Charles \n     L'Enfant's 1791 plan--``symbolizing,'' Moynihan wrote, ``at \n     once the separation of powers and the fundamental unity in \n     the American Government.''\n       Above all, Moynihan showed that he understood cities. The \n     avenue's poor state meant that private capital soon would \n     begin the process of tearing down and building anew. The \n     opportunity had arisen, he wrote, ``to design and \n     construct what would, in effect, be a new avenue,'' and \n     the federal government had a historic duty ``to maintain \n     standards of buildings and architecture in the nation's \n     capital.''\n       Moynihan's vision was humane and, for its time, \n     exceptionally urbane. ``Care should be taken,'' he \n     admonished, ``not to line the north side with a solid phalanx \n     of public and private office buildings which close down \n     completely at night and on weekends. . . . Pennsylvania \n     Avenue should be lively, friendly, and inviting, as well as \n     dignified and impressive.''\n       More than any other American politician of the second half \n     of the 20th century, Moynihan has engaged the issue of \n     architecture, urban design and infrastructure. He has used \n     his intellectual prowess, political skills and sheer power to \n     establish meaningful rules, to save historic buildings, to \n     improve federal architecture, to get buildings built. \n     Washington has been the great beneficiary of these \n     involvements--most dramatically on the section of the great \n     boulevard linking the Capitol and the White House.\n       There is a sense in which the rebuilding of Pennsylvania \n     Avenue became Moynihan's destiny. Partly by chance, partly by \n     design, he has been around to persuade, push and prod a \n     vision into reality. And, for the last 10 years, he has been \n     able to watch it happen with his wife, Elizabeth, from their \n     apartment above the Navy Memorial and Market Square, on the \n     avenue between Ninth and Seventh Streets NW.\n       Soon after the report was published, Goldberg was appointed \n     to the Supreme Court. Moynihan thus inherited responsibility \n     for shepherding the avenue dream in the Kennedy \n     administration. He became great pals with Nathaniel Owings, \n     the celebrated architect Kennedy chose to come up with a \n     plan. The pair would walk the avenue in the evenings and talk \n     excitedly of its past and future while sitting, recalls \n     Moynihan, on ``those nice, strong benches next to the \n     National Archives.''\n       Then, after Kennedy was assassinated, Moynihan helped keep \n     the project alive during the Lyndon Johnson presidency--\n     nothing\n\n[[Page S11843]]\n\n     had been built. He had the enthusiastic collaboration of \n     White House counsel Harry McPherson Jr., and an invaluable \n     plug from Jacqueline Kennedy, who ``saved the undertaking in \n     a farewell call on President Johnson,'' Moynihan recalls. \n     Thereafter, he says, Johnson ``took Mrs. Kennedy's wishes as \n     something of a command.''\n       Moynihan admits that, as much as he liked and admired Nat \n     Owings, he did not care for Owings's formidable first plan. \n     It was a ``terrible plan,'' he now says, though he did not \n     say so at the time. The young politician was perhaps a bit in \n     awe of the elder Great Architect--lots of people were. The \n     firm that Owings had started in the 1930s--Skidmore, Owings & \n     Merrill--was by then world-renowned.\n       How flawed was that first plan? Well, typical of its time, \n     it called for massive demolitions--including the National \n     Press Club building and the Willard and Washington hotels. \n     These were to be replaced by an impressively bloated National \n     Square or by massive buildings all in a row.\n       Fortunately, time was not kind to this vision. We can judge \n     how lucky we are by pondering the one building that actually \n     got built: the FBI headquarters, that odd-looking, off-\n     putting giant facing the avenue between Ninth and \n     10th streets NW.\n       It is possible that, even them, Moynihan suspected he was \n     in this for the long haul. As it happened, he left Washington \n     in 1965 but was backed by 1969--shockingly, to his liberal-\n     Democrat colleagues--as top urban affairs adviser to \n     Republican President Richard Nixon.\n       Once again, Moynihan had lots to say about Pennsylvania \n     Avenue. It is no coincidence that during Nixon's first term \n     the avenue plan was given real teeth in the 1972 legislation \n     creating the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corp. And it was \n     a very different, less destructive plan--much more in keeping \n     with Moynihan's original admonishment to be ``lively, \n     friendly and inviting.''\n       Nothing much got build during the '70s, but the PADC was \n     quietly preparing the groundwork. By the time building got \n     started in the early '80s, Moynihan was back in town, this \n     time as a senator from New York. Since then, he has been \n     there tirelessly for the avenue--out front or behind the \n     scenes, in large matters or small.\n       How large? The Ronald Reagan Building and International \n     Trade Center--the big mixed-use federal building at \n     Pennsylvania and 13th Street NW--is one of his enthusiasms. \n     Back in the Kennedy years, Moynihan's Labor Department office \n     in the Federal Triangle had looked out on parking lot of \n     ``surpassing ugliness.'' He never forgot, and that lot is \n     where the Reagan Building stands.\n       How small? Moynihan never forgot, either, that the Ariel \n     Rios Building, at 13th Street, had been left incomplete when \n     work on the Federal Triangle ceased; its brick sidewall was \n     left exposed ``just like an amputated limb,'' in the words of \n     J. Carter Brown, chairman of the federal Commission of Fine \n     Arts. Moynihan, Brown believes, was the ``eminence grise who \n     was able to shake the General Services Administration by the \n     lapels and get that thing finished.''\n       But if in one way or another Moynihan had a hand in \n     practically everything that was built--or saved--on this \n     crucial stretch of Pennsylvania Avenue, he also worked for \n     Washington in other ways. He helped mightily to preserve and \n     find new uses for three of Washington's most notable historic \n     structures--the Old Patent Office (now housing two \n     Smithsonian museums), the Old Post Office (a mixed-use \n     building because of a law Moynihan pushed through) and the \n     Old Pension Building (now the National Building Museum).\n       Just about single-handedly did Moynihan arrange for the \n     construction of the distinguished U.S. Judiciary Building \n     next to Union Station. He was a crucial negotiator in the \n     brilliant deal by which New York and Washington each get a \n     share of the National Museum of the American Indian. Moynihan \n     fought to get cars off Frederick Law Olmsted's Capitol \n     grounds. He continues to wage an enlightened campaign for \n     reasonableness about security in federal buildings. The list \n     could go on.\n       Of course, it isn't simply Washington that has benefited. \n     As might be expected, Moynihan's own state has profited \n     immensely as well.\n       The new Penn Station--a complex, ongoing project involving \n     federal, state and city bureaucracies and private \n     enterprise--is just the latest of dozens of important \n     examples. There's much talk of calling it ``Moynihan \n     Station'' because he was its ``guiding light and soul,'' says \n     chief architect David Childs.\n       Nor is it just Washington and New York. It is the nation. \n     Two examples of many: The Intermodal Surface Transportation \n     and Efficiency Act of 1991 and its successor, the \n     Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (``Ice Tea'' \n     and ``Tea 21'' for short), are Moynihan bills through and \n     through and through. By encouraging mass transit and \n     loosening the highway lobby's decades-old stranglehold on the \n     nation's transportation policy, these laws do the country an \n     estimable service.\n       And then there are his ``Guiding Principles of Federal \n     Architecture.'' They are straightforward and smart: There \n     should be no official style; the architecture should embody \n     the ``finest contemporary American architectural thought.'' \n     Regional characteristics should be kept in mind. Sites should \n     be selected with care. Landscape architecture also is \n     important.\n       The principles take us back to that committee report of 38 \n     years ago. Nobody asked for a Pennsylvania Avenue plan and no \n     one asked for architectural guidelines. Moynihan simply \n     invented them and attached them to the report, and they have \n     functioned as a beacon for high-quality federal architecture \n     ever since.\n       Moynihan's act is almost impossible to follow. In the \n     phrase of Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Oregon), another \n     architecture fan, Moynihan possesses ``a bundle of \n     qualities'' seldom found in a single politician: a good eye, \n     a first-rate mind, a passion for the subject, lots of power, \n     long experience, a certain flamboyance, a canny sense of \n     timing.\n       Nor is there likely to be another politician alive whose \n     favorite quotation is Thomas Jefferson's statement: ``Design \n     activity and political thought are indivisible.''\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today, I wish to pay tribute to the very \ndistinguished Senator from New York, who will be retiring at the end of \nthis Congressional session.\n  Senator Moynihan, as his recent biography makes clear, has been an \nintellectual giant in the Senate and throughout his service to our \nnation. The breadth of his interests--and his knowledge--is \nextraordinary. From questions about the architecture and urban \ndevelopment of Washington, D.C. to the problems created by single \nparent families to the workings of the International Labor \nOrganization, Senator Moynihan has thought deeply and designed policy \nanswers. I don't think there's a Senator who hasn't learned something \nfrom Senator Moynihan's vast stock of personal experience, \nunderstanding of history, and ability to draw parallels between \nseemingly unrelated topics to enlighten our understanding of both.\n  I have had the particular pleasure of serving with Senator Moynihan \non the Finance Committee for eight years. As Chairman and as ranking \nmember of the Finance Committee, Senator Moynihan has been a true \nleader. Starting in 1993, when I took Senator Bentsen's seat on the \nCommittee and Senator Moynihan claimed his chairmanship, Chairman \nMoynihan successfully guided the 1993 economic plan through the \ncommittee and the Senate. That budget, which I was proud to help shape \nand support, laid the foundation for our current record economic \nexpansion. That same year, we worked together to expose the \nshortcomings of the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n  After Republicans took control of the Senate in the 1994 election, \nSenator Moynihan was a fierce critic of their excessive budget \nproposals. We joined in opposing shortsighted proposals to have \nMedicare ``wither on the vine,'' turn Medicaid into a block grant, and \ndestroy welfare rather than reforming it. Senator Moynihan was, as \nalways, an especially passionate defender of teaching hospitals, \nwarning that the plan to slash spending for Medicare's graduate medical \neducation would threaten medical research in this country--a fear that \nhas proved well-founded as teaching hospitals have struggled to survive \nthe much smaller changes enacted as part of the compromise Balanced \nBudget Act that emerged in 1997.\n  The Finance Committee--and the Senate--will not be the same without \nhim. Who else will be able to gently tutor witnesses on the importance \nof the grain trade in upstate New York in the early nineteenth century \nto a current debate about health care policy? Who else will call for \nthe Boskin and Secrecy Commissions of the future? And who else will \neducate his colleagues on the inequitable distribution of federal \nspending and taxation among the various states?\n  Mr. President, I will miss Pat Moynihan. But I have no doubt that he \nwill continue to be part of the debate. As Senator Moynihan retires to \nhis beloved farm in upstate New York, I join my colleagues in looking \nforward to more and more insightful treaties on new and complicated \npolicy issues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11843-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11843-S11844]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RETIREMENT OF SENATOR J. ROBERT KERREY\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, when the Senate adjourns Senator Bob Kerrey \nwill be retiring from the Senate.\n  Bob Kerrey served his beloved state of Nebraska as a highly popular \nand successful governor from 1982 to 1987. As governor, he was widely \ncredited for his efforts to balance the budget and for educational and \nwelfare reform. In 1988, he was elected to the Senate. But, Bob Kerrey \nestablished himself as a man of great courage and intellect long\n\n[[Page S11844]]\n\nbefore he was elected governor or entered the U.S. Senate. He was an \nAmerican hero long before he became a Senate hero. Now he's both. Time \nand time again, he earned his reputation as one of the most courageous \nmembers of this body by taking on the toughest issues around--from \nentitlements to health care, and speaking his mind no matter what. He \ntook on sacred cows where others feared to act. He did so with \ntremendous dash and daring, with a wonderful youthfulness and \nenthusiasm. His speeches against amending the First Amendment of our \nConstitution relative to flag burning, for instance, have been speeches \nwhich I have often used as a resource back home to prove that the most \ncourageous among us--those that have put their lives on the line for \nthis country--also believe in its Constitution with great passion and \nbelieve we must not reduce its protections of our freedoms in response \nto the behavior of a few misguided or extreme individuals.\n  As a member of the Senate Finance Committee and the Senate \nAgriculture Committee, Bob has earned a reputation as a proponent of \ntax reform, Medicare and Social Security reform, and as a tireless \nadvocate for the nations' farmers.\n  The Senate will sorely miss Senator Bob Kerrey's wise and experienced \nvoice on national security matters. And, I will deeply miss his \npresence, although I trust that we will see him often and that his new \nrole at the New School University will not keep him from weighing in on \npublic policy issues that so need his special touch.\n  I have often thought, only half in jest, that Senator Kerrey should \nbe awarded a second Congressional Medal of Honor for his many brave \nstands in the Senate to match the one he won in war. It has truly been \na privilege to serve with Bob Kerrey and I will miss the noble passion \nand purpose he has brought to so many causes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my good \nfriend Senator Bob Kerrey. I have mixed emotions knowing that the \nUnited States Senate, the State of Nebraska, and the nation are losing \na valued public servant at a time when we can ill afford to lose a \nperson of such great talent. I am saddened thinking about the loss of \nhis valued presence in this chamber. But, I also recognize that my \nfriend is leaving by his own choice to take on the challenges of a new \nadventure as president of the New School University of New York City. \nNew challenges and new accomplishments are about to be added to his \nalready legendary list of achievements that include Medal of Honor \nrecipient, entrepreneur, governor, and Senator.\n  I smile as I think about the good company my colleague has been at \nthe Senate Committee on Agriculture. I always felt as if the hearing \nroom brightened up a notch when Senator Kerrey entered the room. I \nappreciated greatly the fact that we never failed to share a few light \nmoments together, even as we worked to help the farmers and ranchers we \nrepresent. His collegial approach crossed the aisle, too. Senator \nKerrey moved landmark agricultural legislation to passage with hard \nwork and the respect he garnered from his colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle, as he did this session with the crop insurance reform bill.\n  We also served together on the Senate Finance Committee, where \nSenator Conrad has been an absolute bulldog on the issue of entitlement \nreform. Senator Kerrey headed up the bipartisan entitlement commission \nand served on the Medicare Commission. He was a particularly active \nparticipant in the centrist coalition, which worked to find common \nground on budget issues during the partisan stalemate in 1995 and \n1996--an effort that helped produce the 1997 Balanced Budget Act. On \nthese very difficult issues, Senator Kerrey has always been willing to \nconsider policies that make sense for the long term even when these \npolicies carry a high political price in the short term. He was a \nleader in insisting that the Senate version of the Balanced Budget Act \ncontain long term Medicare reforms as well as short term fixes. Yet \nthroughout these discussions, Senator Kerrey has also been a strong \ndefender of the most vulnerable among us--from children in low income \nfamilies struggling to get by with cash assistance, food stamps and \nMedicaid to rural seniors who depend on adequate Medicare reimbursement \nto maintain health care in their local community.\n  All of us will miss his keen intellect, his insight and his candor. \nWe will miss his terrific sense of humor. We will miss his positive \nattitude. We will miss the unique perspective he brings to every \ndiscussion. We will miss his integrity and his courage. But most of \nall, we will miss the boundless enthusiasm he brings to public service. \nThere is no question the Senate will soon be made poorer by his \ndeparture, and there is no doubt Senator Kerrey will make the \nuniversity community he now joins richer by brining these wonderful \nattributes to his new position.\n  We thank you Senator Kerrey for your service to the United State \nSenate.\n  And I thank you for your friendship.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President. I rise today to pay tribute to Senator \nRobert Kerrey of Nebraska. As Undersecretary, then Secretary of Navy \nfor over five years during the war in Vietnam, I learned first hand the \ncourage and sacrifice of the men and women of the armed forces who \nserved our Nation.\n  Lieutenant, USN, Bob Kerrey earned our nation's highest recognition \nfor his valor and unwavering leadership during that conflict. Those \nsame extraordinary personal attributes Bob Kerrey brought to the \nSenate.\n  Serving with Bob is a reward all Senators will cherish. Though the \nchallenges of education will be his next call to duty, I predict he \nwill someday soon be back in public office. Enjoy this respite, my \nfriend, but harken to the bugle-call in years to come for another \ncareer to strengthen our nation with your ``brand'' of leadership.\n  I shall miss our vigorous floor debates, our trips abroad to visit \nour troops, our moments of levity as two old bachelors.\n  As we sailors say, ``well done sir''!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11844-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11844-S11845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RETIREMENT OF SENATOR SLADE GORTON\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as this session of Congress ends, Senator \nSlade Gorton of Washington will leave the Senate. Senator Gorton has \nlong been a leader among the Republicans and a thoughful voice in the \nSenate.\n  Senator Gorton, a hard-worker, has served not only on the Senate \nApproriations Committee, where he chairs the Interior Appropriations \nSubcommittee, but on the Budget Committee, the Commerce, Science and \nTransportation Committee, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, \nand the Indian Affairs Committee. He has carried an impressive \nworkload.\n  In addition, Slade Gorton, a former Attorney General in the State of \nWashington, earned a reputation as a tough proponent of fighting \nviolent crime, particularly international terrorism.\n  While proud of his conservative credentials, Slade Gorton was often \nwilling to reach across party lines to work with Democrats on issues \nlike consumer affairs and an increase in the minimum wage .\n  I admired Slade Gorton's work along with Senator Joe Lieberman to \nfashion a sensible, balanced and expeditious way to consider the \nimpeachment resolution sent to the Senate by the House of \nRepresentatives in 1998. While the plan was ultimately not adopted by \nthe Senate, the careful and judicious effort to put such a plan forward \nreflected Slade's commitment to the dignity of the United States \nSenate.\n  As this year winds to an end, I know that I am joined by my \ncolleagues in the Senate in wishing Slade Gorton and his wife, Sally, \ntheir three children and seven grandchildren, the very best in the \nyears ahead.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to add my voice to those \npaying tribute to Senator Slade Gorton upon his departure from the \nSenate.\n  I have had the privilege of serving with Senator Gorton on the Senate \nBudget Committee for the past eight years. During this time, Senator \nGorton has fought hard for the principles he believes in: a stable \neconomy and a balanced budget. He has made a significant contribution \nto bringing fiscal discipline to our nation. As part of that effort, in \n1996 Senator Gorton and I, as part of the Centrist Coalition, worked \nwith many other Senators to forge a compromise budget resolution that \nbalanced fiscal responsibility with our nation's discretionary spending \nneeds.\n\n[[Page S11845]]\n\nSenator Gorton can be proud of his contribution to ending the deficits \nof the 1980s and early 1990s.\n  Senator Gorton has been a leader in the Senate by focusing on the \nhigh-tech revolution that has dramatically changed our economy. He has \nfought to ensure that we are teaching the next generation of high-tech \nworkers in our schools and has fought to keep our high-tech sector the \nbest-trained in the world. He has also been a champion of providing tax \nincentives for companies to conduct the basic research and development \nthat has helped fuel the dramatic growth of the high-tech industry in \nrecent years.\n  Finally, let me recognize the work Senator Gorton has done as \nChairman of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee. Every year he has \nhad a difficult task developing a spending bill for the Interior \nDepartment and related agencies. He has also helped other Senators to \nmeet needs in their own states, and I appreciate all of Senator \nGorton's help over the years to meet particular needs in North Dakota. \nEven when Senator Gorton could not meet all the requests his colleagues \npresented, he was always fair in his consideration of each Senator's \nneeds.\n  Senator Gorton's dedication to the long-term health of our economy, \nhis work for the high-tech sector, and his leadership on the Interior \nAppropriations Subcommittee are but just a few examples of his work \nthat have produced clear results not only in Washington state, but also \nfor our entire nation. He will be missed here in the Senate, and I wish \nhim all the best in his future endeavors.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a genuine leader \nin the United States Senate, my colleague and friend--Senator Slade \nGorton.\n  We have served together over his entire 18 year career in the Senate. \nOf the 23 men and women who have served the State of Washington in the \nSenate, Slade has earned a ranking commensurate with those classic \ngiants Senator Henry ``Scoop'' Jackson and Senator Warren Magnuson.\n  Slade has served the State of Washington with distinction, but he has \nalso served the nation, exceptionally well. Beginning with his service \nin the United States Army in 1946, Slade has served his state and the \ncountry for nearly 40 years in a number of elected offices.\n  He has fought for balanced budgets, tax relief, and health care \nreforms. We served together on the Armed Services Committee, and I, as \nRanking Member, was the beneficiary of his wise and steadfast counsel.\n  Slade, you are a valued friend. I wish you and your wife Sally well \nin the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11845-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11845-S11846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE RETIREMENT OF SENATOR FRANK LAUTENBERG\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a fine \nindividual and distinguished colleague upon his retirement. At the \nclose of the 106th Congress, Senator Frank Lautenberg will step down \nfrom his position as a United States Senator after 18 years of dutiful \nservice to the people of New Jersey and the citizens of the United \nStates of America.\n  Senator Lautenberg has truly lived the American Dream. The son of \nimmigrants, Senator Lautenberg, was born in the hard working town of \nPaterson, New Jersey in 1924. During his childhood his family moved \nsome twelve times in search of employment, and his father spent a \nmajority of his time working in the Paterson silk mills.\n  After his high school graduation, Senator Lautenberg answered his \ncountry's call to duty when he enlisted and served in the Army Signal \nCorps in Europe during World War II. Following his military service, he \nenrolled in Columbia University on the G.I. Bill, and graduated with a \ndegree in economics in 1949.\n  Senator Lautenberg then began a very successful business career. He \nand two of his childhood friends founded Automatic Data Processing \n(ADP). ADP, a payroll services company, developed into one of the \nlargest computer service companies in the world.\n  Frank Lautenberg worked very hard to achieve success in the business \nworld. Many individuals would have simply stepped away to a more \nrelaxing and slow paced life, but not Senator Lautenberg. Throughout \nhis tenure, Frank Lautenberg has exhibited the characteristics of \npatriotism, hard work, and service to others that define great \nAmericans.\n  In 1982, he decided to begin a new career in public service, and for \nthe past 18 years he has represented the people of New Jersey in the \nUnited States Senate. Senator Lautenberg wanted to give back to the \nstate and Nation that gave him the opportunity to rise to great \nheights, and he has worked diligently to make America a better country \nfor her citizens and future generations.\n  It has been a pleasure working alongside Senator Lautenberg, \nespecially on such issues as reducing alcohol abuse. We shall miss him \nin the Senate chamber, and I wish Senator Frank Lautenberg and his \nentire family health, happiness, and continued success.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, one of the greatest pleasures of being a \nSenator is working with fellow-members like Frank Lautenberg. Few \nSenators have brought more dedication and experience to their service \nin this body.\n  I will never forget how excited my father was to meet Senator \nLautenberg when he first came here almost 18 years ago. My father of \nproud Irish decent followed Frank's first campaign. There was a \nwonderful connection between the two of them, and I am forever grateful \nto Senator Lautenberg for the lovely letter of condolence that he sent \nme when my father passed away. Frank Lautenberg is first and foremost a \ngood friend.\n  Of course, Senator Lautenberg is also a skilled legislator. We served \ntogether for years on the Appropriations Committee. Recently, the \ncommittee debated an amendment to the Defense bill that would lead to \nthe withdrawal of U.S. troops to Kosovo. A veteran of the European \ntheater in World War II and the builder of a data processing empire, \nSenator Lautenberg understood that democratic stability could come only \nthrough a long-term and patient investment in peace.\n  What made Senator Lautenberg's argument so effective was not just the \nideas he possessed but the way he delivered them. He has a rhetorical \nforce that I have always admired, and I think that this ability to \nmarry sound ideas with effective speech-making is what makes him such a \nstellar member.\n  Of course, Senator Lautenberg had a number of legislative \naccomplishments. He helped make our democracy more transparent, \nopposing confusing smoke and mirrors as a Chairman and Ranking Member \nof the Senate Budget Committee. He promoted international justice, \nfervently urging the prosecution of war criminals. Senator Lautenberg \nunderstood that reconciliation and economic growth could not come until \nthese perpetrators are held responsible and punished for their actions. \nAt home, Senator Lautenberg laid the foundation for our strong economic \ngrowth of the last decade. Amtrak and commercial aviation had no \ngreater friend than Senator Lautenberg, who confidently chaired the \nSenate Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation. And he has \nimproved the public's health, encouraging restrictions on tobacco use \nand ensuring the cleanup of hazardous waste sites.\n  In his 18 years here, Senator Lautenberg had an impact that goes \nbeyond his important votes and the bills he sponsored. Through his \nexperience and knowledge, he was steadfast advocate for freedom, \nfairness, and responsibility. He kept these ideal on an unalterable \ncourse, and we are all in his debt for it.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, before Congress adjourns for the year, I \nwanted to take a moment to pay tribute to Senator Frank Lautenberg of \nNew Jersey, who is retiring this year.\n  Senator Lautenberg served our nation in World War II, and later \nbecame a successful businessman. He helped to found a payroll services \ncompany, Automatic Data Processing (ADP), and built it into one of the \nlargest computing services companies in the world.\n  In 1982 Frank Lautenberg launched a new career, in public service, \nwhen he was elected to the United States Senate. He has represented his \nstate well. Frank Lautenberg has been a leader on budget issues, a good \nfriend to the environment, and an accomplished legislator in the areas \nof transportation and health care.\n\n[[Page S11846]]\n\n  I have served on the Senate Budget Committee with Frank Lautenberg \nsince 1987; he became Ranking Member of the Committee in 1997. Senator \nLautenberg played a key role in the 1997 negotiations on the bipartisan \nBalanced Budget Act, which completed the work of balancing the federal \nbudget. That legislation provided important resources for education and \nhealth care, while cutting taxes for millions of Americans.\n  Senator Lautenberg has also been a good friend to the environment, \nserving as the top Democrat on the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee's Subcommittee on Superfund. Throughout his time in the \nSenate, Senator Lautenberg has fought to improve the Superfund program, \nand has worked for legislation preventing pollution, and ensuring clear \nwater and clean air.\n  Senator Lautenberg's accomplishments in the area of transportation \nare impressive. He serves as the top Democrat on the Appropriations \nCommittee's Subcommittee on Transportation. Senator Lautenberg authored \nlaws establishing the legal drinking age at 21, and was successful just \nthis year in encouraging states to reduce legal blood alcohol limits to \n.08. He worked successfully to ban smoking on airplanes, and has \nchampioned funding for Amtrak and mass transit.\n  Senator Lautenberg has also worked for some time on health care, \nincluding tobacco policy issues. He is a nationally recognized leader \nin the fight to protect our young people from the health consequences \nof cigarettes. In 1997, I was extremely fortunate that Senator \nLautenberg was chosen to co-chair the Senate Democratic Task Force on \nTobacco. Senator Lautenberg was a particularly strong proponent of \nprovisions on second-hand smoke and the so-called ``look-back'' \nenforcement mechanism to reduce youth smoking rates.\n  Frank Lautenberg's dedication and expertise on many issues will be \nmissed greatly in the United States Senate, even as New Jersey natives \nwelcome him home. I will miss my good friend and colleague.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11846-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RETIREMENT OF SENATOR WILLIAM ROTH\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to join my colleagues in bidding \ngood wishes and God speed to Senator William Roth, the distinguished \nsenior senator of Delaware. I have served with Senator Roth for most of \nmy career on the Governmental Affairs Committee. For a significant \nperiod of that time, Senator Roth chaired that committee and its \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations.\n  Senator Roth proved an able and dedicated advocate of government \nreform, guiding our committee through oversight hearings and \ninvestigations into how our Federal programs were or were not working. \nHe also spearheaded a number of key efforts--many of which were \nsuccessful--to change our laws to reduce opportunities for waste, fraud \nand abuse.\n  When I sat in my seat on the dais of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, I often heard Senator Roth argue passionately and \nconvincingly for the enhancement of the M, or management \nresponsibilities, in OMB, the Office of Management and Budget. As much \nas anyone in this body, Senator Roth truly cared about the efficiency \nand effectiveness of government programs. He has my deep respect and \nthe gratitude of all of us for his efforts in this area.\n  In addition, Senator Roth distinguished himself as a gentleman in a \nchamber that has sometimes lost its gentlemanly manner. Senator Roth \ncould be tough, there's no doubt about that, on issues about which he \ncared, as well he should be, but he was always civil.\n  We will miss his gentlemanly ways and his guiding hand on the \nimportant but not-always-so-visible issues of government management. I \nwish him well and hope he enjoys an active but less hectic life which \nhe so clearly deserves.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a man I have \nworked with my entire Senate career: Senator Bill Roth. He is a true \nfriend and gentleman, as well as a superb legislator whose \ncontributions to the nation are many.\n  Senator Roth will likely be best remembered as the co-author of the \nfamous Kemp-Roth tax cuts, initiated during President Reagan's tenure \nand for the Roth IRAs which have made it possible for millions around \nthe country to invest taxable income that can be withdrawn tax-free in \ntheir retirement.\n  Senator Roth has represented Delaware for 29 years, making him the \nlongest serving Senator in our ``First State's'' storied history.\n  Senator Roth is a decorated veteran of World War II, and began his \nCongressional service in 1966. He has served his country for almost 40 \nyears. We all are indebted to him for his remarkable service.\n  I wish Senator Roth and his wife, Jane, well and hope that they will \ncherish the years to come in the same way they have those that have \npast.\n  Bill Roth's gentlemanly nature, his quietness and his humility were \nhis hallmarks and strength.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, when this Congress finishes its work it \nwill also mark the end of a particularly distinguished 30-year career \nin this body. I rise to pay tribute to my chairman on the Finance \nCommittee and my friend, Bill Roth.\n  No Senator could hope to serve under a more thoughtful and \nconsiderate Chairman than those of us on the Finance Committee have \nexperienced over the last five years. Bill is a true gentleman who \nworks as hard as any Senator I know to make sure that issues under his \ncontrol have the broadest possible consensus. He has consistently \nreached out to members on our side of the aisle in order to make law in \na way that honors the Senate's best traditions.\n  Like Bill, I represent a small state. He knows, as I know, what a \nspecial responsibility that is. People in a small state expect to have \na personal relationship with their Senators, and I know from the times \nI have taken short vacations in his beautiful state the deep affection \nBill inspires all over Delaware.\n  I am grateful for the opportunity I have had to work so closely with \nhim on the important tax, health, and trade issues we deal with in the \nFinance Committee. Bill has a natural appreciation for the strong roles \nagriculture and tourism play in the economy of my state of North Dakota \nbecause they are such important components of Delaware's economy as \nwell. He knows instinctively the value of looking for common ground.\n  Even as he leaves the Senate, however, one thing will set Bill apart. \nMany Senators are well known among the public at large, but very few \nhave their names become household words. Senator Roth earned his \nmembership in that tiny elite. Bill's deep commitment to retirement \nsecurity and savings led directly to the establishment of the Roth IRA, \na retirement savings vehicle that will give savers decades from now a \nreason to be grateful to our beloved colleague from Delaware.\n  When we consider the departure of Senator Roth in conjunction with \nthe simultaneous retirement of the Senator from New York, the Committee \non Finance is losing more than half a century of institutional memory \nand experience. That is a loss not only for our committee, but for the \ncountry as well.\n  We wish Bill Roth all the best as he leaves us, but he will be \ngreatly missed by his many friends and colleagues in the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11846-2", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11846-S11847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RETIREMENT OF SENATOR CONNIE MACK\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to pay tribute today to a colleague \nand good friend who will be leaving the Senate when the 106th Congress \nadjourns sine die, Connie Mack, the junior senator from Florida.\n  I have served with Connie Mack on the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence where, on the important issues of national security it \nconsiders, he can be counted upon to set partisanship aside, roll up \nhis sleeves and get to work.\n  In the United States Senate we are called upon to work with \ncolleagues of many differing points of view. While Connie Mack has \nserved as a key member of the Republican leadership as Republican \nConference Chairman, and he and I often disagree on the issues before \nthe Senate, it has always been a pleasure to deal with him. Always an\n\n[[Page S11847]]\n\nable advocate for his point of view, he is a willing listener, open to \ncompromise and when an opponent, always gracious, reasonable and fair.\n  Connie Mack has made a name for himself in the Senate on public \nhousing and health care issues, particularly his efforts to make FDA-\napproved drugs available for other uses, especially in the fight \nagainst cancer. He and his wife, Priscilla, both cancer survivors, have \nbeen inspirational in their dedication to delivering the message to all \nAmericans that early detection of cancer is a life-saver.\n  Connie Mack and I have shared a special bond, one of those inside \njokes which create strong personal ties. Whenever I hear of someone \nmaking a great speech, I shall smile inwardly, think of Connie and miss \nhis warm smile and the kind word he has for all of his Senate \ncolleagues. I hope that in the years ahead, Connie and Priscilla will \nvisit often.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to pay a tribute to my friend and \ncolleague from the State of Florida who has decided to leave the Senate \nafter a distinguished 12-year career here. It has been my pleasure to \nwork with Senator Mack during that time on a number of important \nissues.\n  He has always been willing to reach across the aisle when bipartisan \ncooperation can make the difference. As colleagues on the Finance \nCommittee, we have cosponsored each other's bills on such varied \nsubjects as benefits for retired coal miners, fairer treatment for real \nestate under the Internal Revenue Code, and keeping gray market \ncigarettes out of the U.S. market. Senator Mack has been a generous, \nthoughtful, and constructive member of our committee, and we will miss \nhis presence there every much.\n  Year in and year out, I am constantly impressed with the energy, \nintelligence, and commitment that Connie Mack brings to the challenging \njob of representing such a large and diverse State Floridians have been \nprivileged to have the benefit of his effective advocacy for their \nconcerns.\n  I am confident that a man with public policy interests over as wide a \nrange as Connie has shown during his tenure in the body is still going \nto be checking in with his old friends in the Senate to let us know \nwhat he's thinking. I hope we will see him often in the coming years.\n  I am happy to join my colleagues in wishing only the best for Connie \nand Priscilla as they move on to the next chapter in their lives.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Senator \nConnie Mack of Florida. There are many ways to discern the character of \na Senator. Connie Mack has made his mark with strong leadership coupled \nwith an unusual quality of gentleness. A true gentleman of the Senate. \nSenatorial courtesy was his hallmark. He loved this institution; it \nloved him.\n  One unique, but subtle mannerism reveals the inner security of this \ngreat man--how he handled the gavel. The gavel is that symbol of \nauthority so coveted by all Senators. As we all know, a gavel consists \nof two parts: the relatively small handle to hold, and the large \nhammer-like head to strike the blow. Senate Chairmen love the sharp \n``bang'' connoting authority and decision.\n  Senator Mack is the only Senator, the only Chairman, whom I have \nobserved in my 22 years of service who simply used the hammer head for \nthe grip and conveyed his authority by gently tapping the end of the \nhandle.\n  ``May we have order, please.'' Immediately following was always quiet \nacceptance.\n  This symbolized to me how this elegant man commanded the great \nrespect of all in the Senate. As with the gavel, his voice was always \nfirm, and always with the soft tone of confidence.\n  We wish him well, together with his wife and family, as they accept \nlife's next challenge.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11847-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RETIREMENT OF SENATOR RICHARD BRYAN\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the selfless \nand noteworthy service of our esteemed colleague from Nevada, Senator \nRichard Bryan. At the close of the 106th Congress, Senator Bryan will \nretire from public service, and will end the final chapter in a most \nglorious and dedicated career as a servant of the people.\n  Even at an early age, Richard Bryan displayed the leadership, sense \nof caring, and charisma that make for a successful public servant. \nThroughout his education he served as the president of many of his \nclasses, including as the student body president his senior year at the \nUniversity of Nevada-Reno.\n  After graduating, Senator Bryan was commissioned a Second Lieutenant \nin the United States Army and served his country on active duty from \n1959 to 1960. He then entered the University of California, Hastings \nCollege of Law, and graduated with honors in 1963.\n  Senator Bryan returned home to Nevada and began a career in public \nservice that would, to the benefit of the citizens of Nevada, span more \nthan three decades. From 1964 to 1978, he served as a Deputy District \nAttorney, a Public Defender, a State Assemblyman, and a State Senator. \nIn 1978, Senator Bryan won his first state wide election when the \npeople elected him Attorney General. Four years later Richard Bryan \nbecame Nevada's 26th Governor. After two terms as Governor, in 1988, he \nwon election to the United States Senate. Richard Bryan is the only \nNevadan to have served as the state's Attorney General, Governor, and \nUnited States Senator.\n  Clearly, Senator Richard Bryan has always kept in mind the best \ninterests of the people of Nevada and they have consistently asked him \nto represent these concerns. Additionally, over the last twelve years, \nSenator Bryan has become one of the Nation's leading consumer \nadvocates. His deep concern for the consumer was evident by his \nsuccessful campaign to require the installation of passenger side air \nbags in all cars sold in the United States. Many lives have been saved \nbecause of Senator Bryan's promotion of this legislation.\n  It has been a pleasure getting to know Senator Richard Bryan these \npast twelve years, and I wish he, and his fine wife Bonnie, the best of \nluck in the future. I know they will enjoy all the benefits of \nretirement, especially the opportunity to spend more time with their \nfamily.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the leadership \nand accomplishments of an esteemed colleague who will be retiring at \nthe end of this term. Senator Richard Bryan has served in the Congress \nas a representative of Nevada for more than a decade. During his \ntenure, he has been a tireless advocate of a wide range of legislative \nreform activities.\n  Throughout his career, Senator Bryan has fought for improving natural \nresources, enhancing the quality of the nation's classrooms, and \nprotecting privacy on the Internet. Senator Bryan has also been \nnationally recognized for his efforts on behalf of consumers.\n  As the former Chairman of the Senate Consumer Affair Subcommittee, \nSenator Bryan was responsible for enacting laws to give consumers new \npowers to correct errors found on their credit reports and led the \nfight against telemarketing fraud. Perhaps most notably, Dick Bryan was \na champion of 1993 legislation that required air bags be installed in \nevery new car sold in the U.S. These are important accomplishments that \nbenefit consumers across the nation.\n  As colleagues on the Finance Committee, we have fought to address the \nchallenges facing Social Security and Medicare. Just this year, we \nworked closely to develop a proposal to provide prescription drug \ncoverage for all Medicare beneficiaries. I am proud to say that this \nproposal would provide much needed drug coverage to millions of seniors \ncitizens and disabled individuals.\n  I have also had the opportunity to work with Senator Bryan to address \na very important priority for the nation--balancing the federal budget. \nWe enjoy federal budget surpluses today because of the efforts of \nmembers like Senator Bryan who supported measures to cut government \nwaste and get our fiscal house in order.\n  For these and many other reasons, I have been honored to serve with \nDick Bryan. I would like to join my colleagues in wishing the Senator \nand his family the best in the future and in paying tribute to Dick \nBryan's lifelong commitment to public service. I wish him well.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11848-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11848-S11849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S11848]]\n                        SENATOR CHARLES S. ROBB\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to my \ncolleague from Virginia, Senator Chuck Robb, who will leave the Senate \nin January after 12 years of exemplary service to his state as a member \nof this body.\n  As others have noted, Chuck Robb has had a long and distinguished \ncareer in public service. He served his country for 34 years in the \nMarine Corps and reserves, and he is a highly decorated combat veteran. \nHe was a widely popular governor of Virginia, who increased the state's \neducation budget by $1 billion, and appointed many women and minorities \nto top government jobs. And he has now served two terms as a United \nStates Senator, where he has been praised for his leadership on \nnational security, education, and the budget.\n  But I would like to note several aspects of Chuck Robb's Senate \ntenure that may not be quite as familiar, but for which I will always \nremember him and be grateful to him. The fact is that he was a hero on \nmany issues: civil rights, human rights, and a woman's right to choose.\n  Time and time and time again, even in the most difficult and \npolitically charged debates, Senator Robb was steadfast in his support \nfor the precious right of women to control their own bodies without \ninterference from government.\n  He led the fight in the Senate to bring justice to African-American \nfarmers throughout the nation who had been discriminated against by the \nDepartment of Agriculture. His legislation helped lead to the largest \ncivil rights settlement in our history.\n  And then, in February 1993, he delivered a powerful and moving speech \non the floor of the Senate, the message of which was that all of God's \nchildren, regardless of sexual orientation, should be treated equally \nin the military.\n  I will always remember Senator Robb's eloquent words:\n\n       The issue should be not what kind of person you are but \n     what kind of soldier, sailor, airman, or marine you are. . . \n     . I would suggest to you, Mr. President, morale is in the \n     heart of each service person. The threat to morale comes not \n     from the orientation of a few but from the closed minds of \n     many.\n\n  I was deeply touched by these words of tolerance and understanding, \nparticularly because they came from one who had served so gallantly in \nthe Marine Corps.\n  So I salute you and I thank you, Chuck, and send you my very best \nwishes as you move on to new challenges.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the \nstatement be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n    Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (Senate--February 4, 1993)\n\n       Mr. Mitchell. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the \n     Senator from Virginia.\n       The Presiding Officer. The Senator from Virginia.\n       Mr. Robb. Mr. President, I thank the chair.\n       What is it that makes an excellent soldier? I submit to you \n     that it five basic virtues: Devotion to duty; loyalty to \n     country, commanders, and comrades; skill in military arts; \n     personal integrity; and courage. If you have these qualities, \n     you can be an excellent soldier, whether your name of \n     Manursky or Jefferson, Goldberg or Nguyen, Warner, Dole, \n     Kerrey, or McCain.\n       A number of Americans who have these qualities, however, \n     are being excluded from serving their country in the military \n     for reasons beyond fitness or performance.\n       People have told me for some time that they cannot \n     understand how someone who thinks of himself as a gung-ho \n     marine can march to the music of a drummer that I do not \n     hear.\n       Mr. President, the drummer I hear plays the Marine Corps \n     Hymn. It still gives me a chill, and I still stand when it is \n     played. I certainly do not want to detract in any way from \n     the military's effectiveness or performance.\n       Because of that, I cannot stand by and let a policy that I \n     consider less than perfect keep our services from attracting \n     the best and most competent people. The issue should be not \n     what kind of person you are but what kind of soldier, sailor, \n     airman, or marine you are.\n       As a former marine who considers his 34-plus years in \n     uniform and in the reserve to be the proudest affiliation of \n     my life, I well understand those who argue the importance of \n     maintaining morale and good discipline in the ranks.\n       But I would suggest to you, Mr. President, morale is in the \n     heart of each service person. The threat to morale comes not \n     from the orientation of a few but from the closed minds of \n     many. President Truman recognized that when he ordered the \n     services to be integrated by race despite the racial \n     animosity of many then in service.\n       Do some of today's soldiers fear what they do not \n     understand? Certainly, they do. Obviously. But should \n     America's policy be guided by fear, or should be work to \n     overcome prejudice by showing that merit and behavior, not \n     orientations, are what counts in the military?\n       I have spent a great deal of time discussing this with a \n     number of friends, including the Chairman of the Joint \n     Chiefs, Gen. Colin Powell. Some think that I am simply on the \n     wrong side of this issue, and I understand this and other \n     objections to the proposal.\n       General Powell recently drew a difference between \n     discrimination based on sexuality, which he called a \n     behavior, and that based on race, which he called a benign \n     characteristic. But I submit to you that race is obvious, \n     until and unless it is expressed in conduct. And if that \n     sexuality is expressed, it is no longer benign. Then it will \n     run into the existing regulations of the Uniform Code of \n     Military Justice.\n       The code offers sufficient protections against much of the \n     conduct that supporters of this amendment fear. And it can \n     certainly be expanded to prevent breaches of decorum or good \n     order.\n       The specter of drill sergeants dancing together is \n     unsettling, to say the least, Mr. President. But some of the \n     amendment's supporters fail to note it is just the kind of \n     behavior already prohibited by the Uniform Code, as is almost \n     all of the conduct presented as a concern by those who are in \n     favor of this particular amendment.\n       The President is the Commander in Chief of the Armed \n     Services, and he sets the goals. Just as many military men \n     were given the goal of ejecting Iraqi forces from Kuwait, and \n     led the plan and implemented that goal, I believe that the \n     military should also be cast with making the President's goal \n     a reality.\n       As a former military commander, I can tell you that if a \n     goal of truly equal access to military service is to be \n     reached, I believe that the military itself will have to come \n     to terms with it.\n       That will best be done if given the proper role of \n     implementing the President's directive. The hearings \n     announced actually last year by the distinguished chairman of \n     the Armed Services Committee will add information and \n     understanding to that process and will let us fulfill the \n     Congress' proper role of ensuring that readiness is \n     maintained while achieving the President's goal. But I ask we \n     not let fear govern our actions. While we may not perfectly \n     understand what motivates individual sexuality, we cannot \n     allow that lack of understanding to block deserving patriotic \n     Americans from service.\n       Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues will oppose the \n     amendment offered by my distinguished and very respected \n     colleague, the Republican leader, in this particular \n     instance.\n       I yield the floor.\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nChuck Robb, a friend and colleague whom I deeply admire. Throughout our \nservice together in the U.S. Senate, I have observed Senator Robb's \nunfailing commitment to principle. Chuck Robb served his country \ncourageously in Vietnam, and he served the Commonwealth of Virginia \njust as courageously in the U.S. Senate. Time and again, he voted his \nconscience, despite pressures to the contrary. Senator Robb let \nprinciple, not politics, be his guide during his service in the body. \nHis conduct should give every American faith that legislators can \nconduct themselves in a way that does honor to our democracy.\n  Senator Robb opposed the flag desecration constitutional amendment, \nopposed the Defense of Marriage Act, and supported spending cuts while \nopposing the politically popular tax cuts. He did what he thought was \nin the best interest of Virginians and the nation, and I thank him for \nthat. The Senate is a better place for Senator Robb's service, and I \njoin my colleagues in wishing him and his family all the best as he \nmoves on to new endeavors.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the leadership \nand accomplishments of a respected colleague who will be departing at \nthe end of this term. Senator Chuck Robb has served in the Senate as a \nrepresentative of Virginia for more than a decade. During his tenure, \nhe has been a strong advocate for a wide range of important legislative \nreform activities.\n  During his time in the Senate, Senator Robb has fought to strengthen \nnational security, maintain fiscal responsibility, and protect the \nenvironment. He has also been widely recognized for his longstanding \ncommitment to improving education.\n  As a former Governor of Virginia, Senator Robb was instrumental in \nincreasing resources for schools. Building on these efforts, he \nspearheaded efforts to help states and localities build and\n\n[[Page S11849]]\n\nrenovate schools, promoted legislation to put 100,000 new teachers in \nthe classroom, fought for school safety initiatives, and championed \nmeasures to wire schools to the Internet. These are important efforts \nthat have benefited children and teachers across the nation.\n  As colleagues on the Finance Committee, we have fought to address the \nchallenges facing Social Security and Medicare. Just this year, we \nworked closely to develop a proposal to provide prescription drug \ncoverage for all Medicare beneficiaries. I am proud to say that this \nproposal would provide much needed drug coverage to millions of seniors \ncitizens and disabled individuals.\n  I would also like to note that I am proud to have worked with a \ncolleague with such a distinguished military background. Senator Robb \nserved our nation for more than 34 years, during which time he received \nnational honors for his leadership and commitment to serving our \nnation.\n  For these and many other reasons, I have been honored to serve with \nChuck Robb. I would like to join my colleagues in wishing him and his \nfamily all the best in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11849-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RETIREMENT OF SENATOR JOHN ASHCROFT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as we conclude the 107th Congress, we will \nbe saying goodbye to our colleague and friend, Senator John Ashcroft of \nMissouri.\n  A former two-term Governor, John Ashcroft has earned a reputation in \nthe Senate for his principled pursuit of conservative issues. He is \nalso recognized as a strong proponent of the wide use of the internet \nby federal agencies as a way to make the government more responsive and \naccountable. As a leader in the term-limits movement, he carried out \nthe innovative online petition drive.\n  Senator Ashcroft served on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, as \nwell as the Commerce and Judiciary Committees. He established himself \nas a leader among Republicans on a range of issues from term limits to \ntax reform and welfare reform. While in many instances I have found \nmyself on the opposite side of issues from John, I have always \nrespected his intellect, his integrity, his principled positions and \nhis ability to disagree without being disagreeable.\n  Since 1995, John Ashcroft and I have co-chaired the Senate Auto \nCaucus. In this capacity, we have worked together to provide Senators \nwith up to date information on issues affecting the automotive industry \nand its employees. Through the Auto Caucus we organized informational \nbriefings to give Senators and their staff and opportunity to better \nunderstand the auto industry's remarkable progress as well as the \nchallenges it faces. The Caucus provides a forum for Senators to \nexchange ideas on issues affecting the industry such as transportation, \nenvironment, trade, technology and health care.\n  Working together with Senator Ashcroft's, we were able to increase \nmembership in the Auto Caucus from six Senators to twenty-eight. The \nAuto Caucus played a leadership role in pressing the Administration to \nnegotiate market opening trade agreements with Japan and Korea in the \nautomotive sector and continues to weigh in on and monitor those \nagreements. In addition, the Caucus hosts meetings between Senators and \nAutomotive CEOs, provides timely briefings on US-Japan and US-Korea \nautomotive trade negotiations, and encourages the Administration to \nfight to open markets to U.S. vehicles and auto parts.\n  Last year, Senator Ashcroft and I worked together to urge the \nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration to use an unbelted 25 \nmph barrier test instead of a 30 mph test to design air bags that will \nhelp better protect children, teenagers and small adults. Our work on \nthis very complicated and controversial issue brought the \nAdministration and Auto industry together to reach a result that will \nincrease automobile safety.\n  We also worked together to continue the moratorium on unfair and \nineffective increases in Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards and \nworked toward a compromise in the Senate to ensure that a National \nAcademy of Sciences study of the effectiveness and impacts of CAFE \nstandards will include the effect of those standards on motor vehicle \nsafety as well as discriminatory impacts of those standards on the U.S. \nauto industry.\n  Also, we have worked together in the past to ensure that \nenvironmental regulations recognize and reinforce the voluntary \nenvironmental improvements and technological achievements of the \nautomobile industry.\n  Not only will John's contribution be missed in debate on the Senate \nfloor, but his voice will be sorely missed, I suspect, by the ``Singing \nSenators'', the wonderful quartet in which he has joined with Senators \nLott, Craig and Jeffords. My wife and family, join me in wishing the \nbest in the years ahead for John, his loving wife (and co-author), \nJanet, and their family.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Senator \nJohn Ashcroft as he prepares to leave the Senate.\n  For the past six years, Senator Ashcroft has done important work as a \nmember of the Commerce, Judiciary, and Foreign Relations Committees in \nthe United States Senate. For example, Senator Ashcroft has focused on \nreforming our nation's use of agricultural sanctions during foreign \ntrade disputes. We share a common vision that we must not use food as a \nweapon in our disputes with other nations, and Senator Ashcroft has \nmade a high priority of changing this policy. His work is important \nboth domestically and internationally, and he can be proud of his \ncontributions.\n  I also appreciate Senator Ashcroft's recent work with Senator Dorgan, \nSenator Bond, and me on the Dakota Water Resources Act. This \nlegislation is critical for the economic future of North Dakota, and I \ngreatly appreciate the constructive role Senator Ashcroft played in \nrepresenting the interests of his state. During discussions on this \nbill he was a tenacious advocate for his state's interests. His \ndiligence in representing his state's interests, coupled with his \nwillingness to gain an understanding of the water needs of my state, \nultimately helped us reach a compromise acceptable to both states. The \npeople of Missouri can be proud of his work fighting for their \ninterests.\n  More generally, Senator Ashcroft has been a man of his word who \nserved his state and his country with distinction. I join my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle in wishing him well in his future endeavors.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a colleague and \nfriend who will be greatly missed by the United States Senate--Senator \nJohn Ashcroft.\n  Senator Ashcroft, served Missouri and the nation with distinction.\n  In the Senate, he was a leader in passage of landmark welfare reform \nlegislation, authoring the Charitable Choice provision. He fought for \nlower taxes, a strong national defense, greater local control of \neducation, and enhanced law enforcement.\n  A popular, former two term governor of his home state, John brought a \nreal ``can-do'' sense of purpose to his work in the Senate. I have \nalways felt that those who come to the Senate with experience as \ngovernor, have especially valuable experience that the entire nation \nbenefits from.\n  There is a term used throughout the 211 year history of the Senate \ncalled ``Senatorial courtesy.'' John won the admiration of his \ncolleagues in many ways, especially his caring tradition of writing \nwonderful personal notes--not by computer--but always taking time to \nwrite them by hand.\n  We wish you, your wife and family well as you take on your new \nchallenges.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11849-2", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11849-S11850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RETIREMENT OF SENATOR ROD GRAMS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as this session of Congress comes to an \nend, I want to speak about my friend and colleague from the State of \nMinnesota, Senator Rod Grams.\n  A former television news personality, Rod Grams, in his term in the \nHouse of Representatives and in the Senate, quickly established himself \nas a proponent of assistance to farmers and as an advocate for the \nestablishment of a national nuclear waste repository.\n  As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he has been an\n\n[[Page S11850]]\n\nopponent of international agricultural sanctions and a strong supporter \nof vigorous foreign trade. He supported IMF funding, trade with China \nand review of the U.S.-Cuba relationship.\n  He joined the bipartisan effort to enact strong brownfields cleanup \nlegislation. Rod Grams earned a reputation as a strong supporter of tax \nrelief, favoring elimination of the marriage penalty and other tax cut \nproposals.\n  While Rod Grams and I have disagreed on a number of issues, I respect \nthe commitment which he has brought to policy debate. Where we \ndisagreed, I found Rod Grams to be a straight-talking and agreeable \nadversary. I wish him and his family well in the future.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, for the past six years, I have had the \nprivilege of serving in the Senate with Rod Grams, a colleague who has \ndistinguished himself on a number of important issues including budget, \ntax policy, and agriculture. He has served Minnesota with distinction \nas a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the Senate \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, the Senate Budget \ncommittee, and the Joint Economic Committee.\n  On a national level, Senator Grams is perhaps best known for his \n``Families First'' plan, first discussed as part of the 1994 Republican \nbudget alternative. This plan included a $500 per-child tax credit, a \nrecommendation that eventually became part of the 1997 Balanced Budget \nAct.\n  On a more parochial level, I have worked closely with Senator Grams \non issues affecting our farm communities, and in 1997 to help our \nstates recover from the disastrous floods along the Red River Valley. \nCommunities along the Red River were devastated by this 500 year flood \nwhich disrupted business and forced thousands of families from their \nhomes.\n  Senator Grams worked closely with delegations from North Dakota and \nSouth Dakota to make certain that the urgent needs of so many families \nand communities were met. He played an important role in ensuring \nbipartisan support and passage of the disaster relief legislation that \nwas so critical for our states at that time. I know that many North \nDakota families and businesses are very grateful for his support.\n  I extend my best wishes to Senator Grams, and his family, and my \nappreciation for his support on critical agricultural, budget, and \ndisaster issues that we have worked together on in committee and on the \nSenator floor together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11850-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO SENATOR SPENCER ABRAHAM\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute and recognize \nthe accomplishments of a colleague, Senator Spencer Abraham of \nMichigan. Since joining the Senate in 1995, he has served with honesty, \ndedication, and integrity.\n  As members of the Budget Committee, I had the opportunity to work \nwith Senator Abraham on a number of important issues. A fiscal \nconservative, Senator Abraham work to balance the federal budget and \ncut government waste. He has also been a champion of keeping our Social \nSecurity dollars locked away. This is an interest in which Senator \nAbraham and I share a keen interest.\n  Most recently, Senator Abraham was the lead sponsor of the American \nCompetitiveness in the 21st Century Act, legislation that will help \nensure our nation's continued growth and leadership in information \ntechnology (IT). The bill authorized visas for 195,000 high-tech \nprofessionals to work in the U.S. to meet the growing demand for \nskilled IT workers throughout our economy. During consideration of the \nbill, I was pleased to work with Senator Abraham and his staff to \ninclude in the legislation long-term initiatives to ensure that \nAmericans of all ages are trained to fill critical IT positions in our \nInformation Age economy.\n  During his time in the Senate, Senator Abraham also worked to curb \nunfunded mandates, stiffen sentences for cocaine dealers, and advocated \nstronger privacy protections for consumers on the Internet. His work \nhas been thoughtful and our nation is a better place because of his \nefforts.\n  Mr. President, it has been a pleasure to serve in the Senate with \nSpence. I have the utmost respect for my friend and colleague from \nMichigan, and appreciate all of his contributions to the United States \nSenate and our nation. I would like to join with my colleagues in \nwishing the Senator and his family the best in the future.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \naccomplishments of my colleague and friend, Senator Spencer Abraham \nfrom Michigan.\n  Senator Abraham began his service in government in Washington, DC in \n1990, when he had the honor of serving in President Bush's \nAdministration as Deputy Chief to Vice President Dan Quayle. In 1993, \nSpencer Abraham returned to Michigan to run for the United States \nSenate seat vacated by Senator Don Riegle who was retiring. Senator \nAbraham won that Senate seat in 1994 and became the first Michigan \nRepublican elected to the United States Senate in 22 years.\n  I have had the pleasure of working with Senator Abraham on a number \nof issues including high technology and immigration over the last six \nyears. Not only is Senator Abraham a colleague of mine, Spence and his \nfamily are friends as well.\n  Spence Abraham is a dedicated public servant, and he has represented \nthe state of Michigan well in the United States Senate. During the past \nsix years, Senator Abraham took the lead in the Senate on high tech \nissues and immigration. He has been a strong supporter of tax cuts. \nSenator Abraham has also played a prominent role in trying to protect \nour Social Security Trust Fund--having fought hard for a Social \nSecurity Lock Box.\n  The Senate is going to miss Spencer Abraham's leadership. And, those \nof us who know him well are going to miss his friendship in the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11850-2", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11850-S11852]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF BIOMEDICAL IMAGING AND ENGINEERING ESTABLISHMENT \n                                  ACT\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to H.R. 1795, which is at the desk, having been received from \nthe House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1795) to amend the Public Health Service Act \n     to establish the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and \n     Bioengineering.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, many of us have worked throughout this \nCongress to bring greater fairness to our immigration laws. The Legal \nImmigration Family Equity Act and its amendments are a constructive \ncompromise worked out between members of both parties to address a \nnumber of the injustices in current law that have harshly affected many \nimmigrant families. Included in the final legislative package are three \nprovisions that will provide long overdue relief to valued members of \nour communities and their families.\n  First, the legislation includes the partial restoration of section \n245(i) for individuals who are physically present in the U.S. by the \ndate the legislation is enacted into law. Spouses, children, parents \nand siblings of permanent residents or U.S. citizens will now be able \nto adjust their status in the U.S. and avoid needless separation from \ntheir loved ones. Similarly, persons who benefit from employer-based \npetitions will also be helped by the restoration of section 245(i).\n  Second, this legislation will benefit many of the ``late amnesty'' \nclass members who have been in legal limbo for close to 15 years. Their \nspouses and children will be able to remain in the United States until \nthey become eligible for permanent residence.\n  Finally, this legislation provides desperately needed technical \ncorrections that will benefit persons eligible for relief under the \nNicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act and the Haitian \nRefugee Immigrant Fairness Act.\n  Because these provisions were developed outside the usual committee \nprocess, they are not accompanied by committee reports on the \nbackground and purpose of the provisions. Therefore, as the chairman \nand the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Immigration, Senator \nAbraham and I are submitting a detailed memorandum explaining the \nprovisions, which I ask unanimous consent be printed in the Record at \nthe closing of my remarks.\n\n[[Page S11851]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  [See Exhibit 2.]\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Our action today is a significant step in the right \ndirection, but this legislation is far from perfect. Critical pieces \nare missing.\n  We must continue to work for full parity for Central Americans, \nHaitians, and Liberians. It is unjust to treat refugees fleeing \nrepression by left-wing dictators better than those fleeing repression \nby right-wing dictators. Congress must create a fair, uniform set of \nprocedures for all of these refugees.\n  We also must continue to work for relief for permanent residents \nunfairly affected by the 1996 immigration law. The 1996 law contains \nsome of the harshest provisions that Congress has enacted in many \nyears. Their scope is sweeping. They hurt thousands of immigrants. They \nhave taken immigrants away from their U.S. citizen families, without \ngiving them even an opportunity to have their day in court. Next year, \nCongress must pass new legislation to correct the harsh provisions of \nthese unfair laws.\n  It is also unfortunate that the legislation does not include far-\nreaching agreement on agricultural farmworkers. Senator Graham, \nCongressman Berman, and many others worked skillfully to achieve this \nagreement. They proposed an excellent compromise that would have \nbenefitted both the agricultural workers and the farm owners.\n  These further reforms deserve high priority by the next Congress, and \nI look forward to working with my colleagues and with the \nadministration of President-elect Bush to enact them into law.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\nJoint Memorandum Concerning the Legal Immigration Family Equity Act of \n               2000 and the LIFE Act Amendments of 2000.\n\n       The pending legislation contains certain immigration \n     provisions worked out between members of both parties to \n     further address certain issues addressed in the first \n     instance in the Legal Immigration Family Equity Act of 2000, \n     or LIFE Act, which is contained in the Commerce Justice State \n     Appropriations bill being transmitted to the President. \n     Because both the original LIFE ACT and this legislation were \n     developed outside the ordinary Committee process, they were \n     not accompanied by the usual reports elaborating on the \n     background and purpose of their provisions. This memorandum \n     is accordingly submitted on behalf of the Chairman and \n     Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Immigration of the \n     Senate Committee on the Judiciary to provide such elaboration \n     in somewhat abbreviated form.\n       The original LIFE Act sought to address two problems. \n     First, it sought to provide a new mechanism to address the \n     problem created by the long backlog of immigrant visa \n     applications for spouses and minor children of lawful \n     permanent residents, who are currently having to wait many \n     years for a visa to become available to them. Right now, many \n     of these individuals are even precluded from visiting their \n     spouse or parent in the United States on account of an \n     administrative interpretation that the filing of their \n     petition cases doubt on the bona fides of their applications \n     for visitors visas, indicating that instead they are \n     intending immigrants.\n       The LIFE Act creates a new temporary ``V'' visa under which \n     these spouses (and their children) can come to the United \n     States and wait for their visa here, if their immigrant visa \n     petitions have been pending for more than three years. It \n     also expands the criteria for ``K'' visas to include spouses \n     and minor children of U.S. citizens. The purpose of the ``V'' \n     and ``K'' visas is to provide a speedy mechanism by which \n     family members may be reunited. We expect the Department of \n     State and the INS to work together to create a process in \n     keeping with the temporary nature of the visa that does not \n     require potential beneficiaries to wait for months before \n     their visas are approved. Like the existing Finance visa, the \n     new ``K'' visa is not intended to be a prerequisite for the \n     admission of citizen spouses, but a speedy mechanism for the \n     spouses and minor children of U.S. citizens to obtain their \n     immigrant visas in the U.S., rather than wait for long \n     periods of time outside the U.S.\n       Second, the LIFE Act sought to correct past administrative \n     mistakes that resulted in the wrongful denial of adjustment \n     of status to hundreds of thousands of persons who should have \n     qualified for permanent residence under the Immigration \n     Reform and Control Act of 1986. It directs the Immigration \n     and Naturalization Service (INS) to adjudicate the \n     applications of individuals in two class action lawsuits on \n     the merits, rather than continuing to litigate whether they \n     were timely filed.\n       The LIFE Act Amendments make three significant additions to \n     the provisions in the LIFE Act. First, they delete the LIFE \n     Act's special mechanism for ``V'' and ``K'' visa holders to \n     adjust to lawful permanent residence, and instead add a new \n     provision modifying section 245(i), a mechanism by which \n     anyone eligible for an immigrant visa and for whom a visa is \n     currently available can adjust his or her status to that of \n     lawful permanent residence in the U.S., rather than have to \n     return abroad for consular processing. That mechanism was \n     reauthorized in 1996, but only for individuals who were \n     beneficiaries of immigrant visa petitions or labor \n     certification applications filed by January 14, 1998. The \n     LIFE amendments move the date by which such petitions or \n     applications must be filed forward in time to April 30, 2001.\n       They also add a new requirement that for all beneficiaries \n     whose application was filed after January 14, 1998, the \n     principal beneficiary must have been physically present in \n     the U.S. on the date of enactment of the LIFE Act Amendments \n     of 2000. The function of this last requirement is to make \n     sure that the renewed availability of section 245(i) does not \n     operate to encourage anyone to violate our immigration laws. \n     Accordingly, it should be interpreted with common sense.\n       It may be difficult for an individual physically present on \n     the day of enactment to establish his or her presence on that \n     precise date to qualify for 245(i). The Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service (INS) should therefore be flexible in \n     the types of evidence it will accept to establish physical \n     presence on the day of enactment. For example, the kind of \n     evidence of physical presence INS ordinarily accepts \n     demonstrating that the applicant has been physically present \n     during a reasonable period preceding that date, accompanied \n     by an affidavit or declaration that the person was present on \n     the date itself, should ordinarily suffice. We also note that \n     this new requirement is applicable only to principal \n     applicants for 245(i), and not to derivatives, who continue \n     to be allowed to ``follow to join'' if they otherwise \n     qualify.\n       In order to ensure that persons who may benefit from this \n     provision are aware of this legislation, we strongly \n     encourage the INS to conduct a broad outreach program within \n     the immigrant communities. Additionally, to ensure that all \n     potentially eligible persons have an opportunity to qualify \n     for 245(i), if necessary the INS should accept petitions and \n     applications before the April 30, 2001 sunset date that do \n     not contain all necessary supporting documents, and allow \n     additional documents to be filed after the deadline.\n       Second, the legislation adds the members of a third class \n     action law suit, Zambrano v. INS, to those covered by the \n     LIFE Act's provisions concerning adjustment of status under \n     the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA). We \n     note that persons eligible for adjustment pursuant to the \n     combined LIFE provisions include everyone who has ``filed \n     with the Attorney General a written claim of class \n     membership'', that is all registered class members, not \n     only those who have been issued employment authorization \n     pursuant to a screening that did not reliably distinguish \n     between potentially meritorious and non-meritorious \n     applications.\n       We understand that several other class action lawsuits are \n     still pending in the federal courts challenging other INS \n     interpretations of the 1986 adjustment provisions. The \n     precise posture of one of these cases, Perales v. Thornburgh, \n     came to our attention after the legislation had been \n     finalized. We understand that a class of about 200 identified \n     plaintiffs in Perales challenged the same regulation whose \n     illegality the INS has conceded in Zambrano. We would \n     encourage the Attorney General to provide a just resolution \n     for the Perales class members in light of the legislation \n     enacted today.\n       Other cases that have come to our attention, such as \n     Proyecto San Pablo v. INS, and Immigrant Assistance Project \n     v. INS, are in a different posture from those addressed by \n     the LIFE Act and these amendments, in that they do not \n     involve regulations that INS has conceded were illegal. At \n     the same time, however, it is now almost 2001, that is, \n     almost 15 years after the enactment of IRCA, and these cases \n     remain unresolved. We encourage the plaintiffs and the \n     Attorney General to explore the possibility of settling these \n     cases and bringing to an end the years of bitter and costly \n     litigation. Nothing in this legislation is intended to \n     preclude this option, or to preclude the Attorney General \n     from resolving any other IRCA adjustment applications on the \n     merits.\n       In that connection, we also note that when the 1986 \n     legalization program was enacted, the Attorney General, \n     pursuant to section 245A of the INA, was authorized to work \n     in conjunction with voluntary organizations and other \n     qualified State, local and community organizations to broadly \n     disseminate information about the legalization program. The \n     INS helped provide funding to these organizations to assist \n     with the outreach effort, as well as with the preparation and \n     submission of the applications for adjustment of status. A \n     similar outreach campaign should be conducted to disseminate \n     information about the opportunity to apply for adjustment of \n     status under this Act. As noted above, almost 15 years have \n     elapsed since the original legalization program was enacted, \n     therefore the need to publicize the resolution of these \n     issues reached by the LIFE Act and amendments thereto is \n     critical to ensure that eligible persons are notified and \n     have an opportunity to obtain the benefits of this Act. \n     Moreover, nothing in the Act should be construed to preclude \n     the Attorney General from providing funding to organizations \n     qualified and experienced in the preparation and submission \n     of adjustment applications.\n\n[[Page S11852]]\n\n       Third, the amendments clarify that the spouses and \n     unmarried children of the beneficiaries of Section 1104 of \n     the LIFE Act are eligible for the Family Unity provisions of \n     the Immigration Act of 1990. By enacting this provision, our \n     objective is to ensure that these family members are treated \n     in the same manner as the family members of those who \n     adjusted their status under IRCA.\n       In addition, the amendments address two, more technical \n     issues. Section 1104 LIFE Act applicants, as well as \n     beneficiaries under the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central \n     American Relief Act (NACARA) and the Haitian Refugee \n     Immigrant Fairness Act (HRIFA) are made eligible for certain \n     waivers of grounds of inadmissibility. These waivers are \n     ordinarily available only to persons who are outside the U.S. \n     The amendments to the LIFE Act allow the covered individuals \n     to apply for these waivers in the U.S.\n       Finally, the LIFE amendments clarify that section 241(a)(5) \n     of the INA which bars anyone who has been ordered removed and \n     who subsequently reenters the U.S. from obtaining any relief \n     under the INA. Because adjustment under section 245A, NACARA, \n     and HRIFA is not ``relief under'' the Act, LIFE amendments \n     specify that this bar does not apply to LIFE section 1104 \n     beneficiaries, or NACARA or HRIFA applicants.\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Res. 390\n\n       Resolved, That the thanks of the Senate are hereby tendered \n     to the distinguished Democratic Leader, the Senator from \n     South Dakota, the Honorable Thomas A. Daschle, for his \n     exemplary leadership and the cooperative and dedicated manner \n     in which he has performed his leadership responsibilities in \n     the conduct of Senate business during the second session of \n     the 106th Congress.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I could go on for quite some time about my \ncolleague from South Dakota. He does a magnificent job as the \nDemocratic leader. He is thoughtful. He is accessible. He is tenacious. \nHe is committed. He is courteous. And while, as leaders\n\n[[Page S11853]]\n\nof our respective parties in the Senate, we sometimes disagree and \nsometimes even clash publicly--it has been rare--we have a very good \nworking relationship. When the day is done and we have conversations, \nthey are quite often personal and very kind. I appreciate his \ncourtesies. I look forward to working with him in the next Congress.\n  It is going to surely test us in every way, every day, but I hope and \npray we will be up to the task. I will certainly try to fulfill that \nnew, challenging role. And I know I can count on my friend and partner \nto do his part on the other side of the aisle.\n  So I am delighted to be able to offer this resolution of commendation \nto Senator Daschle.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11853-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11853]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       COMMENDING THE EXEMPLARY LEADERSHIP OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have a resolution at the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 391) to commend the exemplary \n     leadership of the Majority Leader.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this resolution is offered in the most \nheartfelt and sincere way. These last 2 years have been very difficult. \nThere have been times when it has tested all of us. But no one has been \nmore tested than the majority leader. No one has been called upon to \nlead in more arduous circumstances, on more occasions, than the \nmajority leader. And as he has just noted, there have been times when \nwe have had our differences. But I have always admired him for his \nremarkable ability to put aside those differences, to come to my \noffice, to invite me to his, to talk in the most affable and personal \nway when the day is done. I admire that and many other of his \nremarkable talents. We are fortunate to have his leadership. We are \nfortunate to have his service to this country. And I am fortunate to \nhave his friendship.\n  So I congratulate him on his successful tenure as majority leader. \nAnd as he noted, our times in the future will become even more arduous, \neven more tested. I look forward to taking on those challenges with the \nsame degree of enthusiasm, the same degree of willingness, to work in a \npartnership that I hope we can continually demonstrate. So I thank him. \nI wish him well and look forward to our service together in the next 2 \nyears.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the American public, the people from South \nDakota, the people from Mississippi, do not know how hard these two men \nwork for their States and their country. They probably have some idea \nbecause they are both so popular in their respective States, but from \nsomeone who sits and watches these two men every day we are in \nsession--and many of the days we are not in session--I am in awe as to \nthe work they do and the difficult situations they get us out of.\n  If someone had said this morning at 10 o'clock that we would be in \nthe position we are in today--being able to go home for Christmas--I \nwould have laughed at them. I thought it was impossible for us to do \nthat. But these two men, working together, were able to put together a \npackage of about $500 billion involving the most important things this \ncountry deals with on a daily basis. They did this. They did it alone. \nThere were others on the outside helping a little bit, but this is just \nan example.\n  But I have been able, from my perspective here for 2 years, to watch \nthem, and I am tremendously impressed. I want this Record spread with \nthe fact that these resolutions do not in any way connote the really \ngood work they do. On paper it says they did a good job, but it takes \nsomeone who works with these two gentlemen on a daily basis to see the \nsacrifices they make for their States and for the country.\n  Their families should be so proud of what they do. The people of \ntheir States should be so proud of what they do. And I, speaking on \nbehalf of Americans, after this bitter election, say here are examples \nof everything that is good about the American political system--\nSenators Daschle and Lott.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the resolution?\n  Without objection, the resolution is agreed to.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 391) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 391\n\n       Resolved, That the thanks of the Senate are hereby tendered \n     to the distinguished Majority Leader, the Senator from \n     Mississippi, the Honorable Trent Lott, for his exemplary \n     leadership and the cooperative and dedicated manner in which \n     he has performed his leadership responsibilities in the \n     conduct of Senate business during the second session of the \n     106th Congress.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I appreciate very much the kind remarks of Senator Daschle \nand also our good friend, Senator Reid of Nevada. He has been very \ngenerous, and we appreciate it. He makes our jobs easier. Sometimes \nwhen we are out there having meetings or taking incoming shots from \nvarious places, in a quiet, humble, self-effacing, diligent way, Harry \nReid is out there finding a solution. I sincerely appreciate the work \nhe has given us and the entire institution over the last year. I enjoy \nworking with him very much.\n  I am very proud, too, while we have big States, very important \nStates, the little States of Nevada, Mississippi, and South Dakota are \nhanging in there. We are glad to be able to fill these positions of \nresponsibility.\n  So I thank them both very sincerely.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11853-2", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11853-S11854]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THANKING SENATE STAFF\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I want to just expound a bit on this \nresolution. We are deeply indebted to these staff members, including \nthose at the table in front of us. They are so efficient. They are so \ninformed. They save us many times from ourselves. They are here early. \nThey are here late. And, of course, all of the clerks, the \nParliamentarians, and the representatives who are here do a magnificent \njob. We do not always say we appreciate it enough, but we do.

The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, again, I want to identify myself with the \nremarks of the majority leader. These staff are the best there could \nbe. I thank them, on behalf of the entire Senate, for their hard work, \nfor their professionalism, for the level of commitment they make each \nand every time they come to work. I thank them for what they do. There \nare so many ways we ought to stop throughout the year and express \nourselves in as heartfelt a way as we can, but at least now at the end \nof this Congress, we ought to say--with an exclamation point--thank \nyou.\n  Thank you for what you do.

Mr. President, let me take this occasion to thank the \ndistinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee and, in his \nabsence, Senator Byrd for his cooperation with Senator Stevens. They \nwork together as a team every day. They do an incredible job. They have \none of the toughest jobs in the Congress.\n  I have been working in budget processes now directly for I guess \nabout 20 years. When I was in the House as the whip, I sometimes \nreluctantly became a participant in those budget renegotiations. They \nwere never easy. But I don't think I have ever seen more fire, \nlightning, and thunder than we had on this bill, when you compare it to \nbills of the past that were relatively small in size and various parts.\n  It was very tough. Everything was fought over so aggressively. Things \ndidn't get in, such as Amtrak, and things got in, such as Medicare \nadjustments. But we found a way to make it happen. We found it very \nhard to let go. But the Senator from Alaska hung in there. I know he \nwas working at 2 o'clock this morning, and I know he was back at the \noffice today at 6:30. I talked to him sometime between 6:30 and 8 \no'clock this morning. The amazing thing was he was sweet and charming \nand pleasant.\n  Is this the deed? Is this what we have here?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I dare not ask a World War II pilot veteran to lift \nthis or the rules on ergonomics might be contradicted.\n  But I congratulate you, sir.\n  Mr. LOTT. It probably violates the rules of ergonomics, I would like \nto say, if that is the package.\n  Finally, all of us learned in the last 2 days more than we ever \nwanted to know about the Steller sea lion. What is it, and what are \nthey? Whatever they are, I am sure they are beautiful, and I know they \nappreciate the effort of the Senator from Alaska. I know about 10,000 \nAlaskans appreciate the fact that their jobs will not be wiped out \nalmost instantly.\n\n  The administration was very tough, but they were protecting the \nEndangered Species Act. I don't know quite how Senator Stevens found \ncommon ground. But he did. Thank goodness for all of the persistence. \nHe is affectionately known as ``The Tasmanian Devil.'' But today he did \nthis job without his Tasmanian necktie.\n  While we get very testy with each other sometimes, we still really \nappreciate the work that is done.\n  Senator Stevens, congratulations, and I look forward to someday being \nable to know all that is in the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this will be the last time, because I \nknow others want to speak.\n  I, too, want to congratulate the chairman and ranking member. This \nhas been a really difficult experience. He knows it. No one knows it \nbetter than he because he had to experience it as late as 3:30 last \nnight and as early as 6:30 this morning. We know because of a very \nintense debate we had within our caucus. It would not have happened \nwithout his leadership. It would not have happened without his \npersistence and the work of his staff--and the staff whom both the \nmajority leader and I have been fortunate to have serve with us as we \nhave attempted to put this package together.\n  I congratulate him. I thank him. I also congratulate the people of \nAlaska for the kind of representation they sent to Washington in the \nperson of Ted Stevens.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I know others are going to take the \nfloor.\n  While the two leaders are here, I thank each of them for their \ncomments. Nothing is done in the Senate without the concurrence of the \nleadership. I know full well the help they have given us in the past \ndays and weeks which led to the final solution. I will be speaking \nabout that later.\n  I thank the Senator from Mississippi and also my friend, the Senator \nfrom South Dakota, for their help and for the sincere comments they \nmade today. They are very welcome, as far as I am concerned, and I am \nhumbled by them. I thank them very much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I appreciate the positive remarks that \nhave just been made about our leadership and those who have supported \nthem throughout these difficult 2 years, and look forward at an \nappropriate time to hearing the comments of the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee on this legislation.\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11855-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11855-S11878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n[[Page S11855]]\n\nSenate\n\n\n(Legislative day of Friday, September 22, 2000)\n\n  DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND \n RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING SEPTEMBER \n                      30, 2001--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. \n4577, which the clerk will report.\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     4577) ``making appropriations for the Departments of Labor, \n     Health and Human Services, and Education, and related \n     agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2001, and \n     for other purposes'', having met, have agreed: that the House \n     recede from its disagreement to the amendment of the Senate, \n     and agree to the same with an amendment, and the Senate agree \n     to the same; that the House agree to the title of the bill, \n     with an amendment, and the Senate agree to the same, signed \n     by a majority of the conferees on the part of both Houses.\n\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of today, December 15, 2000.)\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the fiscal year 2001 Labor/HHS \nAppropriations Conference Report is now before the Senate.\n  This conference report serves to wrap up work on all fiscal year 2001 \nappropriations bills, as it includes the Treasury-General Government \nand legislative branch bills. Those two bills were previously passed by \nthe Congress, but were vetoed by the President.\n  The only significant change to the bills previously passed by \nCongress is the deletion of the telephone tax provision in the Treasury \nbill. The conference report includes other appropriations matters, \nwhich emerged subsequent to the completion of the other fiscal year \n2001 bills.\n  Significant items include $150 million for repair of the U.S.S. Cole, \n$100 million for intelligence activities requested by the White House, \n$110 million for the new markets initiative, $100 million for volunteer \nfirefighter grants sought by our colleague from Delaware, Senator Roth, \nand $100 million for the Library of Congress to enhance the National \nDigital Library.\n  I want to also thank all my colleagues for their patience as I worked \nwith the White House for a compromise on the Alaskan Fishery/Sea Lion \nprotection issue. Through the hard work of many here in Congress and at \nthe White House, OMB and the Department of Commerce, we achieved a \ncompromise that meets the priorities of all parties--who share the goal \nof protecting the sea lion population, and the economic well being and \nviability of the commercial fishing industry in my State.\n  There are many specific issues that I could comment on today, but I \nhad the opportunity to brief members of this side of the aisle at a \nconference this afternoon, and the bill is available in the Cloakroom \nfor review.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support this conference report, which \ncompletes the work of this Congress, during this Congress. Next month, \nwhen the 107th Congress convenes, and a new President is inaugurated, \nthey will both start with no carryover from this Congress.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as has been the case on far too many \noccasions in the past number of years, the Senate finds itself today in \nthe position of having to deal with a massive omnibus appropriations \nbill. We have had to pass a record number--21--of Continuing \nResolutions in order to keep the Federal Government operating since the \nfiscal year began on October 1st. These Continuing Resolutions were \nnecessary because we in the Congress and the Administration could not \nresolve our differences on a myriad of issues, most of which have not \ninvolved funding levels at all. Rather, the haggling for the past many \nweeks has been over issues such as ergonomics regulations, immigration, \nand certain regulatory matters; all of which would be more \nappropriately handled by the authorizing committees with jurisdiction \nover them. Instead of following the established practices and the \nregular\nN O T I C E\n\nEffective January 1, 2001, the subscription price of the \nCongressional Record will be $393 per year or $197 for six months. \nIndividual issues may be purchased for $4.00 per copy. The cost for \nthe microfiche edition will remain $141 per year with single copies \nremaining $1.50 per issue. This price increase is necessary based \nupon the cost of printing and distribution.                          \n                                    Michael F. DiMario, Public \nPrinter\n\n[[Page S11856]]\n\norder of enacting the thirteen annual appropriations bills, we have in \nrecent years, chosen to delay appropriations bills until it is too late \nto do anything other than to package them in a manner that causes such \npackages to be used as vehicles for all manner of non-appropriations \nissues. This has necessitated the adoption of late-year omnibus \nappropriations packages well after the start of the fiscal year, such \nas the one before the Senate today. This is a practice that should \nnever have been started and which, if not discontinued, I fear will \ngravely diminish the Senate as an institution. Senators are being \ndenied the right to debate and amend appropriations bills, all of which \ncontain billions of taxpayer dollars, and literally thousands of \nfunding issues affecting their constituents. Instead, we are being \npresented with unamendable omnibus appropriations packages, which \ncontain many, many matters that have not had any Senate consideration \nat all. In the next Congress, the 107th Congress, we should strive \nmightily, on a bipartisan basis, to return to regular order in taking \nup each of the thirteen annual appropriations bills. The Appropriations \nCommittee has marked up each of the thirteen appropriations bills in a \ntimely manner every year under our distinguished Chairman, Senator \nStevens. He is indeed masterful in his handling of appropriations \nmatters and he is very knowledgeable on the issues that come before the \nAppropriations Committee. He is also one who leads the Committee in a \nbipartisan manner at all times. He gives the same consideration to \nrequests of Members of the Committee on both sides of the aisle, and I \nam honored to serve as Ranking Member of the Committee under his \nchairmanship. It has not been the fault of Ted Stevens that the \nappropriations bills have, too often, been lumped together into omnibus \npackages, such as the one before the Senate.\n  In an effort to facilitate a return to the regular order in the \nSenate's handling of the thirteen annual appropriations bills, I was \npleased to have the support of both Leaders, Mr. Daschle and Mr. Lott, \nin my amendment to the Commerce/Justice/State Appropriations bill for \nFiscal Year 2001 to restore Senate Rule XXVIII, Paragraph 2. That \nprovision makes it out of order for extraneous matters to be included \nin conference reports. Several years ago, in connection with the \nSenate's consideration of an FAA conference report, the Senate voted to \noverturn the Chair when it ruled that there was extraneous matter in \nthat conference report. The effect of that vote to overturn the Chair \nwas to negate Rule XXVIII, Paragraph 2. Consequently, it has not been \nout of order for any matter to be inserted in any conference report \nsince that time. Upon enactment of the Commerce/Justice/State \nAppropriations bill, and as a result of my amendment thereto,\n  Rule XXVIII, Paragraph 2 will be restored. This will mean that in the \n107th Congress, it will not be in order for extraneous matters to be \nplaced in a conference report. Upon a point of order's being made in \nthat regard, if sustained, such a conference report will be rejected. I \nbelieve that restoration of this rule will go a long way toward \neliminating these annual omnibus appropriations measures that the \nSenate has had to deal with in the past several years and is again \nbeing asked to adopt here today.\n  Having said that, Mr. President, I shall vote for the pending \nconference report. It contains the Fiscal Year 2001 appropriations \nbills for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and \nEducation, for the Department of the Treasury and General Government, \nand for the Legislative Branch. By far, the largest of these \nappropriations bills is the Labor/HHS Appropriations bill.\n  In the agreement reached on the Labor/HHS bill, the funding totals \nsome $108.9 billion in budget authority for Fiscal Year 2001. This is \nan increase of almost $12 billion from last year and represents the \nlargest ever one-year increase for the Labor/HHS Appropriations bill. \nThis amounts to more than a 12 percent increase above last year's \nlevel, and will enable funding levels for education to be increased by \nalmost 15 percent, including an appropriation of more than $1 billion \nfor a new school renovation program. The Labor/HHS Appropriations bill \nalso includes critical funding for many health programs such as the \nRyan White AIDS program, NIH, child immunization, substance abuse \nprevention, and mental health programs. All of these programs are \nfunded at levels substantially higher than last year. As Members are \naware, the bill also funds the Head Start program, and the low income \nhome energy assistance program, LIHEAP. I recognize that a number of \nSenators believe that we should have insisted upon even higher levels \nfor the Labor/HHS bill. While I might agree with those Senators, and \nalthough a tentative agreement in October would have funded the Labor/\nHHS Appropriations bill at a level of over $112 billion, that agreement \nfell through over a legislative rider involving ergonomics.\n  After weeks of haggling over the ergonomics issue, as well as other \nissues such as immigration, and overall funding levels, I feel that we \nhave no other choice than to accept this compromise that is before the \nSenate today. As I say, it does not fully please any Senator. I am sure \nthere are some who feel that the funding levels are too high; but the \ntime has long since passed for us to complete our work and get this \nfinal appropriations package to the President's desk.\n  In addition to the Labor/HHS Appropriations bill, this package \ncontains funding for the Legislative Branch, and the Department of the \nTreasury and General Government, which measure funds a number of \nprograms for law enforcement, as well as the U.S. Customs Service--the \nfederal agency with responsibility for border patrol and enforcement of \nour immigration laws.\n  There is also a division of this omnibus package that includes a \nnumber of non-appropriations matters. Those matters were considered \ncarefully by Chairman Stevens, Chairman Young, Mr. Obey and myself, at \nthe request of Members of the House and Senate. There were many more \nsuch matters that were considered, but were not included in this final \npackage.\n  Finally, the package contains a division relating to tax matters, \nincluding the so-called Balanced Budget Act, BBA, Medicare fix. Those \ntax matters were inserted into the omnibus package by the Leadership, \nand they fall into the jurisdiction of the Ways and Means and Finance \nCommittees. Accordingly, we Appropriations Members were not involved in \nthat process.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote for this \nconference agreement. Despite its having all the flaws that we have \nseen in previous omnibus appropriations bills, the time has come to \nfinish the work of the 106th Congress. In that way, we will have a \nclean slate for the new Congress, the 107th Congress, when it convenes \non January 3rd, and for the new Administration, when our new President, \nGeorge W. Bush, is sworn into office on January 20th.\n  While I recognize that there are those who predict a continuation of \nthe gridlock that we have seen in the recent past, or perhaps greater \ngridlock in the next Congress, as it struggles to work with the Bush \nAdministration; I hope and believe that there will be unprecedented \nopportunities for bipartisan efforts to prevail in solving the Nation's \nmost pressing problems; to maintain a vital national defense, and to \nfind solutions which ensure that our Medicare and Social Security \nprograms can sustain the promised for our citizens over the coming \ncentury. I am optimistic that the new Congress will be prepared to work \nwith the Bush Administration. I know that the overwhelming number of \nMembers of the House and Senate, on a bipartisan basis, join me in \npledging our best efforts to do so, and our good faith commitment to \nachieve results in these critical areas, on behalf of the American \npeople.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, after protracted negotiations, the \nAdministration and I have reached an agreement that provides the \nnecessary protections for the Steller sea lion while allowing for the \nneeds of fishermen who depend on the robust and healthy groundfish \nstocks off Alaska. I believe the Senate knows my personal feelings, and \nthe feelings of practically all those who are involved in the \nharvesting, processing, and subsequent marketing of the millions of \ntons of seafood that come from the North Pacific and Bering Sea, on \nthis matter. While we recognize that the Steller sea lion deserves \nprotection, we are not convinced\n\n[[Page S11857]]\n\nthat the Commerce Department has proven, let alone adequately tested, \nits hypothesis that fishing contributes to the sea lions' decline. A \nfew minutes spent skimming the biological opinion reveals the lack of \nscience underlying the proposed actions it contains. For example, the \nCommerce Department states in its biological opinion that it does not \nknow if fishing impacts sea lions, or that sea lions would likely \ncontinue to decline even if all fishing were halted.\n  Nonetheless, the lives of our fishermen will continue to be affected \nby this opinion. Our agreement provides a three-step phase-in process \nfor fishery restrictions proposed to be implemented by the National \nMarine Fisheries Service (NMFS) in the Alaska groundfish fisheries \nunder Endangered Species Act (ESA) requirements. This section is \nintended to lessen the negative economic consequences to the fishing \ncommunity caused by the restrictions and to ensure that any Steller sea \nlion protective measures do not create negative consequences for the \nconservation of the fisheries and ecosystem. This is accomplished by \nrequiring the Secretary to rely on the fishery management provisions in \nthe Magnuson-Stevens Act, including the regional council processes, \nwhen implementing reasonable and prudent alternatives under the \nEndangered Species Act.\n  Unfortunately, work on this provision was not completed until shortly \nbefore the conference agreement was filed on the final day of this \nsession. I ask unanimous consent that the section-by-section analysis \nof this provision be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n       Subsection (a) includes findings by Congress concerning the \n     decline of the Steller sea lion and need for scientists to \n     study the relationship between commercial fisheries and sea \n     lions. It also includes findings confirming that the \n     authority to manage federal fisheries lies with the regional \n     councils created under the Magnuson-Stevens Act. It clarifies \n     that the Secretary is required to comply with, and use the \n     procedures established under, the Magnuson-Stevens Act when \n     implementing measures to comply with the Endangered Species \n     Act. This finding recognizes that the Administration should \n     not use the Endangered Species Act to implement fishery \n     management measures without respect to the Magnuson-Stevens \n     Act, particularly the processes by which the councils \n     develop, review, and promulgate fishery management measures. \n     The appropriate forum to develop fishery management measures, \n     including those measures necessary to protect threatened and \n     endangered species, are the regional councils.\n       Subsection (b) requires the North Pacific Fishery \n     Management Council to conduct an independent scientific \n     review of the November 30, 2000 biological opinion (hereafter \n     the ``Opinion'') issued by NMFS for the Bering Sea/Aleutian \n     Islands and Gulf of Alaska groundfish fisheries, drawing upon \n     the expertise of the National Academy of Sciences. This \n     subsection reflects the Congress's deep concerns over the \n     validity and objectivity of the science relied on in the \n     biological opinion and the process by which the Commerce \n     Department developed this opinion. It directs the Secretary \n     of Commerce to cooperate with the North Pacific Council's \n     scientific review, and requests the National Academy of \n     Sciences to give the review its highest priority.\n       Subsection (c)(1) directs the Secretary to submit proposed \n     Magnuson-Stevens Act fishery conservation and management \n     measures to implement the reasonable and prudent alternatives \n     (RPAs) to the North Pacific Council immediately or as soon as \n     possible, and then tasks the Council with preparing a fishery \n     management amendment or amendments under the Magnuson-Stevens \n     Act to implement such conservation and management measures. \n     While the amendments must implement the measures necessary to \n     protect sea lions and, it is equally important that such \n     measures provide for the conservation and safe conduct of the \n     fisheries, as required in the Magnuson-Stevens Act. Congress \n     remains concerned that the proposed closures would have \n     forced small vessels to fish in dangerous waters during the \n     winter storm season, a prospect specifically commented upon \n     by our Coast Guard.\n       Subsection (c)(2) requires the RPAs, as developed by the \n     North Pacific Council under subsection (c)(1), to become \n     effective on January 1, 2002. To address Congress' concerns \n     about the objectivity and validity of the scientific \n     conclusions of this opinion the opinion must incorporate \n     changes warranted by the scientific review required under \n     subsection (b) or other new information that comes to the \n     Secretary or Council's attention. The Council and Secretary \n     are directed to jointly develop a schedule for the \n     development of FMP amendment or amendments to implement the \n     RPAs beginning in the 2002 fisheries. Subsection (c)(2) \n     specifies that the RPAs shall not go into effect immediately, \n     but shall be phased in according to subsection (c)(3) during \n     the 2001 fisheries.\n       Subsection (c)(3) requires the 2001 Bering Sea/Aleutian \n     Island and Gulf of Alaska groundfish fisheries to be managed \n     in accordance with the regulations promulgated for the 2000 \n     fisheries prior to the issuance of the July 19, 2000 court \n     injunction in those fisheries (which has since been lifted). \n     The 2000 regulations provide substantial protections for \n     Steller sea lions, while maintaining the comprehensive and \n     proven framework that has protected the marine resources of \n     the North Pacific and been fine-tuned for more than two \n     decades. These regulations for the first months of the 2001 \n     fisheries are to be implemented by emergency rule so that the \n     fisheries can begin by January 20, 2001.\n       Subsection (c)(4) requires the Secretary of Commerce to \n     amend regulations based on the 2000 regulations, but which \n     are consistent to the extent practicable with the RPA's, by \n     January 20, 2001. The Secretary is to consult with the North \n     Pacific Council in preparing these draft regulations, with \n     the goal of incorporating some of the protective concepts in \n     the RPAs for these regulations, in time for the fisheries to \n     open no later than January 20, 2001. Under paragraph (7) of \n     subsection (c), the draft regulations amended upon the \n     recommendation of the North Pacific Council until March 15, \n     2001. As soon after March 15, 2001 as possible, the Secretary \n     of Commerce will publish and implement the regulations, and \n     these regulations shall then govern the Bering Sea/Aleutian \n     Island and Gulf of Alaska fisheries for the remainder of \n     2001, consistent with all the requirements of the Magnuson-\n     Stevens Act. It is our intent that the Secretary provide \n     ample opportunity for the public to comment on these \n     regulations before the regulations take effect.\n       Subsection (c)(5) requires that the ``Global Control Rule'' \n     from the RPA's take effect immediately in the fisheries, this \n     is particularly important during the period during the Spring \n     and/or early summer of 2001 when the fisheries are being \n     managed under the 2000 regulations. Paragraph (5) modifies \n     the Global Control Rule during 2001 to limit any reduction to \n     not more than ten percent of the total allowable catch in any \n     of the fisheries.\n       Subsection (c)(6) provides the North Pacific Council with \n     the authority to recommend, and the Secretary of Commerce \n     with the authority to approve, modifications to the RPAs \n     contained in the regulations that will take effect in the \n     Spring or early-summer of the 2001 fisheries. These \n     modifications may include the opening of additional \n     designated Steller sea lion critical habitat for fishing by \n     small boats, the postponement of seasonal catch levels inside \n     critical habitat for small boats, or other measures to ensure \n     that small boat fishermen and on-shore processors in Alaska \n     are not adversely affected during 2001 as compared to the \n     fisheries before the July 19, 2000 injunction. This was \n     specifically agreed to by both the Congressional and \n     Administration negotiators to allow coastal Alaskan fishermen \n     to fish in the safer waters closer to shore.\n       Subsection (d) appropriates $20 million to the Secretary of \n     Commerce to develop and implement a comprehensive research \n     and recovery program for the Steller sea lion, and to study \n     the myriad of factors which may be causing the decline of the \n     Steller sea lion. Subsection (d) specifically requires that \n     the theories of nutritional stress, localized depletion, and \n     food competition with the fisheries be tested to determine \n     their validity. This subsection also directs the Secretary of \n     Commerce to implement non-lethal measures on a pilot basis to \n     protect Steller sea lions from marine mammal predation, \n     including killer whales, and to determine the extent to which \n     predation may be causing the decline or preventing recovery. \n     The Secretary is strongly encouraged to cooperate with the \n     Alaska SeaLife Center, the North Pacific Universities Marine \n     Mammal Consortium, the University of Alaska, and the North \n     Pacific Council in the development and use of these funds. \n     The Alaska SeaLife Center should receive $5,000,000 of these \n     funds to continue their important work on Steller sea lion \n     science.\n       Subsection (e) provides $30 million as a direct payment to \n     the Southwest Alaska Municipal Conference to distribute to \n     the fishing communities, businesses, western Alaska community \n     development quota program groups, individuals, and other \n     entities that have been hurt by the economic losses already \n     inflicted as a result of Steller sea lion restrictions. The \n     President of SWAMC is required to submit a written report to \n     the Secretary of Commerce and the U.S. Senate and House \n     appropriations committees within six months after receiving \n     the funds to indicate how they have been distributed.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in these waning days and hours of the 106th \nCongress, the focus in Washington is naturally on what action is taking \nplace to resolve the remaining fiscal year 2001 appropriations bills \nand concluding the business of this Congress. However, all around us, \nlife goes on. Our constituents in the steel industry must be among the \nfew in America who will not be happy to see the 106th Congress adjourn \nsine die. Our constituents in the steel industry will see Congress's \nadjournment as a thinning of the bucket brigade that has spent the last \ntwo years trying to bail out an\n\n[[Page S11858]]\n\nindustry being flooded by cheap, illegally dumped steel. These people, \nour constituents from Weirton and Wheeling, West Virginia, from \nPennsylvania, Illinois, Alabama, Maryland, Utah--their arms are tired, \ntheir voices hoarse from the effort of keeping their heads above water \nand shouting for help. As we look forward to adjournment, they are \ncontinuing to face a flood whose undertow threatens to pull them under. \nToday, as a result of this continuing crisis in steel, imports make up \nalmost 40 percent of the U.S. market, compared to a historical rate of \napproximately 18 percent.\n  Congress has tried to respond. Members have supported individual \ncompanies and groups in filing trade cases with the Administration, \nattempting to use our anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws as they \nwere intended, to thwart illegal actions by foreign competitors. \nMembers of Congress, myself included, have introduced, supported, and \nfought for passage of legislation to help this core American industry. \nBut the flood of illegally dumped steel continues, fed by the Asian \neconomic crisis, the failure of the Russian economy, and foreign \ncompetitors seeking to gain a competitive edge with the help of illegal \ngovernment subsidies. When one trade case is filed with regard to one \ntype of steel, these competitors switch to another type of steel, \nforcing affected U.S. companies to bear the cost of their sales losses \ncombined with the cost and time of collecting data and building their \nlegal cases. The overall effect is to grind small companies down to the \nverge of collapse.\n  In 1977, there were 16,961 steelworkers on the payroll in West \nVirginia. In March 2000, there were just 6,857, a loss of 10,104 good-\npaying jobs. That's a 60 percent loss. So you understand why I am \nconcerned. The national picture is no brighter. In 1980, there were \n1,142,000 workers nationwide in the primary metals industry, which \nincludes steel. As of September 2000, that total employment number had \ndropped to just 692,000, a drop of approximately 39 percent.\n  In the last two years, thousands of steelworkers have been laid off, \nsome for considerable periods. Six steel companies have declared \nbankruptcy since 1998. But total steel imports in 2000 will be over \n2\\1/2\\ times higher than in 1991. Total steel imports through August \n2000 are 17 percent higher than over the same period in 1999 and are \ngreater even than imports over the same period in 1998, a record year. \nAt the same time, steel prices continue to be depressed, with hot-\nrolled steel prices 12 percent lower in August 2000 than in the first \nquarter of 1998, and average import customs values for all steel \nproducts more than 15 percent lower over the same period.\n  Is this how we want to end an era of American history? Do we want to \nwatch the linchpin of the American industrial revolution--our steel \nindustry--be felled by government subsidized foreign competition, aided \nand abetted by indifferent application of the very trade laws \nimplemented to protect American companies and American workers from \nillegal competition? I certainly hope not. When our crippled Aegis \ndestroyer, the ill-fated U.S.S. Cole, is brought home for repairs, I \nwould like American steel to bind up those wounds. I don't want to be \ndependent on foreign sources of steel for critical national defense \nneeds. During World War II, I was a welder, helping to build the ships \nthat supported our forces in that war. Today, I am a legislator, and I \nwant to help the industry that supports our forces in war and in other \ncritical missions.\n\n  I had prepared a resolution, cosponsored by Senators Specter, \nRockefeller, Abraham, Baucus, Bayh, DeWine, Durbin, Hollings, Kohl, \nLevin, Lincoln, Lugar, Mikulski, Santorum, Sarbanes, Schumer, Sessions, \nShelby, Thurmond, Voinovich, and Wellstone, that would be a Senate \ncompanion to H. Res. 635. H. Res. 635 was introduced on October 18, and \ncurrently has 237 cosponsors. This resolution would call upon the \nPresident to take all appropriate action within his power to provide \nrelief to the steel industry injured by these unfair actions of our \ntrading partners. It would request an immediate and expedited U.S. \nInternational Trade Commission investigation for positive adjustment \nunder Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974. I am pleased that my \nresolution was, instead, accepted and included in the conference report \nto accompany the Labor/HHS appropriations bill.\n  This action by the Administration is necessary. We need a broad-\nbased, comprehensive approach to dealing with this crisis in the \ndomestic steel industry. Fighting this war one skirmish at a time, on \none product type at a time by one company at a time, is simply and \nslowly bleeding our steel companies dry. We cannot let them continue to \npick our steel companies off one at a time. We need to put the full \nweight of our attention and our resources on dealing comprehensively \nwith this matter. We need to be vigilant across all fronts, and we need \nto develop longer strategic vision if we are to preserve this vital \ndomestic industry.\n  We need a level playing field. I have no doubt that American steel \ncompanies can compete on a level playing field. But they cannot compete \nagainst steel that is priced at or below the cost of production by \nforeign companies subsidized by governments who seek not only to \npreserve their own steel production capacity, but to profit by gaining \nU.S. market share and putting our companies into bankruptcy. I am, \nunfortunately, confident that the International Trade Commission's \ninvestigation will find that the steel crisis of 1998 is far from over. \nIn fact, steel imports are on track to match or possibly exceed the \nrecord figures of 1998. So, sadly, our domestic steel producers should \nhave no problem meeting the stringent standards of proof required under \nsection 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 to prove that an injury has or can \nbe expected to occur.\n  I commend the many Members of the Senate who join me in calling for \nthis action to be taken, for standing up for steel and the men and \nwomen and families who depend on steel jobs. I also commend the Senate \nfor including this provision in this bill. I urge the Administration to \nproceed immediately to initiate a Section 201 investigation of steel \ndumping. It is urgently needed.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, 70 days and 20 continuing resolutions \nafter what was supposed to be our October 6 adjournment date, the 106th \nCongress is coming to an end. Let us hope the upcoming New Year brings \nwith it a renewed spirit of bipartisan cooperation.\n  This year, such cooperation took a back seat to partisan bickering \nand ill-advised parliamentary tactics that had the effect of further \npolarizing this body. How many mornings did Americans awake to \nnewspaper headlines reporting that Congress and the president still, \nweeks and months after we were to adjourn, had not finished their work?\n  There are many good provisions in the legislation soon to be sent to \nthe President and I want to thank all those who put in long hours to \nbring this Congress to a close. I am particularly supportive of the \nMedicare changes that will strengthen the quality of health care for \nour seniors.\n  In 1997, Congress made some difficult, but necessary, changes in the \nfinancial structure of the Medicare system as part of the Balanced \nBudget Act. These changes were needed to preserve and protect the \nsystem and delay its impending bankruptcy from 2001 until 2015, while \nalso increasing choice and expanding benefits for beneficiaries.\n  Despite the changes, there has been increasing concern that certain \nreimbursement reductions and caps contained in the Budget Act are \nresulting in access problems for our seniors. Personally, I have grown \nconcerned about the potentially negative impact on the delivery of \nhealth care in our rural communities and for our most frail elderly if \nwe do not make certain adjustments.\n  I am also pleased this legislation addresses many of the concerns \nraised by my constituents and the Arizona health care community. This \nproposal improves senior health care by increasing access to critical \npreventative benefits--including bi-annual pap smear screenings and \npelvic exams, glaucoma screenings, colon cancer screening, and medical \nnutrition therapy for patients with diabetes and renal disease. Rural \nhospitals are strengthened by updating reimbursement policies and \nincreasing access for seniors to emergency and ambulatory services in \nrural areas. And this legislation significantly lowers co-payments for \nout-patient hospital visits.\n\n[[Page S11859]]\n\n  I am also pleased that Native Americans will not be overlooked in \nthis legislative package, but instead will receive an economic boost \nthrough equitable treatment of tribal governments for unemployment tax \npurposes, a change to the tax law that I have been advocating for \nnearly a decade. An important stimulus to economic development in \nIndian country is to provide employment tax credits and incentives, \nincluding unemployment compensation benefits. This change to the \nFederal Unemployment Tax Act, FUTA, will correct an uneven \ninterpretation in the tax law by finally including tribal employees in \nthe Nation's comprehensive unemployment benefit system.\n  Unfortunately, I must oppose this legislation for a variety of \nreason. Once again, I must object to the pork barrel spending in this \nyear-end legislative package and in all of the appropriations bills \nthat have become law. Regrettably, the process that got us to this \npoint led to what a New York Times headline aptly characterized as \n``The Politics of the Surplus.'' In other words, we paved our way home \nby spending billions of taxpayers' dollars on budget items that never \nwent through a merit-based review process.\n  In the run-up to this final agreement, over $24 billion in pork \nbarrel spending (a list of this spending may be found on my Senate Web \nsite) was doled out and that figure will surely climb once we get a \ngood look at the bills before us. Mr. President, our appetite for pork \nbarrel spending was so large this year, in fact, that NBC News \nhighlighted our feast on their Nightly News segment, ``The Fleecing of \nAmerica.''\n  Who among us will ever forget the 1.5 million taxpayer dollars we \nhave already approved to restore ``a 56-foot iron rendition of the \nRoman god of fire and metalworking, Vulcan''?\n  Or the $1.5 million for sunflower research?\n  Or the $400,000 for the Southside Sportsman Club?\n  Or the $250,000 to develop improved varieties of potatoes''?\n  Or the $100,000 for the ``Trees Forever Program\"?\n  Or the $176,000 for the Reindeer Herders Association?\n  Or Or the $5 million for insect rearing?\n  But, there is more to come in this year-end budget deal, which has at \nleast $1.9 billion in pork. For instance, in the Conference Report for \nthe Commerce, State, and Justice Appropriations bill, some examples of \nearmarks having never undergone the appropriate merit-review process \ninclude: $3 million for Red Snapper research, $1 million for Hawaiian \ncoral reef monitoring, $500,000 for the California Ozone study, \n$200,000 for the Kotzebue Sound test fishery for king crab and sea \nsnail, $600,000 for fall chinook rearing for the Columbia River \nhatcheries program, $750,000 for bottle-nosed dolphins, $3,338,000 for \nsea turtles, $1 million for winter pollack survey in Alaska, $1 million \nfor the implementation of the National Height Modernization, NHM, \nsystem in North Carolina, $300,000 for research on the Charleston bump, \nand $150,000 for lobster sampling.\n\n  The pork barrel spending adds up. Look at the numbers.\n  Last spring, Republicans outlined our spending plans calling for \nabout $600 billion in so-called discretionary spending--that is, \nspending on programs other than Social Security, Medicare, and interest \non our $5.7 trillion debt. The President's budget requested about $623 \nbillion in discretionary spending. We'll end up spending in the \nneighborhood of $650 billion--some $100 billion over the discretionary \nspending caps set by the 1997 Balanced Budget Act.\n  According to Robert Reischauer, former head of the Congressional \nBudget Office, this will be the third year in a row in which the \nbudget, excluding Social Security, ``has been in surplus.'' The last \ntime this happened, Reischauer says, was over 70 years ago. This is why \nI believe, Mr. President, we should take advantage of our robust \neconomy and make significantly paying down our national debt one of our \ntop priorities.\n  I must also once again express my disappointment over the narrow \nscope of the immigration provisions contained in this bill. I support \nthe Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act, LIFA. Negotiations between the \nWhite House and the leadership, which endorsed more limited immigration \nreform, have resulted in a compromise that makes progress but falls far \nshort of the Fairness provisions we never had a chance to vote on.\n  In particular, this bill makes meaningful but insufficient progress \non amnesty for those wrongly denied it, and does not address legitimate \nconcerns about Central American refugee parity. Fortunately, \nnegotiators have agreed to temporarily restore Section 245(i), which \nallows immigrants with family or employer sponsors to adjust their \nstatus in the United States, rather than return to their countries of \norigin and face the threat of 10 years of separation from family and \nwork in the United States before returning. This bill also contains \nimportant provisions encouraging family unification through the \ncreation of several new visa categories. That said, it will fall to \nsupporters of the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act in the 107th \nCongress to advance that bill's intent to allow long-term residents who \nhave developed deep roots in our country and contributed to our economy \nfor many years to remain legally, and to establish parity for Central \nAmerican and other refugees not afforded the same status as refugees \nfrom other, similarly troubled countries. I am sorry we could not have \nbetter addressed these concerns in this bill, but I appreciate the \nprogress we are making and hope that we can take up these issues during \nthe 107th Congress.\n  I remain optimistic, Mr. President, that we will be able to work \ntogether in the 107th Congress to accomplish great things.\n  We all should be proud of the recent election. Obviously, it wasn't \nperfect. Democracy never is. Yet, major issues important to all \nAmericans were discussed and debated. In fact, a post-election survey \nby Pew Charitable Trusts found that a high percentage of voters \nbelieved there was ``more discussion of issues than four years ago.'' \nAnd 83 percent of voters said they learned enough ``to make an informed \nchoice.''\n  No doubt voters have different opinions on how we should deal with \nthese issues. But, they did not disagree on which issues need to be \ntackled by Congress and our President.\n  In national pre-election polls, Americans consistently ranked Social \nSecurity, health care, and education among the issues they worry most \nabout. But they also know that little gets done because too much \nspecial-interest money is infecting our political process, resulting in \nthe kind of gridlock we have witnessed over the last year. A Newsweek \npoll found nearly 60 percent of Americans agreeing with the statement \nthat political contributions have ``too much influence on elections and \ngovernment policy.'' Only ten percent disagreed.\n  The way we do business must change.\n  If we have the will, we can begin to repair Americans' cynical \nperception of our government by working together, in bipartisan \nfashion, on campaign finance reform, a real Patient's Bill of Rights, \nSocial Security reform, and badly needed reform of the tax system.\n  We must also do our work in the open with due process and appropriate \ndiscussion.\n  This is why, I must also object to a provision inserted by Senator \nInouye, who has once again gone to great lengths to provide \nprotectionist legislation to the lone U.S. operator of large cruise \nships in Hawaii. In the 106th's closing hours, the Senator has had a \nlegislative provision inserted in the final appropriations measure that \nwill prohibit any cruise ship operator from allowing gaming on board \nany vessel that departs from and returns to Hawaii. This provides \nAmerican Classic Voyages with the protection they need to keep other \ncruise operators who depend on gaming to attract passengers and provide \nan additional revenue stream from entering the Hawaii market and \nprohibit other vessels currently departing from other U.S. port cities \nfrom sailing among the Hawaiian islands. In the end, the American \nconsumer is the loser.\n  While Hawaii law currently prohibits any gaming within the state, \nincluding its waters, U.S., state, and international law allows gaming \non vessels more than three miles from shore. I have no argument against \nHawaii's gambling prohibition. But the amendment authored by Senator \nInouye is aimed at keeping planed operations by international cruise \noperators out of Hawaii and preserving the monopoly\n\n[[Page S11860]]\n\ncreated for American Classic Voyages as part of special interest \nlegislation he sponsored and which became law in 1998. The language \nwill result in fewer large cruise ship operators serving the Hawaiian \nIslands and drastically restricting consumer choice for cruise \nvacations in Hawaii.\n\n  What is most amazing is this measure, like so many others in this \nbill, was never discussed publicly, with the administration, or with \nany Committee of jurisdiction in Congress. This type of closed door, \nspecial interest legislation should concern every Member. To deny the \nAmerican public the freedom of choice in cruising vacations and \nrestrict international trade without one moment of debate is very \ntroubling.\n  In light of this and other such inappropriate legislating, we must \nenact institutional reforms to put an end to the rampant abuse of the \nbudget process.\n  If we are to hold any hope for reforming the budgetary process in \nthis body, fundamental changes to the rules governing the \nappropriations process must be made. The two Rules of the Senate \ndesigned to impose discipline on the appropriations process are Rule \n16, and Rule 28. Rule 16 is designed to block legislative riders on \nappropriations bills coming out of Committee, and Rule 28 is designed \nto accomplish the same goal on Conference Reports. Unfortunately, due \nto the fact that Rule 16 points of order only require a simple majority \nto over-rule the Chair, it has proven ineffective in stripping riders. \nAnd, as we all know, Rule 28 is effectively moot at this point.\n  As such, when the Senate reconvenes next year, it is my intention to \noffer an amendment to the Rules of the Senate designed to toughen Rule \n16, and to reaffirm and toughen Rule 28. This amendment would do the \nfollowing:\n  Rule 16 would be modified to require a three-fifths vote to over-rule \na point of order against a legislative item inserted into a general \nappropriations bill by the appropriations committee. Further, a single \npoint of order may be raised against each legislative item, and each \npoint of order would be debatable and subject to a roll call vote.\n  Rule 28 would be modified, blocking Conferees to a general \nappropriations bill from inserting in their Report any matter not \ncommitted to them by either House, or striking from the bill matter \nagreed to by both Houses. Conferees to a general appropriations bill \nwould be prohibited from increasing an appropriation for any item \ncommitted to them by either House to a level exceeding the highest \nappropriated level for such item presented to them by either House, and \nreducing an appropriated level for any item committed to them below the \nlowest appropriated level for such item committed to them by either \nHouse.\n  Further, Conferees to a general appropriations bill would be \nrestricted from modifying any item committed to them by either House \nwhere such modification is not germane to the item being modified. In \nany case, no matter may be inserted into the Report that is not germane \nto the general appropriations bill committed to the Conferees.\n  The result of these changes would be to impose a strict ``scope of \nconference'' rule on appropriations Conferees.\n  A point of order may be made by any Senator against any general \nappropriations bill Conference Report for any violation of the \nrestrictions set forth by this rule. In such cases where a single \nrestriction has been violated more than once within a Conference \nReport, or where more than one restriction has been violated within a \nsingle Conference Report, each violation may be treated individually, \nand may be subject to a specific point of order. In the event that a \nsingle, or multiple points of order, are made against a general \nappropriations bill Conference Report for reasons set forth under these \nnew restrictions, a three-fifths vote of the Senate is required to \nover-rule the Chair. Each appeal of the ruling of the Chair of each \nrespective point of order is debatable and must be voted on separately.\n  Mr. President, before I end, I want to wish everyone a happy holiday \nseason and New Year.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I would like to take some time to \ndiscuss the importance of investing in our Nation's high-speed rail \ninfrastructure.\n  We have what could fairly be termed a looming transportation crisis \nin the United States. Business and personal travelers are \noverwhelmingly relying on air travel to get from city to city, and the \nsystem is plagued with delays and congestion which is not only \nundermining people's personal plans but also harming the business \ncommunity.\n  Air travel has become so inconvenient and unreliable, the public \nneeds alternatives. According to the Federal Aviation Administration, \naviation delays increased 58 percent between 1995 and 1999. And to add \nto passengers' frustration, the average delay is getting longer each \nyear--averaging 50 minutes in 1999.\n  Even worse, flight cancellations increased 68 percent over that same \nperiod--1995--1999. Overall, nearly one in four flights was either \ndelayed or canceled in 1999.\n  The summer of 1999 was the most delayed summer in aviation history. \nThat is until this summer, which blew past last year's delay record.\n  The number of delays, the number of cancellations, and the length of \ndelays all have continued to go up so far in 2000. And consumer \ncomplaints more than doubled in 1999 and are up almost another 50 \npercent so far this year.\n  With aviation travel expected to increase more than 50 percent over \nthe next decade, we have a crisis looming.\n  The Federal Aviation Administration estimates that boardings will \nincrease to 917 million by 2008. Our current aviation system can't \nhandle this demand.\n  Fortunately, we have a solution to this problem right before our \neyes. A solution that we have ignored and neglected for too long--high-\nspeed passenger rail.\n  Nineteen of the 20 most-delayed airports in the United States are \nlocated on potential high-speed corridors. And high-speed rail can \nprovide a competitive travel alternative, particularly over distances \nless than 500 miles.\n  The situation on our roads is almost as dire as the problems in our \nskies. One study estimated that $72 billion dollars was lost in 1997 as \na result of traffic congestion through lost productivity and wasted \nfuel. And this situation continues to deteriorate. People now spend 50 \npercent more time stuck in traffic than they did in 1990 and triple the \ntime they did in 1982.\n  Critics have complained about Amtrak receiving $23 billion federal \nsubsidies since 1971. But this is pocket change compared with the \nfunding we have provided other modes over that same period. Since 1971, \nwe have spent over $160 billion on aviation programs and over $380 \nbillion on highways.\n  The High-Speed Rail Investment Act can is the vehicle for giving \nAmericans more transportation options. This legislation would allow \nAmtrak to sell $10 billion in high-speed rail bonds over ten years. The \nFederal Government would leverage private sector investment in our rail \ninfrastructure by providing tax credits to bondholders.\n  States would be full partners in this effort and would have to put up \na 20 percent match which would go into an escrow account to be used to \nrepay the bond principal.\n  These funds would enable high-speed rail projects to go forward in \nthe Midwest, the Southeast, the Gulf Coast, and along the Pacific \nCoast.\n  And it would allow us to finish the Northeast Corridor high-speed \nrail project.\n  High-speed rail means better, faster, more competitive rail service. \nIt means a comfortable travel alternative to those who want to avoid \ncongested highways and cramped and delayed planes.\n  The High-Speed Rail Investment Act, S. 1900, is supported by a \nbipartisan group of 57 Senators representing all regions of the \ncountry. And companion House legislation, H.R. 3700, introduced by \nCongressmen Amo Houghton and James Oberstar, now has over 150 \ncosponsors.\n  Our Nation's governors, state legislators, and mayors understand our \ntransportation problems and see high-speed rail as a vital part of the \nsolution to our transporatation woes. Newspapers from across the Nation \nhave come out in support of investing in high-speed rail.\n  Mr. President, the benefits of High Speed Rail Service are clear. \nHigh-speed rail is the future of transportation in America. We cannot \nmaintain a productive and efficient transportation system without \nmodernizing our\n\n[[Page S11861]]\n\nrail infrastructure and providing a competitive alternative means of \ntransportation on our rails.\n  I am therefore pleased that I have the commitment of my colleagues to \nprovide resources for high speed rail next year. While I won't be in \nthe Senate, I know the Senator from Delaware and other colleagues will \nwork relentlessly toward this goal.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as the Senate considers the Medicare, \nMedicaid and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000, I \nwant to take this opportunity to comment about several of the \nprovisions included in the bill. This bill contains many important \nhealth care provisions affecting both Medicare providers and Medicare \nbeneficiaries. Accordingly, I am delighted that a final agreement has \nbeen reached with the White House on these provisions and that the \nmeasure is now ready for passage.\n  I also want to take this opportunity to commend the distinguished \nChairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, for his leadership and \npersistence over the past several months in moving this critically \nimportant legislation. On a personal note, I would be remiss if I did \nnot say that I will miss my colleague and good friend Bill Roth. I am \nvery sorry that he will not be returning to the next Congress to \ncontinue the work on which he has labored for so many years.\n  Bill Roth has made a real difference to Americans--he was one of the \noriginal believers in across-the-board tax cuts. President Reagan \nseized on this idea as the way to get our nation out of \n``stagflation.'' The tax policy worked and produced one of the longest \nperiods of prosperity in history. Bill Roth was also a father of the \nindividual retirement account, which is a simple way that Americans can \nhelp themselves save for retirement. Senator Roth worked tirelessly \nover the years to expand IRAs, make them even more available and more \nworkable. I greatly admire Bill Roth's understanding of the tax code \nand tax policy, and we are going to miss his continued contributions to \nthis complex issue area.\n  But, Chairman Roth has also been a champion on the Finance Committee \nand in the Senate for his commitment in addressing the critical \nstructural and financing problems facing the Medicare program. Indeed, \nhis work over the past several years as Chairman of the Finance \nCommittee has dramatically improved the prospects that meaningful \nMedicare reform can be accomplished, in a bipartisan fashion, in the \nnext Congress. Moreover, because of his efforts, the foundation has \nbeen laid for a workable and much-needed Medicare drug benefit that I \nam hopeful Congress will enact with the leadership of President-elect \nBush.\n  For now, I would like to comment briefly on several provisions which \nI authored, or strongly supported, that are included in this \nlegislation.\n  First, I am pleased the legislation contains provisions to create a \nprospective payment system for federally qualified health centers in \nevery state of the country. Betty Vierra, who serves as the Executive \nDirector of the Association for Utah Community Health, advised me that \nthis is one of the top priorities of community health centers in Utah \nand across the nation. Community health centers have been working on \nthis issue since 1997, and I am pleased they have finally won their \nhard-fought battle.\n  The bill also contains provisions from the Medicare Access to \nTechnology Act of 2000, legislation that I introduced earlier this \nyear. Last year, provisions were included in the omnibus budget \nlegislation for fiscal year 2000 that addressed some of the outstanding \nproblems concerning access issues for Medicare beneficiaries. \nUnfortunately, we were to able to resolve all of the issues last year. \nAs a result, Medicare beneficiaries continue to have trouble gaining \naccess to many new medical technologies that are already reimbursed by \nprivate insurance plans.\n  That is why I introduced the Medicare Patient Access to Technology \nAct of 2000. I believe we must eliminate the delays and barriers to \naccess that have arisen in the way Medicare decides to cover, code and \npay for new medical devices and diagnostics. Last year's legislation, \nwhich was included in the Balanced Budget Relief Act (BBRA), \nrepresented an important first step in modernizing the Medicare program \nto provide timely access to needed medical treatments provided in the \nhospital outpatient setting.\n  Briefly, my legislation requires the Health Care Financing \nAdministration (HCFA) to implement the OPPS pass-through payment \nprogram on the basis of categories starting April 1, 2001. The bill \nincludes a provision which changes the way in which HCFA reimburses for \nclinical laboratory services including the establishment of a specific \nprocess for clinical laboratory payments, and to report to Congress on \nthis issue. Finally, the legislation requires the maintenance of local \ncodes by Medicare contractors for three years and also requires HCFA by \nOctober 1, 2001 to provide for the inclusion of new technologies and \ndevices more quickly in the Medicare inpatient hospital payment \nprogram.\n  On another matter, I have been deeply concerned about the safety of \nour nation's blood supply. Patient access to a safe and adequate blood \nsupply is a national health priority, however, many of us have heard \nfrom the American Red Cross, America's blood centers, and the American \nAssociation of Blood Banks about hospitals having trouble paying for \nnew blood therapies. Additional funding is needed if we are to remain \ncommitted to the safest blood supply possible.\n  The blood banking and transfusion medicine communities are constantly \nworking to assure that safety improvements for blood are implemented as \nsoon as they are available. Unfortunately, these measures significantly \nincrease the cost of blood products--over 40 percent for the two latest \ntechnologies--for both the hospital and blood bank.\n  While blood is donated by volunteers, nonprofit blood centers must \nrecover the costs associated with providing a safe product. Nonprofit \nblood centers pass these charges onto hospitals, which in turn, must \nget timely and adequate reimbursement for these lifesaving and life-\nenhancing products. Unfortunately, the current system by which HCFA \ndetermines inpatient reimbursement rates does not account for these \nsafety improvements a timely manner.\n\n  The bill directs HCFA and MedPAC to review how hospitals are being \nreimbursed for blood. It also asks both entities to recommend necessary \nchanges to provide fair and timely reimbursement. While these \nrecommendations will not be completed until late next year, I will \ncontinue to work on guaranteeing that patients are receiving the safest \npossible blood products as soon as possible.\n  I am also very pleased that the legislation before the Senate today \ncontains additional funding for our nation's skilled facilities (SNFs). \nIn September, I introduced legislation, S. 3030, along with my \ncolleague Senator Domenici, to increase Medicare reimbursements for \nskilled nursing facilities.\n  Nursing homes across our country continue to struggle under the \nenormous demands of complying with the implementation of the \nprospective payment system as authorized pursuant to the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1997 (BBA). In an effort to address this problem, \nCongress passed legislation last year to restore nearly $2.7 billion \nfor the care of nursing home patients. This action provided much needed \nrelief to an industry that is facing extraordinarily financial \ndifficulties as a result of the spending reductions provided under the \nBBA as well as implementation by HCFA.\n  Unfortunately, the problem is not fixed and more needs to be done. \nThat is why Senator Domenici and I introduced the Skilled Nursing \nFacility Care Act of 2000 so that seniors can rest assured that they \nwill have access to this important Medicare benefit.\n  In Utah, there are currently 93 nursing homes serving nearly 5,800 \nresidents. I understand that seven of these 93 facilities, which are \noperated by Vencor, have filed for Chapter 11 protection. These seven \nfacilities care for approximately 800 residents. Clearly, we need to be \nconcerned about the prospect of these nursing homes going out of \nbusiness, and the dramatic consequences that such action would have on \nall residents--no matter who pays the bill.\n  I am pleased that the bill before the Senate contains provisions from \nthe Skilled Nursing Facility Care Act to ensure patient access to \nnursing home\n\n[[Page S11862]]\n\ncare. Medicare's skilled nursing benefit provides life enhancing care \nfollowing a hospitalization to nearly two million seniors annually. \nUnless Congress and HCFA take the necessary steps to ensure proper \npayments, elderly patients will be at risk, especially in rural, \nunderserved and economically disadvantaged areas.\n  Specifically, the bill provides approximately $1.6 billion to SNFs \nover the next five years. The legislation repeals the minus one percent \ndecrease in the SNF market basket for FY 2001 thereby providing the \nfull market basket update. In FY 2002 and 2003 the updates would be the \nmarket basket index increase minus 0.5 percentage points.\n  Moreover, temporary increases in the federal per diem rates provided \nby last year's increases would be in addition to the increases in this \nprovision. The bill also increases the nursing component for each \nResource Utilization Group (RUG) by 16.66% over current law for SNF \ncare furnished after April 1, 2001 and before October 1, 2002. Clearly, \nthese additional dollars will help ensure the continuity of beneficiary \ncare in our nation's nursing homes.\n  Another issue that I worked hard to get into the legislation is the \nfinancial commitment made for the treatment and research on diabetes. I \nam extremely pleased that the bill provides a substantial increase in \nappropriations for special diabetes programs for children with Type 1 \nDiabetes as well as for Native Americans with diabetes. As my \ncolleagues recall, the BBA created two new grant programs under which \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services could make grants to support \nprevention and treatment services of diabetes for children and for \nNative Americans, respectively.\n  Specifically, Congress committed $30 million each for Native American \ndiabetes care and for NIH research of Type 1 Diabetes in children. This \nprogram was authorized for five years--FY 1998 through FY 2002. I am \nvery pleased the legislation increases the appropriated funds available \nfor these two programs by raising the amount from $30 million to $100 \nmillion for FY 2001 and FY 2002, respectively. Moreover, the bill \nappropriates $100 million for each program for FY 2003.\n  These dollars have been extremely helpful in Indian Country where \nNative Americans suffer the highest rate of diabetes than any other \nsegment of our population. I want to commend the Republican leadership \nfor ensuring that these dollars were included in the bill--this \ncommitment is truly making positive difference in the lives of millions \nof Americans who suffer from this deadly disease.\n  With respect to home health care, the legislation protects funding \nfor home health care services by delaying until October 1, 2002 a BBA-\nscheduled 15 percent cut in Medicare payments. I sponsored legislation \nearlier this year that addresses the issue of the 15 percent cut. And, \nwhile I hoped we could repeal the 15% cut provision altogether, I can \nappreciate the difficulty the conferees faced in resolving this \ncomplicated and costly provision. Delaying the cut for another year \nwill provide Congress additional time to address this controversial \nissue.\n  Moreover, the bill provides for a full medical inflation update for \nhome health. I am particularly pleased the bill contains a provision \nthat enhances the use of telehealth medicine in the delivery of home \nhealth care services. This enhancement will be especially helpful to \nthose individuals who live in the rural and remote parts of Utah where \nmedical specialists are not readily available. As a result, Utahns who \nlive in these areas will not have improved access to the best doctors \nand medical care specialists regardless of where they live.\n  The bill also contains a provision on adult day care. This provision \nclarifies that the need for adult day care for a patient's plan of \ntreatment does not preclude appropriate coverage for home health care. \nIt also clarifies the ability of homebound beneficiaries to attend \nreligious services without being disqualified from receiving home \nhealth care benefits. As one of the Senate's strongest supporters of \nhome health care, I believe these provisions will enhance substantially \nthe home health care benefit.\n\n  As far as hospitals are concerned, the legislation provides a \nsubstantial amount of new funding for our nation's hospitals. I have \nbeen particularly concerned about the financial impact of the BBA's \nprovisions on rural hospitals. As I travel across Utah, I am constantly \nreminded by hospital administrators about the serious financial \npressures many of these institutions currently face with increased \ndemands for care while coping with reduced reimbursements from \nMedicare. Clearly, Congress needs to act now to ensure the financial \nviability of our nation's hospitals.\n  The bill also addresses the problem by providing equitable treatment \nfor rural disproportionate share hospitals (DSHs) which care for a \ndisproportionate share of poor Medicare patients. The bill extends the \nMedicare Dependent Hospital program for rural areas; it updates target \namounts for sole community hospitals; and increases rural patients' \naccess to emergency and ambulance services.\n  Moreover, the bill ensures continued access to hospital services \nnationwide by providing a full inflation market basket update for \nfiscal year 2001. The plan also ensures the financial stability of \nteaching hospitals by increasing payments related to physician \ntraining. This provision is especially important to Utah's University \nHospital which has been hard hit in the past year by the BBA \nreductions.\n  With regard to Native Americans, the legislation contains an \nextremely important provision regarding Indian health care. The bill \nauthorizes, for the first time, the Indian Health Service (IHS) and \ntribally operated clinics and hospitals to receive Medicare Part B \nreimbursement for services provided under the physician fee schedule. \nThis proposal would enhance the access of Medicare-eligible Native \nAmericans to affordable, quality health care and improve the ability of \nthese clinics and hospitals to serve the Native American population.\n  Another important Medicare issue I want to raise involves providing \nappropriate coverage for certain injectable drugs and biologicals that \nare critical to many Medicare beneficiaries. To resolve this issue, the \nlegislation has a provision which addresses this important issue.\n  The Medicare Carriers Manual specifies that a drug or biological is \ncovered under this provision if it is ``usually'' not self-\nadministered. Under this standard, Medicare for many years covered \ndrugs and biological products administered by physicians in their \noffices and other outpatient settings. In August 1997, however, HCFA \nissued a memorandum that had the effect of eliminating coverage for \ncertain products that could be self-administered. This resulted in \npatients suddenly losing their Medicare coverage for these products, \nthus limiting access to drugs and biologicals for many seniors and \ndisabled individuals.\n  The legislation's language clarifies Medicare reimbursement policy to \nguarantee that physicians and hospitals will be reimbursed for \ninjectable drugs and biologicals. The new language requires coverage of \n``drugs and biologicals which are not usually self-administered by the \npatient,'' thus restoring the coverage policy that was in effect before \nthe August 1997 HCFA memorandum was issued.\n  When HCFA considers whether a drug or biological is usually self-\nadministered, I feel HCFA should determine whether a majority of \nMedicare beneficiaries can actually self-administer the drug. HCFA \nshould assume, as it did for many years, that Medicare patients do not \nusually administer injections or infusions to themselves, while oral \nmedications usually are self-administered.\n  I believe that it would be appropriate for HCFA to issue guidelines \nfor its contractors to clarify the intent of the legislation. In \naddition, HCFA should instruct its contractors not to exclude a drug or \nbiological without making an explicit finding supported by evidence \nthat the product is usually self-administered by most Medicare \npatients.\n  This issue is an important step to provide our seniors and persons \nwith disabilities with the prescription drugs and biologicals that they \ndeserve. I look forward to working with HCFA to ensure that our \nMedicare beneficiaries receive adequate and appropriate coverage for \nthese drugs and biologicals.\n  On another matter Mr. President, I would also like to state that as \nthe\n\n[[Page S11863]]\n\nMedicare provisions of this legislation are implemented, I urge the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to review policies that affect \nthe order of services provided to home health beneficiaries to assure \nthat, under the prospective payment system, home health agencies are \ngiven maximum flexibility to provide services in a clinically \nappropriate and efficient order.\n  In this connection, I believe the Secretary should also review the \nrole of occupational therapists in conducting the initial Outcome and \nAssessment Information Set (OASIS) even when occupational therapy is \nnot the therapy service that initially qualifies the beneficiary for \ncovered home health services.\n  For example, when patients are prescribed home health solely for \nrehabilitation, the review should include whether or not it would be \nclinically appropriate for occupational therapy to be the first service \nprovided to the patient. Another factor to be considered is whether or \nnot it may be appropriate for an occupational therapist to conduct the \ninitial OASIS. I am hopeful that the prospective payment system \nimplemented by the Secretary will not restrict the ability of home \nhealth agencies to fully utilize the unique skills of covered \ntherapists.\n  Once again, Mr. President, I am pleased the Congress and President \nClinton have come together in reaching agreement on this legislation. \nIt is vital that these provisions become enacted this year; they will \nhelp many people across our country. I look forward to the President \nsigning this measure into law at the earliest possible date.\n  I also want to take this opportunity to thank the numerous \nindividuals across the great state of Utah who took the time to meet \nwith me here in Washington and in Utah over the past year regarding \nmany of the health provisions included in this bill. I value the input \nand expertise I received from health care providers and consumers in \nmay state, and especially from the elderly whose views have been \nparticularly helpful to me in the development of this legislation.\n  Seniors in Utah and across our country depend on Medicare. We must \nensure this program provides the highest quality of health care to \nbeneficiaries. Moreover, I am hopeful that in the next Congress, with \nthe leadership from President-elect Bush, we will be able to build on \ntoday's work and further improve the quality of services to \nbeneficiaries and, especially, provide for a new outpatient \nprescription drug benefit.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me say a few words about the Small \nBusiness Reauthorization Act of 2000 and the process to bring this \nlegislation to the floor as part of the Fiscal Year 2001 Omnibus \nAppropriations bill. First, however, I would like to thank Senate \nCommittee on Small Business Chairman Kit Bond, House Small Business \nCommittee Chairman Jim Talent, House Small Business Committee Ranking \nMember Nydia Velazquez, our staffs, Laura Ayoud with Senate Legislative \nCounsel and John Ratliff with the House Legislative Counsel's office \nfor their efforts on reauthorizing programs vital to America's small \nbusinesses. We have all worked long and hard to get to this point.\n  The Small Business Reauthorization Act of 2000, H.R. 5667, as \nincluded in the Fiscal Year 2001 Omnibus Appropriations bill, contains \na good portion of the conference report negotiated by the Senate and \nHouse Committees on Small Business. Despite the rough start, partisan \nwrangling over unrelated issues, broken deals and lengthy delays, I am \npleased that we can at last pass this legislation so critical to our \nnation's small businesses. Unfortunately, it is our small businesses \nthat have suffered the most in this climate of uncertainty, waiting, \nanticipating and hoping that the Congress would complete its work and \npass this reauthorization package.\n  While I am pleased that we have reached an agreement that will ensure \ncontinuation of valuable Small Business Administration (SBA) programs, \nI am greatly concerned with the breakdown in the legislative process \nthat has prevented what is normally a bi-partisan reauthorization bill \nfrom passing in a timely manner.\n  To briefly elaborate on this, when the original agreement between the \nSenate and the House was concluded, our bipartisan legislation was \ncommandeered by the Republican leadership and provisions dealing with \ntax cuts, assisted suicide and medicare give-backs to HMOs were added \nwithout my knowledge or consent. The President threatened to veto such \na package.\n  Additionally, a Wellstone provision agreed to during negotiations was \nremoved. The Wellstone provision would have created a 3 year $9 million \npilot project to build the capacity of community development venture \ncapital firms through research, training and management assistance. \nSenator Wellstone had already agreed to make this program a three year \npilot project and cut the funding down from $20 million over four \nyears. But the provision was removed from the Conference Report without \nconsulting either of us.\n  I am also disappointed that some provisions included in the Senate \npassed version of the Small Business Reauthorization Act, as well as in \nthe Administration's budget request, were not included in the final \nversion of this legislation. The original Senate version contained \nseveral provisions important to the Administration, Members of the \nSenate Small Business Committee and the Senate in general. In the \nspirit of compromise, the Senate agreed to drop several of these \nimportant provisions, with an understanding, in many cases, to revisit \nthese issues in the 107th Congress.\n  Chairman Bond agreed to remove his provision regarding the \n``Independent Office of Advocacy Act,'' which I cosponsored, and which \npassed the Senate as a separate bill. This Committee has heard on more \nthan one occasion that providing separate funding for the Office of \nAdvocacy is the best means to ensure its autonomy. I look forward to \nworking with the Chairman on this issue in the next Congress. A \nprovision requested by Senator Ted Stevens setting up a HUBZone pilot \nprogram in Alaska and a provision requested by Senator Dianne Feinstein \nto allow fruit and vegetable packing houses hit by the 1998 freeze to \nparticipate in the SBA's Disaster Loan program were removed as well. I \nhave assured Senator Feinstein that the Committee will look further \ninto this matter in the next Congress in an effort to allow the SBA to \nprovide relief if it is warranted.\n  A provision requested by the Administration and strongly supported by \nSenator Paul Wellstone and myself was also dropped. This provision \nwould have created a Native American Small Business Development Center \n(SBDC) Network that would have worked together with the traditional \nSBDC Network, but would have been separately funded. I have received \nassurances from both Chairman Bond and the House Committee on Small \nBusiness that this issue will be addressed in the next Congress, along \nwith concerns raised by Senator Inouye about the participation of \nNative Hawaiian Organizations in the 8(a) program. The Senate and House \nCommittees on Small Business are in agreement that this is an important \nissue for Native Americans, considered a disadvantaged group for the \npurposes of SBA programs, and one that needs greater focus.\n  Provisions regarding the Quadrennial Small Business Summit, the Small \nBusiness Advocacy Review Panel Technical Amendments Act, Development \nCompany Debenture Interest Rates, Fraud and False Statements and \nFinancial Institution Civil Penalties were also removed.\n  The final version of this legislation does include some of the \nprovisions I requested regarding improvements to the Microloan program. \nThe changes to the Microloan program stemmed from the President's \nFiscal Year 2001 budget request and had broad support in the Senate, as \nwell the support of several Members of the House Committee on Small \nBusiness. I have long been a firm believer in microloans and their \npower to help people gain economic independence while improving the \ncommunities in which they live. With a relatively small investment, the \nMicroloan program helps turn ideas into small businesses adding up to \nsel-sufficiency for many families and big returns for the taxpayers.\n  Changes to the program, which resulted from a roundtable Committee \nmeeting in the Senate and discussions with the Administration and users \nof the Microloan program, will be a great\n\n[[Page S11864]]\n\nboon to the effectiveness and availability of Microloans. Specifically, \nprovisions increasing the maximum loan amount from $25,000 to $35,000 \nand increasing the average loan size to $15,000 were included. However, \nchanges to make the program more effective, such as increasing the \nnumber of intermediaries or authorizing reimbursement for peer-to-peer \nmentoring, were weakened or removed because the House did not have time \nto hold hearings and study them thoroughly.\n  I believe all of the changes in the Senate bill make sense, have \nbroad bipartisan and bicameral support, and would go a long way toward \nproviding increased access to capital, especially for minority \nentrepreneurs. I want to make it clear to my colleagues who support the \nMicroloan program that I will continue my efforts to strengthen this \nprogram and will work with Chairman Bond and our House counterparts to \nmake these remaining improvements in the next Congress. I also intend \nto revisit the Microloan funding issue before the end of the three-year \nreauthorization period if the level authorized is inadequate to meet \nprogram needs.\n  While I am disappointed that some of the Senate changes were not \nincluded in the final compromise, this legislation is crucial for our \nnation's small businesses. It reauthorizes all of the SBA's programs, \nsetting the funding levels for the credit and business development \nprograms, and making selected improvements. Without this legislation, \nthe 504 loan program and the Small Business Innovation Research program \nwould shut down; the venture capital debenture program would shut down; \nand funding to the states for their small business development centers \nwould be in jeopardy.\n  The SBA's contribution is significant. In the past eight years, the \nSBA has helped almost 375,000 small businesses get more than $80 \nbillion in loans. That's double what small businesses had received in \nthe preceding 40 years since the agency's creation. The SBA is better \nrun than ever before, with four straight years of clean financial \naudits; it has a quarter less staff, but guarantees twice as many \nloans; and its credit and finance programs are a bargain. For a \nrelatively small investment, taxpayers are leveraging their money to \nhelp thousands of small businesses every year and fuel the economy.\n  Let me just give you one example. In the 7(a) program, taxpayers \nspend only $1.24 for every $100 loaned to small business owners. Well \nknown successes like Winnebago and Ben & Jerry's are clear examples of \nthe program's effectiveness.\n  Overall, I agree with the program levels in the three-year \nreauthorization bill. As I said during the Small Business Committee's \nhearing on SBA's budget earlier in the year, I believe the program \nlevels are realistic and appropriate based on the growing demand for \nthe programs and the prosperity of the country. I also think they are \nadequate should the economy slow down and lenders have less cash to \ninvest. Consistent with SBA's mission, in good times or bad, we need to \nmake sure that small businesses have access to credit and capital so \nthat our economy benefits from the services, products and jobs they \nprovide. As First Lady and Senator-elect Hillary Rodham Clinton says, \nwe don't want good ideas dying in the parking lot of banks. We also \nwant a safety net when our states are hit hard by a natural disaster. \nThere are many members of this Chamber, and their constituents, who \nknow all too well the value of SBA disaster loans after floods, fires \nand tornadoes.\n  Mr. President, I am extremely pleased that we included legislation to \nextend the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program for 8 more \nyears as part of this comprehensive SBA reauthorization bill. While I \nam very sorry the process has taken this long, in no way should that \nimply that there is not strong support for the SBIR program, the Small \nBusiness Administration, or our nation's innovative small businesses.\n  The SBIR program is of vital importance to the high-technology sector \nthroughout the country. For the past decade, growth in the high-\ntechnology field has been a major source of the resurgence of the \nAmerican economy we now enjoy. While many Americans know of the success \nof Microsoft, Oracle, and many of the dot.com companies, few realize \nthat it is America's small businesses, working in industries like \nsoftware, hardware, medical research, aerospace technologies, and bio-\ntechnology, that are helping to fuel this resurgence--and that it is \nthe SBIR program that makes much of this possible. By setting aside \nFederal research and development dollars specifically for small high-\ntech businesses, the SBIR program is making important contributions to \nour economy.\n  These companies have helped launch the space shuttle; conducted \nresearch on Hepatitis C; and made B-2 Bomber missions safer and more \neffective.\n  Since the start of the SBIR program in 1983, more than 17,600 firms \nhave received over $9.8 billion in SBIR funding agreements. In 1999 \nalone, nearly $1.1 billion was awarded to small high-tech firms through \nthe SBIR program, assisting more than 4,500 firms.\n  The SBIR program has been, and remains, an excellent example of how \ngovernment and small business can work together to advance the cause of \nboth science and our economy. Access to risk capital is vital to the \ngrowth of small high technology companies, which accounted for more \nthen 40 percent of all jobs in the high technology sector of our \neconomy in 1998. The SBIR program gives these companies access to \nFederal research and development money and encourages those who do the \nresearch to commercialize their results. Because research is crucial to \nensuring that our nation is the leader in knowledge-based industries, \nwhich will generate the largest job growth in the next century, the \nSBIR program is a good investment for the future.\n  I am proud of the many SBIR successes that have come from my state of \nMassachusetts. Companies like Advanced Magnetics of Cambridge, \nMassachusetts, illustrate that success. Advanced Magnetics used SBIR \nfunding to develop a drug making it easier for hospitals to find tumors \nin patients. The development of this drug increased company sales and \nallowed Advanced Magnetics to hire additional employees. This is \nexactly the kind of economic growth we need in this nation, because \njobs in the high-technology field pay well and raise everyone's \nstandard of living. That is why I am such a strong supporter and \nproponent of the SBIR program and fully support its reauthorization.\n  This legislation also includes my legislation establishing a New \nMarkets Venture Capital program at SBA. This small business legislation \nis designed to promote economic development, business investment, \nproductive wealth and stable jobs in ``new markets,'' low- and \nmoderate-income communities where there is little to no sustainable \neconomic activity but many overlooked business opportunities. The \nventure capital program is modeled after the Small Business \nAdministration's successful Small Business Investment Company program. \nThe SBIC program has been so successful that it has generated more than \n$19 billion in investments in more than 13,000 businesses since 1992.\n  With the passage of the ``New Markets'' legislation, low- and \nmoderate-income areas will have increased opportunities to join the \neconomic boom in America and this targeted venture capital will make a \npowerful difference in places like the inner-city areas of Boston's \nRoxbury or New York's East Harlem, and rural areas like Kentucky's \nAppalachia or the Mississippi's Delta region.\n  This legislation also contains H.R. 2614, which reauthorizes SBA's \n504 loan program, which passed the Senate on June 14, 2000. The bill \nand our improvements make common-sense changes to this critical \neconomic development tool. These changes will greatly increase the \nopportunity for small business owners to build a facility, buy more \nequipment, or acquire a new building. In turn, small business owners \nwill be able to expand their companies and hire new workers, ultimately \nresulting in an improved local economy.\n  Since 1980, over 25,000 businesses have received more than $20 \nbillion in fixed-asset financing through the 504 program. In my home \nstate of Massachusetts, over the last decade small businesses have \nreceived $318 million in 504 loans that created more than 10,000 jobs. \nThe stories behind those numbers say a lot about how SBA's 504 loans\n\n[[Page S11865]]\n\nhelp business owners and communities. For instance, in Fall River, \nMassachusetts, owners Patricia Ladino and Russell Young developed a \ncustom packing plant for scallops and shrimp that has grown from ten to \n30 employees in just two short years and is in the process of another \nexpansion that will add as many as 25 new jobs.\n  Under this reauthorization bill, the maximum debenture size for \nSection 504 loans has been increased from $750,000 to $1 million. For \nloans that meet special public policy goals, the maximum debenture size \nhas been increased from $1 million to $1.3 million. It has been a \ndecade since we increased the maximum guarantee amount. If we were to \nchange it to keep pace with inflation, the maximum guarantee would be \napproximately $1.25 million instead of $1 million. By not implementing \nsuch a sharp increase, we are striking a balance between rising costs \nand increasing the government's exposure.\n  I am pleased to say that this legislation also includes a provision \nassisting women-owned businesses, which I first introduced in 1998 as \npart of S. 2448, the Small Business Loan Enhancement Act. This \nprovision adds women-owned businesses to the current list of businesses \neligible for the larger public policy loans. As the role of women-owned \nbusinesses in our economy continues to increase, we would be remiss if \nwe did not encourage their growth and success by adding them to this \nlist.\n  Mr. President, the 504 loan program gets results. It expands the \nopportunities of small businesses, creates jobs and improves \ncommunities. It is crucial that it be reauthorized, I am pleased this \nlegislation has been included in this package.\n  Small Business Development Centers (SBDC) are also reauthorized under \nthis legislation. SBDCs serve tens of thousands of small business \nowners and prospective owners every year. This bill takes a giant step \nto retool the formula that determines how much funding each state \nreceives. This is an important program for all of our states and we \nwant no confusion about its funding. Without this change, some states \nwould have suffered sharp decreases in funding, disproportionate to \ntheir needs. I appreciate and am glad that the SBA and the Association \nof Small Business Development Centers worked with me to develop an \nacceptable formula so that small businesses continue to be adequately \nserved. As I said previously, I plan to revisit the Native American \nSBDC Network issue next Congress.\n  This legislation also reauthorized the National Women's Business \nCouncil. For such a tiny office, with minimal funding and staff, it has \nmanaged to make a significant contribution to our understanding of the \nimpact of women-owned businesses in our economy. It has also done \npioneer work in raising awareness of business practices that work \nagainst women-owned business, such as some in the area of Federal \nprocurement. Recently, the Council completed two studies that \ndocumented the world of Federal procurement and its impact on women-\nowned businesses.\n  According to the National Foundation for Women Business Owners, over \nthe past decade, the number of women-owned businesses in this country \nhas grown by 103 percent to an estimated 9.1 million firms. These firms \ngenerate almost $3.6 trillion in sales annually and employ more than \n27.5 million workers. With the impact of women-owned businesses on our \neconomy increasing at an unprecedented rate, Congress relies on the \nNational Women's Business Council to serve as its eyes and ears as it \nanticipates the needs of this burgeoning entrepreneurial sector. Since \nit was established in 1988, the bipartisan Council has provided \nimportant unbiased advice and counsel to Congress.\n  This Act recognizes the Council's work and re-authorizes it for three \nyears, from FY 2001 to 2003. It also increases the annual appropriation \nfrom $600,000 to $1 million, which will allow the council to support \nnew and ongoing research, and produce and distribute reports and \nrecommendations prepared by the Council.\n  The Historically Underutilized Business Zone, or ``HUBZone'' program, \nwhich passed this Committee in 1997, has tremendous potential to create \neconomic prosperity and development in those areas of our Nation that \nhave not seen great rewards, even in this time of unprecedented \neconomic health and stability. This program is similar to my New \nMarkets legislation in that it creates an incentive to hire from, and \nperform work in, areas of this country that need assistance the most. \nThis bill would authorize the HUBZone program at $10 million for the \nnext 3 years, which is $5 million above the Administration's request.\n  Additionally, this legislation includes very important provisions to \nallow those groups which were inadvertently missed when this \nlegislation was crafted--namely Indian tribal governments and Alaska \nNative Corporations--to participate in the program. I appreciate the \nwillingness of the Committee on Indian Affairs to work with our \nCommittee to create increased HUBZone opportunities for Native \nAmericans.\n  As I stated, the HUBZone section does not contain any provision \naddressing the interaction of the HUBZone and 8(a) minority contracting \nprograms. I believe that the 8(a) program is an important and necessary \ntool to help minority small businesses receive access to government \ncontracts. The Chairman and I agree that there is a need to enhance the \nparticipation of both 8(a) and HUBZone companies in Federal \nprocurement. It is my intention that the Senate Committee on Small \nBusiness consider the issue of enhancing small business procurement in \nthe next Congress.\n  This legislation also includes a provision relating to SBA's \ncosponsorship authority. This authority allows SBA and its programs to \ncosponsor events and activities with private sector entities, thus \nleveraging the Agency's limited resources. The legislation extends this \nauthority for three additional years.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by reminding my colleagues that all of \nour states benefit from the success and abundance of small businesses. \nThis legislation makes their jobs a little easier. I ask my colleagues \nfor their support of this important legislation.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, as we draw the 106th Congress to a \nclose, I wish only to take a moment to express my appreciation to \nSenator Stevens and others who concluded the negotiations on this final \nappropriations bill. They have worked under difficult circumstances, \nand I commend them for their accomplishment. I particularly acknowledge \nthe effort of the Senator Stevens. He is an outstanding chairman. He \nhas devoted months of effort to this bill at great personal sacrifice. \nHe is extremely capable and is always courteous and I express my \npersonal thanks to him for his good work.\n  I am particularly gratified that the Appropriations Committee found a \nway to fund a leadership development program for the Boys and Girls \nClubs of America. I have a long held interest in and concern for the \nyoung people of our Nation. The funding contained in this bill for a \nNational Training Center will assist this worldwide organization in its \nmission of serving youth. The Center will offer a full array of \nprograms, training, and research for participants from across the \nentire Nation. As a result, significant progress will be make toward \nthe goals of promoting citizenship, leadership, and character \ndevelopment; the prevention of drug and alcohol abuse; and similar \ninitiatives. On behalf of the youth of this Nation, I again express my \nappreciation for the Congress supporting this measure.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to speak to \nthe Commerce-Justice-State appropriations legislation that is contained \nin this bill. Unfortunately, I've got some good news and some bad news. \nThe good news is that this bill recognizes the need to dedicate more \nresources to foreign policy needs; the bad news is that the bill fails \nto contain funding for three important programs in the Justice portion \nof this legislation.\n  The State Department does important work--protecting our citizens and \npursuing our foreign policy objectives--in some of the most dangerous \nand difficult places in the world. Unlike the U.S. military, State \nDepartment employees go into areas of conflict unarmed, and generally \nunprotected. We have State Department officials in Sierra Leone, in \nSyria, in Lebanon and Liberia, and throughout the war-torn corners of \nthe former Yugoslavia.\n\n[[Page S11866]]\n\n  That is why I am particularly pleased to see that funding for embassy \nsecurity in the Commerce-Justice-State bill is at the levels requested \nby the Administration. I strongly support full funding of two critical \naccounts--embassy security and maintenance, and embassy security \nequipment and personnel--in the legislation to authorize State \nDepartment activities which was initiated by the Committee on Foreign \nRelations last year.\n  Failure to fully fund the State Department's security account would \nhave had a devastating effect on the safety of the Americans who serve \nus overseas, both in the number of security agents who protect them \nagainst terrorist threats and construction of new, safe embassies. \nFortunately both these security programs will be well-funded. I regret, \nhowever, that agreement was not reached to fund a new Center for Anti-\nterrorism and Security Training. I hope we can give this careful \nconsideration next year.\n  In addition, after many years of decline, funding for the State \nDepartment's most basic needs--including salaries and administrative \nexpenses--has been increased. The final funding for this account \nexceeds the Administration's original request by $65 million, which \nshould help offset the many reductions in the State Department budget \nduring the 1990s.\n  As the Secretary of State has said numerous times, diplomats are our \nfirst line of defense. Just as we are concerned about military \nreadiness, so we must be attentive to diplomatic readiness overseas. We \nneed to do as much as we can--and in my opinion, this funding goes only \npart way--to ensure that we retain the best and the brightest in our \nForeign Service.\n  I am pleased that the amount of money dedicated to United Nations \nPeacekeeping operations exceeds the Administration's original request. \nThe final figure is based on more recent calculations of the U.S. dues \nto the United Nations and will allow us to help fund these important \nmissions, thereby alleviating suffering and improving stability around \nthe world.\n  I understand the frustration that many of my colleagues feel toward \nthe United Nations. Earlier this week, I visited the UN. I want to \nassure my colleagues that reform is happening. Ambassador Holbrooke has \nkept his commitment, made to the Committee on Foreign Relations during \nhis confirmation hearings, that reform will be his ``highest sustained \npriority.'' He and his team in New York continue to push effectively \nfor needed reforms in the areas of peacekeeping and general operations. \nThe recommendations made by the Brahimi panel, in particular, will \nresult in better focused, trained and equipped peacekeeping missions--\nchanges I believe that we all agree are needed.\n  I wish that I could be as positive about the Justice Department \nportion of the bill, but I cannot. I am disheartened that the \nlegislation does not contain three crucial provisions--reauthorization \nof the COPS program, the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund, and full \nfunding for the Violence Against Women Act.\n  Although we have 49 co-sponsors from both sides of the aisle and \nletters of support from every major law enforcement organization, a few \npowerful members on the other side have refused to allow a vote on the \ncontinuation of the COPS program.\n  In 1994, we set a goal of funding 100,000 police officers by the year \n2000. We met that goal months ahead of schedule. As of today, there \nhave been 109,000 officers funded and 68,100 officers deployed to the \nstreets.\n  Because of COPS, the concept of community policing has become law \nenforcement's principal weapon in fighting crime. Community policing \nhas redefined the relationship between law enforcement and the public. \nBut, more importantly, it has reduced crime. And that is what we \nattempted to do.\n  All across the country, from Wilmington to Washington--from \nConnecticut to California, we are seeing a dramatic decline in crime. \nJust a few weeks ago, the FBI released its annual crime statistics \nwhich showed that once again, for the eighth year in a row, crime is \ndown. In fact, crime was down 7 percent from last year and 16 percent \nsince 1995. But we can't become complacent. We have to continue to help \nstate and local law enforcement by putting more cops on the street. \nMark my words, the day we become complacent is the day that crime rates \ngo up again. And refusing to even allow a vote on this bill is even \nworse than complacency--it is irresponsible.\n  And I will say again that I firmly believe that reauthorization of \nthe Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund is the single most significant \nthing that we can do to continue the war on crime.\n  Since the Fund was established in the 1994 Crime Act, Congress has \nappropriated monies from the fund for programs including the Local Law \nEnforcement Block Grant Program and numerous programs contained in the \nViolence Against Women Act. The money has gone to hire more cops and it \nhas brought unprecedented resources to defending our southwest border. \nIt has funded runaway youth prevention programs and numerous innovative \ncrime prevention programs. And there are many more.\n\n  The results of these efforts have taken hold. Crime is down--way \ndown. And we didn't add 1 cent to the deficit or the debt.\n  This was the single most important paragraph in the 1994 Crime bill \nbecause no one can touch this money for any other purpose. It can't be \nspent on anything else but crime reduction. It is the one place where \nno one can compete. It is set aside. It is a savings account to fight \ncrime.\n  This fund works. It ensures that the crime reduction programs that we \npass will be funded. It ensures that the crime rate will continue to go \ndown instead of up. It ensures that our kids will have a place to go \nafter school instead of hanging out on the street corners. It ensures \nthat violent crimes against women get the individualized attention that \nthey need and deserve. It gives States money to hire more cops and get \nbetter technology.\n  This bill also is unsatisfactory because it leaves the landmark \nViolence Against Women Act underfunded, seriously jeopardizing the \ntremendous strides we have made in every State across this country to \nreduce domestic violence and sexual assault against women. Congress \noriginally approved this legislation in 1994 and then reauthorized it \nunanimously this past October. In the bill before us, however, Congress \nfails to live up to its commitment to women and children who are the \nvictims of domestic violence and sexual assault by not appropriating \nthe necessary funds authorized in the Violence Against Women Act of \n2000.\n  Reauthorization of the COPS program, the Trust Fund, and full funding \nfor the Violence Against Women Act should have been a part of this \npackage, and I'm disappointed that some on the other side have decided \nto put politics ahead of the people.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, today I am proud to add my voice in support \nof the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000. This legislation \nrepresents the end product of work that began in S. 2697, which Senator \nLugar and I introduced on June 8. The Commodity Futures Modernization \nAct of 2000 completes the work of last year's financial services \nmodernization law, bringing our financial regulation in line with the \nrapid pace of developments in the global marketplace. The Commodity \nFutures Modernization Act of 2000 will now allow new and important \nfinancial products--single stock futures--to be sold in America. It \nprotects financial institutions from over-regulation, and provides \nlegal certainty for the $60 trillion market in swaps.\n  Significant portions of this legislation, particularly in Titles II, \nIII and IV of the Act, concern issues within the jurisdiction of the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Title II establishes the authority and framework for the offering of \nsingle stock futures, removing the ban embodied in the so-called Shad-\nJohnson Accord. I would like to take this opportunity to echo the views \nexpressed by my colleague, Congressman Bliley, Chairman of the \nCommittee on Commerce of the House of Representatives, at the time of \nHouse adoption of this bill. It is my understanding that nothing in \nTitle II of H.R. 5660 would (i) authorize any bank or similar \ninstitution to engage in any activity or transaction, or hold any \nasset, that the institution is not authorized to engage in or hold \nunder its chartering or authorizing statute; (ii) authorize depository\n\n[[Page S11867]]\n\ninstitutions either to take delivery of equity securities under a \nsingle stock future or under any other circumstance, or otherwise to \ninvest in any equity security otherwise prohibited for depository \ninstitutions; or (iii) allow a depository institution to use single \nstock futures to circumvent restrictions in the law on ownership of \nequity securities under its chartering or authorizing statute.\n  Under Title III of the bill, the SEC is granted new authority to \nundertake certain enforcement actions in connection with security-based \nswap agreements. It is important to emphasize that nothing in the title \nshould be read to imply that swap agreements are either securities or \nfutures contracts. To emphasize that point, the definition of a ``swap \nagreement'' is placed in a neutral statute, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, \nthat is, legislation that is not specifically part of a banking, \nsecurities, or commodities law. However, drawing upon the SEC's \nenforcement experience, the SEC is permitted, on a case-by-case basis, \nwith respect to security-based swap agreements (as defined in the \nlegislation) to take action against fraud, manipulation, and insider \ntrading abuses.\n  Title III makes it clear that the SEC is not to impose regulations on \nsuch instruments as prophylactic measures. Banks are already heavily \nregulated institutions. Further regulatory burden, rather than \ndiscouraging wrongdoing, would be more likely to discourage development \nand innovation, during business overseas instead. The SEC is directed \nto focus on the wrong doers rather than provide new paperwork burden \nand regulatory costs on the law abiding investors and financial \nservices providers. For example, the SEC is directed not to require the \nregistration of security-based swap agreements. If a registration \nstatement is submitted to the SEC and accepted by the SEC, the agency \nis required promptly to notify the registrant of the error, and the \nregistration statement will be null and void.\n  Insider trading provisions of the Securities Exchange Act will be \napplied to single stock futures transactions as well.\n  Title IV of the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 contains \nthe Legal Certainty for Bank Products Act of 2000. This title is a free \nstanding provision of law, part of neither the banking statutes not the \ncommodities statutes. The provisions of this title clarify the \njurisdictional line between the regulation of banking products and \nfutures products.\n  Under section 403 of Title IV, no provision of the Commodity Exchange \nAct (CEA) may apply to, and the CFTC is prohibited from exercising \nregulatory authority with respect to, an ``identified banking product'' \nif: (1) an appropriate banking agency certifies that the product has \nbeen commonly offered, entered into, or provided in the United States \nby any bank on or before December 5, 2000, and (2) the product was not \nprohibited by the CEA and was not in fact regulated by the CFTC as a \ncontract of sale of a commodity for future delivery (or an option on \nsuch a contract or on a commodity) on or before December 5, 2000. This \nprovision is intended to provide legal certainty for existing banking \nproducts so that they can continue to be offered, entered into, or \nprovided by banks without being subject to CFTC regulation.\n  An existing banking product is one that is certified by the \nappropriate banking regulator as being a product is ``commonly'' \noffered, entered into, or provided, on or before December 5, 2000, in \nthe U.S. by any bank. To rely upon that test a particular bank would \nnot need to have certified that the particular bank had offered the \nproduct. The certification would apply if it or any other bank had \noffered such a product on or before December 5, 2000. The term \n``commonly offered'' means, in effect, that the product was not \nobscure, or offered only briefly. It is not to be construed to mean \nthat the product must be of a type that is appropriate or suitable for \nany and all users, since many common bank products are tailored for \nspecific customers, small business loans or low cost checking accounts \nfor seniors being two such examples.\n\n  New banking products not excluded from the CFTC's jurisdiction under \nTitle IV will be, if indexed to a commodity, subject to a test to \ndetermine whether they are predominantly banking products, in which \ncase, the CFTC is precluded from exercising regulatory authority over \nthem. The predominance test is a self test. Banks themselves may apply \nthe factors of the predominance test with respect to the development of \nnew products, without making prior application to any regulator. The \npredominance test as contained in the law is intended to replace \nregulatory provisions under the Commodity Exchange Act concerning the \napplication of a predominance test with respect to hybrid instruments.\n  Under the predominance test, a hybrid instrument will be considered \nto be predominantly a banking product if (1) the issuer of the \ninstrument receives payment in full of the purchase price of the \ninstrument substantially contemporaneously with its delivery, (2) the \npurchaser or holder of the hybrid is not required to make any payment \nto the issuer in addition to the purchase price during the life of the \ninstrument or at maturity, (3) the issuer is not subject to mark-to-\nmarket margining requirements, and (4) the hybrid is not marketed as a \ncontract of sale of a commodity for future delivery or an option \nsubject to the CEA.\n  If a bank, having applied the predominance test to a new product, \ndetermines that the product is predominantly a banking product not \nsubject to CFTC regulation, and the CFTC later challenges the bank's \nconclusion, the CFTC is still prohibited from exercising regulatory \nauthority over the product unless the Commission obtains the \nconcurrence of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board \n(Board). If the Board does not concur in the CFTC's decision, the Board \nmay submit the controversy for determination by the United States Court \nof Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n  The CFTC is expected to be circumspect in applying the predominance \ntest. For example, it does not necessarily follow that a hybrid \ninstrument not satisfying the predominance test is inevitably a futures \ncontract subject to CFTC regulation. The CFTC must not interpret normal \nor traditional banking practices and activities, or prudent actions \ntaken by a bank to maintain safety and soundness, to be hybrid \ninstruments that the CFTC may regulate. For example, a loan made by a \nbank is an identified banking product under section 206(a)(3) of the \nGramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Some may argue that a new loan product offered \nafter December 5, 2000, may be interpreted to be covered by the \ndefinition of a hybrid instrument if it has one or payments indexed to \nthe value of, or provides for the delivery of, one or more commodities. \nHowever, there would be little justification for the CFTC to construe \nthe pledging of a commodity as collateral for a loan, or that providing \nthat a commodity may be offered as part or full satisfaction of a loan, \nto be representative of a futures contract over which the CFTC may \nexert jurisdiction. No such result is contemplated under this \nlegislation.\n  Moreover, the fact that a loan may be renegotiated or sold, or that a \nloan or other identified banking product may not be held until \nmaturity, is not a violation of the predominance test. These are merely \nexamples of the reasonable interpretations that the CFTC must adhere to \nwhen it applies the predominance test for purposes of the statute.\n  The Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 excludes from its \ncoverage agreements, contracts or transactions in an excluded commodity \nentered into on an electronic trading facility provided that such \nagreements, contracts or transactions are entered into only by eligible \ncontract participants on a principal-to-principal basis trading for \ntheir own accounts. In some cases, a party may enter into an agreement, \ncontact or transaction on an electronic trading facility that mirrors \nanother agreement, contract or transaction entered into at about the \nsame time with a customer. The risk of one transaction may be largely \nor completely offset by the other; and that may be the purpose for \nentering into both transactions. But the party entering into both \ntransactions remains liable to each of its counterparties throughout \nthe life of the transaction. That party is similarly exposed to the \ncredit risk of each of its counterparties. The fact that a party\n\n[[Page S11868]]\n\nhas entered into back-to-back transactions as described above does not \nalter the principal-to-principal nature of each of the transactions and \nmust not be construed to affect the eligibility of either transaction \nfor the electronic trading facility exclusion.\n  Mr. President, enactment of the Commodity Futures Modernization Act \nof 2000 will be noted as a major achievement by the 106th Congress. \nTaken together with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the work of this \nCongress will be seen as a watershed, where we turned away from the \noutmoded, Depression-era approach to financial regulation and adopted a \nframework that will position our financial services industries to be \nworld leaders into the new century.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join in commending the Democratic and \nRepublican leaders for reaching this bipartisan agreement to give \nearly, full and fair consideration to the Amtrak bond proposal in the \nnext Congress.\n  The legislation is needed to ensure that Amtrak has the resources to \nmaintain passenger rail service across the country.\n  This funding will undoubtedly strengthen train service in the \nNortheast Corridor. But this financing package can do much more to \nprovide similar service to communities throughout the country. It will \nprovide the financial stability that Amtrak needs to plan adequately \nfor the future.\n  With the increasing congestion and delays we're seeing at major \nairports across the country, we need other options for transportation \nin the 21st century.\n  I look forward to the enactment of this important legislation early \nin the next Congress, so that passenger rail service will continue to \nbe a key component of our transportation network.\n  Amtrak helps states meet clean air requirements by giving people a \nviable alternative to driving and flying. It's more energy efficient, \nwhich is particularly important for the New England region.\n  For many business commuters and vacationers, it's a more appealing \nway to travel. And for many workers, it's their chosen profession to \nwhich they've devoted years of their lives, and their families depend \non it to pay the bills.\n  As a nation, we need a firm commitment to support passenger rail \nservice, just as we do for highways and airports.\n  So again, I commend the leaders for the commitments made today for a \nfinancing plan to strengthen passenger rail service in the United \nStates.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate-House \nconferees have adopted an amendment I sponsored to inform Congress and \nour citizens about potential violations of their privacy on Federal \nagency Web sites. The public has a right to know whether the Federal \nGovernment is respecting personal privacy. This amendment would require \nall Inspectors General to report to Congress within 60 days on how each \ndepartment or agency collects and reviews personal information on its \nweb site. The amendment is based on similar language offered by \nCongressman Jay Inslee in the House that would have applied exclusively \nto the agencies funded by the Treasury-Postal Appropriations bill. Our \nfinal language was adopted by the Senate-House conferees in the bill \nproviding appropriations for the Legislative Branch and Treasury-Postal \nAppropriations Act, and it was included in the Omnibus Appropriations \nAct.\n  The Internet has brought great benefits to our society, but \nunderstandably, the public is becoming more and more concerned about \nthe way personal information is collected and handled on the Internet. \nThe Federal Government should set an example for how personal privacy \nis handled in cyberspace. But unfortunately, concerns have been raised \nthat some Federal agencies may be engaging in information-gathering \npractices that could only further deepen the public's distrust of \ngovernment. We need to find out whether these concerns are real, and if \nthey are, we need to decide what do about it.\n  Although the Clinton Administration established a privacy policy in \nJune 1999 to guide the agencies, it is not clear whether the policy did \nmuch to protect privacy. In particular, the policy seemed to condone \nagencies' use of ``cookies''--small bits of software placed on web \nusers' hard drives to collect personal information. The policy stated, \n``In the course of operating a web site, certain information may be \ncollected automatically in logs or by cookies.'' It also stated that \n``some agencies may be able to collect a great deal of information,'' \nbut went on to state that some agencies might make a policy decision to \nlimit the information collected. Under the Paperwork Reduction Act, OMB \nis supposed to direct the agencies on privacy policy, but OMB's \noriginal privacy guidance seemed to give the agencies free rein to \ndecide their own privacy policy for themselves. But OMB's original \nguidance did require the agencies to post privacy policies making clear \nwhether they were collecting information.\n  Earlier this year, it was revealed that the White House Office of \nNational Drug Control Policy had contracted with a private company to \nuse cookies to track users of the ONDCP web site. ONDCP failed to warn \nthe public about this practice in its privacy policy.\n  When the press reported ONDCP's practices, there was a swift and \nsharp public outcry. The White House's Office of Management and Budget \nquickly shifted into damaged control mode and issued a June 22 \nmemorandum reversing its previous guidance and creating a presumption \nagainst the use of cookies on Federal web sites. However, more recently \nGAO reported to me that a number of agencies continued to use cookies, \nand it was not clear how these cookies were being used. This whole \nepisode raises questions about the Federal Government's commitment to \ncitizens' privacy. It also could undermine citizens' trust in \ngovernment Web site.\n  I am not suggesting that cookies are inherently bad devices under all \ncircumstances. Cookies can perform beneficial tasks on the Internet, \nsuch as counting the number of visitors to a site, assessing the \npopularity of certain Web pages, and briefly storing information \nalready entered into to a form so that users don't have to enter the \nsame information multiple times. At the same time, cookies can be used \nto identify specific computers and track a user's actions all over the \nInternet. The real questions I have are, ``What are cookies on Federal \nagency web sites being used for, and what are the information-gathering \npractices of the agencies?'' Right now, I don't know. And the American \npeople don't know.\n  I have asked GAO to investigate which agencies are using cookies, how \nthey are using them, and whether the practice violates the law and \nAdministration policy. The amendment I have sponsored will provide \nfurther information from the Inspectors General on how agencies collect \nand use personal information. The language is based on a similar \namendment that was offered to the House Treasury-Postal bill by \nDemocratic Congressman Jay Inslee. I want to thank Congressman Inslee \nfor working in a bipartisan way to protect citizens' personal privacy.\n  Mr. President, the American people have a right to know what \ninformation is being collected about them on Federal Web sites. This \namendment would ensure that we know agencies' data collection practices \nso that we in Congress can make sure that privacy rights of citizens \nare not being violated.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we are finally at the finish line at the \nend of a legislative triathalon. It's been a long, difficult road, but \nwe've finally come up with a health and education appropriations bill \nfor this fiscal year. It truly was a test of endurance. Not only can we \ntake pride in having survived the experience, but, even more \nimportantly, we've produced a bipartisan agreement that is a victory \nfor the health and education of our nation.\n  This agreement is not only a model for giving our nation the building \nblocks we need for a strong and secure future. It is a model of how \nDemocrats and Republicans can work together across party lines to do \nwhat is the best interest of the American people.\n  Believe me, it hasn't been easy. Before the election, Senator \nStevens, Senate Byrd, Senator Specter, and I, along with Congressmen \nBill Young, Dave Obey, and John Porter worked for months to craft a \nsolid bipartisan agreement. At times the negotiations got heated, but \nboth sides hung in there, and in the end we came up with a good \ncompromise.\n\n[[Page S11869]]\n\n  That bipartisan agreement would have passed overwhelmingly in both \nthe House and the Senate--which is why we were all just baffled when, \nless than 12 hours after we had signed our names to the bill, a tiny \nfaction of the House Republican leadership decided to kill it.\n  As a result, some reductions had to be made, some of which were very \ndisappointing. I hope that in the next Congress, a spirit of \ncooperation and civility will prevail and prevent these sort of last-\nminute, partisan maneuvers.\n  That being said, I believe that the version of our bill that we have \nhere today is a very, very good one. It maintains most of our hard \nfought gains and provides critical investments to improve health care, \neducation, and labor conditions for all Americans.\n  I want to extend my sincere thanks and commendation to my long-time \npartner, Senator Arlen Specter and his staff. We have had a great \nbipartisan partnership on this bill for a decade. Year after year, \nSenator Specter has done yeoman's work, and it is a pleasure to work \nwith him. This is always a difficult bill to maneuver and this year may \nhave been our toughest.\n  I also want thank and commend our chairman, Senator Stevens, and \nranking member Senator Byrd for their great work. This bill would not \nbe possible without their outstanding and steadfast efforts.\n  Finally, I want to thank our colleagues on the House side, \nCongressman Obey, Congressman Porter, and Chairman Bill Young. I \nespecially want to commend Congressman Porter who is retiring this \nyear.\n  Here are some of the reasons why I urge all of my colleagues to \nsupport this important bipartisan agreement.\n  Education funding: $1.6 billion to lower class sizes, up from $1.3 \nbillion last year; $900 million to repair and modernize crumbling \nschools: should result in over $5 billion in school repairs, based on \nsuccessful Iowa model; and increase to $3,750 for the maximum Pell \ngrant--that's a record increase in the grants to make college more \naffordable; and $6.2 billion for Head Start: that's a $933 million \nincrease from last year which will allow thousands of additional \nchildren to be served.\n  Afterschool care: $850 million for after school care: nearly 50 \npercent increase.\n  Home heating: $1.4 billion for LIHEAP to help low-income Americans \nheat their homes this winter: a $300 million increase.\n  Health care: $20.3 billion for NIH funding: $2.5 billion increase, \nthe largest increase ever; thousands of new research projects on \nAlzheimer's, cancer, childhood diabetes, HIV, Parkinson's disease, \ncerebral palsy, and others; $125 million for new program to assist \nfamily caregivers struggling to keep elderly loved ones in their \nhomes--provide respite and other needed services.\n  I am also especially excited about the funding in this bill for the \nMedical Errors Reduction Act of 2000 which Senator Specter and I \nintroduced. Medical errors are estimated to be the 5th leading cause of \ndeath in this country. In fact, more people die from medical errors \neach year than from motor vehicles accidents (43,458), breast cancer \n(42,297), or AIDS (16,516). Our bill gives grants to states to \nestablish reporting systems designed to reduce medical errors. It also \ncalls for better research, training and public information on the issue \nof medical errors.\n  I'm also very proud of the funding in this bill for numerous programs \nthat will give people with disabilities a real choice to live in their \nown communities near their families and friends. Most notably, this \nbill includes $50 million for systems change grants to help states \nreform their long-term care systems and make it easier for people with \ndisabilities and the elderly to live at home.\n  This is just the beginning of our work to help states meet their so-\ncalled Olmstead obligation to provide services and supports to people \nwith disabilities in the most integrated settings appropriate and \nfeasible. This year is the 10th anniversary of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, and these provisions are a great way to implement the \nADA's ideals of independence and justice for all.\n  Finally, I would like to mention how pleased I am with the FAIR Act--\nthe Medicare Fairness in Reimbursement Act--that is attached to the \nLHHS Appropriations Bill, I, Senator Thomas, and several other Members \nof Congress introduced this bipartisan bill to provide Medicare \nproviders relief from the excessive payment reductions resulting from \nthe 1997 Balanced Budget Act. This bill will allow approximately 30 \nstates, including Iowa, to benefit from fairer Medicare payments to \nstates below the national average.\n  This bill allots approximately $35 billion over 5 years for \nreimbursement improvements to hospitals, home health agencies, nursing \nfacilities, rural health providers and Medicare managed care. It will \nhelp our struggling rural hospitals, nursing facilities and home health \nagencies continue to provide quality care to seniors in Iowa and across \nthe nation.\n  The bill will also help to improve enrollment rates for families and \nchildren in Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program.\n  While I'm disappointed that our original LHHS Appropriations \ncompromise was derailed, this bill is still a major step forward. It \nprovides important investments in the health, education and \nproductivity of all Americans.\n  This bill would not have been possible without the tireless, often \nheroic work of my staff. They's worked late nights and long weekends, \nand I am incredibly grateful for their expertise and excellent advice. \nI would especially like to thank Ellen Murray, Lisa Bernhardt, Peter \nReinecke, Katie Corrigan, Sabrina Corlette, and Bev Schroeder for their \noutstanding work.\n  In passing this bill, I am hopeful that we will move beyond the \npartisan bickering that stalled our negotiations for so long.\n  With this year's elections, the American people sent us a strong \nmessage. They gave us one of the closest Presidential elections in \nhistory along with an evenly divided Senate and a closely divided \nHouse.\n  Clearly, they are tired of the bickering and bitterness that have \ncharacterized our politics, and they want us to bridge our differences \nand work together for their best interests. It is now time for us to \ncome together and heed their call.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the passage of the \nFY 2001 Omnibus Appropriations bill. Had I been given the opportunity \nto cast a recorded vote on this legislation, I would have voted ``no.''\n  There were a lot of things slipped in without prior authorization for \nthe spending. I hope in the next Congress we can work with a new \nadministration to clean up the process. Projects should go through a \nseparate authorization process. All Members should have the same \nopportunity to review the projects in the bill and the public should \nknow what is being funded. There are a number of us who would also like \nto see biennial budgeting so we have a chance to really evaluate how \ntaxpayer money is being used.\n  We didn't even have a final funding total available to us before the \nvote. I know funding for labor and health and other related areas \nincreased dramatically in this deal to nearly $13 billion more than \nlast year's levels. These significant funding levels are not a one-time \nactivity in the Congress--it has become an annual ritual. It's just too \nmuch. This is money that should be going to pay off the national debt. \nWe must break the pattern of spending our children's future.\n  Some increases in the overall spending package were needed, including \nmore support for education and nearly $36 billion in Medicare payments \nto healthcare providers. Wyoming rural hospitals and nursing homes will \nbenefit from this effort. There are some very good things in this bill, \nbut looking at the whole picture, the bad outweighed the good.\n  I am also very displeased that budget negotiators left out of the \npackage a previously passed amendment which would have prevented the \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) from going forward \nwith a massive new repetitive stress injury rule. The ergonomics rule \ncould leave injured workers' compensation systems in ruin, close \nnursing homes and overshadow existing safety needs. The Senate and \nHouse agreed by a bipartisan vote on identical language that would \nrequire OSHA to slow its furious rush.\n\n[[Page S11870]]\n\nThe amendment would give the agency time to go back and fix the \nterrible flaws with this rule that have been brought to light. This new \nregulation will affect the whole of workplaces in America. It carries \nserious consequences. I am most displeased that this rule will be \nfinalized and I will work with my colleagues to overturn it.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Although I am unable to vote for or against the omnibus \nlegislation before the Senate today, I would like to comment on the \nprocess that brought us here. In an effort to improve the economy of my \nstate and to facilitate trade between America and its East Asian \ntrading partners, I have led a trade mission of Montanans to East Asia \nfor the last several days, meeting with trade officials in Japan, China \nand Korea.\n  Mr. President, I am extremely concerned about the process that has \nbrought about this omnibus bill's passage. It is unfortunate that the \nSenate finds itself in virtually the same position as it did the last \ntwo years with appropriations matters. As my colleagues will recall, in \n1998 we voted on a giant omnibus appropriations bill which contained \neight appropriations bills, plus numerous other authorizing \nlegislation. It ran on for nearly 4,000 pages and was called a \n``gargantuan monstrosity'' by the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia, Senator Byrd.\n  Unfortunately, we did not learn our lesson in 1998. Last year \nCongress wrapped Medicare provider payments into appropriations for \nCommerce-State-Justice, Foreign Operations Appropriations, Interior and \nLabor-HHS, again passing it in omnibus fashion without time for \nsenators to read through the bill and raise concerns about its \ncontents.\n  I voted against the 1998 and 1999 omnibus bills, not because they did \nnot contain good provisions for the country and my State of Montana. \nThey did. I opposed these bills because I believed--as I do now--that \nwriting such legislation behind closed doors among a small group of \npeople dangerously disenfranchises most senators, House members, and \nthe American people.\n  And here we are again, passing Labor-HHS along with Treasury-Postal \nand Legislative Appropriations--all in one bill, with the input of very \nfew members of Congress. Despite statements in 1998 and 1999 that such \na process would not happen again, we find ourselves in the same \nposition as the last two years. Mr. President, we already face a \npopulation that is increasingly cynical of government and those who \nserve it, and the wrangling over the presidential election that just \nended has not helped matters. People believe more and more that \ngovernment does not look after their interests, but only after special \ninterests. And the more we operate behind closed doors, without an \nopen, public process, the more we feed that cynicism. That is not \nhealthy for our democracy or our people, and it's why I cannot support \nthis omnibus bill.\n  That said, Mr. President, there is good news for Montana health care \nin this bill, provisions that I have fought for all year. In \nparticular, I want to reiterate my support for year-long efforts to \nrestore funding to health care providers negatively impacted by the \nBalanced Budget Act, BBA, of 1997.\n  When the BBA was passed in 1997, it was heralded as landmark \nlegislation to extend the life of Medicare's trust fund and impose some \nmuch-needed fiscal discipline on the program. Indeed, just eight years \nago, estimates indicated that Medicare's hospital trust fund would run \ndry in 1999. But a strong economy and reductions in payments to \nMedicare providers through the BBA have extended the life of the Part A \nTrust Fund for probably a couple of decades. Unfortunately, access to \nquality health care may have been compromised in the process.\n  For example, the BBA included new prospective payment systems for \nMedicare providers of hospital, skilled nursing and home health care. \nWhile these payment systems are intended to introduce efficiency to \nMedicare and ultimately increase the quality and availability of \npatient care, in some cases they may not make sense. I am concerned \nthat PPSs may be ill-applied in the case of small, rural facilities, \nwhich do not have the patient volume to survive under a system of flat-\nrate payments.\n  Consider home health care, for example. As costs for this important \nbenefit spiraled out of control, and as reports circulated of fly-by-\nnight home care agencies defrauding the government and harming \npatients, Congress passed a home health prospective payment system as \npart of the BBA. Payments were reduced drastically. While these cuts \nwere justified in regions of the US with too many home care providers, \nthey also took effect where there was not a redundancy of agencies. Now \nthere are some Montana counties lacking home care providers altogether. \nMontana has lost seven home health agencies, and there are currently \nthree counties in my state with no home care provider at all. Together \nthese three counties--Rosebud, Treasure and Big Horn--have an area over \n23,000 square miles, an area nearly the size of West Virginia.\n  I believe BBA changes have gone too far in the area of hospital care \nas well. Last year I pushed legislation to spare small rural hospitals \ndrastic cuts in Medicare reimbursement to their outpatient departments \nby exempting them from the negative impacts of the outpatient \nprospective payment system. Based on estimates from the Health Care \nFinancing Administration, the effects of the outpatient PPS would have \nbeen devastating on small Montana hospitals. Madison Valley Hospital in \nEnnis, Montana, for example, would have lost an estimated 62 percent of \nits outpatient Medicare payments without an exemption from the \noutpatient PPS; Liberty County Hospital in Chester would have lost over \n50 percent.\n  I was pleased that Congress acted to prevent cuts to these outpatient \nfacilities last year, through passage of the Balanced Budget Refinement \nAct of 1999, BBRA, legislation restoring $16 billion in Medicare and \nMedicaid payments over a five-year period.\n  This year's budget bill has significant BBA relief as well. Although \nI believe too much of the funding is directed toward Medicare+Choice \nplans, there is significant help in the package for the well-being of \nMontana health care and Medicare in general. These provisions include \nincreased reimbursement for telemedicine; special payments for rural \nhome care agencies and rural disproportionate hospitals; correction of \na mistake affecting Critical Access Hospitals' outpatient lab \nfacilities; relief for community health centers and rural health \nclinics; and redistribution of unspent funding from the State \nChildren's Health Program, SCHIP. In short, I am pleased that BBA \nrelief is set for passage, and I commend the Administration and my \ncolleagues for setting aside politics to get this bill done.\n  I would also like to make a couple of comments about the tax \nlegislation in this omnibus bill. In this area too, I object not so \nmuch to what is in this bill as I do to what is not. The tax title of \nthe bill includes a number of provisions to encourage economic \ndevelopment in distressed communities, the so-called Community Renewal \nand New Markets provisions. I support these provisions because I \nbelieve they can help spur economic development in many areas in the \ncountry, including in my own home State of Montana. I also support the \nlanguage that allows Indian tribes to be treated like state and local \ngovernments in their payment of Federal unemployment taxes.\n  However, in this closed process of negotiation by the few, several \ngood ideas that were in the Senate version of the Community Renewal \nbill somehow never made it into this conference report. There is not \none single dollar in this bill to help Americans save for their \nretirement, which is a high priority of mine because I believe our \ncountry needs to begin preparing for the wave of baby boom retirements. \nThe Senate bill included a wide-ranging farm package that is very \nimportant for rural areas that you won't see in this bill. It also \nincluded environmental and energy incentives that were designed to help \nus plan for the future. The loss of these provisions will become much \nmore noticeable as our land and energy needs keep growing.\n  The bottom line is that there is a reason that tax items should not \nbe included in an appropriations omnibus bill at the last minute, \nparticularly when the tax-writing committees are left out of the \nprocess of writing the\n\n[[Page S11871]]\n\nbill. That is exactly what has happened again this year, and I again \nvoice my objections to the process.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I rise in support of the Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP \nBenefits Improvement and Protection Act which we are considering as \npart of this omnibus package and which provides over $30 billion in \nmuch needed financial relief to our nation's beleaguered hospitals, \nhome health agencies, hospices and other Medicare providers over the \nnext five years.\n  In 1997, Congress and the White House faced a large and seemingly \nintractable federal budget deficit and projection that the Medicare \nTrust Fund would be bankrupt by 2002 unless Congress acted. The rapid \ngrowth in Medicare spending and pending insolvency of the trust fund \nunderstandably prompted the Congress and the Administration, as part of \nthe Balanced Budget Act of 1997, to initiate changes that were intended \nto allow the spending growth and make Medicare more cost-effective and \nefficient.\n  These measures, however, have inadvertently produced cuts in Medicare \nspending far beyond what Congress intended. In 1997, the Congressional \nBudget Office estimated that the BBA would cut Medicare spending by \n$116 billion from 1998 to 2002. It now appears that the five-year \nimpact of the BBA for hospitals, home health agencies and other \nMedicare providers is closer to $227 billion--almost twice the original \nestimates.\n  These deeper than expected cuts in Medicare spending, coupled with \nonerous regulatory requirements imposed by the Clinton Administration, \nare inhibiting the ability of hospitals, home health agencies, and \nother providers to deliver much-needed care, particularly to \nchronically-ill patients with complex care needs. While the Balanced \nBudget Refinement Act of 1999 did provide some relief, I believe that \nit is imperative that we do more. As we approach the end of the 106th \nCongress, we should have no higher priority.\n  I am particularly pleased that the package we are considering today \nprovides overdue relief for our nation's rural hospitals. Small, rural \nhospitals in Maine and elsehwere face unique challenges in the delivery \nof health care services. Shortages of physicians, nurses and other \nhealth professionals make it difficult to ensure that rural residents \nhave access to all of the care that they need. Moreover, Medicare \nreimbursement policies tend to favor urban areas and often fail to take \nthe special needs of rural providers into account.\n  One relatively simple, but nevertheless important step we can take is \nto enable more small, rural hospitals in Maine and elsewhere to qualify \nfor enhanced Medicare payments under the Medicare Dependent, Small \nRural Hospital Program. I am therefore pleased that this bill includes \nlegislation that I introduced, the Small Rural Hospital Program \nImprovement Act, to update the antiquated and arbitrary classification \nrequirements that prevent otherwise-qualified hospitals from receiving \nassistance under this program.\n  Despite the fact that most of the small rural hospitals in Maine \ntreat a disproportionate share of Medicare beneficiaries, none of them \ncurrently qualifies for this program. Not a single one. If updated in \nthe way that this bill proposes, as many as nine Maine hospitals will \nbe eligible for the program, which will qualify them to receive over $9 \nmillion in additional Medicare dollars each year.\n  The bill also includes legislation introduced by the senior Senator \nfrom Maine, Senator Snowe, to correct a drafting error that precluded \nsome of Maine's sole community hospitals from benefiting from the \nrebasing provisions in the Balancing Budget Refinement Act. This \nprovision will bring an additional $2.8 million in Medicare \nreimbursements to Maine's hospitals each year.\n\n  In addition, the legislation corrects the current inequity in the \nMedicare Disproportionate Share Hospital program that discriminates \nagainst rural hospitals that care for proportionately greater numbers \nof low-income patients. By treating rural hospitals the same as urban \nhospitals, as this bill would do, we will increase Medicare \ndisproportionate share payments to at least 18 of Maine's hospitals by \nmore than $8 million a year.\n  And finally, the legislation will provide increased Medicare payments \nto all Maine hospitals by providing them with a full 3.4 percent \ninflation increase in FY 2001, up from the 2.3 percent they would \nreceive under current law.\n  Increasing Medicare payments rates is critically important to the \nhospitals in Maine. For the past several years, Maine has ranked 49th \nor 50th in the nation in terms of Medicare reimbursement-to-cost \nratios. While hospitals in some states receive more than it costs them \nto provide care to older and disabled patients, Maine's hospitals are \nonly reimbursed about 80 cents for every $1.00 they actually spend \ncaring for Medicare beneficiaries.\n  As a consequence, Maine's hospitals have experienced a serious \nMedicare shortfall in recent years. The Maine Hospital Association \nanticipates a $174 million Medicare shortfall in 2002, which will force \nMaine's hospitals to shift costs on to other payers in the form of \nhigher hospital charges. This Medicare shortfall is one of the reasons \nthat Maine has among the highest insurance premiums in the nation. \nThese provisions will not solve all of Maine's Medicare shortfall \nproblems, but they will help to close the gap.\n  I am also pleased that this bill extends and increases funding for \ntwo diabetes research programs created by the Balanced Budget Act of \n1997, one focused on juvenile diabetes and the other focused on \ndiabetes in Native Americans. These two programs are currently only \nfunded through 2002. The Medicare, Medicaid and S-CHIP Benefits \nImprovement and Protection Act would extend funding for these two \nprograms for one year and increase their funding levels from $30 \nmillion a year to $100 million a year.\n  As the founder and Co-Chair of the Senate Diabetes Caucus, I have \nlearned a great deal about this serious disease and the difficulties \nand heartbreak that it causes for so many Americans and their families \nas they await a cure. We were all encouraged by the news earlier this \nyear that twelve individuals from Canada appear to have been cured of \ntheir diabetes through an experimental treatment involving the \ntransplantation of islet cells, and I believe that it is becoming \nincreasingly clear that diabetes is a disease that can be cured, and \nwill be cured in the near future, if sufficient funding is made \navailable.\n  Last year, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which \nI chair, held an oversight hearing to determine if the funding levels \nfor diabetes research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) are \nsufficient. At the hearing, the Committee heard testimony from the \nDiabetes Research Working Group (DRWG), an expert panel that studied \nthe status of diabetes research at the NIH and across the country. The \nstudy revealed that diabetes research has been seriously underfunded. \nAccording to the DRWG, diabetes research represents only about 3 \npercent of the NIH research budget, which is clearly too small an \ninvestment for a disease that affects 16 million Americans and accounts \nfor more than 10 percent of all health care dollars and nearly a \nquarter of all Medicare expenditures. Moreover, the DRWG report found \nthat ``many scientific opportunities are not being pursued due to \ninsufficient funding,'' and that the current ``funding level is far \nshort of what is required to make progress on this complex and \ndifficult problem.'' According to the DRWG, the funding levels for \ndiabetes at the NIH are roughly $300 million short of what is necessary \nto ensure that the promising scientific opportunities in diabetes \nresearch are realized.\n  The legislation we are considering today will help to close that gap \nand will make an enormous difference to the millions of Americans whose \nlives are affected every day by diabetes. By extending and increasing \nthe funding for these two important research programs, we are providing \nthe additional resources necessary to take advantage of the \nunprecedented opportunities for medical advances that should lead to \nbetter treatments, a means of prevention, and eventually a cure for \nthis devastating disease.\n  Finally, I am pleased that the bill we are considering today does \nprovide a small measure of relief to our nation's struggling home \nhealth agencies, and in particular to those agencies that serve \npatients in rural areas. I am,\n\n[[Page S11872]]\n\n however, disappointed that it does not do more. I will therefore \ncontinue to push not just for a delay--as this measure proposes--but \nfor a full repeal of the automatic 15 percent reduction in home health \npayments that is currently scheduled to go into effect on October 1, \n2001.\n  The Medicare home health benefit has already been cut far more deeply \nand abruptly than any other benefit in the history of the Medicare \nprogram. An additional 15 percent cut in Medicare home health payments \nwould ring the death knell for those low-cost agencies that are \nstruggling to hang on and would further reduce our senior's access to \ncritical home health services.\n  Moreover, the savings goals set for home health in the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1997 have not only been met, but far surpassed. The CBO \nprojects that the post-BBA reductions in home health will be about $69 \nbillion between fiscal years 1998 and 2002. This is over four times the \n$16 billion that Congress expected to save when it passed the 1997 law. \nFurther cuts clearly are not necessary and the 15 percent cut should be \nrepealed. To simply delay the cut for an additional year is to leave \nthis ``sword of Damocles'' hanging over the head of our nation's home \nhealth agencies.\n  I have also been disappointed that the process under which we are \nconsidering this critical piece of legislation has not allowed for any \namendments. The Home Health Payment Fairness Act, which I introduced \nwith my colleague from Missouri, Senator Bond, to repeal the 15 percent \ncut currently has 55 Senate cosponsors. If I had been allowed to offer \nmy bill as an amendment, as I had planned, it almost certainly would \nhave passed.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, and I urge my colleagues to join me in \nvoting for this important legislation.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Hart-Scott-\nRodino Act reform included in the Commerce-Justice-State appropriations \nbill. Our provision updates the law, which hadn't been adjusted for \ninflation since it was enacted in 1976, and makes several improvements \nto the merger review process undertaken by the Antitrust Division of \nthe Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission. It is a \nbipartisan measure, authored by Senators Hatch, Leahy, DeWine, and \nmyself and Representatives Hyde and Conyers, and it deserves our \nsupport.\n  The Hart-Scott-Rodino Act is crucial to the enforcement of \ncompetition policy in today's economy--it ensures that the antitrust \nagencies have sufficient time to review mergers and acquisitions prior \nto their completion. The statute requires that, prior to consummating a \nmerger or acquisition of a certain minimum size, the companies involved \nmust formally notify the antitrust agencies and must provide certain \ninformation regarding the proposed transaction. For those transactions \ncovered by the Act, the parties to a merger or acquisition may not \nclose their transaction until the expiration of a waiting period after \nmaking their Hart-Scott-Rodino Act filing. It also authorizes the \ngovernment to subpoena additional information from merging parties so \nthat the government has sufficient information to complete its merger \nanalysis.\n  While this statute has a very laudable purpose, especially with the \ntremendous numbers of mergers and acquisitions taking place in recent \nyears, some of its provisions are in need of revision. Most \nimportantly, while inflation has caused the value of a dollar to drop \nby more than a half in the past 25 years, the monetary test that \nsubjects a transaction to the provisions of the statute has not been \nrevised since the law's enactment in 1976. As a result, many \ntransactions that are of a relatively small size and pose little \nantitrust concerns are nevertheless swept into the ambit of the Hart-\nScott-Rodino review process. This legislation updates this statute to \nbetter fit into today's economy by raising the minimum size of \ntransaction covered by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act from $15 million to \n$50 million. This will both lessen the agencies' burden of reviewing \nsmall transactions unlikely to seriously affect competition and enable \nthe agencies to allocate their resources to properly focus on those \ntransactions most worthy of scrutiny.\n  Further, exempting small transactions from the Hart-Scott-Rodino \nprocess will significantly lessen regulatory burdens and expenses \nimposed on small businesses. The parties to these smaller transactions \nwill no longer need to pay the $45,000 filing fee--or face the often \neven more onerous legal fees and other expenses typically incurred in \npreparing a Hart-Scott-Rodino filing--for mergers and acquisitions that \nusually don't pose any competitive concerns.\n  In exempting this class of transactions from Hart-Scott-Rodino \nreview, however, it is important that we not cause the antitrust \nagencies to lose the funding they need to carry out their increasingly \ndemanding mission of enforcing the nation's antitrust laws. This bill \nwill reduce the number of Hart-Scott-Rodino filings and therefore \nreduce the revenues generated by these filings if the filing fees were \nkept at their present level. Of course, in a perfect world, we wouldn't \nfinance the Antitrust Division and the FTC on the backs of these filing \nfees. But because they are a fact of life, the antitrust agencies \nshould not be penalized by these reforms by suffering such a reduction \nin revenues. As a result, in order to assure that this reform is \nrevenue neutral, we have worked with the Appropriations Committee to \nensure that this bill raises the filing fees for the largest \ntransactions. Consequently, filing fees are to be increased for \ntransactions valued at over $100,000,000, which makes sense because \nthese transactions require more scrutiny.\n  This legislation makes other changes designed to enhance the \nefficiency of the pre-merger review process. The waiting period has \nbeen extended from twenty to thirty days after the parties' compliance \nwith the government's request for additional information, a more \nrealistic waiting period in this era of increasingly complex mergers \ngenerating enormous amounts of relevant information and documents. And, \nas in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, when a deadline for \ngovernmental action occurs on a weekend or holiday, the deadline is \nextended to the next business day. This simple provision will eliminate \ngamesmanship by parties who currently may time their compliance so that \nthe waiting period ends on a weekend or holiday, effectively shortening \nthe waiting period to the previous business day.\n  Finally, in recent years may have expressed concerns regarding the \ndifficulties and expense imposed on business in complying with \nallegedly overly burdensome or duplicative government request for \nadditional information. So our legislation also contains carefully \ncrafted provisions to ensure that business is not faced with unduly \nburdensome or overbroad requests for information, while assuring that \nthe antitrust agencies' ability to obtain the information necessary to \ncarry out a merger investigation is not hampered. Specifically, our \nlegislation mandates that the FTC and Antitrust Division designate a \nsenior official who does not have direct authority for the review of \nany enforcement recommendation to be designated to hear appeals to the \nappropriateness of the government's information request (the so called \n``Second Requests''). The bill also sets forth the specific standards \nthat this senior official is to utilize when considering such an appeal \nand mandates that these appeals be heard in an expedited manner.\n  In sum, I believe this legislation to be a reasonable and well \nbalanced reform of our government's vital merger review procedures. It \nwill make long overdue adjustments in the filing thresholds--ensuring \nreview of those mergers in most need of governmental scrutiny while \nreducing the burden and expense on government and private parties by \nexempting smaller transactions from often expensive and time consuming \npre-merger filings. It will also significantly reform the merger review \nprocess to ensure that the government has sufficient time to analyze \nincreasing complex merger transactions, while also adding protections \nso that private parties do not face unduly burdensome or duplicative \ninformation request. I urge swift passage of this measure.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concerns about \nthe lack of commitment for forward funding for the Low Income Heating \nEnergy Assistance Program for fiscal year 2002. Mr. President, as you \nknow, LIHEAP is a block grant program to\n\n[[Page S11873]]\n\nthe states to assist needy households with energy assistance. Since \nFY1999, the program has been funded at $1.1 billion, plus $300 million \nfor weather emergencies. I am pleased to note that, through our \nefforts, the Labor-HHS Conference Report provides $1.4 billion for \nFY2001, with a contingency fund of $300 million for emergencies. To my \ngreat dismay, however, the $1.4 million provided to help the States \nbudget for next winter--the winter of 2001-2002--was cut from the final \npackage.\n  We need to face the fact that our nation is budgeting by emergency \nwhen it comes to making sure that our low-income citizens, particularly \nthe elderly, can keep warm in the winter. This past year, there were \nfour different releases of the FY2000 emergency funds, most of which \nwere released by mid-February, 2000. Currently, there is only \n$155,650,000 remaining in the FY2000 emergency funds and I am aware \nthat the White House is coming to a decision soon as to how to dispense \nthese much-needed funds. I have joined many of my colleagues at \ndifferent times over the past year urging these releases along with the \ncurrently needed release.\n  I have also urged an increase in the regular funding for the States \nprograms, along with forward funding for the next fiscal year so that \nthe States can appropriately budget for each successive year so as to \nextend the benefits to as many eligible people in need as possible.\n  Currently, Mr. President, Maine's LIHEAP program has borrowed from \nthe State's ``rainy day fund'' in the hopes that the State would \nultimately get paid back. Today is December 15--two and a half months \ninto the fiscal year--and they are still waiting. Because the \nLegislature had the foresight to lend out this money, the Community \nAction Agencies were able to get funding to LIHEAP beneficiaries last \nJuly so they could buy home heating oil when it was cheaper.\n  Like last winter, Maine's LIHEAP program is currently receiving an \nextraordinary amount of applications for help. Anticipating a colder \nwinter and higher prices this winter, the State has budgeted to \naccommodate more applications--they have already processed over \n26,000--but to do this, they have had to reduce the benefit from $488 \nlast year down to $350 currently. They are hearing that, because of the \nhigh prices--as high as $1.63 per gallon--the $350 does not allow \nLIHEAP recipients to fill their oil tank even once as we move into the \ncolder New England winter months ahead.\n  We have a critical problem facing the country in the upcoming winter \nmonths, Mr. President. It is said that misery loves company, and it is \nmy sense that, given the skyrocketing natural gas prices being \nexperienced by all parts of the country, the Northeast will have lots \nof company this winter as more and more constituents with low incomes, \nparticularly the fixed-income elderly, worry about where the money will \ncome from to pay their heating bills to keep warm. This is a very \nunhealthy situation.\n  I have spent this entire year appealing for more LIHEAP funding to \nprotect the most vulnerable members of our society so they will have \nenergy assistance when they need it most. I will continue to do so in \nthe next Congress in the hopes that we will all step up to the plate \nand not only increase the overall LIHEAP funding but to forward fund \nthe program so the states an be fiscally responsible and accommodate as \nmany people as possible with this vital benefit.\n  The ongoing problem continues to be one of supply and demand as \nnatural gas and heating oil inventories remain historically low, and \nthe increased costs caused by this imbalance will not right itself in \ntime for the cold winter weather when demand will rise sharply. This \nsituation prices the low-income households right out of the market and \nthey find themselves making ``Solomon choices'' for heating or eating, \nor by cutting down on necessary and costly prescription drugs.\n  It is logical that when costs are doubled, those served by the LIHEAP \nprogram are decreased by the same amount. And, we should keep in mind \nthat only around 13 percent of households that are eligible for the \nLIHEAP program actually even receive Federal assistance. Colder \nweather, higher costs and tighter budgets could have the effect of \nraising this percentage upward.\n  Because Maine received over $5.3 million in emergency LIHEAP funds \nthis past winter, my State was able to increase the income limits to \nserve more eligible residents with their high energy costs. Maine was \nable to increase the income guidelines to 170 percent of the Federal \nPoverty Guidelines and assist over 50,400 households with a fuel \nassistance benefit averaging $488, almost twice last year's $261.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to working with you on increased long-\nrange funding that will allow the Community Action Agencies in Maine \nand other States' LIHEAP programs to plan and budget in advance, so \nthat as many energy needs are addressed as possible. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me next year in efforts for increasing funds so \nthat our States can budget for a safety net that can be extended to as \nmany low-income citizens as possible--and to make sure they do not find \nthemselves literally out in the cold.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of provisions in \nthe Consolidated Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2001 that would \ntransfer a Coast Guard lighthouse on Plum Island to the city of \nNewburyport, Massachusetts and land on Nantucket Island from the Coast \nGuard Loran station to the town of Nantucket, Massachusetts. I wish to \nthank the conferees for including these provisions in this bill.\n  Mr. President, the Plum Island lighthouse is a national treasure. \nThis conveyance ensures that this historic treasure will be preserved \nand protected for generations to come. This was included at the request \nof my constituents in the area. The Coast Guard has always been a good \nfriend and neighbor in Massachusetts. I am pleased that this historic \nlandmark will transferred to Newburyport so that it can be preserved \nand protected for the citizens and visitors of the City to enjoy for \nyears to come.\n  Mr. President, the town of Nantucket needs a small amount of property \nfrom the Coast Guard Loran Station to build a sewage treatment plant. \nThe Coast Guard has been working with local government officials on the \nIsland to find a solution to this problem. Initially the Coast Guard \nconsidered leasing this property to Nantucket, however the Coast Guard \nlater determined that a conveyance was the better solution. I applaud \nthe Coast Guard for working with Nantucket to develop this workable \nsolution.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I am pleased that today the Senate \npassed regulatory accounting legislation in the Treasury-Postal title \nof the Omnibus Appropriations Act, section 624, also known as the \nRegulatory Right-to-Know Act. I want to thank Chairman Ted Stevens and \nSenator John Breaux for helping me pass this important legislation. We \nhave worked together over the last several years to further some basic \nimportant goals: to promote the public's right to know about the costs \nand benefits of regulatory programs; to increase the accountability of \ngovernment to the people it serves; and ultimately, to improve the \nquality of our regulatory programs. This legislation will help us \nassess what regulatory programs cost, what benefits we are getting in \nreturn, and what we need to do to improve agency performance.\n  By any measure, the burdens of Federal regulation are enormous. By \nsome estimates, Federal rules and paperwork cost about $700 billion per \nyear, or $7,000 for the average American household. I hear concerns \nabout unnecessary regulatory burdens and red tape from people all \nacross the country and from all walks of life--small business owners, \ngovernors, state legislators, local officials, farmers, corporate \nleaders, government reformers, school officials, and parents.\n  There is strong public support for sensible regulations that can help \nensure cleaner water, quality products, safer workplaces, reliable \neconomic markets, and the like. But there is substantial evidence that \nthe current regulatory system is missing important opportunities to \nachieve these goals in a more cost-effective manner. The depth of this \nproblem is not appreciated fully because the costs of regulation are \nnot as apparent as other costs of government, such as taxes, and the \nbenefits of regulation often are diffuse. The bottom line is that the \nAmerican people deserve better results from\n\n[[Page S11874]]\n\nthe vast resources and time spent on regulation. We've got to be \nsmarter.\n  We often debate the costs and benefits of on-budget programs, but we \nare just breaking ground on creating a system to scrutinize Federal \nregulation. This legislation will provide better information to help us \nanswer some important questions: How much do regulatory programs cost \neach year? Are we spending the right amount, particularly compared to \non-budget spending and private initiatives? Are we setting sensible \npriorities among different regulatory programs? As the Office of \nManagement and Budget stated in its first ``Report to Congress on the \nCosts and Benefits of Federal Regulations'':\n\n       [R]egulations (like other instruments of government policy) \n     have enormous potential for both good and harm....The only \n     way we know how to distinguish between the regulations that \n     do good and those that cause harm is through careful \n     assessment and evaluation of their benefits and costs. Such \n     analysis can also often be used to redesign harmful \n     regulations so they produce more good than harm and redesign \n     good regulations so they produce even more net benefits.\n\n  This legislation continues the efforts of my precedessors. Senator \nBill Roth proposed a regulatory accounting provision in a broader \nreform measure that he worked on when he chaired the Governmental \nAffairs Committee in 1995. In 1996, when Ted Stevens became our \nchairman, he passed a one-time regulatory accounting amendment on the \nOmnibus Appropriations Act. After I became the chairman of Governmental \nAffairs, I supported Senator Stevens' amendment when it passed again in \n1997. In 1998, I sponsored an amendment to strengthen the Stevens \nprovision with the support of Senators Lott, Breaux, Shelby, and Robb, \nas well as a bipartisan coalition in the House. This year, I worked \nwith Senators Stevens and Breaux to make this legislation permanent.\n  This legislation continues the requirement that OMB shall report to \nCongress on the costs and benefits of regulatory programs, which began \nwith the Stevens amendment. This legislation also adds to previous \ninitiatives in several respects. First, it will finally make regulatory \naccounting a permanent statutory requirement. Regulatory accounting \nwill become a regular exercise to help ensure that regulatory programs \nare cost-effective, sensible, and fair. The costs and benefits of \nregulation can become a regular part of the annual debate between the \nCongress and the executive branch on the Federal budget. Second, this \nlegislation will require OMB to provide a more complete picture of the \nregulatory system, including the incremental costs and benefits of \nparticular programs and regulations, as well as an analysis of \nregulatory impacts on State, local, and tribal government, small \nbusiness, wages, and economic growth. Finally, this legislation will \nhelp ensure that OMB will provide better information as time goes on. \nRequirements for OMB guidelines and independent peer review should \ncontinually improve future regulatory accounting reports.\n  The government has an obligation to think carefully and be \naccountable for requirements that impose costs on people and limit \ntheir freedom. We should pull together to contribute to the success of \nresponsible government programs that the public values, while enhancing \nthe economic security and well-being of our families and communities.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the Regulatory \nRight-to-Know Act be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Sec. 624. (a) In General.--For calendar year 2002 and each \n     year thereafter, the Director of the Office of Management and \n     Budget shall prepare and submit to Congress, with the budget \n     submitted under section 1105 of title 31, United States Code, \n     an accounting statement and associated report containing--\n       (1) an estimate of the total annual costs and benefits \n     (including quantifiable and nonquantifiable effects) of \n     Federal rules and paperwork, to the extent feasible--\n       (A) in the aggregate;\n       (B) by agency and agency program; and\n       (C) by major rule;\n       (2) an analysis of impacts of Federal regulation on State, \n     local, and tribal government, small business, wages, and \n     economic growth; and\n       (3) recommendations for reform.\n       (b) Notice.--The Director of the Office of Management and \n     Budget shall provide public notice and an opportunity to \n     comment on the statement and report under subsection (a) \n     before the statement and report are submitted to Congress.\n       (c) Guidelines.--To implement this section, the Director of \n     the Office of Management and Budget shall issue guidelines to \n     agencies to standardize--\n       (1) measures of costs and benefits; and\n       (2) the format of accounting statements.\n       (d) Peer Review.--The Director of the Office of Management \n     and Budget shall provide for independent and external peer \n     review of the guidelines and each accounting statement and \n     associated report under this section. Such peer review shall \n     not be subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 \n     U.S.C. App.).\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of a provision in \nthe Consolidated Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2001 that would \ntransfer Coast Guard Station Scituate to the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration, NOAA. NOAA will use the facility to serve \nas the headquarters for the Gerry E. Studds Stellwagen Bank National \nMarine Sanctuary. Since the mid-90s the Coast Guard has shared the \nfacility with both NOAA and the Massachusetts Environmental Police, \nMEP. Once the Coast Guard has relocated to a new facility NOAA and the \nMEP will jointly use the facility to both manage and study the marine \nsanctuary and to perform cooperative enforcement on the water. I am \nhappy to report that NOAA is teaming with the MEP to share resources \nand facilities to improve fisheries and sanctuary enforcement. It is my \nunderstanding that NOAA will be offering the same working and living \nspaces to the MEP that have been provided in the past by the U.S. Coast \nGuard. In addition the MEP will have the same berthing and dock space \nfor their vessels. Furthermore it is my understanding that this \nagreement between the two agencies will mirror the current U.S. Coast \nGuard agreement with the MEP with respect to terms and conditions.\n  The Stellwagen Bank Sanctuary is located at the mouth of \nMassachusetts Bay. It was first described in the diary of Captain Henry \nStellwagen, a hydrographer for the U.S. Navy, as ``an important \ndiscovery in the location of a fifteen fathom bank lying in a line \nbetween Cape Cod and Cape Ann.'' The wealth of sea life that moved \nbelow the surface of Captain Stellwagen's vessel has drawn commercial \nfishing fleets for centuries. The continued use for maritime commerce, \nwhether shipping, fishing or whale watching excursions, presents a \nmajor challenge in the enforcement of sanctuary rules.\n  Today the sanctuary draws as many as one million visitors a year, \nmany of them whale watchers, intent on experiencing a close encounter \nwith a whale--particularly the gregarious and acrobatic humpback. While \nits numbers at Stellwagen Bank are relatively strong, the species is \nnevertheless listed as endangered based on its worldwide numbers. The \nEndangered Species Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act have been \nenacted to help protect this and other species; but the oceans are \nlarge and enforcement is difficult. I applaud the cooperation shown by \nNOAA and the MEP to address this critical issue in the sanctuary. This \nconveyance of property form the Coast Guard to NOAA will solidify this \nrelationship between the MEP and NOAA and will at the same time provide \noffice space and research facilities for teams of scientists to study \none of the true treasures of New England, the Stellwagen Bank National \nMarine Sanctuary.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in the final days of the 106th Congress, I \nwanted to take this opportunity to speak about the issue of debt relief \nand reform of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.\n  A great deal of attention has been paid recently to a complicated \nissue that has faced Congress--the international lending practices of \nthe World Bank group and the IMF. The complexity increases when you \nfactor in calls for the United States to contribute to efforts to write \noff debt owed by the world's heavily indebted poor countries (HIPCs).\n  As vice chairman of the Senate Banking Subcommittee on International \nTrade and Finance, I have conducted a series of oversight hearings on \nthe functioning of the IMF and World Bank. These hearings have only \nstrengthened my belief that the evidence is clear--we should not grant\n\n[[Page S11875]]\n\ndebt relief without demanding that the international lending \ninstitutions such as the World Bank and IMF change their current \npractices.\n  I supported Senate passage of the fiscal year 2001 foreign operations \nappropriations conference report with much reservation.\n  The bill collectively provides about $435 million toward debt \nforgiveness for the HIPCs. Of this money, $210 million comes disguised \nas ``emergency'' spending.\n  Regrettably, this all goes without any link between relief and \nreform. The legislation calls for a couple of reports to Congress and a \nfew policy suggestions that the U.S. ought to urge these institutions \nto adopt, but it has no teeth to force change. The lending institutions \npay no consequences for failing to mend their ways . . . this means the \nconsequences of inaction will be borne by, among others, American \ntaxpayers and people in need.\n  Essentially, the IMF, World Bank, and other international lending \ninstitutions are supposed to improve economies of impoverished \ncountries and the health and well-being of people throughout the world.\n  In the U.S., we are a compassionate people; we share our bounty with \nmany other countries. But many question the effectiveness of how the \nWorld Bank and the IMF perform their missions.\n  The World Bank and IMF lend money to certain countries to use for \nvarious purposes--improving infrastructure needs, feeding and \nimmunizing children, and stabilizing the economy, to name a few. But \nthese noble goals have been stymied by corruption, greed, and poor \nmanagement. What has developed is sadly lacking in results and in much \nneed of reform.\n  Some advocates of debt relief have tried to delink the issue of debt \nrelief from the issue of reform. I agree with recent remarks that these \nlending institutions are at the ``root'' of the debt problem. And if we \nare to weed out the problem, we must pull it up by its roots. We all \nknow that, if you don't pull up weeds by their roots, they merely \nsprout up again. This serves nobody's interest--least of all the people \ncurrently suffering.\n  We need transparency, accountability, and effectiveness. We need to \nknow where the money is being spent, who is spending it, and how it is \nbenefiting that country and achieving the goals of the World Bank and \nthe IMF.\n  A General Accounting Office (GAO) report on the World Bank concluded \n``[management] controls are not yet strong enough to provide reasonable \nassurance that project funds are spent according to the Bank's \nguidelines.''\n  Simply put, the World Bank can't tell us with any reasonable level of \ncertainty that funds are being spent efficiently and as they are \nintended to be spent. Other reports have questioned the IMF's \npractices.\n  Senate Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm spoke eloquently about \nthis issue recently on the Senate floor. I know he talked about the \nUganda situation at some length. And keep in mind that Uganda has been \nused as the ``poster child'' of success. It has qualified for debt \nrelief under the original and enhanced HIPC initiatives.\n  Let me echo the chairman. In May, I wrote Treasury Secretary Lawrence \nSummers about the Ugandan Government's multi-million dollar expenditure \non a presidential Gulfstream jet. As I noted in my letter, Idahoans and \nothers throughout this country sympathize with the plight facing \nimpoverished Ugandans whose annual per capita income is roughly $330. \nPeople throughout the world deserve the chance to succeed and thrive. \nWhat troubled me was the Ugandan Government's failure to place a high \npriority on reducing poverty and choosing to expend millions on a \nluxury aircraft, then essentially asking for and receiving millions in \ndebt relief.\n  This situation has deeply troubled me. I was even more troubled by \nSecretary Summers' reply. Secretary Summers basically said the purchase \nof the plane was not out of the ordinary and he was satisfied that \nUganda didn't take money from poverty relief programs to pay for it. As \nhe stated, ``The Ugandan authorities have committed to offset the cost \nof the aircraft against defense and other non-priority, non-wage \nexpenditures.'' But to me, money is money; if Uganda can find money in \nits budget to pay for an extravagant jet, it should be able to find \nmoney to help its own people in poverty. I imagine $37 million would go \na long way toward helping people in a country where the average per \ncapita income is less than $350 a year.\n  As I have repeatedly noted, when the U.S. Federal Government helped \nbail out Chrysler, former chairman Lee Iacocca was required to sell the \ncompany jets.\n  And there is another problem--``moral hazard.'' In simple terms, \npeople must be made to bear the consequences of their decisions. If \nnot, they have less incentive to act prudently. If a country knows the \nIMF will come in and bail them out after making bad decisions, there is \nlittle incentive for the country to change its decisionmaking process. \nOr, if the country knows it will receive IMF funding, perhaps it uses \nother monies to prop up companies that should be allowed to fail. The \nmoral hazard problem pervades this system. We might all like someone to \nstep in and alleviate the negative impact of bad decisions we make, but \nthis would not encourage us to act wisely. Furthermore, someone else \nbears those consequences. In the case of troubled countries and the \ninternational lending institutions, it is contributors such as U.S. \ntaxpayers who bear the burden. And, honestly, the citizens of the \ncountry in question whose situation fails to improve.\n  So, while we are and should continue to be a compassionate nation, I \nalso recognize the duty of Congress to set good public policy and \nrepresent the interests of hard-working Americans.\n  Chairman Gramm and I, along with others, only asked that we adopt a \nproposal that recognizes all of these goals. This was achievable if \neveryone had been willing to work together.\n  Unfortunately, the Treasury Department refused to engage in \nmeaningful dialog and compromise with Congress on this issue.\n  What is even more amazing is that the Treasury Department fought for \nthis spending when estimates suggest that the maximum amount that would \nbe necessary for the U.S. to fund its obligations to the HIPC Trust for \nthis year and next is less than $100 million.\n  We should not be granting relief without reform.\n  I assure you that follow-up will be done during the next Congress to \nillustrate the continued need for Congress and the next administration \nto alter current U.S. policies and practices.\n  I completely agree with an editorial in the October 12 Wall Street \nJournal which stated that ``Any debt write-off that doesn't include \nradical reform of the international financial institutions . . . will \nrenew the cycle of non-performance.''\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want the Record to reflect my strong \nsupport for the final appropriations measure that we are completing \ntoday.\n  Since the first day I walked into this distinguished Chamber, I have \nbeen fighting to bring the priorities of our budget closer to the \npriorities of America's families. As I talk to parents and students in \nmy State about what would improve their lives, over and over, I hear \nthat a quality education for our students is a top priority for \nfamilies across this country.\n  Today is a victory for families. The Labor-HHS-Education \nappropriations bill shows this Congress is listening to people across \nthis country. It provides a $6.5 billion increase in education \nspending. This is a 17 percent increase. It makes an investment in the \nthings that matter--reducing class size, improving teacher quality, and \nrepairing and constructing schools. This bill gives the Congress a \nbenchmark to work with the new President who has made education a \npersonal priority.\n  I have come to the Senate floor numerous times over the years to ask \nfor an investment in reducing class size. This is something that \nmatters to parents, teachers and students across this country. After a \nyear long battle against efforts to eliminate class size reduction \nfunds, this bill provides $1.62 billion final appropriations bill for \nthe purpose of reducing class size.\n  By making this investment, we are sending an important message to \nevery community in this Nation. Class size reduction is important \nbecause it makes a tangible difference in real-world public schools.\n  I've talked to teachers in my State about class size reduction. These \nteachers told me the benefits of smaller\n\n[[Page S11876]]\n\nclass size. They say that when class sizes are smaller, they see better \nstudent achievement, fewer discipline problems, more individual \nattention, better parent-teacher communication, and dramatic results \nfor poor and minority students.\n  These are the kinds of things we need in our public schools. Our kids \ndeserve this investment.\n  In Washington State, the funds included in this bill will provide \nover $25 million to the State for the purpose of reducing class size. \nCurrently, over 600 teachers have been hired with Federal class size \nreduction funds across the State to reduce class size. With the funds \nsecured this year, Washington State will be able to hire approximately \nadditional 130 new teachers to reduce class size.\n  This appropriations agreement also makes an important investment in \nschool construction. Students across this country are going to school \nin inadequate facilities. The majority of students in this country \nattend schools that are over 40 years old. These have leaky roofs, \ninadequate heating and cooling, and are not the type of learning \nenvironment that goes hand in hand with expecting our students to \nachieve high standards. This bill makes an investment in school \nconstruction, providing $1.2 billion for this purpose.\n  In addition, it makes an investment in teacher quality. Our districts \nneed help in the area of teacher quality. The districts need to be able \nto provide teachers the support they need, and make efforts to reach \nout and bring more highly qualified people into the teaching \nprofession. This appropriations bill provides a $150 million increase \nover last year in our investment to improve teacher quality.\n  This bill provides more than a 30-percent increase for IDEA, the \nbiggest increase in the program history. I'm sure there is not a member \nof this Senate who has not visited a school district and heard the \nstruggles the district faces in funding special education services. \nThis bill provides $1.35 billion more for IDEA than last year. We \nshould not back down from this commitment to our schools.\n  The bill provides close to a 50-percent increase for after school \nprograms. The funding is raised from $435 million to $851 million.\n  There is a much needed investment in child care. There is a 70-\npercent increase in child care funding, bringing the funding up to $2 \nbillion. With these additional funds, nearly 150,000 children will \nreceive child care subsidies.\n  An increase of over $1 billion in Head Start: These funds would allow \nan additional 70,000 children to participate in Head Start.\n  The bill invests in college opportunities for students. The $450 \nincrease in the Pell Grant Program and the substantial increase for \nSEOG, LEAP, and Federal work-study will give more families the ability \nto send their children to college.\n  While I am extremely disappointed that this Congress failed to finish \nconsideration of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, I am glad \nwe were able to make a commitment to kids through this appropriations \nbill. Investing in reducing class size, teacher quality, college \naffordability, and things to help our young children like Head Start \nand child care are the kind of investments we need in this country.\n  While these investments are not quite as high as the ones agreed to \nin October, I still believe we are moving the right direction in this \nbill by investing in the things that we know work. Kids, teachers and \nparents across this country deserve these investments.\n  And while I have focused my remarks on education, I should note that \nthis bill contains vital investments in many key areas like health \ncare. I am immensely proud of the increased investments we are making \nin health care research at the National Institutes of Health and the \nCenters for Disease Control. These investments represent our strong \ncommitment to finding cures to life threatening ailments like breast \nand prostrate cancer, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis. This \nbill funds key health projects in Washington State like Children's \nHospital and others.\n\n  This bill makes an essential investment in health care with $35 \nbillion for BBRA relief. These improvements are imperative for access \nto quality health care for people everywhere. I cannot emphasize enough \nthe importance of these changes to hospitals, home health, skilled \nnursing facilities which serve the elderly. Ensuring this population \nhas high quality health care is high priority, and I commend my \ncolleagues for recognizing this pressing need.\n  As a member of the Labor-HHS-Education Subcommittee, I urge my \ncolleagues to join in support for this bill.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to lodge my objection to H.R. \n4577. I understand that there will not be a rollcall vote but if there \nwere to be a rollcall vote I would vote ``no.''\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President I want to voice my strong objection to \nthe process by which this legislation is being passed by the Senate. \nThe Omnibus Appropriations conference report--containing numerous other \npieces of unrelated legislation--is being passed by the Senate tonight \nunder a consent agreement that was entered suddenly by the Majority \nLeader without the normal notification process. We should have had a \nrecorded vote. Since I first came to the Senate 9 years ago I have felt \nthat it does the Senate no credit to pass such significant budgetary \nlegislation--literally hundreds of billions of dollars--without a \nrecorded vote. We cannot be held accountable as Senators to our \nconstituents when such bills are passed in this manner. I want to make \nit clear; I oppose this legislation and I would like the Record to show \nthat I would have voted no had there been a recorded vote.\n  Mr. L. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today we consider legislation that \naddresses crucial areas of our Nation's tax and health care policy. I \napplaud the hard work of appropriators and President Clinton in coming \nto a hard-won agreement on this year's final spending bill. And, I am \npleased that we can finally wrap up the business of the 106th Congress \nand clear the deck for our new President and the 107th Congress.\n  This bill includes many of my legislative priorities, which I believe \nwill benefit Rhode Islanders, and all Americans.\n  First: let's focus on those in the area of health care. The health \ncare portion of this measure includes two legislative proposals I \nauthored, and for which I worked hard to build bipartisan support this \nyear: a version of the State Children's Health Insurance Program \nPreservation Act, and the Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital \nPreservation Act.\n  The SCHIP provision allows 40 states--including Rhode Island--to \nretain for two more years $1.2 billion in children's health insurance \nfunds. In extending the deadline for states to spend these federal \ndollars, we give eligible children in 40 states the opportunity to \nreceive health insurance. In Rhode Island, our state's low-income \nhealth care program--known as RIte Care--may be able to retain as much \na $8 million in federal funds. That amount would go a long way to cover \nuninsured children between the ages of eight and 18 in my home state.\n  My second priority--The Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital \nPreservation Act--would benefit hospitals that serve a disproportionate \nshare of America's 43 million uninsured. It would increase Medicaid DSH \npayments to these hospitals to defray their costs of treating Medicaid \npatients--particularly indigent patients with complex medical needs. In \nall, it would strengthen the safety net for Rhode Island's hospitals--\nthat are struggling as a result of the budget cuts instituted by the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997. Indeed, this proposal could save Rhode \nIsland hospitals $10 million over the next two years.\n  What's more, the initiative before us increases Medicare \nreimbursements for teaching hospitals, and scales back deep cuts to the \nhome health care industry. And, it bolsters the ability of nursing \nhomes and community health clinics to provide high quality service to \nthose in need. Together, these provisions will go a long way to improve \nthe health care received by the children, the elderly, and the \nuninsured of our nation.\n  Turning to the tax provisions, I am heartened that this bill contains \nmany incentives to rebuild distressed communities, both in urban and \nrural areas. I've cosponsored legislation to foster urban renewal, and \nI am pleased that this package contains a version of\n\n[[Page S11877]]\n\nit. Specifically, this measure would establish 40 renewal communities \nand designate 9 new empowerment zones that would be eligible for tax \nbreaks.\n  I am particularly heartened that this measure increases the low-\nincome housing tax credit caps over the next two years. Along with the \nRhode Island Housing Authority, I am an ardent supporter of this \nincrease because it will help many low-income families gain access to \naffordable housing.\n  What's more, the initiative we consider today accelerates a scheduled \nincrease in the state volume limits on tax-exempt private activity \nbonds. This provision has broad, bipartisan support, and I am glad we \nare moving forward with it.\n  Finally, many of you know that, as a member of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, I have worked to win passage of legislation to \nspur cleanup of lightly contaminated industrial sites--so-called \nbrownfields sites. This bill contains a brownfields expensing provision \nthat promotes the clean-up of environmental contaminants. This is a \nmodest step in the direction of the wholesale reform I've been \npressing, but it is an important step towards that eventual goal.\n  I am pleased that we have finally reached agreement with our \ncounterparts on the other side of the aisle here in the Senate; with \nour colleagues in the House of Representatives; and most importantly, \nwith the Clinton administration on this broad spending package.\n  In that spirit of constructive compromise, I will vote in favor of \nthis bill. I urge my colleagues to do the same. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n              the cultural property procedural reform act\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, in 1972, the Senate gave its advice and \nconsent to ratification of the UNESCO Convention on the Means of \nProhibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export, and Transfer of \nOwnership of Cultural Property, but subject to the passage of \nimplementing legislation by Congress. The implementing legislation--the \nConvention on Cultural Property Implementation Act (CCPIA)--became law \nin 1983. I wrote this legislation in the Senate in cooperation with \nSenators Robert J. Dole and Spark M. Matsunaga. It is technically a \nrevenue measure and came under the jurisdiction of the Senate Finance \nCommittee of which I was then a senior member, later chairman. Earlier \nI had been Ambassador to India and to the United Nations and was much \naware of the issues surrounding cultural property. As Ambassador in \nDelhi I was responsible for negotiating the return of the Shiva \nNataraja. I also was serving at the time as chairman of the board of \ntrustees of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, and in that \ncapacity I dealt at length with similar issues.\n  The CCPIA sets forth our national policy concerning the importation \nof cultural property. As part of the statute, we created the Cultural \nProperty Advisory Committee (CPAC), an 11-member body appointed by the \nPresident to advise him concerning foreign government requests that \nimport restrictions be placed on certain archaeological and \nethnological material. The statute specified that each member should \nrepresent one of four categories: museums (two members), \narchaeologists/anthropologists (three members), dealers (three \nmembers), and the public (three members). There are different interests \nhere, and my purpose was to see that these were represented in any \nrecommendation the CPAC would make. In addition, the CCPIA explicitly \nstates that the CPAC is subject generally to the Federal Advisory \nCommittee Act provisions relating to open meetings, public notice, and \npublic participation in its proceedings. As the last of the authors of \nthe CCPIA remaining in the Senate, it fell to me to keep an eye on its \nimplementation.\n  Earlier this session I introduced S. 1696, the Cultural Property \nProcedural Reform Act. Joining me as cosponsors on the bill are \nChairman Roth, and Senators Schumer, Gramm, and Breaux. Congressman \nRangel introduced companion legislation on the House side. I have \npressed this legislation because I feel it provides an essential \nclarification of the CCPIA.\n  Unfortunately, time has run out in this session of Congress to pass \nS. 1696. Although some halting progress has been made by the executive \nbranch in responding to the problems that S. 1696 sought to address, it \nis clear that the fundamental issues of procedural reform raised by S. \n1696 have not been resolved. Therefore, it is imperative that \ncongressional oversight continue in an effort to ensure that the \nimplementation of the Act is faithful to the terms Congress \npromulgated.\n  We have seen a number of serious shortcomings in the administration \nof the CCPIA which led to the introduction of S. 1696. A central \nconcern has been that the procedures of the CPAC remain essentially \nclosed to nonmembers of the committee despite the provisions of the \n1983 Act, such as 19 U.S.C. section 2605(h), that generally require \nopen meetings and transparent procedures. I remain concerned that past \nproceedings before the CPAC and the administering agency have been \nconducted in almost total secrecy, thus denying interested parties a \nmeaningful opportunity to respond to evidence presented by foreign \nnations concerning alleged pillage and with respect to the statutory \nrequirements that must be satisfied. The result is that the CPAC is \ndenied a full, unbiased record upon which to make its decisions. A \ncentral goal of S. 1696 is to open those proceedings.\n  The initial step in a CPAC proceeding is the publication of a notice \nin the Federal Register informing the public of the filing of an \napplication by a foreign government. However, that notice of the \nrequest is often so cursory as to effectively deny interested persons \nan opportunity to contribute meaningfully to CPAC proceedings. An \nadequate notice should provide descriptive information from the foreign \nnation about the archaeological or ethnological materials, the pillage \nof which the requesting country claims is placing its cultural \npatrimony in jeopardy. This information is particularly important \nbecause the 1983 act explicitly authorizes the President to impose \nimport restrictions only on particular archaeological and ethnological \nmaterials that are the subject of pillage, which, in turn, is \njeopardizing the cultural patrimony of a requesting state.\n  Any notice of a foreign government's request should, at a minimum, \nput on the public record the approximate dates during which the \ncultural material at issue was produced, the approximate dates during \nwhich that material is alleged to have been pillaged, the cultural \ngroup with respect to which the material is associated (if available), \nthe medium, and representative categories or types of cultural material \nthat the foreign nation asked by barred from import into this country. \nThis information will permit interested parties to prepare themselves \nto participate in an informed fashion in proceedings before the CPAC.\n\n  Requiring the approximate dates of the alleged pillage is essential \nto carry out the purposes of the statute. Evidence of contemporary \npillage is central to the goals of the 1983 act, which is based on the \nconcept that a U.S. import restriction is justified only if it will \nhave a meaningful effect on an ongoing situation of pillage. It is \nquite obvious that an import restriction in the year 2000 cannot deter \npillage that took place decades or even centuries ago. Thus, the \napproximate dates of the pillage, which a fair notice would provide, is \nimperative to ensure that the administrative process is faithful to the \ngoals of the CCPIA.\n  A second concern that led to the introduction of S. 1696 was the \nabsence of meaningful art dealer participation in the proceedings of \nthe CPAC. This year, in fact, art dealers have not been represented at \nall on the CPAC--all three dealer slots have been and continue to be \nvacant. This state of affairs is inconsistent with the CCPIA, which \nestablished an elaborate process to ensure that the views of \narchaeologists, art dealers, museums, and the public were taken fully \ninto account when a foreign government asked us to prohibit the \nimportation of archaeological and ethnological materials.\n  It is reported that the White House is now moving forward to fill all \nthese are dealer vacancies and perhaps the introduction of S. 1696 \nhelped move that process along. To ensure that in the future all \ninterested constituencies are represented on the CPAC, it would be \ndesirable to modify the CPAC quorum provisions to require the presence \nof at least one member from each statutory category. Moreover, the \nlanguage describing the CPAC members should be\n\n[[Page S11878]]\n\nmade consistent across all four categories and consistent with Senate \nreport language stating that the members are to be ``knowledgeable \nrepresentatives of the private sector.''\n  Further, discussions on the bill have revealed that the process \nwhereby the Executive Branch reports to the Congress on its actions \nunder the 1983 act needs to be strengthened. Under current law, the \nCPAC and the State Department are to provide copies of their reports to \nCongress. These reports have not been transmitted to the Senate Finance \nCommittee, the committee of jurisdiction in the Senate. Significantly, \nconsultations have not occurred routinely on these matters since the \noriginal statute was enacted in 1983.\n  To implement the goals of the 1983 Act for open proceedings, the \nreporting requirements in the CCPIA should be made more consistent with \nthe traditional consultation and layover provisions used by Congress to \nensure adequate consultation. Thus, reports of the CPAC and State \nDepartment action should be sent to appropriate jurisdictional \ncommittees with a traditional layover period to permit consultation, as \nappropriate, between Congress and the executive branch. Consultation \nprovisions can be developed that will not impair the executive branch's \nability to proceed with import restrictions, after there is an \nopportunity for consultation with Congress. Such consultation would \nhelp ensure that executive branch procedures and actions do not stray \nfrom Congress' intent in passing the 1983 act, and would thus help \nallay concerns of interested persons that the statutory criteria are \nnot being met.\n  One concern that I have heard repeatedly is that the CPAC and the \nagencies to which it reports have simply disregarded the multinational \nresponse requirement in recent actions imposing far-reaching \nrestrictions on cultural property. Central to our intention in drafting \nthe CCPIA was the principle that the United States will act to bar the \nimport of particular antiquities, but only as part of a concerted \ninternational response to a specific, severe problem of pillage. The \nrationale for this requirement is that one cannot effectively deter a \nserious situation of pillage of cultural properties if the United \nStates unilaterally closes its borders to the import of those \nproperties, and they find their way to markets in London, Munich, \nTokyo, or other art importing centers. Congress intended that the \nmultinational response requirement be taken seriously--indeed its \ninclusion ensured the passage of the 1983 Act. I am concerned that the \nexecutive branch may not be giving serious weight to this requirement.\n  I am distressed that the procedural changes proposed in S. 1696 \ncannot be made in this Congress. A fair administration of the 1983 act \nis vitally important to our citizens and our cultural life. The United \nStates has long encouraged free trade in artistic and cultural objects \nwhich has helped create a museum community in our Nation that has no \nequal. That policy of free interchange of cultural objects was narrowly \nmodified in the 1983 act to respond to specific, severe problems of \npillage. A diversion from this posture, which the current \nadministration of the law suggests, can deny the American public the \nopportunity to view, study, and appreciate cultural antiquities that \nreflect the multicultural heritage that is the essence of our nation.\n  I trust, and urge, that the next Congress will address these issues \nvigorously.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11878-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11878-S11885]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n            the commodity futures modernization act of 2000\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Commodity \nFutures Modernization Act of 2000 (``CFMA''), the proposed legislation \nto reauthorize the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC'') and \nto amend the Commodity Exchange Act (``CEA''). This legislation is the \nSenate companion of H.R. 5660, which Congressman Thomas Ewing \nintroduced yesterday in the House of Representatives and which is part \nof the final appropriations measure. As an original co-sponsor of the \nCFMA, I am proud to join Chairmen Gramm and Lugar in supporting \nlegislation to provide much needed regulatory relief to the United \nStates futures exchanges, to remove the eighteen-year-old ban on single \nstock futures, and to bring legal certainty in the multi-trillion \ndollar derivatives markets.\n  The CFMA gives a substantial boost to Chicago's futures industry and \nthe 200,000 jobs that depend on it. The Chicago futures exchanges will \nbe given an opportunity to compete on a level playing field with the \nworld markets. Burdensome federal regulations will be removed and a new \nregulatory structure will be implemented that will give our nation's \nmost important futures exchanges the ability to compete equally with \nworld markets in product innovation and the ever-changing demands of \nthe marketplace. Chicago's exchanges will now have the opportunity to \noffer single stock futures so that they can compete with global markets \nalready trading those types of futures. This is potentially an enormous \nmarket for Chicago's exchanges and U.S. investors. It goes without \nsaying that this market is absolutely necessary for Chicago to remain \nthe center for world futures trading.\n  I commend Chairman Lugar on his efforts to act swiftly to modernize \nthe CEA and to implement the recommendations of the President's Working \nGroup on Financial Markets (``PWG''). The challenges involved in such \nan undertaking are enormous and I appreciate Chairman Lugar's \nthoughtful and comprehensive approach to this complex task. As Chairman \nof the Subcommittee on Research, Nutrition, and General Legislation, I \nhave been actively involved in the evolution of the CFMA and am \ncommitted to working closely with Chairman Lugar, Chairman Gramm, and \nmy other colleagues to ensure that the United States derivatives \nmarkets remain strong, competitive, and viable. The CFMA codifies the \nrecommendations of the PWG to enhance legal certainty for over-the-\ncounter (``OTC'') derivatives by excluding from the CEA certain \nbilateral swaps entered into on a principal-to-principal basis by \neligible participants. The market for OTC derivatives has exploded over \nthe past two decades into a multi-trillion dollar industry. These large \nand sophisticated markets play an important role in the global economy \nand legal certainty is a critical consideration for parties to OTC \nderivative contracts. Accordingly, the CFMA recognizes that legal \ncertainty for OTC derivatives is vital to the continued competitiveness \nof the United States markets and achieves this certainty by excluding \nthese transactions from the CEA.\n  The provisions of the CFMA also address the problem that federal \nregulation has not adapted to the rapid growth of the financial markets \nand today serves as a substantial restriction on market competitiveness \nand modernization. In order for the United States to maintain the most \nefficient markets in the world, regulatory barriers to fair competition \nmust be removed. The CFMA reduces the inefficiencies of the CEA by \nremoving constraints on innovation and competitiveness and by \ntransforming the CFTC into an oversight agency with less front-line \nregulatory functions. The provisions for three kinds of trading \nfacilities with varying levels of regulation provide needed flexibility \nto both traditional exchanges and electronic trading facilities by \nbasing oversight of the futures markets on the types of products they \ntrade and on the investors they serve.\n  Finally, the CFMA removes the Accord's prohibitions on the trading of \nsingle stock futures and small indices. Stock index futures have \nmatured into vital financial management tools that enable a wide \nvariety of investment concerns to manage their risk of adverse price \nmovements. The options markets and swaps dealers offer customers risk \nmanagement tools and investment alternatives involving both sector \nindexes and single stock derivatives. It seems only fair that futures \nexchanges be allowed to compete in this important market.\n  The CFMA lifts the ban on single and index stock futures restrictions \nto allow the marketplace to decide whether these instruments would be \nuseful risk management tools and to enhance the ability of the U.S. \nfinancial markets to compete in the global marketplace. The bill \nreforms the Accord to allow both futures and securities exchanges to \ntrade these products under the jurisdiction of their current \nregulators. The CFMA also allows both the\n\n[[Page S11879]]\n\nSEC and the CFTC to enforce violations of their respective laws \nregardless of whether the products are traded on a futures or \nsecurities exchange and requires that the agencies share necessary \ninformation for enforcement purposes.\n  The CFMA represents an arduous effort to remove burdensome regulatory \nstructures and provide much needed legal certainty to the United States \nderivatives markets. This effort has produced comprehensive legislation \nthat is designed to remove impediments to innovation and regulatory \nbarriers to fair competition for the United States financial markets. \nThe positive impact of this legislation on Chicago's futures markets \ncannot be overstated. The CFMA is vital to Chicago remaining the \nderivatives capital of the world and gives Chicago's futures exchanges \nthe ability to lead the way in the potentially explosive single-stock \nfutures market.\n\n\n                    restricting cruise ship gambling\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would like to engage the Senator from \nHawaii in a colloquy regarding a provision of interest to him, that \nwould restrict cruise ships from gambling in the State of Hawaii. For \nthe benefit of our colleagues, I would like to ask the Senator if he \nwould explain the clear intent of this provision.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I would be happy to have a brief \ndiscussion with Chairman Stevens on this matter. As he knows, on many \noccasions I have expressed to my colleagues in this Chamber my strong \nopposition to gambling in the Hawaiian Islands. Our State of Hawaii is \none of only two states in the entire country that prohibits gambling of \nall kinds. When Federal laws, including the Gambling Devices \nTransportation Act, more commonly known as the Johnson Act, affecting \nthe ability of cruise ships to conduct gambling operations were relaxed \nover the past decade, I was involved in drafting those provisions to be \nsure that the longstanding Federal prohibition against the possession \nand operation of gambling devices be maintained with respect to the \nState of Hawaii. Unfortunately, I understand that a foreign cruise line \nseeks to exploit a loophole in Federal law and circumvent this long \nstanding prohibition. This legislation closes this loophole.\n  This recent announcement by a foreign cruise line--that is \nsubstantially owned by foreign gambling interests--to permanently based \na large cruise ship with an extensive casino on board in Hawaii for \nyear-round operation on cruises that will begin and end in Honolulu has \nprompted this amendment. This amendment ensure that there is no \nambiguity in the intent of the Johnson Act's application to the State \nof Hawaii by expressly preserving the act's original prohibition of the \ntransportation, possession, repair, and use of any gambling devices \naboard vessels that embark and disembark passengers in the State of \nHawaii, as defined in 19 C.F.R. 4.80a(a)4.\n  I want to make clear to my colleagues that this provision would not \naffect any State other than Hawaii. Moreover, it would not prohibit \ncurrent gambling operations on board cruise ships that, for example, \nbegin or end their cruises on the mainland or in foreign countries, \neven if they call at multiple ports in Hawaii, so long as the gambling \nfacilities are closed when the vessel is in Hawaii and the passengers \ndo not begin and end their trip in Hawaii. Passengers could either \nbegin or end their trip in the State, but could not do both. A vessel \nthat is operating in dedicated service in Hawaii, however, cannot \nescape the Johnson Act's broad prohibitions simply by calling at \nChristmas Island or some other similar foreign port.\n  I have made clear that I do not want gambling in Hawaii many time and \nin particular on the occasions that we have debated the Johnson Act and \ngambling on cruise ships. I have been unwavering in my position that \ngambling on voyages beginning and ending in Hawaii will not be accepted \npractice. This provision should clarify any ambiguity in the Johnson \nAct as to what types of gambling operations on board vessels are \nallowed and not allowed in Hawaii. I can assure my colleagues that if \ngambling interests believe they can exploit and circumvent the spirit \nand intent of Federal laws prohibiting gambling in Hawaii, I will be \nback in this Chamber to attempt to make the necessary changes to \ncontinue our State's longstanding prohibition on such activities.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we all recognize the Senator's diligence \nin keeping the gambling industry out of Hawaii. Would I be correct then \nsaying this provision would not have any impact on those cruise ships \nthat begin or end their voyages in a foreign port or on the mainland so \nlong as they don't gamble while in Hawaii?\n  Mr. INOUYE. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator for his explanation.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I appreciate the opportunity to explain this matter for \nour colleagues.\n\n\n               coal waste impoundment study clarification\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, conference report language has been added to \nH.R. 4577, the fiscal year 2001 Labor/HHS Appropriations bill to \naddress concerns about the safety of coal waste impoundments. A study, \nwhich is to be completed by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) in \nnine months, will be funded by monies included in the Mine Safety and \nHealth Administration's (MSHA) Fiscal Year 2001 appropriations. Because \nMSHA has regulatory authority for coal waste impoundment oversight, I \nhope that MSHA officials will play an active role throughout the course \nof the study. The NAS study is intended to review the coal waste \nimpoundments and report on viable methods and alternatives to prevent \nanother dam failure like the one that occurred in Martin County, \nKentucky, in October of this year.\n  I would like to clarify the understanding of the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Senate Labor/HHS Appropriations subcommittee regarding \nthis conference report language. Is it their understanding that the NAS \nstudy should involve the participation of experts to include, but not \nbe limited to, members of relevant state and federal agencies, such as \nthe Mine Safety and Health Administration, the Office of Surface Mining \nand Enforcement, the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as \nindustry, labor, citizen, and environmental groups, which have either \nbeen, or may be, impacted by impoundments in their areas? Further, in \naddition to addressing how best to assure the stability of existing \nimpoundments, is it the understanding of my distinguished colleagues \nthat this NAS study should also address alternative methods of coal \nmine waste disposal and placement in the future?\n  Mr. SPECTER. As I, too, have had a long-running interest in coal \nmining and health and safety matters, I thank the Senator for his \ninterest in this important coal matter. Yes, I believe that it is \nimportant for a range of stakeholders to be involved in this study as \nwell as to look at both the current and future issues related to coal \nwaste impoundments.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would like to thank the Senator from West Virginia for \nhis leadership on this subject. It is also my understanding that \nrelevant federal, state, industry, labor, citizen, and environmental \nparties should participate in this study so as to gain a broader range \nof views and recommendations on the current problem and future \nsolutions in order to prevent such problems as he has described from \noccurring again.\n\n\n                        Swan Lake-Tyee Intertie\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished \nchairman of the Senate Interior Appropriations subcommittee in a short \ndiscussion on an item which is included on page 171 of the conference \nreport on the recently passed Interior appropriations bill, H.R. 4578. \nIn that bill, there is a reference to utilizing the Alaska ``Job in the \nWoods'' program for projects ``that enhance the southeast Alaska \neconomy, such as the southeast Alaska intertie.'' May I inquire of the \ndistinguished chairman if that language refers specifically to the \ncurrently proposed Swan Lake-Lake Tyee Intertie project for which the \nForest Service completed its final environmental impact statement and \nissued its record of decision on August 29, 1997?\n  Mr. GORTON. The distinguished chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee is correct. That reference is specifically intended to refer \nto the Swan Lake-Tyee Intertie project and was inadvertently referred \nto as the southeast Alaska intertie. I hope the Record\n\n[[Page S11880]]\n\nwill reflect this clarification and will result in an expeditious use \nof the funds.\n\n\n                                 liheap\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. Chairman, as you know, many members on both sides of \nthe aisle have concerns about the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance \nProgram (LIHEAP) and the lack of an advance appropriation for that \nprogram in fiscal year 2002. As you know, home heating costs have \nskyrocketed over the past year in many areas of the country. The LIHEAP \nprogram helps over four million low-income households with their \nheating bills. Usually this appropriations bill includes advance \nfunding for LIHEAP so that states have time to plan their program, but \ndue to a provision in the budget resolution capping advance \nappropriations we were not able to do so this year.\n  I hope, as I know you do, that we finish our work on this bill before \nOctober 1 next year. But if we do not, I think we should do everything \nwe can to see that any continuing resolution for fiscal year 2002 would \ninclude sufficient funds for States to properly run their LIHEAP \nprograms.\n  Mr. SPECTER. As you know, I have been a strong supporter of the \nLIHEAP program and I am aware of how essential the program becomes in \ntimes of high fuel prices. While I hope that a continuing resolution \nwill not be necessary next year, I would certainly support including \nfunding for the full winter season in the first continuing resolution \nfor fiscal year 2002, if that is necessary.\n\n\n                        catholic social services\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished \nchairman of the Senate VA-HUD Appropriations subcommittee in a short \ndiscussion on an item which is included on page 79 of the Conference \nReport H. Rept. 106-988 (H.R. 4635) for the VA-HUD appropriations bill. \nIn that bill, there is funding available for Catholic Community \nServices. I am told that reference is incorrect and that the funding \nshould actually be made available for Catholic Social Services for \nrenovations and construction at the Brother Francis Shelter and AWAIC's \ntransitional housing. I would ask the distinguished subcommittee \nchairman whether it was his understanding that Catholic Social Services \nwas the intended recipient of this funding rather than Catholic \nCommunity Services, and if so, would the chairman make note of this for \nthe Record?\n  Mr. BOND. The distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee \nis correct. That reference is specifically intended to refer to \nCatholic Social Services for renovations and construction at the \nBrother Francis Shelter and AWAIC's transitional housing and was \ninadvertently referred to as Catholic Community Services. I hope the \nRecord will reflect this clarification and will result in an \nexpeditious use of the funds.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank my colleague.\n\n\n                       authoritative root server\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Will the chairman yield for purposes of a colloquy?\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield to the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. I understand that the Internet Corporation for Assigned \nNames and Numbers, ICANN, intends to request that the Department of \nCommerce transfer the Internet's authoritative root server to ICANN's \ncontrol. The authoritative root server is the foundation of the \nInternet, which cannot function without it. Would the chairman agree \nthat the Department of Commerce should retain control of the \nauthoritative root server until the appropriate committees of Congress \nhave reviewed the legality, appropriateness and implications of such a \ntransfer?\n  Mr. GREGG. I agree with the Senator from Montana that Congress should \nbe given the opportunity to exercise its oversight responsibility over \nthis important issue.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Will the chairman yield to me on this issue?\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield to the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. Chairman, I would like to join you in supporting \nthe statements made by the Senator from Montana. As managers of the \nCommerce, Justice, State bill, you and I have the responsibility and \nexpectation of providing agencies under our jurisdiction with \ncongressional input and guidance. On an issue of this great \nimportance--transferring the a-root server to ICANN--it is critical we \ncarefully look at the implications a decision like this would have.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Will the chairman yield to me on this issue?\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield to the Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRY. I share the concerns expressed by the Senators from \nMontana and South Carolina about the premature transfer of the \nauthoritative root server to ICANN. Control of this root server \nincludes the power to dramatically affect all aspects of Internet \nactivity, including e-commerce and our national security. The \nDepartment of Commerce should not transfer the root server to ICANN \nuntil Congress has had the opportunity to review the wisdom of such a \ntransfer.\n  Mr. GREGG. I agree with the views expressed by my ranking member, \nSenator Hollings, and the Senators from Washington and Montana on this \nmatter.\n\n\n                           Antidumping duties\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to commend the chairman of \nthe Finance Committee for his bipartisan efforts which resulted in the \npassage of section 1425 of H.R. 4868, the Miscellaneous Tariff Act. \nThis section is intended to address an unfortunate situation involving \nthe imposition of antidumping duties on a number of entries of conveyor \nchain from Japan. At the time of these entries, the applicable \nantidumping duty cash deposit rate was 0 percent. As a result, no cash \ndeposits were made on these entries by the U.S. importer. Through no \nfault of the U.S. Customs Service, the antidumping duties and interest \nsubsequently imposed when these entries were liquidated as a result of \nthe Department of Commerce administrative review process now represents \na severe and unanticipated hardship on the U.S. importer, Drives, Inc., \nbased in Fulton, Illinois. This legislation is intended to address this \nsituation by having the Customs Service reliquidate the entries at the \nantidumping duty cash deposit rate in effect at the time of entry.\n  Mr. ROTH. The senior Senator from Illinois is correct and I thank him \nfor his kind words. He is correct with regard to the purpose and \nintended effect of this section. My understanding is that the \nantidumping duty order covering these entries has recently been \nrevoked. I also understand that the domestic industry association that \nwas the complainant in the dumping proceedings is aware of this \nlegislation and does not object.\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is correct. In accordance with this legislation, the \nidentified entries will be re-liquidated with no antidumping duties \nassessed. Moreover, no interest charges which relate in any way to \nantidumping duties will be assessed. Since the deposit rate at the time \nof entry of all of the identified entries was 0 percent, this will have \nthe effect of liquidating the entries at the cash deposit rate in \neffect at the time of entry.\n  Mr. ROTH. We should note for the record that during the drafting of \nthis legislation, a few words were inadvertently left out, with the \nunintended consequence of the language being not as clear as we would \nlike for Customs' interpretation. It was our intent with this \nlegislation that re-liquidation should occur within 90 days of \nenactment. This was the intent of the Congress when it reviewed and \npassed this section.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The senior Senator from Delaware is correct. There was a \nmistake made in drafting the language. Regardless, the intent of the \noriginal legislation, and the intent that can still be interpreted from \nthe law as enacted, is to have the Customs Service re-liquidate the \nentries at the antidumping duty cash deposit rate in effect at the time \nof entry. I thank the Senator from Delaware for his guidance and \nappreciate working with him on a bipartisan basis.\n  Mr. ROTH. I thank the Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                            asbestos victims\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. I notice my colleague from Ohio, Senator Voinovich is on \nthe floor as well as the majority leader. I think I speak for my \ncolleague when I say we are extremely disappointed that our bill, S. \n2955, was not able to be passed in this Congress. That bill is very \nimportant to asbestos victims and two of our State's largest employers.\n\n[[Page S11881]]\n\nAs we all probably know, our nation is facing an asbestos litigation \ncrisis. A crisis for which the federal government, in my opinion, \nshares responsibility. From World War II through the Vietnam war, the \ngovernment mandated the use of asbestos to insulate our naval fleet \nfrom secondary fires. This mandate is the cause of many tragic \ndisabilities. Unfortunately, while the federal government would be one \nof the largest asbestos defenders due to this mandate, an aggressive \nand successful litigation strategy to assert sovereign immunity has \nallowed them to evade any monetary culpability.\n  Since the federal government is not paying their fair share of the \ncosts, the former asbestos manufacturers are burdened with asbestos \nclaims. Of the approximately 30 original core defendants, over two \ndozen have gone bankrupt, in large part due to asbestos claims. The \nsituation has reached the crisis stage. Good companies, providing good \njobs, and providing payments to victims, are in significant peril. The \nrecent bankruptcies of several former asbestos manufacturers have \nplaced an even more overwhelming burden on the remaining defendants. \nDue to joint and several liability, the remaining defendant companies \nare now paying an even higher share of asbestos claims. The markets \nhave taken note. Stock market values are declining, making it more and \nmore difficult for these companies to receive the financing they need \nto survive. The very future of these companies, the very future of \nthese jobs are at stake.\n  But, it is not just the companies who are suffering. Asbestos victims \nare also suffering greatly. They are not receiving the awards to which \nthey are entitled. If something is not done to correct this situation, \ngood companies will continue to go bankrupt, good jobs will continue to \nbe lost, and asbestos victims will not receive any compensation.\n  We must act now to do this. I understand the majority leader \nunderstands and appreciates the urgency of this situation. I would ask \nthat the bill that Senator Voinovich and I have introduced would be one \nof the first bills considered when we return for the 107th.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I wholeheartedly agree with my colleague, Senator \nDeWine. I do not think we can stress enough that this really is a \nmatter of survival for these companies and their employees. The \ngovernment bears some responsibility here, we simply must get this bill \ndone as soon as possible. The companies, their workers, and asbestos \nvictims--after all when the companies go bankrupt it affects payments \nto victims--need certainty that this will be brought to the Senate \nfloor at the earliest possible date next year. We need to work to keep \nthese companies afloat.\n  Mr. LOTT. I appreciate the concerns of the two Senators from Ohio. \nThey have made a very strong and convincing case on the need for a \nsolution to this problem. I pledge to work with them to see that this \nissue is addressed as early as possible in the 107th Congress.\n\n\n              disaster-resistant wood construction program\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, as you know, natural disasters exact a \ntremendous toll on our nation. In just two decades (1975-1994), 24,000 \nindividuals nationwide lost their lives to natural disasters. An \nadditional 100,000 were injured, and the resulting property damage \nreached a staggering $500 billion.\n  Hurricanes are responsible for 80 percent of these $500 billion in \ndamages. The continued rapid building of homes and commercial \nfacilities along our coastlines increases the potential for even higher \nnatural disaster costs in the future. Since Congress often responds to \nthese disasters with emergency supplemental appropriations, it makes \nsense to also support the development of technologies and building \ntechniques to mitigate damage resulting from hurricanes and other \nnatural disasters.\n  Mr. GREGG. I agree with my distinguished colleague from Maine that we \nneed to do what we can to mitigate the devastation caused each year by \nnatural disasters. Exciting new building techniques and technologies \nhold promise in this regard.\n  Ms. COLLINS. They certainly do. And one of the most exciting \ntechnologies involve wood composites. The fact is, most natural \ndisasters directly affect wood construction, which is used for 99 \npercent of houses constructed nationally. The University of Maine \nAdvanced Engineered Wood Composites Center (AEWC) has developed new \ntechnologies to reinforce wood construction materials with fiberglass \nmaterial. These fiberglass-reinforced wood composites are two to three \ntimes stronger, more impact resistant and more ductile than their \nunreinforced counterparts. Homes and buildings constructed with these \nadvanced materials should greatly enhance occupant protection from \nhurricanes, earthquakes, tornadic missiles, and other natural threats. \nIn addition to their benefits in new construction, these technologies \ncan be used to retrofit and strengthen existing wood buildings. The \nUniversity of Maine and its industry partners require $4 million in \nfiscal year 2001 funds to complete material and wood panel testing on \nthese technologies, and to start developing building code provisions to \ntransition the new disaster resistant panels into residential and \ncommercial construction.\n  I commend my good friends, Chairman Gregg and the subcommittee's \nranking member, Senator Hollings, for their efforts thus far to \nallocate additional funds to the National Institute of Standards \nScientific and Technical Research Services programs. I am particularly \npleased with the additional funds that have been allocated to the NIST \nBuilding and Fire Research Laboratory, which is ideally suited to \ndevelop improved building technologies resistant to natural disaster.\n  I would strongly encourage the NIST Building and Fire Research Lab to \nsupport development work on advanced wood composites, demonstrate the \nperformance of reinforced-wood composites under simulated hurricane \nwind conditions, and introduce the new construction materials into \nnational building codes and standards.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank my good friend and colleague, Senator Collins, \nfor her kind remarks regarding this subcommittee's work on the FY '01 \nCommerce, Justice, State, and judiciary appropriations bill. I \nrecognize the importance of investing in advanced building technologies \nthat can resist damage from hurricanes. As you know, South Carolina has \nexperienced several costly and disastrous hurricanes. Yet our coastal \neconomy continues to expand and to serve as a commercial and recreation \nresource to our State and the Nation.\n  I agree with my colleague that development of fiberglass-reinforced \nwood composites is important, and I also encourage the National \nInstitute of Standards and Technology to support the development and \ndeployment of these materials. Improvements to wood building materials \nwill result in direct benefits to the people of South Carolina and all \nother coastal communities in the United States.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank my distinguished colleague from Maine as well and \nshare her concerns about the impact of natural disasters on the lives \nof people and on the economy. In the past, government has worked \neffectively with the building industry to make homes and commercial \nbuildings better and safer through building codes and standards, and by \nsupporting improvements in building technology.\n  The subcommittee is very interested in the contributions that the \nNIST Building and Fire Research Laboratory can make to improve the \nquality of building products. Fiberglass-reinforced wood composites can \ngreatly increase the safety of homes subjected to natural disasters. I \nagree that the National Institute of Standards should pursue with the \nUniversity of Maine the development and demonstration of fiberglass-\nreinforced wood composites for improved building materials.\n\n\n            expansion of a successful executive mba program\n\n  Mr. L. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to clarify the intent of \nthe conferees regarding a provision in the conference report \naccompanying H.R. 4576, FY01 Defense appropriations bill (H. Rept. 106-\n754). Within this legislation is $2 million for the expansion of a \nsuccessful Executive MBA program, jointly administered by the Naval \nUndersea Warfare Center (NUWC), Newport, Rhode Island and Bryant \nCollege, Smithfield, Rhode Island. The funding\n\n[[Page S11882]]\n\nwill be used to expand the current student enrollment from 30 to 60 \nNavy personnel and to expand and upgrade Bryant's technical \ncapabilities. Specifically, funds will be used to expand and upgrade \nBryant's network bandwidth to gigabit speed, as well as fund \ntechnological enhancements to Bryant's new Bello Center for Information \nand Technology, allowing Executive MBA students better access to \nvaluable information resources. This, in turn, will assist them in \ntheir studies at Bryant. The $2 million for the expansion of this \nprogram will not only allow 30 more military/government personnel to \nearn an MBA at Bryant, but will link those students with expanded \ntechnical resources at Bryant. This linkage will allow Executive MBA \nstudents access to all information available within Bryant's resources \nand create the capability to interact with each other and with other \nstudents on and off campus.\n  Is this description what the conferees intend?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes, that is correct.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I do not mean to be the skunk at the \npicnic party, but I believe there are some realities to be faced. Those \nrealities are that we are establishing on the last evening of the 106th \nCongress some standards that are going to be either positive paths \ntowards greater cooperation in the next Congress or will be impediments \nto achieving success in what will be the most divided National \nGovernment in our Nation's history.\n  I am afraid what we are doing tonight will not make a positive \ncontribution. The fact is that at 7:08 p.m. on a Friday evening, we are \ntaking up in one enormous piece of legislation--a piece of legislation \nwhich dwarfs the New York City telephone directory in size, a piece of \nlegislation which not one single Member of this body or the House of \nRepresentatives has ever had an opportunity to read.\n  The fact that we are about to adopt this legislation without the \nnormal debate and opportunity to understand what is in this bill is not \na positive sign because, in my judgment, the kinds of bipartisan \ncooperation that we will require in the future are going to be based \nupon respect, understanding, and a due regard for our constituents who \nalso deserve to be served better than we are doing this evening.\n  It also, frankly, has to be based on a level of trust among Members \nwhen commitments are made, that there is a sense of a solemn \nobligation. This body cannot function, as no human institution can \nfunction, unless there is a fundamental level of trust and regard among \nits membership. This document does not reflect that trust.\n  My fundamental concern about this appropriations bill, which will \nexpend approximately $180 billion of our taxpayers' money, is that it \ntakes the wrong fundamental path.\n  Contrary to myth, the 21st century has not begun. The new century \nwill actually commence at 12:01 a.m. on January 1, 2001. The first \nCongress of the new millennium, the 107th Congress, will convene on \nJanuary 3. This historic Congress will find itself at the proverbial \ncommencement of the century and a fork in the road. Two very different \nfiscal paths will lie in front of it.\n  The path we select will play a major role in shaping our country's \nfuture in the 21st century. One path maintains the fiscal discipline \nthat has marked the latter half of this decade. It has played an \nintegral part in creating the longest economic expansion in U.S. \nhistory. This expansion has created over 20 million jobs since 1993. It \nhas reduced unemployment to a 30-year low of 3.9 percent in October of \nthis year. During all of this, inflation has remained at its lowest \ncore rate since 1965. Those are all achievements for which we can take \nconsiderable pride.\n  This first path views the projected budget surplus as a means to \ncontinue this economic success by continuing to pay down the national \ndebt.\n  This first path also recognizes that a portion of the surplus should \nbe used to address some of the long-time intergenerational challenges \nwhich are confronting our Nation--securing Social Security's future and \nmodernizing Medicaid. Social Security is in fine shape today. Payroll \ntax revenues exceed the funds needed to pay current benefits by record \namounts.\n  This positive cash-flow, however, will not last long. In just 15 \nyears, payroll tax revenue will no longer be sufficient to pay \nbenefits. We need to act now to strengthen the program's finances so \nthat today's workers and tomorrow's retirees will have the security of \nknowing that their Social Security benefits will also be paid.\n  Medicare faces a similar long-term funding shortfall, only it begins \n5 years earlier, in 2010. In addition, Medicare has one substantial \ndeficiency. That is its focus on sickness rather than wellness. Thus, \nMedicare needs to be fundamentally reformed to conform with modern \nmedicine and the desires of its beneficiaries. That will require the \ninclusion in Medicare of a prescription drug benefit. Virtually every \npreventive program currently in use has prescription drugs as a \nsubstantial component of its treatment modality. A portion of the \nsurplus should be devoted to fixing these deficiencies in Social \nSecurity and Medicare.\n  I just described the first path. There is a second path. That \nalternate path veers off to a far different destination. That path \nfocuses on short-term desires, the here and now, and foregoes fiscal \ndiscipline in favor of new spending programs and tax cuts. It views the \nsurplus as a giant windfall to be doled out to favored constituencies \nas if Christmas lasted 365 days. In short, this is a path back to the \npast.\n  This final bill of the 106th Congress represents another step down \nthe wrong path, the path to the past. The Senate is considering the \nfinal 2001 appropriations bill, a bill that combines the Department of \nLabor and HHS, the Departments of Treasury, Postal, and the legislative \nbranch. This agreement also clears the Department of Commerce, \nDepartment of State, and Department of Justice bill for signature.\n  Discretionary spending in these combined bills totals nearly $182 \nbillion. This bill follows the pattern established by most of the \nprevious appropriations bills considered by the Senate. Its total \nspending greatly exceeds the standard established by the Senate in the \nbudget resolution adopted in April of this year. Section 206 of the \nbudget resolution proposed a cap on discretionary appropriation \nspending for the fiscal year 2001 at $600 billion. That level would \nhave allowed discretionary spending to grow at a rate that was above \ninflation, a rate of approximately 3.5 percent. What do we have before \nthe Senate at 7:15 in the evening of December 15? We have a bill which \nallows spending to grow by 8 percent, more than twice that tolerated \nunder the budget resolution.\n  I admit I support many of the programs funded in this bill, but we \nmust exercise restraint. We must establish some sense of priorities. I \nhave spoken on the Senate floor on several occasions earlier this year \nto decry specific appropriations bills as they were being considered. \nThe common complaint I have had with each of these bills has been that \nthey have been crafted in a vacuum without a clearly defined blueprint \nto give Congress the full picture of the implications of its actions \nbefore it acts. It is as if a carpenter about to build a home would \nstart to build the living room without any awareness of what the rest \nof the house was going to look like.\n  The budget resolution should have provided exactly such a blueprint. \nBut it has failed to do so. A good part of the reason it has failed to \ndo so is that it was developed without the full participation of all \nMembers of the Senate. It was a partisan document, representing one \npoint of view but not providing the context around which all Members of \nthis body as reflective of the public of the United States could give \ntheir support. In addition, it was crafted with wholly unrealistic \nexpectations of where we were headed.\n  Let me demonstrate in this chart back to the year 1997. In 1997, we \npassed a budget resolution that capped discretionary spending at $528 \nbillion; we actually spent $538 billion. By 1998, our commitment to \nfiscal discipline had grown stronger and we only exceeded the budget \nresolution by $2 billion. Since that year, every year, we have had \nsubstantial deviations from our budget resolution. In every year, we \nhave spent substantially more than we had committed ourselves to do in \nour budget resolution.\n\n  To go back to that example of the carpenter and the house, it is as \nif the family said: we have a budget. We can afford, based on our \nincome, to build a\n\n[[Page S11883]]\n\n$100,000 house. But they build a $125,000 house which stretches their \nfinancial capability.\n  This year we had a resolution that said we spent $600 billion; with \nthis legislation tonight, we will spend $634 billion. We have overspent \nour budget by $34 billion. This chart exposes the failure of our \ncurrent budget process. Each year we pass a budget resolution which \nestablishes limits, and each year we break the resolution.\n  The fiscal year 1999 budget resolution which was supposed to be a \nspending limit of $533 billion had a final tally of $583 billion. In \nthe year 2000, the limit was supposed to be $540 billion and the final \ntally was $587 billion. As I indicated, this year was supposed to be \n$600 billion and we have concluded now at $634 billion.\n  The last 3 years highlight the dangers of considering spending bills \nwithout a credible budget, one that establishes reasonable parameters \nand results from the participation of both parties.\n  While that is my fundamental objection to this budget and why I will \nrequest to be counted as voting no when we take the final voice vote on \nthis matter, this legislation also includes changes to the Medicare \nprogram that will result in greater payments to providers. This bill \nincreases payments to Medicare providers by $35 billion over the next 5 \nyears, $85 billion over the next 10 years. My primary objection to \nthese changes is that too much of the $35 billion for the first 5 years \nand $85 billion for the next decade is funneled into one aspect of the \nMedicare program--health maintenance organizations, HMOs. In my \nopinion, and more importantly, in the opinion of the experts, the HMOs \ndo not need and cannot justify the level of additional appropriations \nwhich they are about to receive.\n  While I appreciate the modest improvements for beneficiaries which \nare included in this bill, the fact remains that HMOs, which enroll \nless than one out of six Medicare beneficiaries, will receive almost \none-third of the overall funding. I am alarmed by increasing payments \nto HMOs because we are told by the experts that the payments are \nalready too high. The General Accounting Office says under current law:\n\n       Medicare's overly generous payment rates to HMOs well \n     exceed what Medicare would have paid had these individuals \n     remained in the traditional fee-for-service program.\n\n  The General Accounting Office concluded that Medicare HMOs have never \nbeen a bargain for the taxpayers. Increasing HMO payments will not keep \nthem from leaving the markets where they are most needed.\n  One of the several outrages in this area is the requests that were \nmade that if we were going to provide this generous additional payment \nto HMOs, one-third of the money for less than one-sixth of the Medicare \nbeneficiaries, that they would have to commit they would not, as they \nhave done in many areas in my State and virtually every other State, \npack up leaving beneficiaries without coverage.\n  Or in other areas, as I recently experienced in the city of \nJacksonville, HMOs have been driving down the benefits within their \nplans. I found while working at a pharmacy in Jacksonville earlier this \nyear, most of the HMOs in that city have now put a cap on the annual \npayments of prescription drugs, and that cap is $500. As anyone who \nknows about the cost of prescription drugs, a $500 annual limit, \nparticularly for an elderly population, is a very meager benefit. If \nyou take this overly generous additional payment, you have to make some \ncommitments to the beneficiaries relative to your willingness to stay \nand serve in the communities where you are currently providing services \nand to maintain your service benefit level. None of that is in this \nfinal bill. This is a check being written with no response, in terms of \nprotection for beneficiaries.\n\n  According to the testimony from Gail Wilensky, chair of the Medicare \nPayment Advisory Commission, she states that plan withdrawals--that is, \nwithdrawals from HMOs:\n\n       . . . have been disproportionately lower in counties where \n     payment growth has been the most constrained.\n\n  What Ms. Wilensky is saying is that where you have constrained \nreimbursements to HMOs, you have less withdrawals than you do where you \nare, as we proposed to be in this legislation, excessively generous.\n  It comes down to priorities. Should we spend billions on HMOs or try \nto help frail and low-income seniors, people with disabilities and \nchildren?\n  The managed care industry and its advocates in Congress have thwarted \nevery effort to reform the Medicare+Choice Program so that it does what \nit was designed to do--save money while providing reliable, effective \nhealth care services.\n  A prime example of this occurred almost a year ago in this Chamber. \nIn 1997, under the Balanced Budget Act, we provided for two \ndemonstration projects to provide for the outrageous idea that there be \ncompetitive bidding among HMOs, to let the marketplace--which we all \nlaud as being the best distributor of resources--let the marketplace \ndecide what should an HMO be paid. This happens to be the same practice \nwhich is used in the private sector in its selection of HMOs and in \nsome of the largest public employee HMO plans. Implementation of such a \nprocess had the potential of saving taxpayers and the Medicare program \nmillions of dollars. It could have ensured that HMOs with the best bids \nwere awarded contracts. It would have eliminated the discrimination \nagainst rural and smaller communities vis-a-vis the large communities \nwhich now get the largest HMO reimbursement.\n  Unfortunately for the American public, last year the managed care \nindustry convinced their friends in Congress to beat back even these \ntwo demonstration projects. In so doing, they assured that we would not \nhave a competitive system, a system that based contracts on merit. In \nfact, they would not have to compete at all. In fact, there would be no \nbasis by demonstration of what would be the potential benefits to \ncompetition.\n  This year the HMOs have launched a multimillion-dollar lobbying \neffort to pressure Congress to increase their payment rates, and they \nhave been successful. The HMOs are claiming that their current rates \nare too low, yet these are the same HMOs that committed congressional \nhomicide when they killed a proposal that would have allowed a more \nmarket oriented system which would have resulted in higher \nreimbursement rates if the market indicated that was appropriate. This \nis the equivalent of a man shooting his mother and father and throwing \nhimself on the mercy of the court because he is an orphan.\n  Worse yet, the bill fails to provide adequate accountability \nrequirements for these plans. The House bill, when it was originally \npassed, required that any new funds be used for beneficiary \nimprovements. This bill, this conference bill, contains no such \nrequirement.\n  To be honest, there are some high points in this bill, as few and far \nbetween as they might be. I was pleased to learn the bill being \nconsidered added new preventive benefits for Medicare beneficiaries.\n\n  I strongly believe Medicare must be reformed from a system based on \nillness to one based on maintaining the highest standard of health. I \nhave introduced legislation to this effect. The benefits I included \nwere based on recommendations made by the experts in the field: the \nUnited States Preventive Services Task Force. Therefore, I was \ndisappointed to find that this bill fails to provide Medicare coverage \nfor hypertension screening and smoking cessation counseling, which are \nthe highest two priorities as identified by the United States \nPrevention Services Task Force in its ``Guide to Clinical Preventive \nServices.''\n  This bill also provides access to nutrition therapy for people with \nrenal disease and diabetes, but leaves out the largest group of \nindividuals for whom the Institute of Medicine recommends nutrition \ntherapy, people with cardiovascular disease. This is the recommendation \nof the Institute of Medicine, a recommendation which has been \npolitically rejected.\n  I believe strongly that additions to the Medicare program must be \nbased on scientific evidence and medical science, not on the power of a \nparticular lobbying group or the bias of a single Member. It appears to \nme that instead of taking a rational, scientific approach to \nprevention, the Members who constructed this Medicare add-back \nprovision used a ``disease of the month'' philosophy, leaving those who\n\n[[Page S11884]]\n\nneed help the most without relevant new Medicare services.\n  When I asked why did the authors of this bill ignore the expert \nrecommendations, why did they provide that seniors with cardiovascular \ndisease could not take advantage of the nutrition therapy, what was the \nanswer? I was told that it was excluded because it was too expensive.\n  It does not take a Sherlock Holmes, or even a Dr. Watson, to \nunderstand what is happening. This bill provides $1.5 billion over 5 \nyears for prevention services to our older citizens. It provides a \nwhopping $11.1 billion for the HMO industry. Clearly, the money is \nthere but the real goal is not to direct it to the greatest need. It \nis, rather, to herd seniors into HMOs as a means of avoiding the \naddition of a meaningful Medicare prescription drug benefit for our \nNation's seniors.\n  Whether you believe in the broad Government subsidization of the \nmanaged care industry or in providing benefits to seniors and children, \nwe should all agree that taxpayers' money should be spent responsibly. \nThis legislation does not meet that test. Congress has the \nresponsibility to make certain that the payment increases we offer are \nbased on actual data rather than anecdotal evidence or speculation. How \ncan we justify that over the next 10 years the managed care industry--\nMr. President, I ask you and our Members to listen to this startling \nfact--over the next 10 years the HMO industry will walk away with \nalmost the same amount of funding increase as hospitals, home health \ncare centers, skilled nursing facilities, community health centers, and \nthe beneficiaries combined. That allocation makes no sense.\n  One of the most appalling omissions of this bill is the exclusion of \na provision which would have given the States the option, under another \nimportant program, Medicaid and children's health insurance coverage, \nto make that coverage available to legal immigrant children and \npregnant women.\n  Current census data shows us that last year nearly half of low-income \nimmigrant children in America had no health coverage. Congressional \nRepublicans and Democrats, Governors--and I am proud to say including \nGov. Jeb Bush of the State of Florida, Christie Todd Whitman of New \nJersey, Paul Cellucci of Massachusetts, and the Clinton \nadministration--have been advocating for the inclusion of this \ncommonsense provision in this balanced budget add-back bill. But some \nin Congress have opposed the inclusion of a provision that will provide \nhealth care coverage for indigent immigrant women and children, arguing \nthat the welfare reform law removed legal immigrants from the health \nrolls.\n\n  There was a reason why they were removed, and that reason was money. \nBy limiting the number of people eligible for Medicaid and children's \nhealth insurance, the Federal Government was able to save some dollars. \nThis provision had nothing to do with the overall worthy goals of \nwelfare reform, which were encouraging self-reliance, self-sufficiency, \nand discouraging single parenting. There is no evidence that legal \nimmigrants come to the United States to secure health benefits. In \nfact, in the last decade immigrants have been moving from high benefit \nStates such as California and New York to low benefit States such as \nNorth Carolina and Virginia.\n  There is also no denying that the money to cover this population of \napproximately 200,000 persons is available if we choose to use it. The \nproof is covering children and pregnant women is not only humane, it is \nfiscally responsible. The Medicare ``give back'' package is aimed at \nkeeping strapped hospitals solvent. These same struggling hospitals \nbear the brunt of providing uncompensated emergency room care for \nchildren without health insurance whose families cannot afford to pay. \nTaxpayers are eventually going to wind up paying the cost of citizen \nchildren born prematurely because their legal immigrant mothers could \nnot get prenatal care.\n  This bill is disturbing for both what it has and what it does not \nhave. As I said, it does not have a clear blueprint towards a path of \nsustained fiscal responsibility.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of my \nremarks an article written by Dr. Robert Reischauer entitled ``Bye-Bye \nSurplus'' be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Dr. Reischauer outlines the four ingredients present in \ntoday's political environment that are likely to lead to a feeding \nfrenzy that will lay waste to the surplus that we have until now \nguarded. Those ingredients are: No. 1, the need for the next President \nto affirm his administration's legitimacy; No. 2, even larger budget \nprovisions; and a compliant Congress, and finally a weakening economy.\n  Why should we worry about all this? Why should we at this stage, at \n7:35 on a Friday evening, suddenly become exercised about the issue of \nfiscal discipline? Some budget observers believe the Federal surplus \nmay be revised upward by as much as $1 trillion when the new budget \nestimates are revealed. If that is the case, the unified budget surplus \nfor the next 10 years will rise to roughly $5.5 trillion.\n  Given these larger surplus projections, one may ask why Americans \nshould be concerned with the deterioration of budget discipline. \nAmericans should worry because Congress is frittering away the hard-won \nsurplus without a real plan for utilizing those surpluses, without \naddressing the long-term, major challenges facing Americans--Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and paying down a $5.5 trillion national debt. \nAmericans should care because we are sleepwalking through the surplus. \nWe are denying ourselves the chance to face major national challenges. \nWe are leaving to our grandchildren the credit card bills that our \ngeneration has accumulated.\n  The Congressional Budget Office recently released its long-term \nbudget outlook. The findings in that report are not encouraging, but \nthey are not surprising. That may explain why the report garnered such \nlittle attention.\n  What were the Congressional Budget Office findings?\n  The Federal Government spending on health and retirement programs--\nMedicare, Medicaid, Social Security--will dominate the long-term budget \noutlook. Spending on major health and retirement programs will more \nthan double, rising from 7.5 percent of gross domestic product today to \n16.7 percent 40 years from now. Why? The retirement of the baby boom \ngeneration will drastically increase the number of Americans receiving \nretirement and health care benefits, and the cost of providing health \ncare is growing faster than the overall economy.\n  Saving most or all of the budget surpluses that CBO projects over the \nnext 10 years--using them to pay down the debt--would have a positive \nimpact on these projections and substantially delay the emergence of a \nserious fiscal imbalance.\n  There could be no more clear delineation of the long-term problem. \nEqually clear is the proffered outline of the short-term steps Congress \ncan take to begin to address this problem: Save the surplus; pay down \nthe debt.\n  Yet despite the obvious, Congress seems content to take the easier \npath and to fritter away the surplus. We have an obligation not to let \nthis happen.\n  The ugly days of deficits taught Congress some very valuable lessons. \nOne of those lessons was the need to prioritize. We all have \nexpectations. We all are representing our constituents to the best of \nour ability. We all have a sense of our national responsibility. But \nthe tool that forced us to do what was required was the one that said \nthat for each additional dollar of spending, a dollar of spending had \nto be reduced or a dollar of taxes had to be raised. That is what \ndiscipline is about.\n  The surplus has eroded that discipline. We are failing the American \npublic by not having honest, open debate about the tradeoffs that are \nnecessary if we create programs, build projects, or cut taxes.\n  Few Congresses in the history of this Nation have squandered their \nopportunities as much as the 106th. Few Congresses in the history of \nthis Nation have had the opportunity of redemption that awaits the \n107th Congress. Few Congresses will be judged more harshly for \navoiding, trivializing, and ultimately failing to seize that \nopportunity.\n\n[[Page S11885]]\n\n  For those reasons, I have asked that I be recorded as ``no'' on the \nfinal vote on the omnibus appropriations bill.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Dec. 5, 2000]\n\n                            Bye-Bye, Surplus\n\n                       (By Robert D. Reischauer)\n\n       A president with no mandate to pursue his campaign \n     promises. A Congress hardened by four years of partisan \n     combat, scarred by a bitter election and immobilized by the \n     lack of a party with a clear majority. Isn't this the recipe \n     for continued gridlock? Won't legislative paralysis leave the \n     growing budget surpluses safe from plunder for another two \n     years?\n       Don't bet on it. A torrent of legislation that squanders \n     much of the projected surplus is much more likely than \n     continued gridlock, because four key ingredients needed to \n     cook up a fiscal feast of historic proportions will all be \n     present next year.\n       First, there will be the new president's desperate need to \n     affirm his administration's legitimacy. There's no better way \n     to do this than to quickly build a solid record of \n     legislative accomplishment, one that convinces Americans that \n     the era of partisan gridlock is over and the new occupant of \n     the Oval Office deserves to be president of all the people, \n     even if he didn't win a convincing majority of the popular \n     vote.\n       The second ingredient will be new and even larger \n     projections of future surpluses. These will make the \n     president's legislative agenda look like the well-deserved \n     reward for a decade of fiscal fasting rather than a return to \n     reckless budget profligacy. During the presidential campaign, \n     the two candidates debated how best to divide an estimated \n     $2.2 trillion 10-year surplus among tax cuts, spending \n     increases and debt reduction. The budget offices' new \n     projections, which will be released early next year, will \n     almost certainly promise even fatter, juicier surpluses, \n     surpluses that will boost the expectations of all of the \n     greedy supplicants.\n       Rather than being bound by gridlock, the 107th Congress \n     will be poised for a feeding frenzy, the third ingredient for \n     the fiscal feast. Nervously eyeing the 2002 election, when \n     each party will have a reasonable shot at gaining effective \n     control of Congress, Democrats and Republicans will curry \n     favor with all important--and many not so important--interest \n     groups. While the election campaign underscored the different \n     priorities of the two parties, it also revealed many areas \n     where there was bipartisan agreement that more should be \n     spent. Education, the top priority of both candidates and the \n     public's primary concern, could benefit from a bidding war if \n     each side tries to prove that it is the ``Education Party.'' \n     Increases in defense spending also have broad bipartisan \n     support. And then there is the irresistible impulse to shower \n     resources on health research (NIH), Medicare providers and \n     farmers, to name but a few.\n       The size of the projected surpluses, the uncertain \n     political environment, and the argument that those surpluses \n     are ``the hardworking people of America's money . . . not the \n     government's money'' will make a large tax cut almost \n     inevitable. No one will stop to ask whose money it was when \n     the hard-working people's representatives racked up $3.7 \n     trillion in deficits between 1980 and 1998 or whether we owe \n     it to our kids to pay down the increased public debt these \n     deficits generated. Instead, large bipartisan majorities will \n     rally around and add to a presidential proposal that includes \n     marriage penalty relief, rate cuts, tax credits for health \n     insurance, new incentives for retirement saving, and an \n     easing of the estate tax for struggling millionaires who have \n     had to suffer through a period of unprecedented prosperity \n     and soaring stock values.\n       A weakening economy--the final ingredient--will wipe away \n     any lingering qualms lawmakers may have about wallowing again \n     in waters of fiscal excess. No matter that the vast majority \n     of economists welcome slower growth because they believe that \n     the current 4 percent unemployment rate is incompatible with \n     price stability. If the unemployment rate drifts up close to \n     5 percent--a level that labor, business and the Fed \n     considered unattainable as recently as 1995--the summer \n     soldiers of fiscal prudence will cut and run, slashing taxes \n     and boosting spending, claiming as they retreat that these \n     actions are the only way to save the nation from another \n     Great Depression.\n       The current fiscal year will be the third consecutive one \n     in which the budget, excluding Social Security, has been in \n     surplus. The last time such a record was achieved was 1928 to \n     1930. If the new president and the 107th Congress do what \n     comes most naturally, we may have to wait another 70 years to \n     celebrate such an accomplishment. Worse yet, we will wake up \n     after the fiscal feast to discover that the surplus has been \n     squandered while the nation's foremost fiscal challenge--\n     providing for the baby boomers' retirement--has not been \n     addressed because that required difficult choices and \n     political courage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the conference \nreport is agreed to.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the Appalachian National Scenic Trail is \na treasure that thousands of Americans enjoy every year. From day \nhikers to adventures making the 2,167 mile trip from Georgia to Maine, \nall who travel the footpath enjoy a remarkable wilderness experience.\n  The National Trails System Act of 1968 designated the Appalachian \nTrail as one of our nation's first scenic trails and authorized the \nSecretary of Interior to protect the trail through the acquisition of \nland along the trail or by other means. Over the years, Congress has \nsupported this important effort through appropriations that have \nenabled the National Park Service to acquire more than 3000 parcels of \nland, protecting ninety-nine percent of the trail for future \ngenerations.\n  Despite the success of the last thirty years, more work needs to be \ndone to ensure that the trail is preserved in its entirety. The longest \nremaining unprotected segment of the Appalachian Trail crosses \nSaddleback Mountain, in the Rangeley Region of western Maine. The 3.1 \nmiles that traverse the Saddleback Mountain range is one of the trail's \nhighest stretches, offering hikers an alpine wilderness trek and \nextraordinary vistas. The mountain is also home to Saddleback Ski Area, \nwhich draws skiers to an area of Maine where many are employed in the \ntourism industry.\n  For nearly twenty years, the National Park Service and the owners of \nthe ski area have sought an agreement that balances the preservation of \nthe trail experience as it exists today and development opportunities \nat the mountain that would draw additional skiers to the resort and the \nregion. Some have been inclined to suggest that skiers and hikers \ncannot share Saddleback Mountain, but I have always maintained that \nwith careful planning, preservation and economic development can \ncoexist. Consequently, I have long urged both sides to work together to \nfind a resolution that satisfies the interests of those who cherish the \nAppalachian Trail, as well as those who live and work in the Rangeley \nRegion.\n  Mr. President, the impasse between the National Park Service and the \nowners of Saddleback Mountain is drawing to a close. The agreement so \nmany have labored to achieve has been all but finalized, and with the \npassage of the bill before us today, Congress will establish the \nframework by which this matter can be resolved. Included in the bill is \na provision proposed by me and Senator Snowe directing the Secretary of \nInterior to acquire the land necessary to protect the Appalachian Trail \nas agreed to by both the Department and the owners of Saddleback \nMountain. The language also directs the Secretary to convey the land to \nthe State of Maine.\n  I would like to express my appreciation to Appropriations Committee \nChairman Stevens and Subcommittee Chairman Specter for working with \nSenator Snowe and I on this matter of importance to our State. I would \nalso like to thank Interior Subcommittee Chairman Gorton for including \nthe Saddleback acquisition in the list of projects approved for Title \nVIII funds in the FY 2001 Interior Appropriations bill. Their support, \nalong with the dedication of many others who have been involved in the \nnegotiations, will ensure that skiers and hikers can share in the \nenjoyment of the natural beauty and wonders of Saddleback Mountain for \ngeneration to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11885-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11885-S11886]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CORRECTING THE ENROLLMENT OF H.R. 4577\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nconcurrent resolution be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, all without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 162) was agreed to, as \nfollows:\n\n[[Page S11886]]\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 162\n\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Clerk of the House of Representatives, \n     in the enrollment of the bill (H.R. 4577), making \n     appropriations for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human \n     Services, and Education, and related agencies for the fiscal \n     year ending September 2001, and for other purposes, shall \n     make the following correction:\n       In section 1(a)(4), before the period at the end, insert \n     the following: ``, except that the text of H.R. 5666, as so \n     enacted, shall not include section 123 (relating to the \n     enactment of H.R. 4904)''.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I regret deeply that last concurrent \nresolution, and at some time in the future I will explain it.\n  I am awaiting some other papers. For the time being, let me say this. \nI have stood on the Senate floor several times talking about the \nSteller sea lion problem. I personally thank Mr. John Podesta, the \nPresident's assistant, for talking to me for so long and working with \nour staff and myself for so long, into the early hours this morning and \nthrough the day, to bring about a resolution of the problem I have been \ndiscussing.\n  I cannot say we won this argument, but I can say we have reached a \nconclusion that will allow a substantial portion, approximately 90 \npercent, of the fishermen affected by this issue to return to fishing \nnext January. These are people who live along a stretch of coastline \nand on islands, as I said, that are the same distance as from this city \nto the end of the Florida chain. They are people who live in very harsh \ncircumstances and have one basic source of income, and that is fishing.\n  We have been able now to agree on a process by which the fishing \nseason will commence on January 20. Incidentally, it has nothing to do \nwith the Inauguration; it just happens to be the first day of fishing \nseason. We are delighted we have found a way to resolve the conflict. \nIt still means there is a long hard task ahead of not only this \nSecretary of Commerce and his personnel but the next Secretary of \nCommerce and personnel to carry out the agreement we have crafted and \nto see that it works.\n  I am pleased to say we have had a great many people who have assisted \nus. As I said earlier, the distinguished majority leader and minority \nleader were personally involved, as were their staffs, along with the \nstaff of the Assistant to the President, and the Office of Management \nand Budget. I cannot leave out, and would not leave out, the \ndistinguished chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, the \nHonorable Bill Young, a Representative from Florida, who waited for \nthis resolution.\n  I know it was a harsh task he had, and there are many Members in both \nthe House and Senate who were inconvenienced by this delay. I can only \nthank them for their cooperation. As I have said before, not one Member \nof Congress argued with me about the delay. They all understood that we \nhad a substantial problem.\n  It is not easy to represent a State and people who live closer to \nTokyo than Washington, DC. These people really have but three spokesmen \nin Washington compared to the many that other States have. They rely on \nus to convey their wishes and to convey their dilemmas over potential \nFederal actions and to seek solutions.\n  I am delighted we have received the cooperation that led to a \nconsensus today that I believe will assist them and will start the \nresolution of this problem and bring it to a conclusion where we can \nabide by the Magnuson-Stevens Act that governs the fisheries off our \nshores and, at the same time, respect the findings that are made under \nthe Endangered Species Act.\n  I thank Sylvia Matthews, Office of Management and Budget; Michael \nDeitch, Office of Management and Budget; Penny Dalton of NOAA; Mark \nChildress of Senator Daschle's office; Dave Hoppe of Senator Lott's \noffice; and Lisa Sutherland and David Russell of my office for their \nhard work on the issue pertaining to Steller sea lions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11886-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11886-S11890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICER MEDAL OF VALOR ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nJudiciary Committee be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 46 \nand the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 46) to provide a national medal for public \n     safety officers who act with extraordinary valor above and \n     beyond the call of duty.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we consider three bipartisan measures \noffered together as a package: the Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor \nAct, H.R. 46; the Computer Crime Enforcement Act, which I introduced as \nS. 1314, on July 1, 1999, with Senator DeWine and is now also co-\nsponsored by Senators Robb, Hatch and Abraham; and a Hatch-Leahy-\nSchumer ``Internet Security Act'' amendment. I thank my colleagues for \ntheir hard work on these pieces of legislation, each of which I will \ndiscuss in turn.\n  I support the Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor Act. I cosponsored \nthe Stevens bill, S. 39, to establish a Public Safety Medal of Valor. \nIn April and May, 1999, I made sure that the Senate acted on Senator \nStevens' bill, S. 39.\n  On April 22, 1999, the Senate Judiciary Committee took up that \nmeasure in regular order and reported it unanimously. At that time I \ncongratulated Senator Stevens and thanked him for his leadership. I \nnoted that we had worked together on a number of law enforcement \nmatters and that the senior Senator from Alaska is a stalwart supporter \nof the men and women who put themselves at risk to protect us all. I \nsaid that I looked forward to enactment of this measure and to seeing \nthe extraordinary heroism of our police, firefighters and correctional \nofficers recognized with the Medal of Valor.\n  On May 18, 1999, I was privileged to be on the floor of the Senate \nwhen we proceeded to consider S. 39 and passed it unanimously. I took \nthat occasion to commend Senator Stevens and all who had worked so hard \nto move this measure in a timely way. That was over one year ago, \nduring National Police Week last year. The measure was sent to the \nHouse where it lay dormant for the rest of last year and most of this \none.\n  The President of the United States came to Capitol Hill to speak at \nthe Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Service on May 15, 2000, and said \non that occasion that if Congress would not act on the Medal of Valor, \nhe was instructing the Attorney General to explore ways to award such \nrecognition by Executive action.\n  Unfortunately, these calls for action did not waken the House from \nits slumber on this matter and the House of Representatives refused to \npass the Senate-passed Medal of Valor bill. Instead, over the past \nyear, the House has insisted that the Senate take up, fix and pass the \nHouse-passed version of this measure if it is to become law. House \nmembers have indicated that they are now prepared to accept most of the \nSenate-passed text, but insist that it be enacted under the House bill \nnumber. In order to get this important measure to the President, that \nis what we are doing today. We are discharging the House-passed version \nof that bill, H.R. 46, from the Judiciary Committee, adopting a \ncomplete substitute, and sending it back to the House.\n  I have worked with Senator Hatch, Senator Stevens and others to \nperfect the final version of this bill. We have crafted bipartisan \nimprovements to ensure that the Medal of Valor Board will worked \neffectively and efficiently with the National Medal of Valor Office \nwithin the Department of Justice. Our legislation establishes both of \nthese entities and it is essential that they work well together to \ndesign the Medal of Valor and to create the criteria and procedures for \nrecommendations of nominees for the award. The men and women who will \nbe honored by the Medal of Valor for their brave deeds deserve nothing \nless.\n  The information age is filled with unlimited potential for good, but \nit also creates a variety of new challenges for law enforcement. A \nrecent survey by the FBI and the Computer Security Institute found that \n62 percent of information security professionals reported computer \nsecurity breaches in the past year. These breaches in computer security \nresulted in financial losses of more than $120 million from fraud, \ntheft of\n\n[[Page S11887]]\n\ninformation, sabotage, computer viruses, and stolen laptops. Computer \ncrime has become a multi-billion dollar problem.\n  Many of us have worked on these issues for years. In 1984, we passed \nthe Computer Fraud and Abuse Act to criminalize conduct when carried \nout by means of unauthorized access to a computer. In 1986, we passed \nthe Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), which I was proud to \nsponsor, to criminalize tampering with electronic mail systems and \nremote data processing systems and to protect the privacy of computer \nusers. In 1994, the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act \nincluded the Computer Abuse Amendments which I authored to make illegal \nthe intentional transmission of computer viruses.\n  In the 104th Congress, Senators Kyl, Grassley and I worked together \nto enact the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act to \nincrease protection under federal criminal law for both government and \nprivate computers, and to address an emerging problem of computer-age \nblackmail in which a criminal threatens to harm or shut down a computer \nsystem unless their extortion demands are met. In the 105th Congress, \nSenators Kyl and I also worked together on criminal copyright \namendments that became law to enhance the protection of copyrighted \nworks online.\n  The Congress must be constantly vigilant to keep the law up-to-date \nwith technology. The Computer Crime Enforcement Act, S. 1314, and the \nHatch-Leahy-Schumer ``Internet Security Act'' amendment are part of \nthat ongoing effort. These complementary pieces of legislation reflect \ntwin-track progress against computer crime: More tools at the federal \nlevel and more resources for local computer crime enforcement. The fact \nthat this is a bipartisan effort is good for technology policy.\n  But make no mistake about it: even with passage of this legislation, \nthere is more work to be done--both to assist law enforcement and to \nsafeguard the privacy and other important constitutional rights of our \ncitizens. I wish that the Congress had also tackled online privacy \nin this session, but that will now be punted into the next \ncongressional session.\n\n  The legislation before us today does not attempt to resolve every \nissue. For example, both the Senate and the House held hearings this \nsession about the FBI's Carnivore program. Carnivore is a computer \nprogram designed to advance criminal investigations by capturing \ninformation in Internet communications pursuant to court orders. Those \nhearings sparked a good debate about whether advances in technology, \nlike Carnivore, require Congress to pass new legislation to assure that \nour private Internet communications are protected from government over-\nreaching while protecting the government's right to investigate crime. \nI look forward to our discussion of these privacy issues in the next \nCongress.\n  The Computer Crime Enforcement Act is intended to help states and \nlocal agencies in fighting computer crime. All 50 states have now \nenacted tough computer crime control laws. They establish a firm \ngroundwork for electronic commerce, an increasingly important sector of \nthe nation's economy.\n  Unfortunately, too many state and local law enforcement agencies are \nstruggling to afford the high cost of enforcing their state computer \ncrime statutes. Earlier this year, I released a survey on computer \ncrime in Vermont. My office surveyed 54 law enforcement agencies in \nVermont--43 police departments and 11 State's attorney offices--on \ntheir experience investigating and prosecuting computer crimes. The \nsurvey found that more than half of these Vermont law enforcement \nagencies encounter computer crime, with many police departments and \nstate's attorney offices handling 2 to 5 computer crimes per month.\n  Despite this documented need, far too many law enforcement agencies \nin Vermont cannot afford the cost of policing against computer crimes. \nIndeed, my survey found that 98 percent of the responding Vermont law \nenforcement agencies do not have funds dedicated for use in computer \ncrime enforcement. My survey also found that few law enforcement \nofficers in Vermont are properly trained in investigating computer \ncrimes and analyzing cyber-evidence.\n  According to my survey, 83 percent of responding law enforcement \nagencies in Vermont do not employ officers properly trained in computer \ncrime investigative techniques. Moreover, my survey found that 52 \npercent of the law enforcement agencies that handle one or more \ncomputer crimes per month cited their lack of training as a problem \nencountered during investigations. Without the necessary education, \ntraining and technical support, our law enforcement officers are and \nwill continue to be hamstrung in their efforts to crack down on \ncomputer crimes.\n  I crafted the Computer Crime Enforcement Act, S. 1314, to address \nthis problem. The bill would authorize a $25 million Department of \nJustice grant program to help states prevent and prosecute computer \ncrime. Grants under our bipartisan bill may be used to provide \neducation, training, and enforcement programs for local law enforcement \nofficers and prosecutors in the rapidly growing field of computer \ncriminal justice. Our legislation has been endorsed by the Information \nTechnology Association of America and the Fraternal Order of Police. \nThis is an important bipartisan effort to provide our state and local \npartners in crime-fighting with the resources they need to address \ncomputer crime.\n  The Internet Security Act of 2000 makes progress to ensure that we \nare properly dealing with the increase in computer crime. I thank and \ncommend Senators Hatch and Schumer for working with me and other \nMembers of the Judiciary Committee to address some of the serious \nconcerns we had with the first iteration of their bill, S. 2448, as it \nwas originally introduced.\n  Specifically, as introduced, S. 2448 would have over-federalized \nminor computer abuses. Currently, federal jurisdiction exists for a \nvariety of computer crimes if, and only if, such criminal offenses \nresult in at least $5,000 of damage or cause another specified injury, \nincluding the impairment of medical treatment, physical injury to a \nperson or a threat to public safety. S. 2448, as introduced, would have \neliminated the $5,000 jurisdictional threshold and thereby criminalized \na variety of minor computer abuses, regardless of whether any \nsignificant harm resulted.\n  For example, if an overly-curious college sophomore checks a \nprofessor's unattended computer to see what grade he is going to get \nand accidently deletes a file or a message, current Federal law does \nnot make that conduct a crime. That conduct may be cause for discipline \nat the college, but not for the FBI to swoop in and investigate. Yet, \nunder the original S. 2448, as introduced, this unauthorized access to \nthe professor's computer would have constituted a federal crime.\n  Another example is that of a teenage hacker, who plays a trick on a \nfriend by modifying the friend's vanity Web page. Under current law, no \nfederal crime has occurred. Yet, under the original S. 2448, as \nintroduced, this conduct would have constituted a federal crime.\n  As America Online correctly noted in a June, 2000 letter, \n``eliminating the $5,000 threshold for both criminal and civil \nviolations would risk criminalizing a wide range of essentially benign \nconduct and engendering needless litigation. . . .'' Similarly, the \nInternet Alliance commented in a June, 2000 letter that ``[c]omplete \nabolition of the limit will lead to needless federal prosecution of \noften trivial offenses that can be reached under state law. . . .''\n  Those provisions were overkill. Our federal laws do not need to reach \neach and every minor, inadvertent and harmless computer abuse--after \nall, each of the 50 states has its own computer crime laws. Rather, our \nfederal laws need to reach those offenses for which federal \njurisdiction is appropriate.\n  Prior Congresses have declined to over-federalize computer offenses \nas originally proposed in S. 2448, as introduced, and sensibly \ndetermined that not all computer abuses warrant federal criminal \nsanctions. When the computer crime law was first enacted in 1984, the \nHouse Judiciary Committee reporting the bill stated:\n\n       The Federal jurisdictional threshold is that there must be \n     $5,000 worth of benefit to the defendant or loss to another \n     in order to concentrate Federal resources on the more \n     substantial computer offenses that affect\n\n[[Page S11888]]\n\n     interstate or foreign commerce. (H.Rep. 98-894, at p. 22, \n     July 24, 1984).\n\n  Similarly, the Senate Judiciary Committee under the chairmanship of \nSenator Thurmond, rejected suggestions in 1986 that ``the Congress \nshould enact as sweeping a Federal statute as possible so that no \ncomputer crime is potentially uncovered.'' (S. Rep. 99-432, at p. 4, \nSeptember 3, 1986).\n  The Hatch-Leahy-Schumer substitute amendment to S. 2448, which was \nreported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee on October 5th, \naddresses those federalism concerns by retaining the $5,000 \njurisdictional threshold in current law. That Committee-reported \nsubstitute amendment, with the additional refinements reflected in the \nHatch-Leahy-Schumer Internet Security Act amendment to H.R. 46, which \nthe Senate considers today, makes other improvements to the original \nbill and current law, as summarized below.\n  First, titles II, III, IV and V of the original bill, S. 2448, about \nwhich various problems had been raised, are eliminated. For example, \ntitle V of the original bill would have authorized the Justice \nDepartment to enter into Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties (MLAT) with \nforeign governments that would allow the Attorney General broad \ndiscretion to investigate lawful conduct in the U.S. at the request of \nforeign governments without regard to whether the conduct investigated \nviolates any Federal computer crime law. In my view, that discretion \nwas too broad and troubling.\n  Second, the amendment includes an authorization of appropriations of \n$5 million to the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property (CCIP) \nsection within the Justice Department's Criminal Division and requires \nthe Attorney General to make the head of CCIP a ``Deputy Assistant \nAttorney General,'' which is not a Senate-confirmed position, in order \nto highlight the increasing importance and profile of this position. \nThis authorized funding level is consistent with an amendment I \nsponsored and circulated to Members of the Judiciary Committee to \nimprove S. 2448 and am pleased to see it incorporated into the Internet \nSecurity Act amendment to H.R. 46.\n  Third, the amendment modifies section 1030 of title 18, United States \nCode, in several important ways, including providing for increased and \nenhanced penalties for serious violations of federal computer crime \nlaws, clarifying the definitions of ``loss'' to ensure that the full \ncosts to a hacking victim are taken into account and of ``protected \ncomputer'' to facilitate investigations of international computer \ncrimes affecting the United States, and preserving the existing $5,000 \nthreshold and other jurisdictional prerequisites for violations of \nsection 1030(a)(5)--i.e., no Federal crime has occurred unless the \nconduct (1) causes loss to 1 or more persons during any 1-year period \naggregating at least $5,000 in value, (2) impairs the medical care of \nanother person, (3) causes physical injury to another person, (4) \nthreatens public health or safety, or (5) causes damage affecting a \ncomputer system used by or for a government entity in furtherance of \nthe administration of justice, national defense, or national security.\n  The amendment clarifies the precise elements of the offense the \ngovernment must prove in order to establish a violation by moving these \nprerequisites from the current definition of ``damage'' to the \ndescription of the offense. In addition, the amendment creates a new \ncategory of felony violations where a hacker causes damage to a \ncomputer system used by or for a government entity in furtherance of \nthe administration of justice, national defense, or national security.\n  Currently, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act provides for federal \ncriminal penalties for those who intentionally access a protected \ncomputer or cause an unauthorized transmission to a protected computer \nand cause damage. ``Protected computer'' is defined to include those \nthat are ``used in interstate or foreign commerce.'' See 18 U.S.C. \n1030(e)(2)(B). The amendment would clarify the definition of \n``protected computer'' to ensure that computers which are used in \ninterstate or foreign commerce but are located outside of the United \nStates are included within the definition of ``protected computer'' \nwhen those computers are used in a manner that affects interstate or \nforeign commerce or communication of this country. This will ensure \nthat our government will be able to conduct domestic investigations and \nprosecutions against hackers from this country who hack into foreign \ncomputer systems and against those hacking though the United States to \nother foreign venues. Moreover, by clarifying the fact that a domestic \noffense exists, the United States will be able to use speedier domestic \nprocedures in support of international hacker cases, and create the \noption of prosecuting such criminals in the United States.\n  The amendment also adds a definition of ``loss'' to the Computer \nFraud and Abuse Act. Current law defines the term ``damage'' to include \nimpairment of the integrity or availability of data, programs, systems \nor information causing a ``loss aggregating at least $5,000 in value \nduring any 1-year period to one or more individuals.'' See 18 U.S.C. \nSec. 1030(e)(8)(A). The new definition of ``loss'' to be added as \nsection 1030(e)(11) will ensure that the full costs to victims of \nresponding to hacking offenses, conducting damage assessments, \nrestoring systems and data to the condition they were in before an \nattack, as well as lost revenue and costs incurred because of an \ninterruption in service, are all counted. This statutory definition is \nconsistent with the definition of ``loss'' appended by the U.S. \nSentencing Commission to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines (see \nU.S.S.G. Sec. 2B1.1 Commentary, Application note 2), and will help \nreconcile procedures by which prosecutors value loss for charging \npurposes and by which judges value loss for sentencing purposes. \nGetting this type of true accounting of ``loss'' is important because \nloss amounts can be used to calculate restitution and to determine the \nappropriate sentence for the perpetrator under the sentencing \nguidelines.\n  Fourth, section 303(e) of the Hatch-Leahy-Schumer Internet Security \nAct amendment to H.R. 46 clarifies the grounds for obtaining damages in \ncivil actions for violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. \nCurrent law authorizes a person who suffers ``damage or loss'' from a \nviolation of section 1030 to sue the violator for compensatory damages \nor injunctive or other equitable relief, and limits the remedy to \n``economic damages'' for violations ``involving damage as defined \nin subsection (e)(8)(A),'' relating to violations of 1030(a)(5) that \ncause loss aggregating at least $5,000 during any 1-year period. \nCurrent law does not contain a definition of ``loss,'' which is being \nadded by this amendment.\n\n  To take account of both the new definition of ``loss'' and the \nincorporation of the requisite jurisdictional thresholds into the \ndescription of the offense (rather than the current definition of \n``damage''), the amendment to subsection (g) makes several changes. \nFirst, the amendment strikes the reference to subsection (e)(8)(A) in \nthe current civil action provision and retains Congress' previous \nintent to allow civil plaintiffs only economic damages for violations \nof section 1030(a)(5) that do not also affect medical treatment, cause \nphysical injury, threaten public health and safety or affect computer \nsystems used in furtherance of the administration of justice, the \nnational defense or national security.\n  Second, the amendment clarifies that civil actions under section \n1030, and not just 1030(a)(5), are limited to conduct that involves one \nof the factors enumerated in new subsection (a)(5)(B), namely, the \nconduct (1) causes loss to 1 or more persons during any 1-year period \naggregating at least $5,000 in value, (2) impairs the medical care of \nanother person, (3) causes physical injury to another person, (4) \nthreatens public health or safety, or (5) causes damage affecting a \ncomputer system used by or for a government entity in furtherance of \nthe administration of justice, national defense, or national security. \nThis clarification is consistent with judicial constructions of the \nstatute, requiring proof of the $5,000 loss threshold as a prerequisite \nfor civil suit, for example, under subsection 1030(a)(2)(C). See, e.g., \nAmerica Online, Inc. v. LCGM, Inc., 46 F.Supp. 2d 444, 450 (E.D. Va. \n1998) (court granted summary judgment on claim under 1030(a)(2)(C), \nstating, ``[p]laintiff asserts that as a result of defendants' actions, \nit suffered damages exceeding $5,000, the statutory threshold \nrequirement'').\n\n[[Page S11889]]\n\n  While proof of ``loss'' is required, this amendment preserves current \nlaw that civil enforcement of certain violations of section 1030 is \navailable without requiring proof of ``damage,'' which is defined in \nthe amendment to mean ``any impairment to the integrity or availability \nof data, a program, a system, or information.'' In fact, only \nsubsection 1030(a)(5) requires proof of ``damage''; civil enforcement \nof other subsections of this law may proceed without such proof. Thus, \nonly the factors enumerated in new subsection (a)(5)(B), and not its \nintroductory language referring to conduct described in subsection \n(a)(5)(A), constitute threshold requirements for civil suits for \nviolations of section 1030 other than subsection 1030(a)(5).\n  Finally, the amendment adds a new sentence to subsection 1030(g) \nclarifying that civil actions may not be brought ``for the negligent \ndesign or manufacture of computer hardware, computer software, or \nfirmware.''\n  The Congress provided this civil remedy in the 1994 amendments to the \nAct, which I originally sponsored with Senator Gordon Humphrey, to \nenhance privacy protection for computer communications and the \ninformation stored on computers by encouraging institutions to improve \ncomputer security practices, deterring unauthorized persons from \ntrespassing on computer systems of others, and supplementing the \nresources of law enforcement in combating computer crime. [See The \nComputer Abuse Amendments Act of 1990: Hearing Before the Subcomm. On \nTechnology and the Law of the Senate Comm. On the Judiciary, 101st \nCong., 2nd Sess., S. Hrg. 101-1276, at pp. 69, 88, 92 (1990); see also \nStatement of Senator Humphrey, 136 Cong. Rec. S18235 (1990) (``Given \nthe Government's limited capacity to pursue all computer crime cases, \nthe existence of this limited civil remedy will serve to enhance \ndeterrence in this critical area.'')]. The ``new, civil remedy for \nthose harmed by violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act'' was \nintended to ``boost the deterrence of the statute by allowing aggrieved \nindividuals to obtain relief.'' [S. Rep. No. 101-544, 101st Cong., 2d \nSess., p. 6-7 (1990); see also Statement of Senator Leahy, 136 Cong. \nRec. S18234 (1990)]. We certainly and expressly did not want to ``open \nthe floodgates to frivolous litigation.'' [Statement of Senator Leahy, \n136 Cong. Rec. S4614 (1990)].\n  At the time the civil remedy provision was added to the Computer \nFraud and Abuse Act, this Act contained no prohibition against \nnegligently causing damage to a computer through unauthorized access, \nreflected in current law, 18 U.S.C. Sec.  1030(a)(5)(C). That \nprohibition was added only with subsequent amendments made in 1996, as \npart of the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act. \nNevertheless, the civil remedy has been interpreted in some cases to \napply to the negligent manufacture of computer hardware or software. \nSee, e.g., Shaw v. Toshiba America Information Systems, Inc., NEC, 91 \nF.Supp. 2d 926 (E.D. TX 1999) (court interpreted the term transmission \nto include sale of computers with a minor design defect).\n  The Hatch-Leahy-Schumer Internet Security Act amendment to subsection \n1030(g) is intended to ensure that the civil remedy is a robust option \nfor private enforcement actions, while limiting its applicability to \nnegligence cases that are more appropriately governed by contractual \nwarranties, state tort law and consumer protection laws.\n  Fifth, sections 304 and 309 of the Hatch-Leahy-Schumer Internet \nSecurity Act amendment to H.R. 46 authorize criminal forfeiture of \ncomputers, equipment, and other personal property used to violate the \nComputer Fraud and Abuse Act, as well as real and personal property \nderived from the proceeds of computer crime. Property, both real and \npersonal, which is derived from proceeds traceable to a violation of \nsection 1030, is currently subject to both criminal and civil \nforfeiture. See 18 U.S.C. Sec.  981(a)(1)(C) and 982(a)(2)(B). Thus, \nthe amendment would clarify in section 1030 itself that forfeiture \napplies and extend the application of forfeiture to property that is \nused or intended to be used to commit or to facilitate the commission \nof a computer crime. In addition, to deter and prevent piracy, theft \nand counterfeiting of intellectual property, the section 309 of the \namendment allows forfeiture of devices, such as replicators or other \ndevices used to copy or produce computer programs to which counterfeit \nlabels have been affixed.\n  The criminal forfeiture provision in section 304 specifically states \nthat only the ``interest of such person,'' referring to the defendant \nwho committed the computer crime, is subject to forfeiture. Moreover, \nthe criminal forfeiture authorized by Sections 304 and 309 is made \nexpressly subject to Section 413 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse \nPrevention and Control Act of 1970, but subsection (d) of section 413 \nis expressly exempted from application to Section 304 and 309. That \nsubsection (d) creates a rebuttable presumption of forfeiture in favor \nof the government where a person convicted of a felony acquired the \nproperty during the period that the crime was committed or within a \nreasonable time after such period and there was no likely source for \nsuch property other than the criminal violation. Thus, by making \nsubsection (d) inapplicable, Sections 304 and 309 make it more \ndifficult for the government to prove that the property should be \nforfeited.\n\n  Sixth, unlike the version reported by the Judiciary Committee, the \namendment does not require that prior delinquency adjudications of \njuveniles for violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act be counted \nunder the definition of ``conviction'' for purposes of enhanced \npenalties. This is an improvement that I urged since juvenile \nadjudications simply are not criminal convictions. Juvenile proceedings \nare more informal than adult prosecutions and are not subject to the \nsame due process protections. Consequently, counting juvenile \nadjudications as a prior conviction for purposes of the recidivist \nsanctions under the amendment would be unduly harsh and unfair. In any \nevent, prior juvenile delinquency adjudications are already subject to \nsentencing enhancements under certain circumstances under the \nSentencing Guidelines. See, e.g., U.S.S.G. Sec.  411.2(d) (upward \nadjustments in sentences required for each juvenile sentence to \nconfinement of at least sixty days and for each juvenile sentence \nimposed within five years of the defendant's commencement of instant \noffense).\n  Seventh, the amendment changes a current directive to the Sentencing \nCommission enacted as section 805 of the Antiterrorism and Effective \nDeath Penalty Act of 1996, P.L. 104-132, that imposed a 6-month \nmandatory minimum sentence for any conviction of the sections \n1030(a)(4) or (a)(5) of title 18, United States code. The \nAdministration has noted that ``[i]n some instances, prosecutors have \nexercised their discretion and elected not to charge some defendants \nwhose actions otherwise would qualify them for prosecution under the \nstatute, knowing that the result would be mandatory imprisonment.'' \nClearly, mandatory imprisonment is not always the most appropriate \nremedy for a federal criminal violation, and the ironic result of this \n``get tough'' proposal has been to discourage prosecutions that might \notherwise have gone forward. The amendment eliminates that mandatory \nminimum term of incarceration for misdemeanor and less serious felony \ncomputer crimes.\n  Eighth, section 310 of the amendment directs the Sentencing \nCommission to review and, where appropriate, adjust sentencing \nguidelines for computer crimes to address a variety of factors, \nincluding to ensure that the guidelines provide sufficiently stringent \npenalties to deter and punish persons who intentionally use encryption \nin connection with the commission or concealment of criminal acts.\n  The Sentencing Guidelines already provide for enhanced penalties when \npersons obstruct or impede the administration of justice, see U.S.S.G. \nSec. 3C1.1, or engage in more than minimal planning, see U.S.S.G. \nSec. 2B1.1(b)(4)(A). As the use of encryption technology becomes more \nwidespread, additional guidance from the Sentencing Commission would be \nhelpful to determine the circumstances when such encryption use would \nwarrant a guideline adjustment. For example, if a defendant employs an \nencryption product that works automatically and transparently with a \ntelecommunications service or software product, an enhancement for use \nof encryption may not be appropriate, while the deliberate use of\n\n[[Page S11890]]\n\nencryption as part of a sophisticated and intricate scheme to conceal \ncriminal activity and make the offense, or its extent, difficult to \ndetect, may warrant a guideline enhancement either under existing \nguidelines or a new guideline.\n  Ninth, the Hatch-Leahy-Schumer Internet Security Act amendment to \nH.R. 46 would eliminate certain statutory restrictions on the authority \nof the United States Secret Service (\"Secret Service''). Under current \nlaw, the Secret Service is authorized to investigate offenses under six \ndesignated subsections of 18 U.S.C. Sec.  1030, subject to agreement \nbetween the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General: \nsubsections (a)(2)(A) (illegally accessing a computer and obtaining \nfinancial information); (a)(2)(B) (illegally accessing a computer and \nobtaining information from a department or agency of the United \nStates); (a)(3) (illegally accessing a non-public computer of a \ndepartment or agency of the United States either exclusively used by \nthe United States or used by the United States and the conduct affects \nthat use by or for the United States); (a)(4) (accessing a protected \ncomputer with intent to defraud and thereby furthering the fraud and \nobtaining a thing of value, unless the object of the fraud and the \nthing obtained consists only of the use of the computer and the value \nof such use is not more than $5,000 in a one-year period); (a)(5) \n(knowingly causing the transmission of a program, information, code or \ncommand and thereby intentionally and without authorization causing \ndamage to a protected computer; and illegally accessing a protected \ncomputer and causing damage recklessly or otherwise); and (a)(6) \n(trafficking in a password with intent to defraud).\n  Under current law, the Secret Service is not authorized to \ninvestigate offenses under subsection (a)(1) (accessing a computer and \nobtaining information relating to national security with reason to \nbelieve the information could be used to the injury of the United \nStates or to the advantage of a foreign nation and willfully retaining \nor transmitting that information or attempting to do so); (a)(2)(C) \n(illegally accessing a protected computer and obtaining information \nwhere the conduct involves an interstate or foreign communication); and \n(a)(7) (transmitting a threat to damage a protected computer with \nintent to extort).\n  The Internet Security Act removes these limitations on the authority \nof the Secret Service and authorizes the Secret Service to investigate \nany offense under Section 1030 relating to its jurisdiction under 18 \nU.S.C. Sec.  3056 and subject to agreement between the Secretary of the \nTreasury and the Attorney General. This provision also makes clear that \nthe FBI retains primary authority to investigate offenses under \nsubsection 1030(a)(1).\n  Prior to 1996 amendments to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the \nSecret Service was authorized to investigate all violations of Section \n1030. According to the 1996 Committee Reports of the 104th Congress, \n2nd Session, the 1996 amendments attempted to concentrate the Secret \nService's jurisdiction on certain subsections considered to be within \nthe Secret Service's traditional jurisdiction and not grant authority \nin matters with a national security nexus. According to the \nAdministration, which first proposed the elimination of these statutory \nrestrictions in connection with transmittal of its comprehensive crime \nbill, the ``21st Century Law Enforcement and Public Safety Act,'' \nhowever, these specific enumerations of investigative authority ``have \nthe potential to complicate investigations and impede interagency \ncooperation.'' (See Section-by-section Analysis, SEC. 3082, for ``21st \nCentury Law Enforcement and Public Safety Act'').\n\n  The current restrictions, for example, risk hindering the Secret \nService from investigating ``hacking'' into White House computers or \ninvestigating threats against the President that may be delivered by \nsuch a ``hacker,'' and fulfilling its mission to protect financial \ninstitutions and the nation's financial infrastructure. The provision \nthus modifies existing law to restore the Secret Service's authority to \ninvestigate violations of Section 1030, leaving it to the Departments \nof Treasury and Justice to determine between them how to allocate \nworkload and particular cases. This arrangement is consistent with \nother jurisdictional grants of authority to the Secret Service. See, \ne.g., 18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.  1029(d), 3056(b)(3).\n  Tenth, section 307 of the Hatch-Leahy-Schumer Internet Security Act \namendment would provide an additional defense to civil actions relating \nto preserving records in response to government requests. Current law \nauthorizes civil actions and criminal liability for unauthorized \ninterference with or disclosures of electronically stored wire or \nelectronic communications under certain circumstances. 18 U.S.C. \nSec. Sec.  2701, et seq. A provision of that statutory scheme makes \nclear that it is a complete defense to civil and criminal liability if \nthe person or entity interfering with or attempting to disclose a \ncommunication does so in good faith reliance on a court warrant or \norder, grand jury subpoena, legislative or statutory authorization. 18 \nU.S.C. Sec.  2707(e)(1).\n  Current law, however, does not address one scenario under which a \nperson or entity might also have a complete defense. A provision of the \nsame statutory scheme currently requires providers of wire or \nelectronic communication services and remote computing services, upon \nrequest of a governmental entity, to take all necessary steps to \npreserve records and other evidence in its possession for a renewal \nperiod of 90 days pending the issuance of a court order or other \nprocess requiring disclosure of the records or other evidence. 18 \nU.S.C. Sec.  2703(f). Section 2707(e)(1), which describes the \ncircumstances under which a person or entity would have a complete \ndefense to civil or criminal liability, fails to identify good faith \nreliance on a governmental request pursuant to Section 2703(f) as \nanother basis for a complete defense. Section 307 modifies current law \nby addressing this omission and expressly providing that a person or \nentity who acts in good faith reliance on a governmental request \npursuant to Section 2703(f) also has a complete defense to civil and \ncriminal liability.\n  Finally, the bill authorizes construction and operation of a National \nCyber Crime Technical Support Center and 10 regional computer forensic \nlabs that will provide education, training, and forensic examination \ncapabilities for State and local law enforcement officials charged with \ninvestigating computer crimes. The section authorizes a total of $100 \nmillion for FY 2001, of which $20 million shall be available solely for \nthe 10 regional labs and would complement the state computer crime \ngrant bill, S. 1314, with which this bill is offered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4366\n\n(Purpose: To enhance computer crime enforcement and Internet security, \n                        and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate South \nDakota's Josh Heupel, quarterback of the Oklahoma Sooners, on his \nincredible season leading his top-ranked and undefeated football team \nto the National Championship game. I am tremendously proud of the \nachievements of a fellow South Dakotan and Aberdeen Central graduate.\n  I am not the first and certainly will not be the last to praise Josh \nfor his accomplishments. Josh passed for 3,392 yards and 20 touchdowns \nthis season and led his team through a difficult schedule of worthy \nopponents. It is no surprise that Josh received so many honors this \nyear: he was named Player of the Year by the Walter Camp Football \nFoundation; College Football Player of the Year by the Associated \nPress; and College Football Player of the Year by the Sporting News.\n  Most recently he was the runner-up for the Heisman Trophy, South \nDakota's first Heisman Finalist. While he may have felt some \ndisappointment in not winning, Josh handled himself with the maturity \nand grace that has molded him into a fine young leader and allows him \nto put team accomplishments and goals before his personal feats.\n  I believe Josh's success at the national level is the result of \nnatural ability coupled with hard work and drive. But he has not been \ncontent with excellence simply in the athletic realm. He has also \ncommitted himself to civic duty, visiting sick children in hospitals \nand coordinating food drives, and has been a dedicated student. More \nthan that, he lives by ideals instilled in him by his family--his \nparents Ken and Cindy, and sister Andrea--and the values and life \nexperiences gained in South Dakota. He is an inspiration to all of us, \nyoung and old, teaching us to follow our dreams but stay close to our \nvalues.\n  I speak for South Dakota when I say that we proud of Josh Heupel and \nwe wish him the best of luck as he leads his team into the National \nChampionship game on January 3d and in his future athletic and academic \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11891-2", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11891-S11892]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO SECRETARY OF DEFENSE BILL COHEN\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Secretary \nof Defense Bill Cohen and Mrs. Janet Langhart Cohen. As Secretary of \nDefense for almost four years, Bill Cohen has led the Defense \nDepartment and the military services with leadership and a strong \ncommitment.\n  In contemporary political history, persons of a political party other \nthan the party of the Administration, have offered to serve this \nNation. It takes a special courage; Bill Cohen has that courage. He has \nearned--with distinction--a place in history.\n  Bill Cohen and I were first elected to the Senate in 1978. We served \ntogether on the Armed Services Committee from 1979 until Bill retired \nfrom the Senate in 1996. Throughout his service with the Senate, he was \nrecognized as a leader.\n  A prodigious student of history, diplomacy, foreign policy and \nnational security, he was recognized as one of the most able and \nproductive members of the Armed Services Committee. He worked hard to \ndevelop and maintain a bipartisan consensus on national security \npolicy. For Bill Cohen, partisan politics--in the words of the famous \nRepublican senator from Michigan, Senator Arthur Vandenberg--``stopped \nat the water's edge.''\n  Fortunately, the President recognized the wealth of knowledge and \nexperience Bill had developed during his service in the Congress.\n  Bill Cohen also had the good fortune of being the son of parents he \nloved and admired. That gave him inner strength.\n  In December 1996, he was nominated to be Secretary of Defense and was \npromptly confirmed by the Senate.\n  When Bill Cohen accepted the nomination, he undestood the \nextraordinary challenges that lay ahead. He understood that he would be \nresponsible for a department and for military services that had \nundergone, and were undergoing, the most significant reduction in force \nand personnel and equipment in almost thirty years.\n  The problems associated with these reductions were compounded by \nincreasing operational commitments. Comparing the period between the \nend of the Vietnam War and the beginning of Operation Desert Storm to \nthe period between Operation Desert Storm to today, these commitments \nhave increased by over 400 percent. And there would be no foreseeable \nend to our extended commitments in many parts of the world.\n\n  It was at such a critical crossroad in the history of the U.S. Armed \nForces that a leader with a strong sense of purpose and keen intellect \nwas needed at the helm of the Department of Defense. That leader was \nBill Cohen. We, in this chamber, knew very well the profound depth of \nhis intellect and leadership through his oratory, his writings, his \npoems and, yes, his occasional ``doodles'' on the notepad. Like Colonel \nJoshua Chamberlain, a Union Army soldier and son of Maine, that Cohen \nrevered, he likewise accepted the daunting challenge with which he was \npresented.\n  Upon taking the helm at the Department of Defense, Bill Cohen quickly \nidentified those key areas that required his immediate attention. \nShortly after his confirmation hearing, Secretary Cohen stated that he \nwould dedicate his time in office to working on the quality of life for \nmilitary personnel and their families and to addressing continuing \nshortfalls in readiness and modernization of the Armed Forces.\n  So began his four years of labor to lead the largest agency in the \nFederal Government--one of the largest organizations in the world. But \nthis was a labor of love for the new secretary. Bill Cohen recently \ndescribed his tenure as ``the most demanding, exhilarating experience'' \nhe has ever had--work he would do ``forever.''\n\n[[Page S11892]]\n\n  Sharing this experience with Bill Cohen is his wife, Janet Langhart \nCohen. She has been equally enthusiastic in her role supporting him--\nand military personnel throughout the world--as a ``First Lady of the \nPentagon.''\n  Janet Langhart Cohen's tireless and selfless work for our men and \nwomen in uniform, and their families, has been remarkable. She has been \ncommitted to making sure that the American people's hearts and minds \nare fully joined with those who are wearing the uniform. Thanks to \nJanet Langhart Cohen, soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines have come \nto know how much they are appreciated by their fellow Americans.\n  To this end, Janet Langhart Cohen called on the USO--and their \nvolunteer entertainers--to bring the message from the homefront to our \nforward deployed military men and women. She recognized that the USO \nhelped those in the military who are far from home give in to laughter \nrather than give way to loneliness and despair. With the USO, Janet \nLanghart Cohen reinvigorated the spirit of our warriors.\n  Understanding the important relationship between the men and women of \nthe Armed Forces and the USO, Janet Langhart Cohen led the effort to \nbuild a lasting exhibit to the USO in the Pentagon. Thanks to her, the \ntribute was unveiled just a few short weeks ago. To many, she is now \nalso recognized as the ``First Lady of the USO.''\n  Together, Bill and Janet have been a dynamic team. They have tackled \nmany of the problems facing military families today. They have also \ncircled the globe together to demonstrate their combined conviction and \nsupport for our men and women in uniform wherever they are deployed. \nOnly recently, Bill and Janet completed their third trip to Kosovo \nsince the June 1999 end of the air campaign.\n  In our brief years, Secretary Cohen, through tireless work, study, \nand travel, has continued to develop his already formidable \nunderstanding of global, economic and national security issues. And as \nhad been the case during his 24 years of service in the Congress, \nSecretary Cohen's conviction for supporting the troops continued \nwithout question.\n  Anyone who has been privileged to serve in the Department of Defense, \nespecially as the ``Top Gun,'' knows there is no more difficult a job \nin the Executive Branch of our government. Bill Cohen earned his place \nin history, alongside the best, and the men and women in uniform render \na respectful ``hand salute.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11892-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11892]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President, I rise in tribute to a friend and \ncolleague, Julian Dixon. Congressman Dixon honorably represented the \n32nd District of California for more than 22 years. Julian and I were \nmembers of the Congressional Freshman Class of 1978. It was my pleasure \nto serve with him for more than two decades.\n  Everyone in the Senate knew him and I know no member of the House or \nSenate who did not like him, as well as respect him. His life \nexemplified public service and his actions were always motivated by \ntruth, justice and compassion. He was without question a Distinguished \nGentlemen.\n  During his tenure in office, Congressman Dixon accomplished many \nthings. He was always magnanimous in victory and gracious in defeat and \naccepted difficult assignments, such as the Chairmanship of the House \nEthics Committee in 1989. It is a responsibility that few members seek \nand only the most selfless accept. Congressman Dixon did so, and the \nHouse of Representatives is a better place for his service.\n  From 1957 to 1960, he served as an enlisted man in the United States \nArmy, rising to the rank of sergeant. This experience made him a life \nlong advocate for the men and women in the Armed Forces. He understood \ntheir hardships and needs as well as any member of the Congress. The \nmilitary services have lost a good friend.\n  At the conclusion of the Cold War, our defense expenditures were cut \ndramatically. Literally, hundreds of military installations, large and \nsmall, around the Nation were slated for closure. Thousands of small \nbusinesses depended entirely, or mostly on work generated by the \ndefense industry, and they were in danger of failure.\n  In an effort to help these businesses, Congressman Dixon sponsored \nlegislation to assist small businesses in making the difficult \ntransition to new markets. His efforts saved innumerable small \nbusinesses from going under and now many are thriving because of his \nforesight and stewardship. Most recently he was the very able Ranking \nMember of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. He was \na voice of reason and restraint in an arena that often lends itself to \nhyperbole and grandstanding. Julian served his country well in this \ncapacity.\n  Congressman Dixon was known for his intelligence, political savvy and \nstrong character. While Julian surely had much lift to accomplish, he \ntruly made a difference while he walked among us. He was a family man \nand a man of the people. He will be missed. Our prayers are with his \nfamily, friends and people he served so well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11892-3", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11892-S11894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  DRUG ADDICTION TREATMENT ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator \nHatch, Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, to comment on a provision \nof the recently enacted omnibus children's health legislation (H.R. \n4365; Public Law 106-310) that established a number of excellent \nchildren's health programs. The bill also included important new \nlegislation, the Drug Addiction Treatment Act [DATA], which I authored \nalong with Senator Hatch, working with our colleagues Senators Biden \nand Moynihan. It will make a revolutionary difference in the way in \nwhich we battle heroin and other opiate addiction.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, my colleague from Michigan is correct. \nAdditionally, as my colleagues are aware, the bill reauthorized the \noperation of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \nAdministration, and established and reinforced penalties for illegal \nmanufacture, sale, and possession of certain illicit drugs.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, when implemented, the DATA bill, as we call \nit, will change significantly the way opiate addiction is addressed by \nallowing qualified physicians, for the first time, to prescribe in \ntheir private offices, substances which block the craving for heroin \nand otherwise address this deadly addiction.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as Senator Levin knows, the DATA bill \nincludes a provision similar to one applicable for many years to both \nthe Medicaid and Medicare programs, which makes clear that basic \ndecisions about the way medicine is practiced are to be made by \nphysicians and patients, not by the federal government.\n  Mr. LEVIN. In other words, it is our intent that with respect to the \namendments to the Controlled Substances\n\n[[Page S11893]]\n\nAct made by the provisions incorporated in H.R. 4365, decisions by \nqualified physicians about the appropriate means to treat their \npatients and to prescribe and dispense medications are not a proper \nmatter for government regulation.\n  While the bill clearly provides authority for the Department of \nHealth and Human Services to issue regulations to expand the pool of \nqualified physicians, it is not the intention of our legislation that \nthose regulations extend to the practice of medicine.\n  Mr. HATCH. I certainly agree with that. Indeed, such an \ninterpretation is expressly prohibited by the language: ``Nothing in \nsuch regulations or practice guidelines may authorize any Federal \nofficial or employee to exercise supervision or control over the \npractice of medicine or the manner in which medical services are \nprovided.''\n  Mr. LEVIN. This clarification is important, both for the qualified \nphysicians who wish to participate in this new approach to addiction \ntreatment and for patients for whom a new treatment option may present \na life-changing possibility. I know my colleague from Utah agrees that \nwe want this legislation to work. An unauthorized and ill-advised \nattempt to regulate the practice of medicine, including the practice of \nprescribing anti-addiction medication, would make it unworkable.\n  Mr. HATCH. I do agree wholeheartedly. I feel compelled to add, \nhowever, that as the Chairman of the Committee of jurisdiction, it was \nimportant to me to make certain that the bill in no way impedes the \nDrug Enforcement Administration [DEA] from vigorously enforcing the \nControlled Substances Act. Specifically, the DATA legislation is not \nintended to prevent the DEA from its historic role of prosecuting \nphysicians for dispensing controlled substances without a legitimate \nmedical purpose.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I agree with my colleague. I believe we successfully \nbalanced both interests in the DATA bill. It is important legislation \nand I am pleased to have had the support of the Chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee and Senators Biden and Moynihan as we successfully \nmoved this bipartisan legislation to enactment.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the passage of H.R. \n1653, which includes the Pribilof Islands Transition Act and the Coral \nReef Conservation Act of 2000. This bill contains a number of ocean, \ncoastal, and fisheries related titles that will result in major \nconservation gains for our nation's marine resources at a time when we \nare placing enormous demands on them. The bill not only attempts to \nprovide additional environmental protections through a number of state \nand local programs, but also tools for better management.\n  Title I of this bill is the Pribilof Islands Transition Act. The \nAlaskan Pribilof Islands in the Bering Sea were a former reserve for \nharvesting fur seals. The Commerce Department, acting through the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), has been \ninvolved in municipal and social services on the islands since 1910. In \n1983, NOAA tried to remove themselves from administering these \nprograms. However, despite the $20 million in funds the Pribilof \nIslands received to replace future annual Federal appropriations, the \nPribilof Islanders claim that the terms of the transition process were \nnot met and the withdrawal failed.\n  This title authorizes $28 million over five years to again attempt to \nachieve the orderly withdrawal of NOAA from the civil administration of \nthe Pribilof Islands. Additionally, it authorizes $10 million a year \nfor five years for NOAA to complete its environmental cleanup and \nlandfill closure obligations prior to the final transfer of federal \nproperty to the six local entities. The Pribilof Islands have \nhistorically been a very expensive program to the American taxpayers. \nCongress expects that this title will provide a final termination of \nNOAA's municipal and social service responsibilities on the islands and \na distinct end to federal taxpayer funding of those services.\n  Title II of this bill is the Coral Reef Conservation Act of 2000. It \nis based on legislation that I first introduced over three years ago \nand S. 725, a bill that I introduced earlier in the 106th Congress \nalong with Senator McCain, the Chairman of the Commerce Committee.\n  Over the last decade, the United States had been leading a focused \neffort to conserve and manage coral reef ecosystems. The plight of \ncoral reefs, both in the United States and internationally, gained much \nattention in 1997, the International Year of the Reef. One very \nsuccessful program undertaken during the year-long event involved \ngrants to local groups to build grassroots support for coral reef \nconservation, management, and educational programs. Since that time, \nNOAA has steadily improved coral reef management programs utilizing the \nfull range of existing statutory authorities including the Coastal Zone \nManagement Act, the National Marine Sanctuaries Act, the Magnuson-\nStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the Marine Mammal \nProtection Act, and the Endangered Species Act. These complementary \nauthorities provide the framework for comprehensive coral reef \nconservation and management. Working in partnership with the States and \nother agencies, NOAA has demonstrated its unique ability among the \nfederal agencies to effectively manage these valuable resources.\n  This title will augment the tools already available and provides an \noutline to assist NOAA as it moves forward with coral reef ecosystem \nmanagement plans. It requires the creation of a national coral reef \naction strategy. Of particular note is the use of marine protected \nareas to serve as replenishment zones. The U.S. Coral Reef Task Force \nhas called for setting aside 20 percent of coral reefs in each region \nof the United States that contains reefs as no-take areas. However, \nmany of the U.S. islands that have coral reefs have significant \ncultural ties to these reefs. It is imperative that any new marine \nprotected areas are developed in close cooperation with the people of \nthese islands and account for traditional and cultural uses of these \nresources. Without such cooperation, there will not be public support. \nThe national strategy will address how such traditional uses will be \nincorporated into these replenishment zones.\n  The national program will also incorporate such important topics as \nmapping; research, monitoring, and assessment; international and \nregional management; outreach and education; and restoration. According \nto NOAA, the majority of our nation's coral reefs are within federal \nwaters, therefore it is expected that NOAA will continue to work \ncooperatively with the states, territories, and commonwealths in the \ndevelopment and implementation of coral reef management plans and not \nshift the burden of responsibility onto these states, territories, and \ncommonwealths. It is particularly important that NOAA not let recent \nactivities in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands consume too much of the \nagency's personnel and financial resources at the expense of the rest \nof the nation's reefs. While the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral \nReef Reserve will provide protection for the majority of reefs within \nour borders, it will not provide protection for our most heavily \ndegraded reefs. NOAA must work collaboratively with our island partners \nto implement meaningful coral reef management strategies that target \nthe full range of problems.\n  The title also creates a new coral reef conservation program, which \nwill provide grants to states, governmental authorities, educational \ninstitutions, and non-governmental organizations. This is intended to \nfoster locally based coral reef conservation and management. Creation \nof a coral reef conservation fund is also authorized. This fund would \nallow the Administration to enter into agreements with nonprofit \norganizations to support partnerships between the public and private \nsectors to further the conservation of coral reefs and help raise the \nmatching funds required as part of the new grants program.\n  The title authorizes a total of $16 million a year for fiscal years \n2001 through 2004 to be spilt equally between the local coral reef \nconservation program and national coral reef activities. It is our \nexpectation that this money will be utilized in such a way that builds \nupon partnerships with the U.S. islands.\n  Title III of the bill makes a number of minor technical changes to \nfisheries\n\n[[Page S11894]]\n\nlaws. The fourth title of the bill authorizes the study of biological \nand environmental factors that are responsible for an increase in \ndeaths in the eastern gray whale population. Two-hundred ninety \nthousand dollars is authorized for fiscal year 2001, and $500,000 is \nauthorized for each of fiscal years 2002 through 2004.\n  Title V of the bill makes a technical correction to the American \nFisheries Act (AFA) with regard to two fishing vessels, the Providian \n(United States Official Number 1062183) and the Hazel Lorraine (United \nStates Official Number 592211). The 1998 AFA authorized the \nparticipation of certain US-owned fishing vessels in the Bering Sea \npollock fishery. The AFA was designed to work in conjunction with the \nlicense limitation provisions of the fishery management plan developed \nby the North Pacific Fishery Management Council. Certain ``qualifying \nyears'' were established in order to determine which vessels had earned \na ``fishing history'' to allow them future access to pollock-fishing \nquotas. During the consideration of the AFA, the special circumstances \nof many vessels were taken into account. At that time, the fishing \nvessel Providian was being built in a U.S. shipyard as a replacement \nvessel for the pollock-fishing vessel Ocean Spray.\n  In 1994, the Ocean Spray was lost at sea--fortunately without the \nloss of a single life. Had the Ocean Spray not been lost, the vessel \nwould have continued to fish for Bering Sea pollock during the years \nleading up to the development of the AFA. After the loss of the Ocean \nSpray, the owner-operator followed the replacement guidelines in order \nto secure his federal fishing permits and endorsement for his new \nvessel, the Providian. According to landing records, it appears that \nthe average pollock harvest of the Ocean Spray during the years 1992 \nthrough 1994, exceeded 2000 metric tons.\n  Since the construction on the Providian was completed, the owner \ndecided to bring his vessel to Bath, Maine to work in the Maine herring \nfishery. The current location of this vessel does not eliminate the \nneed to establish fairness and restore the vessel owner's pollock-\nfishing rights earned with the Ocean Spray during 1992-1994. This \namendment to the AFA is intended to provide the North Pacific Fishery \nManagement Council and the National Marine Fisheries Service with the \nauthority to qualify the Providian under the AFA with directed onshore \npollock-fishing rights equivalent to those earned by the Ocean Spray \nduring the years 1992-1994.\n  Mr. President, the authors of the AFA certainly took into account the \nparticular circumstances of other vessel owners and companies. This \ntechnical amendment simply qualifies two vessels, the Providian and the \nHazel Lorraine under the AFA for fishing rights that they otherwise \nshould have received allow for the participation of two additional \ncatcher vessels in the Alaskan pollock fishery. These vessels were able \nto demonstrate that they should have been included in the Act when it \npassed in 1998.\n  I would like to thank Senator Kerry, the ranking member of the Oceans \nand Fisheries Subcommittee for his hard work and support of this bill. \nI would also like to thank Senator Inouye for his support, particularly \nfor his contributions to the coral reef conservation section of the \nbill. In addition, I would like to thank Senator McCain, the chairman \nof the Commerce Committee, and Senator Hollings, the ranking member of \nthe Committee, for their bipartisan support of this measure. We have \nbefore us an opportunity to significantly improve our nation's ability \nto conserve and manage our marine resources and I urge the Senate to \npass H.R. 1653, as amended.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11894-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECOGNITION OF CONGRESSMAN NEIL STAEBLER\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

However, \nNeil's greatest desire was to make our government work for all its \ncitizens.\n  Throughout his life, Neil dedicated himself to serving the United \nStates of America. At the age of thirty-seven, he joined the World War \nII effort by enlisting in the United States Navy, where he served as a \nlieutenant.\n  After the conclusion of the war, Neil and a group of other \ndistinguished citizens from Michigan, including former Governor G. \nMennen Williams, former Congresswoman and Lieutenant Governor Martha \nGriffiths, and Martha's husband Hicks, helped to re-shape the Michigan \nDemocratic Party and alter the landscape of Michigan politics. They \nsought to reinvigorate the Democratic Party and make it more responsive \nto the will and the needs of Michigan's citizens. Their efforts led to \na renewed vibrancy within the Michigan Democratic Party, and propelled \nNeil to the chairmanship of the Party.\n  Neil served as state chairman for over a decade, and was able to use \nhis position to encourage active political participation by all people. \nIn addition to serving as state chairman and winning a seat to Congress \nin 1962, he ran an unsuccessful but hard fought challenge of Governor \nGeorge Romney in 1964.\n  While he was a loyal member of the Democratic Party, Neil Staebler \nwas first and foremost committed to our nation's institutions and the \nneed for all citizens to participate in the democratic process. \nPresident Gerald Ford recognized Neil's commitment to civic \nparticipation when he appointed him to serve on the first Federal \nElections Commission.\n  Throughout this year's election, people of differing political \nallegiances have remarked on the stable and resilient nature of our \nnation's institutions. Our health as a democracy is due, in a large \npart, to the dedication and efforts of individuals like Neil Staebler. \nNeil Staebler was one of the true lions of Michigan and American \npolitics. I am sure that my Senate colleagues will join me in honoring \nthe memory of Neil Staebler, and in wishing his wife Burnette and their \nfamily well in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11894-2", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11894-S11895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE MILLENNIUM HOLIDAY TREE\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, the wonderful tree currently gracing the \nWest lawn of this Capitol is from Colorado. I have had the pleasure of \nworking towards getting this tree to DC for 2\\1/2\\ years, and I wanted \nto share with my colleagues a little about my home state's gift to the \nnation.\n  The Millennium Holiday Tree is a gift from the entire state of \nColorado to our nation. It is a celebration of all that is Colorado: \nnatural beauty, many cultures, cities and rural communities, and our \nrich history. The Colorado tree will be shining through early January \n2001. The Millennium Holiday Tree is a native Colorado Blue Spruce \nwhich stands 65' tall and was projected to be 77 years old at the time \nof cutting. It was grown on the Pike National Forest near the community \nof Woodland Park. The tree was selected from this area because it is in \nthe shadow of Pikes Peak, often referred to as ``America's Mountain''.\n  The Colorado State Forest Service is growing seedlings from the \n``grandma'' tree. Seedlings from the Millennium Holiday Tree will be \nreplanted at the cutting site. The Governor and Francis Owens were \namong the first to receive a Holiday Tree seedling for their support of \nthis project. Hundreds of seedlings will also be planted in memorial \nforests around the state as part of Holiday Tree celebrations.\n  Colorado school children made over 4,000 ornaments for the tree. They \neach depict the theme: ``Valuing the Past--Looking to the Future''. \nEach county had the opportunity to supply 100 ornaments for the \nMillennium Holiday Tree and the companion trees.\n  Through the many community events, we celebrated the richness of \nColorado. Each reflected the wide range of cultural and historical \ninfluences present in our communities--Native American, Hispanics, \npioneers, and others. Local celebrations were encouraged in each of \nColorado's 64 counties and at each of the 10 stops along the Tree \nroute. Santa Fe Trail communities in Kansas and Missouri joined the \ncelebrations too, including one in St. Louis at a National Park Service \nhistoric site. After the cutting ceremony on November 20th, the tree \nwas\n\n[[Page S11895]]\n\nmoved indoors where the limbs were drawn up and secured for the long \njourney. A 65-foot trailer, designed to look like a historic Conestoga \npioneer wagon, hauled the tree. Organizers used an experimental shrink \nwrap method to keep the tree fresh and secure from weather damage. The \ntree traveled caravan-style here to our nation's Capitol following the \nSanta Fe Trail, a historic trade route through Colorado, Kansas and \nMissouri. My friend and our colleague from Colorado, Senator Ben \nNighthorse Campbell, actually drove the tree carrying truck all the way \nout here. He told me he had a great time, and I believe him.\n  Sixty four smaller companion trees, one from each county, traveled \nwith the Millennium Holiday Tree and were placed in various government \noffices throughout DC.\n  This entire project was made possible through generous financial and \nin-kind support from the many sponsors. Volunteers, donations, and \nsponsorships made it all possible. Unused surpluses from this project \nwill be set aside for a rural endowment fund. The year 2000 will be the \n31st year a tree has been provided by the U.S. Forest Service and its \npartners. And I want to especially thank Dr. Raitano and Bill Nelson \nfor their incredible work on this. They ``parented'' the project for \nyears and it is due to their efforts it all turned out so well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11895-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ``SHALL ISSUE'' LEGISLATION IN MICHIGAN\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, late Wednesday night, the Michigan \nLegislature passed a bill that, if signed, will have a negative impact \non public safety in my home state. The legislature passed the ``shall \nissue'' bill which would require that local licensing authorities \n``shall'' or must issue a concealed handgun license to a person who \npasses a background check and a safety course. Notably, the legislature \nwaited until after the election to pass the legislation.\n  The current law in our state now gives local gun boards discretion to \nissue concealed gun licenses where a need is shown. Current law allows \nlocal gun boards--each made up of a local sheriff, a county prosecutor \nand a designee of the State police--to determine who should be allowed \nto carry a concealed handgun. The legislation before the state \nlegislature would take discretion away from local law enforcement and \nallow virtually any applicant to carry a concealed handgun.\n  In May of 1999, when the State Legislature last took up this bill, a \ncoalition of law enforcement groups led the fight against it. Law \nenforcement soundly rejects the proliferation of concealed weapons in \nour communities and have warned that this legislation will move \nMichigan in a dangerous direction.\n  The Michigan Law Enforcement Coalition issued the following statement \nabout the bill:\n\n       Current law authorizes a local gun board made up of local \n     law enforcement officials to issue CCW [Carry Concealed \n     Weapons] licenses to those citizens who show a demonstrated \n     need to carry a concealed weapon. Legislation that would \n     shift the burden of proof, requiring the board to issue a \n     permit unless it can state a reason, is a state-mandated \n     ``shall issue'' bill and eliminates local control.\n       The Michigan Law Enforcement Coalition opposes any \n     legislation which strips local gun boards of their discretion \n     and shifts the burden of proof from the applicant to the gun \n     board.\n\n  The Michigan Association of Chiefs of Police issued this statement:\n\n       This bill not only puts citizens at risk but will also \n     effect law enforcement officers trying to do a difficult and \n     dangerous job. Officers, already concerned due to the \n     proliferation of handguns, would have even more apprehension \n     knowing that the odds of confronting a concealed weapon have \n     been multiplied. The presence of a gun can make any situation \n     more dangerous. A gun can turn routine arguments into \n     episodes of serious injury or death. During stressful times \n     reasonable people do unreasonable things. The shouting match \n     over a parking space or the fist fight at a sporting event \n     can escalate into a shoot-out when guns are more accessible. \n     Already nearly one-third of all murders committed are the \n     result of an argument according to the FBI's Uniform Crime \n     Report.\n       The Michigan Association of Chiefs of Police urges the \n     Michigan Legislature to refrain from allowing the \n     proliferation of concealed weapons without adequate \n     safeguards by county licensing authorities. An armed society \n     is a frightened and dangerous society.\n\n  Law enforcement groups were joined in their opposition to this bill \nby religious leaders, child advocates, and community leaders. Groups \nsuch as the Michigan Catholic Conference, Michigan PTA, Michigan \nMunicipal League, Michigan's Children, Michigan Library Association, \nMichigan Association of Elementary and Middle School Principals, \nMichigan Association of Nonpublic Schools-Parent Network, Michigan \nPartnership to Prevent Gun Violence, Michigan Association of Theatre \nOwners, and National Conference for Community and Justice are unified \nagainst the ``shall issue'' standard.\n  Mr. President, I am disappointed that the Michigan Legislature passed \nthis bill. I believe ``shall issue'' is wrong for Michigan and I have \nurged the Governor to veto the bill. I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record the letter I sent to the Governor.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                December 13, 2000.\n     Hon. John Engler,\n     Governor of the State of Michigan,\n     Lansing, MI.\n       Dear Governor Engler: I am writing to urge you to veto the \n     ``shall issue'' legislation which recently passed the \n     Michigan Legislature.\n       The ``shall issue'' legislation would make us less safe \n     according to those best in a position to know. That's why it \n     is opposed by a broad coalition of law enforcement groups \n     such as the Michigan Association of Chiefs of Police and the \n     Michigan Police Legislative Coalition (which includes the \n     Michigan State Police Troopers Association, the Michigan \n     State Police Command Officers Association, the Michigan \n     Association of Police, the Police Officers Labor Council, \n     Detroit Police Lieutenants and Sergeants Association, Detroit \n     Police Officers Association, Warren Police Officers \n     Association, and Flint Police Officers Association).\n       Law enforcement officers, who undergo an initial 72 hours \n     of firearms training as well as annual re-training, have \n     warned that allowing thousands more private citizens to carry \n     concealed handguns would pose significant threats to public \n     safety. It is unrealistic to expect citizens with a fraction \n     of the training to demonstrate the same precautions and the \n     same judgment as police officers. There is no justification \n     for making the already difficult and dangerous job of an \n     officer even more difficult and dangerous by increasing the \n     number of concealed handguns on the streets.\n       I am also concerned that an increase in concealed weapons \n     licenses will effectively expand an exception in the Brady \n     background check system. The ``Brady Law'' provides that \n     licensed gun dealers are not required to initiate criminal \n     background checks if the purchaser presents a state-issued \n     license to carry a firearm which was issued within five \n     years. This would mean that people who have committed crimes \n     after they have received concealed carry licenses would be \n     able to purchase additional guns with no background checks \n     unless and until their licenses are revoked.\n       Although the ``shall issue'' legislation allows the State \n     to suspend or revoke a license if the license holder has \n     committed a potentially disqualifying crime, the experiences \n     of other states with such laws show that revocation doesn't \n     happen instantly or always successfully. Some states with \n     ``shall issue'' laws have acknowledged mistakenly issuing \n     hundreds of licenses to applicants with prior convictions. \n     Once those persons manage to slip through the screening \n     process for concealed gun licenses that one time, they are \n     then able to buy guns without further background checks for \n     five years.\n       Earlier this year, all eyes turned to Michigan after the \n     tragic shooting death of Kayla Rolland. Now, nearly ten \n     months later, the people of Michigan want all of us to work \n     toward decreasing the amount of gun violence in their schools \n     and community places, not increasing the proliferation of \n     guns in our neighborhoods and on our streets. The people of \n     Michigan reject the notion that they will be unsafe in public \n     places if not armed. I urge you to do the same and to veto \n     the ``shall issue'' legislation, leaving local gun boards in \n     charge of these often life and death decisions.\n           Sincerely,\n     Carl Levin.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11895-2", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11895-S11896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOMMENDATION OF GLENN A. FINE\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I want to voice my support today for Glenn \nFine, who would truly be an outstanding Inspector General at the \nDepartment of Justice. As you know, the Inspector General is charged \nwith investigating waste, fraud, abuse and corruption. As such, it is a \nposition of critical importance that we should have filled before \nadjourning for the year to ensure accountable and effective oversight \nof the DOJ.\n  Mr. Fine has been dealing with corruption ever since the Harvard-\nBoston\n\n[[Page S11896]]\n\nCollege basketball game on December 16, 1978, in which he scored 19 \npoints and had 14 assists--perhaps his best performance in college--\nonly to discover later that this particular game was part of a \nnotorious point-shaving scandal. No doubt this first-hand experience \ndrove him in his later quest to weed out corruption at the Department \nof Justice.\n  More seriously, though, Mr. Fine has served in a variety of \nprofessional roles and always in an exemplary fashion. He is currently \nthe Director of the Special Investigations and Review Unit in the \nDepartment of Justice's Office of the Inspector General, where he has \nsupervised a variety of sensitive internal investigations, including \nthe FBI's handling of the Aldrich Ames case. He also worked as an \nAssistant U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, where he \nprosecuted more than 35 criminal jury trials. His academic credentials \nare stellar as well. He is a Rhodes Scholar and he was graduated magna \ncum laude from Harvard Law School. Finally, though this is a political \nappointment, Mr. Fine is non-partisan--exactly the type of appointee \nthat a Republican President might very well consider keeping on. He \nworked as an Assistant U.S. Attorney during the Reagan and Bush \nadministrations, and has never been involved in a political campaign.\n  As this session of Congress comes to a close, a position as important \nas the Inspector General should have been filled. I'm only sorry that \nan individual as outstanding as Mr. Fine was not confirmed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11896-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11896-S11897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              COMMODITY FUTURES MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to thank and commend Chairman Lugar \nfor all of his hard work and leadership in bringing the Commodity \nFutures Modernization Act to the point of this final, agreed upon bill, \nwhich will be a part of the appropriations measure passed later today. \nI am pleased to have had the opportunity to work with Chairman Lugar on \nthis important legislation and to cosponsor it.\n  This bill will bring much-needed modernization, legal certainty, \nclarification and reform to the regulation of futures, options and \nover-the-counter financial derivatives. At the same time, it maintains \nregulatory oversight of the agricultural futures and options markets \nand continues and improves protections for investors and the public \ninterest with regard to futures, options and derivatives.\n  The legislation carries out the recommendations of the President's \nWorking Group on Financial Markets. Members and staff of the Working \nGroup, especially the Department of the Treasury, the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission, were \ninstrumental in helping to craft the bill. And it is significant that \nthis final version of the bill is strongly supported by all members of \nPresident's Working Group on Financial Markets. I ask unanimous consent \nthat a letter from the Working Group be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of this statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HARKIN. After many years of effort, this legislation resolves a \nnumber of very difficult issues regarding the trading of futures on \nsecurities--issues that have caused a great many headaches as well as \ndisparities in the markets over the years. I am pleased that we have \nbeen able to arrive at solutions that clear away regulatory impediments \nto market development, while maintaining and strengthening investor \nprotections and addressing margin and tax issues in order to avoid \ngiving any market an inappropriate competitive advantage over others \ninvolved in related transactions.\n  Clearly, modernizing the regulatory scheme for futures and \nderivatives must be balanced with maintaining and strengthening \nprotection for individual investors and the public interest. The \nprincipal anti-fraud provision of the Commodity Exchange Act is section \n4b, which the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has consistently \nrelied upon to combat fraudulent conduct, such as by bucket shops and \nboiler rooms that enter into transactions directly with their \ncustomers, even though such conduct does not involve a traditional \nbroker-client relationship. Reliance on section 4b in such \ncircumstances has been supported in federal courts that have examined \nthe issue, and is fully consistent with the understanding of Congress \nand with past amendments to Section 4b, which confirmed the \napplicability of Section 4b to fraudulent actions by parties that enter \ntransactions directly with customers. It is the intent of Congress in \nretaining Section 4b in this bill that the provision not be limited to \nfiduciary, broker-client or other agency-like relationships. Section 4b \nprovides the Commission with broad authority to police fraudulent \nconduct within its jurisdiction, whether occurring in boiler rooms and \nbucket shops, or in the e-commerce and other markets that will develop \nunder this new statutory framework.\n  I would also like to discuss my views regarding the substantial \nregulatory changes for electronic markets in derivatives relating to \nnon-agricultural commodities. Essentially, those commodities are energy \nand metals. With particular regard to energy, given the recent high \nvolatility in energy markets--with dramatic price increases for \ngasoline, heating oil, natural gas and electricity--we must take great \ncare in whatever Congress does affecting the way in which markets in \nenergy function. In the Agriculture Committee, I worked to remove an \noutright exclusion from the bill and basically to continue with the \nsubstantial exemption the Commodity Futures Trading Commission had \nalready granted for energy and metal derivatives. Later, there were \nfurther negotiations to arrive at the provisions on this subject that \nare in this bill.\n  While I still have certain reservations about the energy and metals \nmarkets, I recognize the need for compromise, particularly in \nconsidering the overall importance and positive features of this \nlegislation. This bill's language and Congressional intent is clear \nthat the Commodity Futures Trading Commission retains a substantial \nrole in ensuring the honesty, integrity and transparency of these \nmarkets. For exempt commodities that are traded on a trading facility, \nthis bill clearly specifies that if the Commission determines that the \nfacility performs a significant cash market price discovery function, \nthe Commission will be able to ensure that price, trading volume and \nany other appropriate trading data will be disseminated as determined \nby the Commission. This bill also clearly continues in full effect the \nCommission's anti-fraud and anti-manipulation authority with regard to \nexempt transactions in energy and metals derivatives markets.\n  I also want to mention and express appreciation for the cooperation \nof Chairman Gramm and Ranking Member Sarbanes of the Banking Committee \nin completing this bill. With respect to banking products, the language \nof the bill clarifies what is already the current state of the law. The \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission does not regulate traditional \nbanking products: deposit accounts, savings accounts, certificates of \ndeposit, banker's acceptances, letters of credit, loans, credit card \naccounts and loan participations.\n  The language of Title IV of this bill is very clear and very tightly \nworded. It requires that to qualify for the exclusion, a bank must \nfirst obtain a certification from its regulator that the identified \nbank product was commonly offered by that bank prior to December 5, \n2000. The product must have been actively bought, sold, purchased or \noffered--and not be just a customized deal that the bank may have done \nfor a handful of clients. The product cannot be one that was either \nprohibited by the Commodity Exchange Act or regulated by the Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission. In other words--a bank cannot pull a \nfutures product out of regulation by using this provision.\n  For new products, Title IV is also abundantly clear: the Commodity \nExchange Act does not apply to new bank products that are not indexed \nto the value of a commodity. Again, the plain language is clear and the \nintent of Congress is clear that no bank may use this exclusion to \nremove products from proper regulation under the Commodity Exchange \nAct.\n  Lastly, Title IV allows hybrid products to be excluded from the \nCommodity Exchange Act if, and only if, they pass a ``predominance \ntest'' that\n\n[[Page S11897]]\n\nindicates that they are primarily an identified banking product and not \na contract, agreement or transaction appropriately regulated by the \nCFTC. While the statute provides a mechanism for resolving disputes \nabout the application of this test, there is no intent that a product \nwhich flunks this test be regulated by anyone other than the CFTC.\n  Once again, I commend Chairman Lugar and Congressman Tom Ewing, the \nChairman of the Subcommittee on Risk Management, Research and Specialty \nCrops, as well as all staff involved for their outstanding work in \nmaking this important legislation a reality.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                December 15, 2000.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \n         Forestry U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: The Members of the President's Working \n     Group on Financial Markets strongly support the Commodities \n     Futures Modernization Act. This important legislation will \n     allow the United States to maintain its competitive position \n     in the over-the-counter derivative markets by providing legal \n     certainty and promoting innovation, transparency and \n     efficiency in our financial markets while maintaining \n     appropriate protections for transactions in non-financial \n     commodities and for small investors.\n           Sincerely,\n     Lawrence H.

Mr. President, I rise today to briefly discuss S. 2589, \nthe Meeting America's Investment Needs in Small Towns Act, or the MAIN \nStreet Act as I call it. Not only is Main Street the acronym formed by \nthis title, but it goes to the heart of why this legislation is \nnecessary.\n  As we move into the new economy, money is flowing from our small \ntowns and communities to the larger financial markets. While each \nindividual investment decision may make sense, the cumulative effect is \na wealth drain from rural America. Money invested in Wall Street is not \ninvested on Main Street. Wall Street wizards can work wonders with a \nportfolio, but they don't fund a new hardware store down the street. \nThey don't go the extra mile to help a struggling farmer whose family \nthey have served for years. And they don't sponsor the local softball \nteam.\n  By increasing the federally insured deposit level, we can help \ncommunity banks and thrifts compete for scarce deposits. My legislation \nwill account for the erosion to FDIC-insured levels from 1980. It will \nindex these levels into the future, protecting against further \nerosions.\n  Under current calculations, the immediate impact would be to almost \ndouble the insured funds, from $100,000 to approximately $197,000. The \nlong range impact of this legislation would be to make locally based \nfinancial institutions more competitive for deposits, help stem the \ndwindling deposit base many areas face, and lead to new investments in \nour communities.\n  Congress last addressed the issue of a deposit insurance increase in \n1980. At that time, we increased the insured level from $40,000 to \n$100,000. Congress has not adjusted that level since 1980. In real \nterms, inflation has eroded almost half of that protection.\n  Every bank or thrift customer knows that the FDIC insures deposits up \nto $100,000. For many people, that notice symbolizes that the financial \nmight of the United States government stands behind their banking \ninstitution. We learned the hard lessons of the 1930s, and created the \nFDIC to protect and strengthen our financial system.\n  In rural communities across America, local banks serve as the hub of \nthe town. Every business in town relies on the bank for funding. The \nbanker knows the town, and the town knows the banker. In many ways, \neach knows it disappears without the other.\n  Individuals in these towns like to know who is handling their money. \nThey like the idea that their funds are secure in their home town. And, \nthey like the fact that their money can be leveraged into other \ninvestments that will improve their communities. The more deposits a \nbank has, the more loans it can make. These loans are made locally, and \nserve as an investment in local communities.\n  The MAIN Street Act will help preserve these small towns and \ncommunities. It will bring greater liquidity to community banks and \npromote growth and development. I look forward to working with the FDIC \nand other banking leaders as we seek to update our banking insurance \nprotections to allow small banks to compete with other investment \nopportunities available. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord an article by Bill Seidman which further outlines some of the \nissues surrounding federal deposit insurance.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         $200,000 of FDIC Insurance? The Battle Has Just Begun\n\n       The battle is on--in one corner there's the proverbial \n     David in the person of the FDIC Chairman Donna Tanoue, and in \n     the other corner, three giant Goliaths--Senate Banking \n     Committee Chairman Phil Gramm, Treasury Secretary Lawrence \n     Summers, and Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan\n       Technically the conflict is over the FDIC's Deposit \n     Insurance Option Paper (published in August), which suggested \n     (some said foolishly) that deposit insurance coverage should \n     be increased from $100,000 to $200,000 per depositor. As the \n     paper pointed out, such an increase would compensate for the \n     last 20 years or so of inflation since the insurance level \n     was set at $100,000. The new ceiling might also help to meet \n     an increasingly difficult problem for community banks--\n     obtaining sufficient deposits to meet growing loan demand. \n     Core deposits as a source of funding for community banks have \n     steadily declined and largely are being replaced by loans \n     from the Federal Home Loan Banking System.\n       Once this idea was floated, Senator Gramm, and ever-pure \n     free marketer, reacted with a resounding ``No way--not on my \n     watch!'' At a recent Senate committee hearing (on an \n     unrelated subject) Gramm gained support for his position from \n     the secretary of the Treasury and the Fed chairman. Treasury \n     said it doesn't agree with the proposal because it increases \n     risk taking and possible government liability; Greenspan said \n     ``no'' because he feels it's a subsidy for the rich. (I guess \n     he's been in government so long that anyone who has over \n     $100,000 is really rich.)\n       Do these opinions nix the possibility for a change in the \n     deposit insurance ceiling? I don't believe so. This is a \n     complex issue that will require congressional hearings and \n     much research, because it relates to ``too big to fail'' \n     policies and overall financial reform. Here are some of the \n     important points to be weighed in this debate.\n       Increasing deposit insurance brings more financial risk to \n     government--Possible, but unlikely, since the bank insurance \n     fund has never cost the Treasury a penny (the thrift \n     insurance fund is the one that went broke. Even Chairman \n     Tanoue and Fed Governor Meyer have pointed out that the \n     greatest risk to the fund is likely to be the failure of a \n     large complex bank. Moreover, the risk is much greater to the \n     federal government when it supports a huge home loan bank \n     financing institution (another quasi-governmental agency such \n     as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac)--where any trouble means big \n     trouble.\n       It distorts the operations of the free market--This is also \n     referred to as creating a ``morale hazard,'' the idea being \n     that FDIC depositors won't have to worry about the condition \n     of the bank. Of course, the so-called free market is out of \n     kilter anyway, what with the Federal Reserve's discount \n     window and the Treasury's bailout of Mexico and half of Asia \n     through the IMF. In fact, the government seldom does anything \n     that doesn't impact the free market (think environmental \n     protection, antitrust, regulation of good drugs, bad drugs, \n     and so on). The issue of whether to increase the deposit \n     insurance ceiling has less to do with distortion of the free \n     market than it does with whether this particular action in \n     total is ``good for the country.'' (In the case of Mexico, \n     for instance, the free marketers decided that a U.S. bailout \n     of rich U.S. business leaders was good for the country and \n     the world; bingo, the funds were granted.)\n       It's a subsidy for the rich--It's debatable whether FDIC \n     insurance is a subsidy at all. Most economists (though not \n     Greenspan) doubt that there is much of a subsidy because the \n     banks have paid for all of the insurance and the insurance \n     fund has covered any losses.\n       Now that I've laid out the opposing views, here are several \n     good reasons for approving the FDIC deposit guarantee \n     increase:\n       It will level the competitive playing field--Historically, \n     governments have protected all bank depositors when very \n     large banks are in trouble, thus providing an implicit \n     guarantee of unlimited insurance for those institutions \n     (e.g., Japan, Saudi, Korea, Thailand,\n\n[[Page S11898]]\n\n     and the U.S.). Therefore, at the very least, the increase to \n     $200,00 tends to give community banks a better chance to \n     maintain their deposit base against a too-big-to-fail \n     competitor.\n       The increase will reduce the risk that smaller banks and \n     the communities they serve will stagnate due to the banks' \n     inability to obtain funding at a reasonable cost--It could \n     also reduce future FDIC insurance payments if these weak \n     banks fail in the next recession. (Incidentally, an FDIC \n     study shows that if the insurance level had been at $200,000 \n     during the problems of the '80s and '90s, it would not have \n     materially increased FDIC insurance costs.)\n       The increase will help to maintain a banking system that is \n     decentralized and diverse--This type of system helps the \n     economy, boosts productively, and promotes entrepreneurship--\n     important factors in our present prosperity.\n       It provides a savings incentive--As more baby boomers \n     retire with savings in excess of $100,000, the increased FDIC \n     insurance coverage will provide a convenient and conservative \n     savings option and will encourage savings, which all \n     economists agree would be good for the U.S. economy.\n       You may have guessed by now that I'm rooting for the corner \n     with little David (Chairman Tanoue) in this important policy \n     showdown--and the battle is far from over. Why? I'll simply \n     use the litmus test that applies to all other proposed \n     reforms: It's good for the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11898-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            RECOGNITION OF SERVICE TO THE STATE OF MICHIGAN\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM.

Among the most pressing issues facing American senior \ncitizens and persons with disabilities is the need for coverage of \nprescription drugs under Medicare. While we in Congress continue to \nwork to reach consensus on a Medicare prescription drug benefit, I \napplaud the bipartisan efforts of my colleagues to restore and preserve \nMedicare coverage for certain injectable drugs and biologicals that are \ncrucial to seniors and persons with debilitating chronic illnesses. To \nthis end the Act contains a tremendously important provision which \namends Section 1861(s)(2) of the Social Security Act relating to \ncoverage under Medicare Part B of certain drugs and biologicals \nadministered incident to a physician's professional service. Because it \nis expected that the Act will be passed without any accompanying \nCommittee Report language, and due to its importance to thousands of \ncitizens, I rise to explain this statutory language.\n  The Medicare Carrier Manual specifies that a drug or biological is \ncovered under this provision if it is ``usually'' not self-\nadministered. Under this standard, Medicare for many years covered \ndrugs and biological products administered by physicians in their \noffices and in other outpatient settings. In August 1997, however, the \nHealth Care Financing Administration issued a memorandum that had the \neffect of eliminating coverage for certain products that could be self-\nadministered. This changed policy interpretation resulted in thousands \nof patients who until that time had had coverage for drugs or \nbiologicals for their illnesses, including intramuscular treatments for \nmultiple sclerosis, being denied coverage for these same drugs and \nbiologicals. At a time when the Congress and the Administration are \nseeking to expand Medicare prescription drug coverage, this HCFA policy \nhas led to a reduction in coverage of many treatments.\n  The Act's language clarifies the Medicare reimbursement policy to \nensure that HCFA and its contractors will reimburse physicians and \nhospitals for injectable drugs and biologicals for illnesses such as \nmultiple sclerosis and various types of cancer as they had been \nreimbursed prior to the 1997 memorandum. The new statutory language \ncontained in the Act requires coverage of ``drugs and biologicals which \nare not usually self-administered by the patient,'' thus restoring the \ncoverage policy that was in effect prior to the August 1997 HCFA \nmemorandum. In carrying out this provision, HCFA\n\n[[Page S11899]]\n\nshould not narrowly define the word ``usually.'' Nor should HCFA make \nunsupported determinations that a drug or biological is usually self-\nadministered. In addition, HCFA should assume, as it did for many \nyears, that Medicare patients do not usually administer injections or \ninfusions to themselves, while oral medications usually are self-\nadministered. HCFA should also continue to take into account the \ncircumstances under which the drug or biological is being administered. \nFor example, products that are administered in emergencies should be \ncovered even though self-administration is the usual method of \nadministration, in a non-emergency situation.\n  I believe that to implement Congressional intent on this provision, \nHCFA must promptly issue a memorandum to inform its contractors (e.g. \ncarriers and intermediaries) of the change in the law.\n  I commend the efforts of the bipartisan sponsors of this provision \nfor correctly clarifying the intent of the Medicare reimbursement \ncoverage policy for injectable drugs and biologicals. This issue is of \nvital importance to thousands of our citizens that are afflicted with \ndebilitating illness such as multiple sclerosis. As Congress and the \nnation continue to engage in a discussion on expanding prescription \ndrug coverage under Medicare, this is an important step to provide our \nseniors and persons with disabilities with the life-saving prescription \ndrugs and biologicals that they deserve. I look forward to continue \nworking with the Administration and HCFA to ensure that our seniors and \npersons with disabilities receive coverage for injectable drugs and \nbiologicals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11899-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FAREWELL TO MANUS COONEY\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong support for \nthe International Criminal Court, ICC. Like all Senators, indeed like \nall Americans, I understand the need to safeguard innocent human life \nin wartime, at the same time that we ensure that the rights of our \nmilitary personnel are protected. The Rome Treaty establishing the \nInternational Criminal Court will achieve both those goals, and I urge \nPresident Clinton to sign the Treaty before the December 31 deadline.\n  The Treaty was approved overwhelmingly two years ago by a vote of 120 \nto 7. Since then, 117 nations have signed the Treaty--including every \none of our NATO allies except Turkey, all of the European Union \nmembers, and Russia. Regrettably, the U.S. joined a handful of human \nrights violators like Libya and Iraq in voting against it. Only one of \nour democratic allies voted with us, and it is quite possible that we \nwill end up as the only democratic country that is not a party to the \nCourt.\n  During the last century, an estimated 170 million civilians were the \nvictims of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. Despite \nthis appalling carnage, the response from the international community \nhas been, at best, sporadic, and at worst, nonexistent.\n  While there was progress immediately following World War II at \nNuremberg and Tokyo, the Cold War saw the international community \nlargely abdicate its responsibility and fail to bring to justice those \nresponsible for unspeakable crimes, from Cambodia to Uganda to El \nSalvador.\n  In the 1990s, there was renewed progress. The U.N. Security Council \nestablished a tribunal at The Hague to prosecute genocide and other \natrocities committed in the Former Yugoslavia. A second tribunal was \nformed in response to the horrific massacre of more than 800,000 people \nin Rwanda.\n  In addition, individual nations have increasingly taken action \nagainst those who have committed these crimes.\n  Spain pursued General Pinochet, and he may yet be prosecuted in \nChile. The Spanish Government has requested Mexico to extradite \nRichardo Miguel Cavallo, a former Argentine naval officer who served \nunder the military junta, on charges that include the torture of \nSpanish citizens.\n  A number of human rights cases have also been heard in U.S. civil \ncourts. In August, 2000, $745 million was awarded to a group of \nrefugees from the Balkans who accused Radovan Karadzic of conducting a \ncampaign of genocide, rape, and torture in the early 1990s. Also that \nmonth, an organization representing Chinese students who are suing the \nChinese Government for its brutality during the 1989 Tiananmen Square \nprotests, successfully served papers on Li Peng, the former Chinese \nPremier, as part of an ongoing lawsuit.\n  They are important steps towards holding individuals accountable, \ndeterring future atrocities, and strengthening peace. But the ICC would \nfill significant gaps in the existing patchwork of ad hoc tribunals and \nnational courts. For example:\n  A permanent international court sends a clear signal that those who \ncommit war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide will be \nbrought to justice.\n  By eliminating the uncertainty and protracted negotiations that \nsurround the creation of ad hoc tribunals, the Court will be more \nquickly available for investigations and justice will be achieved \nsooner.\n  International crimes tried in national courts can result in \nconflicting decisions and varying penalties. Moreover, sometimes \ngovernments take unilateral actions, even including kidnaping, to \nenforce prosecutorial and judicial decisions. The Court will help to \navoid these problems.\n  The Court will act in accordance with fundamental standards of due \nprocess, allowing the accused to receive fairer trials than in many \nnational courts.\n  In the past, when the international community established war crimes \ntribunals, the United States was at the forefront of those efforts. The \nperformance of the U.S. delegation at Rome was no different. The U.S. \nensured that the Court will serve our national interests by being a \nstrong, effective institution and one that will not be prone to \nfrivolous prosecutions.\n  Why then did the United States oppose the Treaty, despite getting \nalmost everything it wanted in the negotiations? Many observers feel \nthat it was because the Administration could not get iron-clad \nguarantees that no American servicemen and women would ever, under any \ncircumstances, come before the Court. A related concern was that the \nTreaty empowers the Court to indict and prosecute the nationals of any \ncountry, even countries that are not party to the Treaty.\n  The legitimate concern about prosecutions of American soldiers by the \nCourt, while not trivial, arises from a misunderstanding of the Court's \nrole.\n\n[[Page S11900]]\n\n The U.S. has been successful in obtaining important safeguards to \nprevent political prosecutions:\n  First, the ICC is neither designed nor intended to supplant \nindependent and effective judicial systems such as the U.S. courts. \nUnder the principle of ``complementarity'', the Court can act only when \nnational courts are either unwilling or unable to prosecute.\n  Second, the Court would only prosecute the most \natrociousinternational crimes such as genocide and crimes against \nhumanity. The U.S. was instrumental in defining the elements of these \ncrimes and in establishing high thresholds to ensure that the Court \nwould deal with only the most egregious offenses.\n  Third, the Court incorporates the rigorous criteria put forth by the \nUnited States for the selection of judges, ensuring that these jurists \nwill be independent and among the most qualified in world. Further, the \nRome Treaty provides for high standards for the selection of the \nprosecutor and deputy prosecutor, who can be removed by a vote of the \nmajority of states parties.\n\n  Finally, the Court provides for several checks against spurious \ncomplaints, investigations, and prosecutions. Before an investigation \ncan occur, the prosecution must get approval from a three-judge pre-\ntrial chamber, which is then subject to appeal. Moreover, the U.N. \nSecurity Council can vote to suspend an investigation or prosecution \nfor up to one year, on a renewable basis, giving the Security Council a \ncollective veto over the Court.\n  Because of these safeguards, our democratic allies--Canada, England, \nFrance, Ireland--with thousands of troops deployed overseas in \ninternational peacekeeping and humanitarian missions, have signed the \nTreaty.\n  The Pentagon has, from day one, argued that the United States should \nnot sign the Treaty unless we are guaranteed that no United States \nsoldier will ever come before the Court. In other words ``we will sign \nthe Treaty, as long as it does not apply to us.'' That is a totally \nuntenable position, which not surprisingly has not received a shred of \nsupport from other governments, including our allies and friends.\n  There is no doubt that further negotiations can improve the ICC, but \nit is unrealistic to expect to single out one's own citizens for \nimmunity, in every circumstance, from the jurisdiction of an \ninternational court. If that were possible, what would prevent other \nnations from demanding similar treatment? The Court's effectiveness \nwould be undermined.\n  Moreover, as the United States--which has refused to sign the treaty \nbanning landmines, or to ratify the comprehensive test ban treaty, or \nto pay our U.N. dues--is perceived as acting as if it is above the law, \nnations may begin to think ``why should we honor our international \ncommitments?'' If the U.S. becomes increasingly isolated, our soldiers \nwill face greater, not less, risk.\n  Such increasing risk is wholly unnecessary. Our Armed Forces are \nknown globally for their strict adherence to international humanitarian \nlaw and conventions governing the conduct of a military in wartime. \nSigning the Rome Treaty would be the clearest indication possible that \nwe are proud of this record, and are working every day to uphold it.\n  Mr. President, I too am troubled by the precedent of exerting \njurisdiction over non-party nationals. While this is a key component of \nthe Treaty which prevents rogue nations from shielding war criminals \nfrom the Court's jurisdiction by refusing to become a party, it could \nalso invite mischief in the future. What if, for example, a dozen \nstates were to join in a treaty that asserts jurisdiction over non-\nparties for the explicit purpose of targeting the citizens of the \nUnited States and its allies? Will the Rome Treaty set a precedent that \ncould make this more likely?\n  In fact, there is nothing to prevent that from happening today, and \nit is highly unlikely that such treaties would achieve legitimacy. They \nwould almost certainly not become recognized parts of international law \nand convention. While it is essential that we do everything possible to \nprotect the rights of American citizens, we also want an effective \nCourt. Indeed, there are almost certainly to be circumstances when we \nwould support ICC jurisdiction over non-party nationals.\n  Critics argue that the United States should ``block'' the ICC. They \nare misinformed. That is not an option. The requisite 60 countries are \ngoing to ratify the Treaty, and the Court will have jurisdiction over \ncitizens of non-parties, whether or not the U.S. signs.\n  The real issue is whether we sign the Treaty and enable the U.S. to \ncontinue to play a crucial role in shaping the ICC, ensuring that it \nserves its intended purpose of prosecuting the most heinous crimes--not \nthe U.S. Air Force pilot who mistakenly bombs the wrong target, a \ntragic but inevitable consequence of war. It is instructive, for those \nwho raise the specter of political prosecutions, that the Tribunal for \nthe Former Yugoslavia--which, like the ICC, the U.S. had a key role in \nshaping--declined to investigate allegations of war crimes resulting \nfrom NATO bombing of Serbia. We will be in a far better position to \nprotect the rights of American citizens if the Court must answer to the \nU.S. for its actions.\n  We can sign the Treaty and make clear that if the Court strays from \nits intended purpose, we will take what steps are needed, from refusing \nto ratify to withdrawing from the Treaty. I sincerely doubt, however, \nthat will become necessary. A key part of the Court's ability to \nfunction is its legitimacy. As others have said, ``the politicization \nof the Court would quickly end its relevance.''\n  We all know that it is simply not possible to be part of an \ninternational regime and get absolutely everything one wants. Nay \nsayers can always invent implausible scenarios that pose some risk. The \nkey question is: do the benefits of signing the Rome Treaty and \nthrowing our weight and influence behind it, outweigh the risks? I \nbelieve the answer is clearly yes.\n  Mr. President, the Treaty provides an adequate balance of strength \nand discretion to warrant signature by the United States. On the one \nhand, the Court is strong enough to bring war criminals to justice and \nprovide a deterrent against future atrocities. On the other, there are \nimportant checks in place to minimize the risks of sham prosecutions of \nAmerican troops. Yet, without the active participation and support of \nthe United States--the oldest and most powerful democracy on Earth \ncommitted to the rule of law--the Court will never realize its \npotential.\n  I agreed with President Clinton when he stated that, ``nations all \naround the world who value freedom and tolerance [should] establish a \npermanent international court to prosecute, with the support of the \nUnited Nations Security Council, serious violations of humanitarian \nlaw.''\n  Those words reminded me of the President's speech at the United \nNations six years ago, when he called for an international treaty \nbanning anti-personnel landmines. Two years later, when many of our \nallies and friends were negotiating such a treaty, the Administration, \nbowing to the Pentagon, chose to sit on the sidelines. They assumed, \nwrongly, that without U.S. support the process would run out of steam, \nand they even tried, at times, to undermine it.\n  Only in the final days, when the Administration finally realized the \nmine treaty was going to happen with or without the U.S., did they make \nseveral ``non-negotiable'' demands. Essentially, they said ``okay, we \nwill sign the treaty, as long as it does not apply to our landmines.'' \nPredictably, that was rejected. Today, 138 nations have signed that \ntreaty and 101 have ratified, including every NATO member except the \nUnited States and Turkey, and every Western Hemisphere nation except \nthe United States and Cuba.\n  One would have thought we would have learned from that experience. \nThe fact is that the United States can no longer singlehandedly \ndetermine whether an international treaty comes into force. If we do \nnot sign the Rome Treaty, there is a strong possibility that the Court, \nits prosecutors and judges will develop from the beginning an \nunsympathetic view towards the United States and its official \npersonnel. That is especially so if we end up opposing the Court and \nits legitimacy. Do we want a Court that views itself in opposition to \nthe United States? Or do we want a Court whose prosecutors and judges \nare selected\n\n[[Page S11901]]\n\nwith the influence of the United States, and a Court that must answer \nto the United States, as its most significant state party, for its \nactions? The answer should be obvious to anyone.\n  Mr. President, it is unacceptable that the world's oldest democracy--\nthe nation whose Bill of Rights was a model for the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights, the nation that called for the creation of \na permanent, international criminal court and did so much to make it a \nreality, has shrunk from this opportunity. The President should sign \nthe Rome Treaty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11901-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11901]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO BOY SCOUTS AND GIRL SCOUTS\n\n  Mr. L. CHAFEE. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I today \npay tribute to the accomplishments of the Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts of \nRhode Island. These fine organizations include an admirable group of \nyoung men and women who have distinguished themselves as leaders in \ntheir communities.\n  Since the beginning of this century, the Girls Scouts and Boy Scouts \nof America have provided thousands of youngsters each year with the \nopportunity to make friends, explore new ideas, and develop leadership \nskills, along with a sense of determination, self-reliance, and \nteamwork.\n  These awards are presented only to those who possess the qualities \nthat make our nation great: commitment to excellence, hard work, and \ngenuine love for community service. The Silver and Gold Awards \nrepresent the highest awards attainable by junior and high school Girl \nScouts. Becoming an Eagle Scout is an extraordinary award with which \nonly the finest Boy Scouts are honored. To earn the award--the highest \nadvancement rank in Scouting--a Boy Scout must demonstrate proficiency \nin the rigorous areas of leadership, service, and outdoor skills.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the recipients of \nthese awards. Their activities are indeed worthy of praise. Their \nleadership benefits our community and they serve as role models for \ntheir peers.\n  Also, we must not forget the unsung heroes, who continue to devote a \nlarge part of their lives to make all this possible. Therefore, I \nsalute the families, Scout leaders and countless others who have given \ngenerously of their time and energy in support of Scouting.\n  It is with great pride that I submit a list of the young men and \nwomen of Rhode Island who have earned this award.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the list be printed the Record.\n  The list of follows:\n\n                  Girls Scout Silver Award Recipients\n\n       Barrington, RI: Sarah E.

Mr. President, I rise tonight to express my deep \ndisappointment that this final package does not include a provision \nthat allows Liberian nationals living in this country to adjust to \npermanent residency.\n  As I have told this body many times, approximately 10,000 Liberians \nfled to the United States beginning in 1989 when their country became \nengulfed in a civil war. In 1991, Attorney General Barr granted \nLiberians Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and renewed it in 1992. \nUnder the Clinton administration, Attorney General Reno continued to \nrenew TPS for Liberians on an annual basis until last year when she \ngranted Deferred Enforced Departure. DED was renewed again this year.\n  While Liberians can now legally live in the United States for another \nyear, it does not change the fact that they have lived in limbo for \nalmost a decade. The Liberians have lived in a ``protected status'' \nlonger than any other group in the history of this country. These \nindividuals have played by the rules. From the beginning, they have \nalways lived in this country legally. They have established careers, \nopened businesses, bought homes, had American-born children, and \ncontributed to our communities. Yet, they are unable to enjoy the basic \nrights and privileges of U.S. citizenship. These people deserve better.\n  For several years I have been working to see that the Liberians \nreceive the justice they deserve. In March 1999, I introduced S. 656, \nthe Liberian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act which would allow \nLiberian nationals who had received TPS to adjust to permanent \nresidency. For almost two years I have been unable to convince my \ncolleagues to hold a hearing, debate this issue on the floor, or pass \nthe bill. I did everything I believed was necessary to garner support \nfor this legislation. I spoke on the floor, I wrote ``Dear \nColleagues'', I gathered cosponsors on both sides of the aisle, I spoke \npersonally with the leadership of both parties and the White House. \nDespite these efforts, the plight of the Liberians has not been \nrecognized and their status has not been resolved.\n  The situation facing the Liberians is not a novel issue for Congress. \nIn the time that the Liberians have lived in this country, several \nother immigrant groups, including 52,000 Chinese, 4,996 Poles, 200,000 \nEl Salvadorans, 50,000 Guatemalans and 150,000 Nicaraguans, who lived \nin the U.S. under temporary protective status for far less time have \nbeen allowed to adjust to permanent status. Just last month we passed a \nbill adjusting the status of 4,000 Syrian Jews. There are those who \nhave argued that it is time to stop passing ``nation specific'' \nimmigration fixes and to implement a system that is comprehensive and \nfair. I fully agree. But until we reach that point and are ready to \npass such legislation, I do not believe that we can, in good conscious, \narbitrarily deny certain groups a remedy for the unintended and unjust \nconsequences of our immigration law.\n  I would also like to state that I believe that we have a special \nobligation to the Liberians because of the special ties the U.S. has \nwith that country. Congress should honor the special relationship that \nhas always existed between the United States and Liberia. In 1822, \ngroups of freed slaves from the U.S. began to settle on the coast of \nWestern Africa with the assistance of private American philanthropic \norganizations at the behest of the U.S. government. In 1847, these \nsettlers established the republic of Liberia, the first independent \ncountry in Africa. Liberians modeled their constitution after the U.S. \nand named their capital Monrovia after President James Monroe. Mr. \nPresident, many of the Liberian nationals in this country can trace \ntheir ancestry to American slaves. We owe them more than we are giving \nthem tonight.\n  When Liberians arrived in this country, they expected to stay only a \nshort time and to return home once it was safe. But one year turned \ninto many and they moved on with their lives. They are now part of our \ncommunity. They deserve the same benefits that we have given so many \nothers--the rights of citizenship. It is my hope that we can address \nthis grievous situation early in the 107th Congress. We need to right a \nwrong.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11902-2", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11902]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       RONALD McDONALD HOUSE CHARITIES' NEW CHILD HEALTH PROGRAM\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the Houston \narrival of a Ronald McDonald Care Mobile--a state-of-the-art pediatric \nmobile healthcare unit. It is one of the first in an innovative \ninitiative of the Ronald McDonald House Charities, known and respected \nworldwide for its dedication to improving children's health.\n  In cooperation with its local affiliates and local hospitals or \nhealth systems, RMHC has begun rolling out these Ronald McDonald Care \nMobiles to bring free medical and dental services to children in \nunderserved communities. The Houston Ronald McDonald Care Mobile will \nbe operated and staffed by the Harris County Hospital District. It will \ntravel, on a regular schedule, to schools, churches, apartment \ncomplexes and other neighborhood sites where need is great. This RMHC \npartnership will significantly strengthen the District's capacity to \nserve the county's disadvantaged children and their families.\n  The Ronald McDonald Care Mobiles are a far cry from the usual \nconverted vans and school buses. They are specially-designed \npediatricians' offices on wheels, with two patient examination rooms, a \nlaboratory, reception and medical records areas and, in some cases, a \nhearing screening booth and dental hygiene room. The units are also \nstaffed to deliver first-rate care. Staffing will vary according to \nlocal needs but is likely to include a pediatrician, a pediatric nurse, \nand a manager. There may also be a social worker, a dental hygienist, \nan asthma specialist and/or medical residents, nursing students, and \ninterns in training.\n  The Ronald McDonald Care Mobiles will go directly into underserved \ncommunities. They will provide primary care, including immunizations \nand medical screenings; diagnosis, treatment, referral, and followup \nfor serious medical and dental conditions; and health education for \nchildren and their families. Staff will also help eligible families \nobtain government-assisted health insurance and will partner with \ncommunities to address critical local childhood health needs.\n  Our children are our nation's most precious resource. We are all \nbeholden to the Ronald McDonald House Charities for bringing vital \nhealth care to the underserved so that they may learn and play and grow \nup strong. This truly is giving back to the community at its finest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11902-3", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11902-S11903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               PROTECTING THE RIGHTS OF IMMIGRANT WORKERS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, fourteen years ago, Congress passed the \nImmigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, IRCA. That Act has had \nundeniably profound effects on the nation--both positive and negative. \nIRCA set into motion the current legalization program, which has \nbrought millions of individuals out of the shadows of illegal immigrant \nstatus and onto a path of temporary status, permanent status and, \nultimately, United States citizenship. At the same time, IRCA \nauthorized employer sanctions which, in addition to not deterring \nillegal immigration, have led to a false document industry and caused \ndiscrimination against Latino, Asian, other immigrant workers, and even \nUnited States citizens, who by their accent or appearance are wrongly \nperceived as being here illegally.\n  Many of us supported the provision in IRCA which created an office to \naddress cases of discrimination resulting from employer sanctions. \nSince then, the Department of Justice Office of Special Counsel for \nImmigration Related Unfair Employment Practices, OSC, has enforced the \nanti-discrimination provisions and provided relief to workers who have \nfaced immigration-related job discrimination.\n  One of the innovative accomplishments of OSC has been to develop \neffective partnerships with state and local government civil rights \nagencies. A Memoranda of Understanding enables the civil rights \nagencies who are supposed to work together to do just that. As a \nresult, all agencies are better equipped to prevent and eradicate \ndiscrimination.\n  Recently, the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination joined\n\n[[Page S11903]]\n\nwith the OSC to educate employers, workers and the general public in \nthe state and to work together to address discrimination. The Boston \nGlobe praised the work of the Office of Special Counsel and urged \nincreases in its staff and budget in order for it to keep up with the \ngrowing number of newcomers and employers. In the words of the \neditorial, ``This would help immigrants and the economy--a winning move \nfor the United States.''\n  I ask unanimous consent for the Boston Globe editorial, ``Protecting \nImmigrants,'' to be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Boston Sunday Globe, Oct. 19, 2000]\n\n                         Protecting Immigrants\n\n       Working immigrants are like high-octane fuel for the \n     economy. Given the nation's shortage of workers, hiring \n     immigrants is a great way to fill jobs, whether in high-tech \n     or in restaurants.\n       But immigrants can face serious job discrimination. Some \n     don't know their rights. Others are afraid to complain. \n     That's why federal and state governments must improve \n     enforcement of fair work practices.\n       One tool is in place, but it needs to grow.\n       In 1986, eager to crack down on illegal immigration, \n     Congress passed the Immigration Reform and Control Act. The \n     law threatened employers with fines unless they verified that \n     new hires were legally eligible to work.\n       Congress knew that turning employers into immigration cops \n     could lead to more discrimination. So the act also created \n     the Office of Special Counsel for Immigration Related Unfair \n     Employment Practices.\n       Today, the Office for the Special Counsel fights \n     discrimination based on national origin and citizenship \n     status. It cracks down on ``document discimination''--asking \n     for more proof of work status than is legally required--and \n     on rarer cases of employer retaliation. The office also \n     mediates disputes and trains employers and human service \n     providers.\n       This work goes on in states with large immigrant \n     populations, like New York and California, but also in \n     Arkansas, Oregon, and Nebraska, where immigrant populations \n     are growing. In the last two years, the office has reached \n     settlements with SmithKline Beecham, the pharmaceutical \n     company, the Atlanta Journal Constitution newspaper, and Iowa \n     Beef Packers, a meat packing and processing company in South \n     Dakota.\n       Last year, the special counsel's office awarded $45,000 to \n     the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition, a \n     grant used statewide to education immigrants, train community \n     agency staff, and hold forums. The office recently formed a \n     valuable alliance with the Massachusetts Commission Against \n     Discrimination. Since the office has no local branches, it is \n     building a nationwide web of local contacts whom immigrants \n     can turn to for federal help.\n       Unfortunately as national immigration rates soar, the \n     Office for the Special Counsel is having trouble keeping up. \n     Its activities are limited by a small staff and a budget of \n     just under $6 million. Doubling the budget would spread the \n     office's reach more evenly across the country. It could take \n     more preventative measures, helping employers before laws are \n     violated, instead of punishing them once the harm is done.\n       This would help immigrants and the economy--a winning move \n     for the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11903-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           FEDERAL JUDGESHIP\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today this Congress has expanded \naccessibility to justice for hundreds of thousands of residents of \nnorthern Wisconsin by creating a Federal judgeship to sit in Green Bay, \nWI. Let me explain how this judgeship will alleviate the stress that \nthe current system places on business, law enforcement agents, \nwitnesses, victims and individual litigants in northeastern Wisconsin.\n  First, while the four full-time district court judges for the Eastern \nDistrict of Wisconsin currently preside in Milwaukee, for most \nlitigants and witnesses in northeastern Wisconsin. Milwaukee is well \nover 100 miles away. In fact, as the courts are currently arranged, the \nnorthern portion of the Eastern District is more remote from a Federal \ncourt than any other major population center, commercial or industrial, \nin the United States. Thus, litigants and witnesses must incur \nsubstantial costs in traveling from northern Wisconsin to Milwaukee--\ncosts in terms of time, money, resources, and effort. Indeed, driving \nfrom Green Bay to Milwaukee takes nearly two hours each way. Add \ninclement weather or a departure point north of Green Bay--such as \nOconto or Marinette--and often the driving time alone actually exceeds \nthe amount of time witnesses spend testifying.\n  Second, Wisconsin's Federal judges serve a disproportionately large \npopulation. I commissioned a study by the General Accounting Office \nwhich revealed that Wisconsin Federal judges serve the largest \npopulation among all Federal judges. Each sitting Federal judge in \nWisconsin serves an average population of 859,966, while the remaining \nFederal judges across the country--more than 650--serve less than half \nthat number, with an average of 417,000 per judge. For example, while \nLouisiana has fewer residents than Wisconsin, it has 22 Federal judges, \nnearly four times as many as our State.\n  Third, the Federal Government is required to prosecute all felonies \ncommitted by Native Americans that occur on the Menominee Reservation. \nThe Reservation's distance from the Federal prosecutors and courts--\nmore than 150 miles--makes these prosecutions problematic, and because \nthe Justice Department compensates attorneys, investigators and \nsometimes witnesses for travel expenses, the existing system costs all \nof us. Without an additional judge in Green Bay, the administration of \njustice, as well as the public's pocketbook, will suffer enormously.\n  Fourth, many manufacturing and retail companies are located in \nnortheastern Wisconsin. These companies often require a Federal court \nto litigate complex price-fixing, contract, and liability disputes with \nout-of-State businesses. But the sad truth is that many of these \nlegitimate cases are never even filed--precisely because the northern \npart of the State lacks a Federal court. This hurts businesses not only \nin Wisconsin, but across the Nation.\n  In conclusion, having a Federal judge in Green Bay will reduce costs \nand inconvenience while increasing judicial efficiency. But most \nimportant, it will help ensure that justice is more available and more \naffordable to the people of northeastern Wisconsin.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11903-2", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11903-S11904]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ILO CONVENTION 182 RATIFICATION\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the first \nanniversary of U.S. ratification of the ILO's newest core human rights \nconvention: ILO Convention #182--the Elimination of the Worst Forms of \nChild Labor.\n  Last Friday was not just the first anniversary of ILO Convention \n#182. It was also the date on which Convention #182 came into effect in \nthe United States. That means the first report on U.S. compliance with \nthe terms of this treaty is due in Geneva by next September.\n  I have long been deeply involved in the struggle to end abusive child \nlabor. Ten years ago, the scourge of abusive child labor was spreading \nin the U.S. and throughout the world with little notice or concern from \nour government.\n  That is why I supported the first-ever, day-long Capitol Hill forum \non the Commercial Exploitation of Children. I had two primary goals in \nmind back then.\n  First, I wanted to sound an alarm about the increase in abusive child \nlabor in the U.S. and overseas. Second, I wanted to elevate this human \nrights and worker rights challenge to a global priority.\n  I am heartened to report that significant progress has been made in \nthe past decade, even though much remains to be done.\n  In June of 1999, ILO Convention #182 was adopted unanimously--the \nfirst time ever that an ILO convention was approved without one \ndissenting vote. Just one year ago, the Senate, in record time, \nratified ILO Convention #182 with a bipartisan, 96-0 vote.\n  And today, 41 countries have ratified ILO Convention #182--countries \nfrom every region of the world. 12 African nations, 12 European \nnations, 10 American Caribbean nations, 5 from the Middle East, and 2 \nfrom Asia. Since the ILO was established in 1919, never has one of its \ntreaties been ratified so quickly by so many national governments.\n  In May of 2000, we enacted the Trade and Development Act of 2000. \nThis Act included a provision I authored that requires more than 100 \nnations that enjoy duty-free access to the American marketplace to \nimplement their legal commitments to eliminate the worst forms of child \nlabor in order to keep these trade privileges.\n  Since May, the State Department has demanded thorough review of the \nefforts of over 130 nations to eliminate\n\n[[Page S11904]]\n\nthe worst forms of child labor. The U.S. Labor Department is planning \nto file its first comprehensive report to Congress on whether countries \nthat enjoy preferential access to our markets are fulfilling their \nobligations de facto until ILO Convention #182. And they've dispatched \nfact-finding teams around the world to investigate.\n  Their findings will be submitted to an inter-agency review process \nchaired by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. Later this \nyear, this process will decide which beneficiary countries should \nretain their trade privileges and which should not.\n  Last year, this Congress approved a $30 million U.S. contribution to \nthe ILO's International Program to Eliminate Child Labor (IPEC) for \nFiscal Year 2000.\n  This made our country the single largest contributor to IPEC. And--if \nand when we finally approve our LHHS Appropriations Bill--our \ncontribution will increase to $45 million in Fiscal Year 2001. This is \nyet another reason for us to wrap up that legislation before we \nadjourn.\n  That's the good news, Mr. President. But we've got a long way to go \nin our battle to eliminate abusive child labor and open up a bright \nfuture for more than 250 million child laborers around the world.\n  Our first, and perhaps most important step, is to heed ILO Convention \n#182 in our own country. We have to develop a national action plan to \neliminate the worst forms of child labor in our midst--labor which ``by \nits nature or the circumstances in which it is carried out is likely to \nharm the health, safety or morals of children.''\n  Mr. President, who among us can deny that there are children working \nunder such circumstances in our own country?\n  In order to be a credible leader in the world struggle against \nabusive child labor, we've got to do more to eliminate the worst forms \nof child labor right here in America.\n  Fortunately, the Child Labor Coalition has recently convened meetings \nof non-governmental organizations to begin fashioning recommendations \nfor the U.S. national action plan required by ILO Convention #182.\n  Hopefully, President Clinton will be moved to act on some of these \nrecommendations when they are presented to White House officials today. \nHe has already distinguished himself as a President who has done more \nthan all of his predecessors combined to fight abusive child labor.\n  I conclude my remarks by describing one glaring example of abusive \nchild labor in our own backyard that cries out for immediate \nlegislative redress.\n  Right now, as many as 800,000 migrant child laborers toil in the \nfields of large-scale commercial agriculture picking the produce we eat \nevery day. They are working at younger ages, for longer hours, exposed \nto more hazardous conditions than minors working in non-agricultural \njobs.\n  Their plight has prompted me to introduce the Children's Act for \nResponsible Employment (S. 3100--The CARE Act) which I will push hard \nto enact next year.\n  This legislation will end our current double standard in employment. \nIt will extend to minors working in large-scale commercial \nagriculture--corporate farms, if you will--the same rights and legal \nprotections as those working in non-agricultural jobs. It will also: \nToughen civil and criminal penalties for willful child labor violators; \nprotect children under 16 from working in peddling or door-to-door \nsales; strengthen the authority of the U.S. Secretary of Labor to deal \nwith ``hot goods'' made by children and shipped in interstate commerce; \nimprove coordination and reporting among federal, state, and local \ngovernments on injuries and deaths of minors on the job; improve \ncollaboration between the U.S. Labor and Agriculture Departments to \nenforce federal child labor laws; and preserve exemptions for minors \nworking on family farms as well as those selling door-to-door as \nvolunteers for non-profit organizations like the Girl Scouts of \nAmerica.\n  So today, we should all celebrate that day one year ago when we took \nthe high road and ratified ILO Convention #182. But we cannot rest on \nour laurels. In the next Congress, we've got to re-dedicate ourselves \nto restoring the childhoods of millions of child laborers and lifting \nthem up from the cruel hand that they and their impoverished families \nhave been dealt.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11904-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11904]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      AMERICAN HOMEOWNERSHIP AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. ALLARD.

Mr. President, Alan Emory, who for nearly half a \ncentury covered Washington for the Watertown Daily Times, passed away \non November 27. Known for years as ``the Dean'' of the New York press \ncorps, he was an indefatigable and prolific writer who often penned up \nto six stories a day in addition to a twice-weekly column. Even after \nretiring as bureau chief in 1998, he pursued stories with the same \nintegrity and determination that first brought him to Washington in \n1951. This past July, he broke the news that the Health Care Financing \nAdministration intended to cut Medicare reimbursement for outpatient \ncancer care. Shortly thereafter, in a great part because of Alan's \nreporting, the plan was abandoned.\n  He was a dear friend, and he will be missed. I ask that the obituary \nfrom the Associated Press be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\nAlan Emory, Longtime Washington Correspondent for Watertown Times, Dies\n\n       Washington--Alan Emory, Washington correspondent for the \n     Watertown (N.Y.) Daily Times for 49 years, died Monday after \n     a battle with pancreatic cancer.\n       He was 78.\n       Emory covered 10 presidential administrations--from Harry \n     Truman to Bill Clinton--during his tenure in Washington. He \n     began his career with the Times in 1947 in Watertown and also \n     worked in the paper's Albany, N.Y., bureau before coming to \n     Washington in 1951.\n       He specialized in Canadian border issues, founding a group \n     of reporters from northern states that met regularly with \n     Canadian officials. He also covered more than 1,500 White \n     House press conferences, traveling to Russia, China, Canada \n     and South America.\n       A former president of Washington's famed Gridiron Club, \n     Emory penned many of the songs and skits that were performed \n     in the club's annual spoof of the Washington political scene.\n       In 1956, he was elected to the Standing Committee of \n     Correspondents of Congressional Press Galleries. He was \n     elected to the Hall of Fame of the Washington chapter of the \n     Society of Professional Journalists in 1979.\n       Emory graduated from Harvard University and received a \n     master's degree from Columbia University's School of \n     Journalism. He spent almost three years in the U.S. Army.\n       Emory was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer early in 2000. \n     He continued with his political writing, sometimes also \n     writing about his struggles with the health care system.\n       Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., called Emory ``a giant.''\n       ``He practiced journalism the way it should be practiced \n     with integrity and honesty,'' Schumer said Monday. ``Whether \n     you liked the story he was writing or not, you always knew it \n     was going to be fair and honest.''\n       Emory died at his home in Falls Church, VA.\n       He is survived by his wife, Nancy Carol Goodman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11904-3", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11904-S11906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PASSING OF JAMES RUSSELL WIGGINS\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nbeloved adopted son of Maine, James Russell Wiggins, whose life brought \ntremendous pride to our State, credit to the profession of journalism, \nand joy to all those fortunate to have known him.\n  For all of us, a great many people pass through our lives. Few \nclearly and\n\n[[Page S11905]]\n\ncompletely present us with the qualities to which we instinctively know \nwe should aspire. Few truly define and embody the standards to which \nall of us should hold ourselves, and it is a blessing when we find \nthem.\n  James Russell Wiggins was instantly recognizable as such a person, \nand I was blessed to have found him nearly 23 years ago. While his \nheart has ceased to beat after nearly 97 extraordinary years, his \nspirit continues to enkindle the hearts of all those whose lives he \ntouched with his warmth, his enthusiasm, and his generosity.\n  Russ Wiggins cast his light most broadly and brightly through the \nmedium of the printed word, and perhaps most prominently in his 20-year \ncareer with The Washington Post. Difficult as it may be to believe \ntoday, there was a time when the Post was not widely held in high \nregard, even in its own hometown. That the Post is internationally \nrecognized today is a testament to the vision of a man for whom the \npublic's right to the best possible information was paramount and \nintegral to the health of our democracy.\n  Eventually reaching the position of editor, Russ Wiggins' stamp \nremains on every new edition of the Post. As Stephen Rosenfield, former \neditorial page editor of The Washington Post, wrote after Russ Wiggins' \npassing, he ``brought to the Washington Post a passion for newspapering \nand an unrelenting dedication to the public good . . . (he) set for his \nstaff an unmatched standard of personal decency and integrity.''\n  Just a few weeks shy of his 65th birthday, and his planned retirement \nfrom the Post, Russ Wiggins was tapped by President Johnson to serve as \nU.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. What would normally be a fitting \nand distinguished finale to a long and productive working life would \nbecome only a prelude to his passion for the years that remained--a \nweekly newspaper called The Ellsworth American in Ellsworth, Maine.\n  Russ moved to the state in 1969, and became publisher and editor of \nThe Ellsworth American shortly thereafter, building it into one of the \nmost respected weekly newspapers in Maine and the Nation, and a great \ntreasure for both the community and our state. As if that were not \nenough for a man ``in retirement'', he also became an active and \nintegral member of his new community of Brooklin, lending his boundless \nenergy and enthusiasm to a variety of civic causes.\n  I first met Russ Wiggins during my first campaign for Congress in \n1977 at an editorial board meeting at the paper. He put me immediately \nat ease with his remarkable personality and wit, and I was immensely \nimpressed with his extraordinary depth of knowledge.\n  As I would come to discover, Russ Wiggins had an appetite for \nlearning for which the term ``voracious'' may well be an inadequate \ndescription. He loved ideas, and loved testing his ideas against the \nopinion of others. He exemplified the concept of disagreeing without \nbeing disagreeable--he was the definition of a gentleman, and a \npractitioner of the kind of civility that all-too-often seems an old \nfashioned notion these days but, in reality, is needed now more than \never.\n\n  His excitement over knowledge was infectious, never pretentious. If \nhe was energized by a book he had just read, he would implore others to \ndo likewise. He challenged people not only to assess their own beliefs, \nbut to risk undermining those beliefs with the addition of new facts, \nnew arguments, and new ways of seeing the world. In short, he enriched \nthe minds and souls of all those who knew him, and encouraged everyone \nhe met to rise to their potential.\n  On that day when I first met Russ, an Ellsworth American photographer \nchronicled our discussion, particularly my reaction to Russ' comments. \nThe images from that meeting later formed the basis of my first \ncampaign poster--which hangs today in my Washington office and serves \nas a reminder of the time I spent with him and the example he set for \nthe rest of us. And what a tremendous example that was.\n  Russell never strayed from his beliefs and integrity, as demonstrated \nby the high regard with which he was held among his contemporaries. And \nwith his unparalleled skill, he captured the essence of the people he \ncalled his neighbors.\n  During his time with the Ellsworth American, he was able to bring out \nnot just the news of Ellsworth and Hancock County, but also to convey \nthe sensibilities and nature of a special region. Perhaps it is the \nfact that Russ saw and experienced so much of the world, that he \ncontinually showed that the rural coastal setting of Downeast Maine is \nanything but circumstanced. Whatever the reason, those of us in Maine \nare especially fortunate that he let us see the dynamic world through \nhis eyes.\n  Throughout it all, James Russell Wiggins was comfortable in any \ncompany, not because he changed his stripes to suit the occasion, but \nbecause the essence of the man was always his generosity of spirit--and \nit was apparent for all to see. He shared what he knew not to elevate \nhis own standing, but rather to elevate the standing of others. He \nvoiced his opinions not to hear himself talk, but rather to advance the \nlevel of debate. He searched for the truth not in service to his own \nends, but rather in service to humankind.\n  With his life having touched so many so deeply, it is no surprise \nthat his death has done the same. Columns were written by those with \nwhom he had worked. Katherine Graham, chair of the executive committee \nof The Washington Post, wrote a special piece eulogizing Russ and \nthanking him for his service. And letters to the editor expressed the \nsense of loss we all have felt in the wake of this giant's passing.\n  So it is with a heavy but grateful heart that I pay whatever humble \ntribute I might to this great man whom I was privileged to know. How \nfortunate we are that he lived--and how deeply we will miss him in our \nlives. I ask that a number of articles that have appeared in the \nnewspapers regarding Russ Wiggins be printed in the Record.\n  The articles follow.\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 20, 2000]\n\n                      The Evocation of Excellence\n\n                         (By Katherine Graham)\n\n       Russ Wiggins, good steward, farseeing guide of The Post for \n     21 years.\n       Russ Wiggins's death yesterday leaves a large hole, so \n     great was his embracing personality and a life lived \n     vigorously until five months ago, when his brave heart \n     started to weaken and then gave out.\n       I feel grateful to Russ because he quite literally created \n     The Post we know today. The Pentagon Papers and Watergate \n     received so much attention that most people don't realize \n     what Russ accomplished.\n       When my father purchased The Post in 1933, it was the fifth \n     newspaper in a five-newspaper town. He set out to improve The \n     Post and make it viable because he believed Washington \n     deserved a top-quality morning newspaper. However, it was \n     difficult to get people to come to work for a paper most \n     people assumed would fail. My father had found a good, old-\n     fashioned, blood-and-guts editor, who began to make some \n     progress. But clearly more was needed.\n       When my husband, Phil Graham, became publisher after the \n     war, he and my father tried to find a serious editor and \n     leader for the future. They heard of Russ Wiggins, who had \n     been editor of the paper in St. Paul, Minn., where he'd made \n     quite an impression. When some people accused its owner-\n     publisher of being dependent on Russ, the man had walked into \n     the newsroom and summarily fired Russ.\n       My father and Phil asked Russ to come to The Post, but he \n     elected instead to go to the New York Times as assistant to \n     the publisher. A year later they went back and persuaded Russ \n     to change his mind. He arrived in 1947 and stayed for 21 \n     years.\n       Russ immediately made several changes that had a \n     significant impact on the quality and integrity of the paper. \n     First, he eliminated taking favors--free tickets for sports \n     reporters, free admissions to theaters for critics and \n     parking tickets fixed by police reporters for people all over \n     the building. This sounds elementary, but in those days it \n     was done everywhere.\n       One of Russ's most heroic accomplishments was to lead the \n     way in civil rights. He stopped the use of irrelevant racial \n     descriptions. He printed the first picture of an African \n     American bride. He started hiring minority reporters. This \n     took courage in those days.\n       Despite the paper's precarious financial situation, Russ \n     and Phil together began to assemble a fine staff--attracted \n     by Russ's won professional standards and hard work. He set \n     the example. He worked seven days a week, if necessary, and \n     rarely took vacations.\n       Over the years, Russ stood up to many threats to the paper, \n     and he and Phil overcame many obstacles. Not the least was my \n     mother, whose correct but inflammatory political passions \n     encouraged charges of red-baiting. As we grew more \n     successful, Russ built up a national and foreign staff.\n       His ambition for the paper, Russ told me, ``was \n     unachievable. But how do you lift an\n\n[[Page S11906]]\n\n     institution except with unachievable ideals? If your ideals \n     are so low you can achieve them, you ought to adjust them,'' \n     he said.\n       When my husband became mentally ill with manic depression, \n     Russ had to withstand Phil's destructive impulses. When Phil \n     died, Russ held the staff together and encouraged my coming \n     to work. Then he had to teach me how to understand editorial \n     and news policy, which didn't happen overnight. Russ was very \n     patient.\n       One of the first major issues we confronted was the Vietnam \n     war. Russ was a thoughtful and sensitive hawk; he believed \n     the country's reputation was at stake if we abandoned our \n     allies. At one point, President Johnson said one of Russ's \n     editorials was worth two divisions. Russ was never personally \n     hostile about issues. This enabled us to get though this \n     difficult period.\n       At all times, Russ was a voracious and learned reader. He \n     often would thrust books at all of us, tell us we had to read \n     them, and check in a day or two to see if we had finished. \n     Just a few years ago, Russ informed me in a letter that he \n     had just completed Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin's \n     autobiography, was up to Volume 4 of Edward Gibbon's \n     ``Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'' and also had read \n     the 35,000-word Unabomber manifesto. It was repetitious, Russ \n     commented.\n       Russ set a deadline for himself to retire at 65. A few \n     months before, President Johnson nominated him as ambassador \n     to the United Nations. Russ insisted on leaving without much \n     ceremony.\n       Then Russ did the most admirable thing of all: He went to \n     Ellsworth, Maine, where he had vacationed, bought the paper \n     there and built it up into one of the most distinguished \n     small papers in the country. He wrote a poem for it every \n     week. And he never lost his creative editorial spirit. To \n     point out the deficiencies of the post office, for instance, \n     he mailed a letter to Ellsworth from a neighboring town and \n     had two oxen pull a cart that beat the letter.\n       Even after he'd left The Post, Russ remained one of our \n     most interested readers and staunchest supporters. Shortly \n     after the Janet Cooke story erupted, Russ came to a meeting \n     of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, where we were \n     being drubbed right and left. With his usual wry humor, Russ \n     said, ``I feel great about the state of the American press. \n     Every editor I saw assured me this couldn't have happened at \n     his paper.''\n       Russ lived his entire life according to the highest \n     intellectual and moral standards, with great humor and \n     compassion for others, and with panache. He was thoughtful--I \n     would even say brilliant. The words he evokes are \n     ``excellence'' and ``integrity.'' He had fun and he gave it \n     to others. He was a teacher and a friend to the very end.\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 20, 2000]\n\n                         James Russell Wiggins\n\n       Almost the minute he took over as managing editor of this \n     newspaper in 1947, James Russell Wiggins jolted the city room \n     staff with his passion for rectitude and integrity. No more \n     freebies, he decreed, not even movie passes for copy aides. \n     No more fixing of tickets at police headquarters. These were \n     not the crotchety preachings of a fuddy-duddy; Russ Wiggins, \n     who died yesterday at the age of 96, was a vigorous and \n     engaged editor who cared deeply about ethical standards, old-\n     fashioned honesty and the importance of a free and \n     independent press. During his 21-year stewardship here, his \n     enthusiasm for the competitive pursuit of information was \n     girded by an insistence on fairness.\n       Today the news and editorial departments at The Post are \n     independently managed. In Mr. Wiggins' day, though, both fell \n     under his exacting command; he took care to maintain a sharp \n     delineation. ``The ideal newspaperman,'' he told the staff, \n     ``is a man who never forgets that he is a reporter . . . not \n     a mover and shaker. . . . Nothing could be more alarming or \n     dismaying to me . . . than to encounter repeatedly the \n     suggestion that the reader knows from the news columns what \n     the views of the newspaper are.'' The reporter ought to have \n     the commitment ``of the honest witness, the fair narrator,'' \n     he said.\n       A largely self-educated, extraordinarily well-read man who \n     never went to college, Mr. Wiggins kept reporters and \n     editorial writers alike on their toes--quizzing them on \n     findings, recommending books and suggesting further questions \n     or research.

DETTMER\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to a fine \npublic servant, Michael H. Dettmer, on his retirement.\n  Since January of 1994, Mike has served diligently as the United \nStates Attorney for the Western District of Michigan. During his seven-\nyear tenure, his office obtained more than 2700 convictions and helped \nlead numerous crime fighting initiatives in the District involving \nFederal law enforcement's support, leadership and participation.\n  Among his impressive accomplishments are the task forces and \npartnerships he helped create and foster to combat drugs and violent \ncrime. A few of those specialized partnerships are the Methcathinone \nTask Force, the Benton Harbor Violent Crime Task Force, the Health Care \nFraud Task Force, the Western Michigan Environmental Task Force and \nProject Exile.\n  Mike is also to be credited for reinvigorating the Law Enforcement \nCoordinating Committee/Victim-Witness unit of the U.S. Attorney's \nOffice. Since 1994, this unit has adopted an elementary school in the \nGrand Rapids public school system, participated in the D.A.R.E (Drug \nAbuse Resistance Education) and D.E.F.Y (Drug Education For Youth) \nprograms, and sponsored more than 80 training programs covering all \naspects of law enforcement. In addition, under Mike's leadership, four \nadditional sites to the Weed and Seed Program have been created, making \nthe Western District of Michigan's program one of the largest \ninitiatives among any Federal District in the United States.\n  In recognition of his efforts, in 1998, Mike was honored by the \nDepartment of Justice Programs Director and Assistant Attorney General \nLaurie Robinson for his work in the area of crime prevention and \nreduction. In addition, in the year 2000, Mike was honored by the \nnational Executive Office of Weed and Seed with it's ``Creating Healthy \nCommunities'' Award and by the City of Benton Harbor with the \npresentation of its ``Key to the City'' Award.\n  Of course, his many achievements could not have been attained without \nthe love and support of his wife of more than 30 years, Teckla, and \ntheir children, Janna and Bryn. Mr. President, I know that the members \nof the Senate will join me in congratulating Mike on a job well-done \nand thanking him for his service to the people of Michigan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11906-2", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11906-S11907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        A TRIBUTE TO PERCY HILL\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to Percy Hill, an accomplished school teacher from Andover, NH. \nPercy was recently honored at the Disney American teacher Awards, as \none of the 33 honorees selected from a group of 70,000 who were chosen \nfor their creativity in the classroom as well as their teaching \naccomplishments.\n  Growing up in New England, Percy developed his love for athletics as \nwell as children, spending the past 10 years coaching the Unicycle \nTeam. Working around the clock, he has coached these champions to new \nlevels. They have performed in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, the \nFiesta Bowl Parade, the Strawberry Festival of Virginia and even have \ngone international, performing in Canada.\n  Not only has Percy given his time and energy to coaching, but he has \nspent countless hours raising the funds for the team's traveling \nexpenses. Percy has managed to fund one hundred percent of all of the \ntrips through massive fund raising efforts, allowing all children to go \nregardless of their situations outside of practice. He has proven time \nand time again to be a valuable asset not only to the team, but the \ncommunity of Andover as well.\n  Aside from Percy's work with the unicycle team he also finds time to \nvolunteer referee both basketball and soccer, proving once again, that \nPercy Hill puts his dedication to the youth of America at the top of \nhis priority list. He is to be commended on his commitment to Andover \nElementary and Middle School, and those students which attend it.\n  The Disney American Teacher Awards were developed as, ``A way of \nhonoring members of the teaching profession, whose talent, commitment, \nand creativity have a profound and lasting impact on our children as \nwell as our society as a whole,'' according\n\n[[Page S11907]]\n\nto Michael D.

Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to \nhonor Marilyn Herz, a sixth grade language arts teacher from Rapid \nCity, who has recently been named South Dakota's Teacher of the Year \nfor 2001.\n  Marilyn currently teaches at West Middle School in Rapid City and has \ntaught various grade levels in the Rapid City Area School District \nsince 1983. She has devoted an impressive 22 years of her life to \nteaching elementary school.\n  Marilyn's greatest service to our community lies in her devotion as \nan educator to her students. She deserves the greatest praise both from \nthe families of these young individuals, and from all those whose lives \nshe will touch. Her efforts are an invaluable investment in South \nDakota's future and we are all truly blessed to have her in the \nclassroom.\n  In a true testimony of Marilyn's devotion and love for teaching, she \ncommented that her greatest contribution to education is simply that \nshe has given, and will continue to give, all the caring, commitment, \nand compassion that she has within her to guide students to succeed \nacademically, emotionally, and socially.\n  Marilyn also makes extra efforts to see that her classes are learning \nto their potential and preparing themselves for the demands of the 21st \ncentury. A true veteran in the field of education, Marilyn's efforts to \nincrease the credibility of teaching as a profession is designed to \nentice and encourage a new generation of students into following her in \nthis most honorable profession.\n  Marilyn will now proceed to the national competition for Teacher of \nthe Year. I express my appreciation for the Rapid City Public School \nFoundation for sponsoring the Teacher of the Year program in the Rapid \nCity School District.

Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to the \nmemory of an outstanding leader, a philanthropist who knew no limits, \nand a distinguished public servant whose integrity and decency made him \na role-model to all who knew him. A few weeks ago, we in the State of \nMichigan mourned the passing of Ambassador David Hermelin. I suppose it \nis a little presumptuous to suggest that only the State of Michigan \nbeams with pride in our association with Ambassador Hermelin, for the \norganizations that he led, the political leaders he counseled, and the \ncommunities to which he dedicated his life, literally span the globe.\n  Against that backdrop, I will submit for the Record excerpts of \neulogies--as they were reported in the Detroit Jewish News--by Rabbi \nIrwin Groner of Congregation Shaarey Zedek in Michigan, Brian Hermelin, \nJon Gundersen, deputy chief of the American Embassy in Norway, and U.S. \nAgriculture Secretary Daniel Glickman.\n  But before I submit these eulogies, I would just like to take a \nmoment to reflect on the first time I really had a chance to get to \nknow Ambassador Hermelin and the impact he had on me. It was shortly \nafter President Clinton had nominated him to serve as our nation's top \ndiplomatic representative in Norway. As protocol dictates, David \ncontacted his U.S. Senators to seek our support. And while David \nHermelin and I did not always see eye-to-eye on the domestic political \nissues of the day, we agreed to meet to discuss his confirmation \nprocess.\n  While I had heard many things about David before that meeting--about \nall the charitable causes he had led, about his close relationships \nwith top government leaders in the United States and Israel, about his \nsuccessful business career--I never could have expected to be drawn to \nthe orbit of David's warmth, energy, kindness and wisdom, in the way \nthat I was.\n  From the moment we met that afternoon in my office, we forged a \nfriendship, that developed further during our interactions through his \nSenate confirmation process, when I was proud to testify on his behalf \nand urge my Republican colleagues on the Foreign Relations Committee to \nwaste no time in ushering this fine man's nomination through the \nSenate.\n  And our friendship even deepened further over time. For even though \nhe and I came from opposite sides of the political aisle, I found \nmyself seeking his advice and counsel from time to time.\n  Sometimes it was his thought provoking perspective on developments in \nthis Middle East, or the insights he had gained the being an active \nparticipant in U.S. foreign policy as Ambassador to Norway. Other times \nit was his advocacy for both the Detroit and American Jewish \ncommunities, or his tireless philanthropic efforts in Michigan. \nWhatever the topic, no matter when we met, it was impossible to not \nbenefit in some way from David Hermelin's wisdom, or his contagious \nenergy and passion for life.\n  I feel blessed that I knew David Hermelin for the short time that I \ndid. I cannot begin to even imagine the scope and depth of impact he \nhad on the people closest to him. So my heartfelt sympathies and \ncondolences go out to his dedicated and compassionate wife, Doreen, and \nhis devoted, caring, and decent children, grandchildren, nieces, and \nnephews, many of whom I have had the pleasure of getting to know as \nwell.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I would like to refer to the description \nof James Madison, another great American, by one of his biographers, in \nwhich Madison was summed up this way: ``When you called on him, he was \nalways home.''\n  Well, I think that's how David Hermelin could be described as well by \neveryone he touched. No matter who it was that called on his help and \non his leadership--the Jewish community, numerous charitable causes, \nthe State of Michigan, the United States Government, the people of \nNorway, the State of Israel and most importantly, his family--whenever \nyou called on David Hermelin, he always took your call, and he was \nalways ready to lend a hand.\n  I am better for having known David Hermelin. He was not only an \noutstanding leader and generous giver in every way possible, but he was \nalso the kind of individual everyone would want as a neighbor. He will \nbe deeply missed.\n  I ask that the above mentioned excerpts be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n                 Excerpts from the Detroit Jewish News\n\n                   David B. Hermelin, Saying Goodbye\n\n\n      a beloved leader gets an emotional farewell at Shaarey Zedek\n\n       David Hermelin was remembered by more than 2,500 people \n     whose lives he touched at his Nov. 24 funeral. it was held in \n     Southfield at Congregation Shaarey Zedek--the synagogue he \n     had served as president. Afterwards, some 150 cars formed a \n     procession for the interment at Clover Hill Park Cemetery in \n     Birmingham.\n       Mr. Hermelin, of Bingham Farms, died of brain cancer Nov. \n     22, 2000 at age 63.\n       Delivering the eulogy was his friend of 41 years, Shaarey \n     Zedek Rabbi Irwin Groner. Also speaking were Jon Gundersen, \n     deputy chief of the American Embassy in Oslo, Norway, where \n     Mr. Hermelin served as ambassador; U.S. Agriculture Secretary \n     Daniel Glickman; and Mr. Hermelin's son, Brian.\n       Speaking first, Gundersen said he has just conveyed to Mr. \n     Hermelin's wife, Doreen, messages from the royal family of \n     Norway, from the U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, \n     from the Norwegian ambassador and consul general, from the \n     prime minister of Norway and from the foreign minister.\n       ``I've just arrived from Norway, and it seems the entire \n     nation sends to David and Doreen their greatest \n     condolences,'' Gundersen said.\n       ``David and Doreen represented the very best of America and \n     what we stand for. Faith, honesty, openness, tolerance, love. \n     David, your embassy family and indeed an entire nation will \n     miss you. You will be in our hearts forever.''\n       Glickman, like President Bill Clinton, has known the \n     Hermelins for many years. He shared a letter the president \n     sent to Mrs. Hermelin, which read, in part:\n       ``David loved life. And he made sure that everyone around \n     him shared that love. I will always cherish his friendship \n     and support\n\n[[Page S11908]]\n\n     and remember with gratitude his exceptional service as our \n     ambassador to Norway.\n       ``He left the world a better place than he found it. And no \n     one could ask for a finer legacy\n       ``Hillary and I are keeping you and your family in our \n     thoughts and prayers.''\n       Brian Hermelin then gave an emotional, personal tribute to \n     his father.\n       ``The thing about us that made us feel the most special was \n     that he was our dad,'' Brian said. ``Just being able to be \n     with him at the intimate family settings allowed the full \n     bright glow of one of God's brightest lights to shine on us \n     and provided a comfort and security which is irreplaceable.''\n       Brian added, ``He just knew how much fun it was to be \n     alive. And he was sure if you were with him, you would know \n     how much fun life could be, too.,\n       ``We took such pride in his accomplishments with him,'' \n     Brian said. ``We were all equally amazed at how far and how \n     much he accomplished because we know how he saw himself, just \n     a regular kid from Pasadena [Avenue in Detroit]. He made it \n     all seem so within our reach--the accomplishments, the \n     friends, the admiration, the fun. Just go out there with that \n     positive, can-do attitude and you can have all that, too.''\n       Rabbi Groner mourned his friend, whose influence was felt \n     from the sanctuary of the synagogue to the far reaches of the \n     world stage.\n       ``When a true leader goes, can he be replaced?'' the rabbi \n     asked. ``Woe is the army that has lost its captain.\n       ``We will miss him. He will miss his hearty welcome, he \n     warm laugh, his quick wit, his words of encouragement, his \n     shared exuberance.\n       ``When David came into a room, his luminous presence was \n     immediately felt,'' Rabbi Groner added. ``He was so vital, so \n     filled with energy, so magnetic that he seemed \n     indestructible.\n       ``Once you came to know David, your life changed. You \n     laughed more, you felt more, you cared more, you gave more.\n       ``To have known David was to have warmed your hands at the \n     central fire of life.\n       ``For David Hermelin, service, benevolence, mitzvot was the \n     very essence of his life,'' said the rabbi.\n       ``David gave us a great and blessed gift. He taught us how \n     to dream a glorious dream.''\n       Mr. Hermelin is survived by his wife, Doreen; son and \n     daughter-in-law Brian and Jennifer Hermelin; daughters and \n     sons-in-law Marcie and Rob Orley, Karen Hermelin Borman and \n     Mark Borman, Julie Hermelin Frank and Mitchell Frank, \n     Francine Hermelin Levite and Adam Levite; and grandchildren \n     Matthew, Alex, Jason and Olivia Orley, Max and Isabel \n     Hermelin, Asa Levite and Madeline Borman.\n       Also suriving are sisters and brother-in-law Henrietta \n     Hermelin Weinberg, Lois Shiffman and Terran and Roger Leemis; \n     brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law Eugene and Suzanne Curtis, \n     Reggie and Dr. Robert Fisher and Mitchell Curtis; and mother-\n     in-law Anna Curtis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11908-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11908]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CAROL BROWNER TRIBUTE\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nCarol Browner, the longest-serving Administrator in the history of the \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency and one of the people with whom I \nhave been most honored to work. I can think of no finer role model for \nyoung women, or young men, considering a career in government today \nthan Carol Browner. Since she came to the EPA seven years ago, she has \nset a gold standard for public service and for protection of the \npublic's health. A dedicated advocate for the environment, she has \nnever neglected her responsibility to protect and preserve the water, \nland and air that our childrens' children will inherit from us.\n  Carol Browner has been a tireless advocate for the environment and \nmade significant contributions in every area that the EPA touches. As \njust one example, Administrator Browner set up a childrens' office at \nthe EPA for the first time, signaling her commitment to strengthening \nthe ties between the environment and children's health. Under \nAdministrator Browner's control, the EPA began to take children into \naccount when developing air and water safety standards, such as the \nSafe Drinking Water Act. The Food Quality Protection Act was the first \nlaw that made health of children, rather than adult males, the \nbenchmark for evaluating safety. These two acts are monuments to Carol \nBrowner's dedication to the environment and to children.\n  To better protect our nation's surface waters, Administrator Browner \nwas a principal architect of the Clinton Administration's Clean Water \nAction Plan. One component of this program was to increase the public's \nknowledge about the potential health threats from swimming in \ncontaminated waters at our nation's beaches. Under her leadership, EPA \nestablished a publicly-accessible Internet site containing information \nabout water quality and beach closings across the nation. Administrator \nBrowner and I worked closely together to strengthen the water quality \nstandards for our nation's coastal recreation waters, and to assist \nstates in setting up beach monitoring and notification programs. Our \nefforts were successful through the enactment of Public Law 106-284, \nalso known as the ``Beach Bill.''\n  Through the Clean Water Action Plan, Administrator Browner \ndemonstrated her ability to take on the tough fights and to do what was \nright for the environment. Under her leadership, EPA adopted policies \nto reduce polluted runoff from factory farms and from aging urban \nwastewater systems, and helped obtain the funding to implement these \ncontrols.\n  As a proponent of corporate responsibility and the citizen's ``right \nto know,'' an area of particular interest to me, Administrator Browner, \nthe law and EPA's implementation of it, effected a 50 percent drop in \nthe rate of industrial emissions, without creating any new regulatory \nmandates. As another example, Administrator Browner fought to limit the \nindustrial pollution generated by coal fire plants in Midwestern states \nthat contributed to air pollution in New Jersey. Under Administrator \nBrowner and President Clinton, the EPA has both vigorously enforced \nenvironmental laws and reached out to industry to find creative new \nincentives and environmental results. This is the kind of leadership \nthat Democrats and Republicans can both rally around.\n  Perhaps most importantly to my home state, during Administrator \nBrowner's nearly eight-year tenure, the Superfund Program has completed \nthree times the number of waste site cleanups than in its previous \ntwelve years. She helped keep Superfund strong, and held fast to the \nbelief that justice and the environment are best served when polluters \npay to clean up the messes they create, even while she strove to \nimprove the program and accelerate clean-ups. I was honored to share \nthe stage with Administrator Browner recently at Pepe Field in Boonton, \nNew Jersey, which was Superfund's 750th clean-up. What was once a \nmalodorous eyesore is now a thriving community park. Pepe Field is but \none of many Superfund success stories under Administrator Browner's \nleadership.\n  With her oversight of the Brownfields program, Carol Browner has \ndemonstrated the vital ties between a healthy environment and a healthy \neconomy. Revitalizing these sites created more than 8,300 construction \njobs. And once the work was done, another 22,000 jobs were either \ncreated or retained. Much of this economic revitalization happened in \ncommunities in need, where per capita incomes averaged just over \n$10,000 a year, versus a national average of almost $14,500. This \nprogram brings both environmental and economic justice to these \nneighborhoods. Communities once on the verge of despair are back on the \nroad to revitalization, thanks to Carol Browner.\n  Carol Browner is one of the best friends this nation's environment \nhas ever had. As I prepare to leave the Senate, I will remember her for \nmany things, but most of all for her optimism, her commitment, and her \nintegrity. I thank her for her work and salute her \naccomplishments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11908-2", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11908-S11909]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ABILENE PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON.

These solar panels \nare 240 feet from tip to tip, the longest structure deployed in space.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Bloomfield was born in Flint, Michigan. He \ngraduated from Lake Fenton High School, and still considers Fenton, \nMichigan, as his hometown. He attended the United States Air Force \nAcademy, where he was captain of the United States Air Force Academy \nFalcon Football Team. He received a Bachelor of Science Degree in \nEngineering Mechanics from the Air Force Academy, and a Master of \nScience Degree in Engineering Management from Old Dominion University.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Bloomfield was trained as an F-15 Fighter Pilot, \nand has been assigned to NASA since 1995. This was his second space \nflight. His first flight was a mission to rendezvous and dock with the \nRussian Space Station Mir to exchange U.S. crew members.\n  Mr. President, we in Michigan are proud of Lieutenant Colonel \nBloomfield's record as a NASA astronaut.

Mr. President, it is a privilege to bring to the \nattention of the Senate the excellent work that an impressive \norganization in Costa Rica is doing to address the tragic problem of \nstreet children in Central America. The organization, Casa Alianza--a \nsubsidiary of Covenant House in New York--is headquartered in Costa \nRica. It was founded in 1981, and provides services for thousands of \nhomeless children, ages six to eighteen, offering shelter, food, \nmedical care, and educational opportunities.\n  The extraordinary work of Casa Alianza was recently honored by the \nHilton Foundation, when it received one of the world's most prestigious \nhumanitarian awards, the Conrad N. Hilton Award.\n  At the ceremony in Geneva, Switzerland to present the award, Queen \nNoor of Jordan praised Casa Alianza. As she stated, ``The phenomenon of \nstreet children is global, alarming and escalating. Estimates are that \ntoday are 100 million children living on the world's streets. Casa \nAlianza deserves the Hilton Humanitarian Prize for being the voice and \nthe defender of this helpless and unprotected segment of society and \nfor its important work to stop the human rights abuses inflicted upon \nthem.''\n  In accepting the award, Bruce Harris, executive director of Casa \nAlianza, said, ``Street children are often the victims of violence, but \nwhat is even more hurtful to them is society's indifference. * * * The \nprize money will feed and shelter many more abandoned children, but the \nrecognition will feed their souls.''\n  Mr. Harris was recently profiled in the book Speak Truth to Power: \nHuman Rights Defenders Who Are Changing Our World, by my niece, Kerry \nKennedy Cuomo.\n  I join in commending Casa Alianza for this well-deserved award and \nfor its pioneering work. These children desperately need help, and Casa \nAlianza is providing it. At great risk, including facing death threats \nand armed on its facilities, Casa Alianza and Bruce Harris are acting \neffectively on behalf of these needy children. They deserve our praise, \nour thanks, and, most importantly, our support. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11909-3", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11909]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING GERVASE MILLER\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, as America honors and remembers \nthose who have served in our armed forces, I want to recognize the \nservice of Mr. Gervase Miller, a North Dakota native who served his \ncountry during World War II. Mr. Miller was drafted into the Army in \nSeptember 1942 and was away from home while his wife was pregnant with \ntheir first child. Although deaf in one ear, Mr. Miller served with \ndistinction for more than three years in China, Burma, and India.\n  Mr. Miller was a part of the 1575th Heavy Shop Engineers, a group of \nmen who helped to build roads in Burma and then drove heavy supply \ntrucks in this dangerous territory. Throughout his service in the Army, \nMr. Miller earned three Battle Stars and one Bronze Star for his heroic \nactions.\n  He finally came home for good in December 1945. He was discharged as \na Technician, 5th Grade. It is men like Gervase Miller who won World \nWar II for the Allies and helped to guarantee the rights and freedoms \nthat we all enjoy today.\n  Today, Mr. Miller lives in Parshall, North Dakota, with his wife \nBernice. They have four children and 9 grandchildren. As his family \ngathers for Christmas this year, I want to send out warm holiday \ngreetings to him and a word of appreciation for his service to our \ncountry more than 50 years ago.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11909-4", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11909]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     THE NATIONAL HUMANITIES MEDAL FOR VIRGINIA DRIVING HAWK SNEVE\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate Virginia \nDriving Hawk Sneve for being awarded the National Humanities Medal for \n2000 presented to her by the President of the United States. Virginia \nis the first South Dakotan to receive this prestigious award, and I am \npleased that she is being recognized for her extraordinary \ncontributions as an author, a counselor, and a teacher.\n  As you know, the National Humanities Medal honors individuals whose \nwork enhances the nation's understanding of the humanities while also \npreserving Americans' access to important resources about their history \nand society. The humanities preserve the voices of generations through \nhistory, literature, philosophy, religion, languages, and archaeology. \nHowever, the humanities are not simply records of past eras; they are \nan essential part to the development and understanding of our current \nculture and definition of who we are as Americans.\n  Born on the Rosebud Indian Reservation in South Dakota, Virginia \nDriving Hawk Sneve has become one of the nation's preeminent \nstorytellers. Virginia's stories often come straight from her \nexperiences growing up on the reservation and help give an accurate \nportrayal of her ancestors' lives in the Dakotas. Her children's books \nhave won numerous awards, including national competitions for minority \nchildren's books, because of their unique and poignant mixture of \nrecorded events and imagination.\n  Virginia has also given us valuable works of literature about the \nAmerican Indian written from the female perspective. In her award-\nwinning work, Completing the Circle, Virginia breaks the historic mold \nof denoting Native American women either as princesses like \nPocohontas'' or noble savages like Sacagawea.'' The result is an \neducational account of the strengths and weaknesses of the Sioux \nculture from the female point of view. Virginia's research and writings \nhave helped others to understand the high level of esteem held by the \nSioux for women--a lesson from which Native American society and non-\nIndian cultures can draw guidance and appreciation.\n  I applaud Virginia for the literary works she has given us and for \nher continued teaching, counseling, and mentoring in South Dakota. \nVirginia's words, either on paper or in person, have opened a nation's \neyes to the lives of Native Americans and will prove to be the \nfoundation from which other Native American writers, especially women, \nwill continue to explore their unique heritage and society. Virginia \nDriving Hawk Sneve is a national treasure and the pride of South \nDakota.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11910-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11910]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S11910]]\n                       TRIBUTE TO F. FRED GOROSPE\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nlife and work of a truly remarkable American and long-time Detroit \nresident, Fred Gorospe. Born in 1902 in the Philippines, he pursued a \ndream to journey to America and become part of this great democracy. He \novercame many obstacles as a young immigrant, and eventually was able \nto study mechanical engineering at Purdue University, becoming one of \nonly three minorities hired into the engineering department of the Ford \nMotor Company not long after the Great Depression. He devoted himself \nto community and public service, and helped pave the way for many \nFilipino Americans like himself to assimilate into the mainstream of \nAmerican life. Fred enjoyed a full life of 97 years and had the good \nfortune of having a loving wife, Helen, and a caring family that \nincludes four sons and four daughters, and 10 grandchildren. He is \nwell-remembered for his great sense of charity, and his unshakeable \nfaith that people working together can make a difference.\n  In his lifetime, Fred provided leadership to numerous organizations, \nincluding the Federation of Filipinos of Michigan, Michigan Democratic \nState Central Committee, Advisory Council of Wayne County Community \nCollege, Advisory Board and Board of Directors of Detroit Area Agency \non Aging, Board of Directors of the International Institute of \nMetropolitan Detroit, President of Far Eastern Festival of Detroit, \nSteering Committee of Ethnic Festivals of Detroit, cofounder of Fil-Am \nAssociation, and member of the University of Michigan and American \nAssembly of Columbia University on Philippine-American Relations. Fred \nmade a significant contribution to Detroit's culture, and helped to \nbridge understanding of and appreciation for diversity. He worked hard \nto advance equal opportunities for education and social and economic \nachievement, and promoted the American ideal of social justice.\n  I would like to express my admiration for the life and \naccomplishments of Fred Gorospe. We can all benefit from his example of \ncourage, perseverance and leadership. Fred has left an indelible mark \non Detroit's history and its community. His family can be proud of his \nlegacy. I know my Senate colleagues will join me in paying tribute to \nFred Gorospe, and in congratulating his family on his exemplary and \nprincipled dedication to helping and enriching the lives of \nothers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11910-2", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11910]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JOHN REDNOUR\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize John \nRednour, who has recently been named the millennium ``Outstanding \nCitizen of the Year'' by the Du Quoin Chamber of Commerce.\n  John Rednour has been a friend of mine for over thirty years. His \nlife story is a fascinating tale of humble origins, a great family, \nhard work, and success. When others might have relaxed or retired, John \nand his life's partner Wanda continue to give to others every day. \nJohn's record as Mayor of Du Quoin is proof positive of his commitment \nto public service.\n  John Rednour has served as the Mayor of the City of Du Quoin, \nIllinois, for the past 11\\1/2\\ years, and his contributions to the city \nduring his tenure have been outstanding. His hard work and dedication \nhave had a tremendous impact on the city and its people, and it is only \nfitting that he be singled out for the City of Du Quoin Chamber of \nCommerce's highest honor.\n  During his time as Mayor, John Rednour has been instrumental in \nbuilding new public facilities, including a city hall, library, and \npolice department. These are just the beginning of the list of \naccomplishments in which Mayor Rednour has played the leading role. The \nstrengthening of the infrastructure through water and sewer \nimprovements may be among the less glamorous projects he has \nundertaken, but they are very important to Du Quoin. Over the years \nMayor Rednour assured the safety of the community by fully staffing the \nDu Quoin police and fire departments. Also, during his administration, \nfor the first time in the history of the 150-year-old city, Du Quoin \nhas secured city wide fire protection.\n  John Rednour has also greatly increased the economic vitality of a \ncity that is proud of its mayor. One of the ways in which he was able \nto boost its economic status was through the construction of the Du \nQuoin Industrial Park, completed with the aid of the Chamber of \nCommerce. Over the years, he has also helped to attract numerous \nbusinesses to the city, resulting in new jobs to the area. His actions \nhave contributed to a fully staffed tourism commission that has helped \nto give Du Quoin a firm footing in the tourism industry in Southern \nIllinois. Mayor Rednour has helped Du Quoin through his ability to gain \naccess to state and federal funding, which has helped the city to \ncomplete many of these important projects during his administration. \nHis vision is transforming Du Quoin into a 21st century city.\n  In closing, Mr. President, all of these achievements, and many more, \nare the fruits of the labor of John Rednour. His dedication to his job \nas Mayor and to his city have made his administration a great success. \nI applaud John Rednour for his achievements and his many successful \nefforts to improve the quality of life for the citizens of Du \nQuoin.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11910-3", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11910]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RETIREMENT OF RAY KAMMER\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, those of us who have been around \nthis town for a while know how much we and this government depend on \nour civil servants to get the really tough jobs done, to bring ideas to \nreality, and sometimes to even tell us when our ideas need some \nadjusting, shall we say. These people don't get much praise, at least \nnot nearly enough.\n  One of the classic examples of a dedicated civil servant, Ray Kammer, \nis about to retire from government service after 31 years. Ray retires \non December 29 as Director of the Commerce Department's National \nInstitute of Standards and Technology, where he spent the vast majority \nof his career. I have known Ray for a good portion of that time, both \nfrom his work at NIST and from the time he spent at the Department's \nheadquarters and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, \nNOAA.\n  In the late 1980's, the country called upon NIST, which used to be \nknown as the National Bureau of Standards, to help industry rally and \nregain its competitiveness. It was a time when we first began facing \nsevere competition from overseas. The Bureau's labs had a long-standing \nreputation for excellence, impartiality, and for working cooperatively \nwith industry. Ray helped us to expand that mission by establishing \nNIST and adding the Advanced Technology Program, the Manufacturing \nExtension Partnership, and the Baldrige National Quality Program. It \nwasn't easy, but we got it done. Ten years later--with Ray's help--\nthose programs have been tremendously beneficial for this country.\n  While at NOAA and during his time as Acting Assistant Secretary for \nAdministration at the Commerce Department, Ray helped to stabilize \nseveral critical programs that needed the steady hand of an experienced \nmanager. He was the Department's fireman of sorts, always being called \non to help put out this fire, put out that fire, and to keep another \none from breaking out. Even now, Ray is helping us take a look at how \nto improve NOAA's fisheries service.\n  I am sorry that we are losing Ray, especially at a time when NIST is \njust about to begin its centennial year and the agency will be getting \na lot more attention and credit for all of the good work that its staff \nhas done. I want to wish him my very best. I know that I am joined by \nothers in this body who have had the pleasure of working with this \ndedicated public servant, Ray Kammer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11910-4", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11910-S11911]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        CELEBRATING THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF SAINT JOSEPH'S HOSPITAL\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the \nachievement of one of West Virginia's finest healthcare facilities, \nSaint Joseph's Hospital in Parkersburg, West Virginia. Earlier this \nmonth, Saint Joseph's was recognized as one of the top 100 hospitals in \nthe United States in a prestigious study conducted by the HCIA-Sachs \nInstitute in conjunction with the University of Michigan School\n\n[[Page S11911]]\n\nof Public Health,. This is an enormous honor for one of West Virginia's \ncritical health care providers.\n  St. Joseph's Hospital is an acute care regional healthcare facility. \nLocated on the western edge of Wood County, the hospital's service area \nincludes three counties in Ohio and eight counties in West Virginia, \nwith a total population of 316,000. With the announcement of the top \n100 hospitals, Saint Joseph's became the first facility in West \nVirginia to receive this great recognition.\n  I had the pleasure of visiting Saint Joseph's in October 1998, to \npartake in the ground breaking for their new $20 million extension. \nThis extension has created over 100 new jobs at the hospital, adding to \nthe 860 people already employed by Saint Joseph's. The extension \nreplaced the physical facilities for surgical and emergency services, \nand consolidated the hospital's heart services.\n  The HCIA-Sachs study selects the top 100 hospitals based on five \ncategories, depending on the number of beds and teaching status, and \nranks them based on seven measures of clinical, operational, and \nfinancial performance. Saint Joseph's has been recognized as one of the \ntop twenty large community benchmark hospitals, with more than 250 \nbeds. The list encourages awareness of industry-wide benchmarks and the \nmeasurement of performance against peers. For example, the top \nhospitals have taken median average length of stay to a five-year low \nthis year, and surpassed comparable hospitals in clinical quality \nmeasures, such as lower mortality and complications.\n  I find it highly gratifying that one of West Virginia's finest \nhospitals has been nationally recognized by this great honor. It is \nparticularly striking that Saint Joseph's has been distinguished by a \nstudy with such very high standards as one of the top twenty facilities \nof its kind. I am so thankful to the Saint Joseph's Hospital's CEO \nStephens Mundy, its doctors and nurses, and all of its employees for \nthe amazing work that they continue to do to serve their community. The \npeople of Wood County, West Virginia, and the surrounding areas, are \nindeed fortunate to have you as part of their community. \nCongratulations on this great achievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11911-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11911-S11912]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SCIENTISTS AND PUBLIC SERVICE\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to call my colleagues' \nattention to the work of scientists around the country who are involved \nin guiding the federal government in issues relating to science and \ntechnology. As the ranking Democrat on the International Security, \nProliferation, and Federal Services Subcommittee, I know the importance \nof these men and women who support our nation's ability to make \ninformed science policy decisions.\n  Throughout this Congress, the Governmental Affairs Committee has held \nextensive hearings on the challenges facing the federal government to \nensure adequate staffing levels in the face of aggressive competition \nfrom the private sector for skilled employees. A common theme of these \nhearings is the shortage of information technology employees, and the \nfederal government is taking steps to fill the critical gaps in IT \npersonnel through enhanced recruitment, retention, and training \nprograms. The Office of Personnel Management recently announced new pay \nschedules for some levels of IT employees, and a new scholarship \nprogram will offer financial assistance to undergraduate and graduate \nstudents in exchange for a two-year commitment to work for the \ngovernment in information security. The program was authorized by the \nFY01 Defense Authorization bill.\n  However, in the rush to ensure adequate IT and computer information \nsecurity staffing levels, we should not forget the need to make certain \nthat the federal government continues to attract physical and natural \nscientists. The November 24, 2000 issue of Science discusses the \ndifficulties and rewards facing scientists who enter public service. \nThese ``civic scientists'' are employed at all levels of government, as \nwell as serving on federal advisory panels and review groups. Their \nactivities play a critical role in making decisions for funding \npriorities, new initiatives, and regulatory actions that depend \nincreasingly on scientific expertise.\n  The scientific community and the federal government have a mutually \nbeneficial relationship, which is nurtured through programs that bring \nscientists into policy staff positions, both as career employees and as \ntemporary staff. I know my colleagues are well acquainted with the Sea \nGrant Fellowship program that offers an educational experience to \ngraduate students in marine or aquatic studies to work in a \ncongressional, executive branch, or association office. Nor are we \nstrangers to the American Association for the Advancement of Science \n(AAAS) Fellowship program that introduces over 100 scientists and \nengineers from diverse fields to executive and legislative policy \npositions for one to two years. These fellowship programs provide \nunique opportunities to scientists and serve as an introduction to \nworking for the federal government.\n  In addition, many professional science and engineering societies are \naddressing the importance of these programs to science and the value of \nthe scientists who choose to take on these roles. The scientific \ncommunity is changing its view of those who work in science policy as \ndigressing from ``real science'' to instead seeing it as a respectable \ncareer path. These programs and others put scientists into staff roles \nat the federal level and create politically informed citizen-\nscientists.\n  Besides bringing scientific expertise and professional service into \nfederal offices for a year or more, these programs provide scientists \nwith a deeper understanding of policy making and the government. It is \nexpected when these ``civic scientists\" return to their universities, \nlaboratories, and companies that they will share their experiences and \nunderstanding with others and encourage their colleagues to become \ninvolved. The activities taken by citizen-scientists, both as part of \nformal fellowship programs, and as employees, advisors, consultants, \nand individual voters, demonstrate the importance their work plays in \nour society. I will continue to seek increased opportunities for \nscience fellows and scientific advisors to explore opportunities in \nfederal policymaking, and I ask that the text of the ``Science'' \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n                 [From Science Magazine, Nov. 24, 2000]\n\n                     Staffing Science Policy-Making\n\n                 (By Daryl Chubin and Jane Maienschein)\n\n       There are repeated calls for scientists worldwide to become \n     involved in guiding government decisions concerning science. \n     In the United States, science policy-making positions span \n     the gamut from political appointees (through a melange of \n     advisory panels, review groups, and professional \n     associations) to consultants, all of whom provide \n     commentary--solicited and unsolicited--on budgets, programs, \n     and current science and technology issues. Neal Lane, \n     Assistant to the President for Science and Technology Policy, \n     has called for ``civic scientists'' to enter public service \n     as staff in support of informed science policy-making.\n       Given the daily decisions affecting the directions and \n     applications of science, the more staff members who \n     understand science the better. Otherwise, valuable time is \n     wasted and risks are taken in making uninformed decisions \n     about funding priorities, new initiatives, and regulatory \n     actions that increasingly depend on considered scientific \n     judgments. One way to add scientific value to decision-making \n     is to bring scientists into staff positions, either within a \n     policy career path or as a temporary assignment. The question \n     is how to attract more scientists to take up this public \n     service and how to prepare them to contribute?\n       Overcoming the underlying problem of conflicting core \n     values in the scientific and policy cultures presents a \n     challenge. Working individually within a laboratory \n     hierarchy, scientists are rewarded for originality and \n     ownership of ideas. Even in collaborative projects, the \n     leaders typically receive the credit. Despite periodic calls \n     for rewarding departments, multidisciplinary teams, and \n     broader collaborations, an individualistic ethic prevails. \n     Researchers seek credit, and the community practices \n     individual accountability for performance. Priority of \n     discovery, authorship, and invention all circle around the \n     traditional proprietary nature of scientific knowledge.\n       Scientists who move from the laboratory into public \n     service, and from the foreground into the background, will \n     experience culture shock. An outstanding speech or position \n     paper on which the scientist's name does not appear replaces \n     an article published in a peer-reviewed journal. Ego must \n     fade from view; instead, satisfaction comes from being part \n     of the process and seeing it work. This requires learning to \n     speak for someone else, in someone else's voice, to someone \n     else's credit. Why should any self-respecting scientist want \n     to do this? Because there is more at stake than acclaim by \n     one's professional\n\n[[Page S11912]]\n\n     community. There is a larger public and national interest. \n     Beyond altruism, staff work allows another expression of the \n     competitive values of science. In a high-stakes high-tempo \n     environment, scientists can make a difference by drawing on \n     their research and pedagogical skills while mastering new \n     ones. Many have done so admirably, but we need more \n     scientists who are willing to help staff science policy-\n     making.\n       In the United States, a number of programs exist to provide \n     orientation and on-the-job training for scientists willing to \n     enter this public role. For example, Research!America \n     connects scientists in all federal legislative districts with \n     representatives there. The Ecological Society of America is \n     cultivating a cohort of Aldo Leopold Fellows. The \n     Congressional Fellows program of the American Association for \n     the Advancement of Science introduces scientists to the \n     policy-making process. Many U.S. universities now offer \n     undergraduate and graduate students a semester in Washington \n     as an intern in an agency, congressional office, or think \n     tank. These programs and others put scientists into staff \n     roles at the federal and local levels and create cohorts of \n     politically informed citizen-scientists. We applaud these \n     efforts and call for more.\n       In particular, we need more public discussion of what it \n     means to serve as staff and why it is important for science \n     that some scientists take on these roles. We need additional \n     training at all levels to negotiate the clash of cultures. We \n     need rewards for those who undertake staffing roles and do \n     them well. These scientists should not be seen as digressing \n     from ``real science'' but as facilitating the expanding reach \n     of science as a respectable career path. Staffing science \n     should be embraced as a necessary part of the scientific \n     enterprise, as well as a form of public service that advances \n     interest, appreciation, and understanding of a rapidly \n     changing world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11912-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11912]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ALLAN W. WITTE\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nextraordinary contributions of Allan W. ``Buck'' Witte to the people of \nAdams County, Illinois, and to congratulate him on his recent \nretirement.\n  One week ago, Al Witte quietly retired as Adams County Treasurer, a \npost he had held since 1992. But his public service contributions \nextend far beyond the treasurer's office. Al spent three years on the \nAdams County Board, winning a district in 1990 that, quite frankly, he \nwasn't supposed to win.\n  During his tenure on the County Board and in the treasurer's office, \nhe became one of the most popular public servants in Adams County, \ndrawing the largest vote totals of any county official. He followed in \nthe footsteps of his late father, Art Witte, a hard working Adams \nCounty Clerk, who dedicated himself to a lifetime of public service.\n  Prior to his tenure on the Adams County Board and his service as \nTreasurer, Al worked for 30 years at Gardner-Denver in industrial \nengineering, retiring from that post in 1989.\n  Anyone who knows Al is aware of his strong support for the Democratic \nParty, an unyielding loyalty that ensured he was the first phone call \nmade by any Democratic politician arranging a visit to Adams County. \nAlthough at times a fierce partisan, he kept winning elections by \nappealing to Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. He was a true \nbridge builder and an effective county and party official.\n  Mr. President, I have had the honor of working with Al Witte for most \nof this past decade, including when I represented Adams County and \nQuincy in the U.S. House of Representatives. I have always been taken \nby his dedication, loyalty, and commitment to public service.

Mr. President, today I am especially proud to \nrecognize the achievement of one of my state's most prized \norganizations, the Youth Museum of Southern West Virginia. Joining only \n21 other museums nationwide, the Youth Museum has been selected as a \nrecipient of this year's prestigious Institute of Museum and Library \nService National Award for Museum Service. This award highlights the \nenormous contributions made by the Youth Museum to the growth and \ndevelopment of the children of Southern West Virginia. This \norganization is truly deserving of this national recognition.\n  Located in the beautiful mountains of Beckley, West Virginia, the \nYouth Museum has brought culture, art, and the rich tradition of \nAppalachian history to West Virginian school children since 1977. \nEarning the praise of teachers, parents, and school administrators, the \nMuseum has touched the lives of thousands of families across the state. \nWithout the vast resources of more urban contemporaries, the Youth \nMuseum has helped to ensure that West Virginia's children have a sense \nof the diverse accomplishment and creativity that define their state's \nheritage.\n  An example of the unique and significant opportunities offered by the \nYouth Museum can be found in the Page After Page program. Recognizing \nthe extraordinary number of talented writers to be found in our state, \nthe Museum has brought together teachers, librarians, reading \nspecialists, students, and native authors to create an exhibition that \nemphasizes literacy and the achievements of West Virginia artists. \nCombining a focus on improving reading skills with the unique and \npersonal contributions of local writers, this program continues to \nchallenge, stimulate, and inspire young readers across the state.\n  However, the Page After Page program is just one example of the \nMuseum's commitment to providing positive and significant opportunities \nfor West Virginia's youth. The Artists-in-Residence series, programs \nfor special needs preschoolers, a planetarium, a science room, even a \nrecreated pioneer village--the list of educational resources and \nactivities is endless. Of course, this list reflects the hard work and \ndedication of an organization that has not wavered in its commitment to \nour children, or in its celebration of the unique and vital history of \nWest Virginia.\n  For 23 years, the Youth Museum has been enriching the lives of the \nchildren and families in our great state. Truly, it was a privilege to \nnominate the Youth Museum of Southern West Virginia for this year's \nAward for Museum Service, and it was no surprise to learn that they \nwere chosen for this prestigious national recognition. I am deeply \nproud of their accomplishment, and look forward to the many \ncontributions the Museum will continue to make to the education of West \nVirginia's youth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11912-3", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11912]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and withdrawals which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11912-4", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11912-S11913]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  Under authority of the order of the Senate of January 6, 1999, the \nSecretary of the Senate, on December 15, 2000, during the recess of the \nSenate, received a message from the House of Representatives announcing \nthat the House has agreed to the following concurrent resolution, \nwithout amendment.\n\n       S.

A bill to establish an Election Administration \n     Commission to study Federal, State, and local voting \n     procedures and election administration and provide grants to \n     modernize voting procedures and election administration, and \n     for other purposes; to the Committee on Rules and \n     Administration.\n\n\n                          election reform act\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Election \nReform Act. As chairman of the Senate Rules Committee, I am pleased to \nbe introducing along with Senators Torricelli, Feinstein, Allard, \nSmith, and Landrieu meaningful, bipartisan legislation to reform the \nadministration of our nation's elections. As we move into the twenty-\nfirst century it is inexcusable that the world's most advanced \ndemocracy relies on voting systems designed shortly after the Second \nWorld War. The Election Reform Act will ensure that our nation's \nelectoral process is brought up to twenty-first century standards.\n  By combining the Federal Election Commission's Election Clearinghouse \nand the Department of Defenses' Office of Voting Assistance, which \nfacilitates voting by American civilians and servicemen overseas, into \nthe Election Administration Commission, the bill will create one agency \nthat can bring focused expertise to bear on the administration of \nelections. This Commission will consist of four Commissioners appointed \nby the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. It will \ncontinue to carry out the functions of the two entities that are being \ncombined to create it. These include advising states on the \nrequirements of the Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and \nHandicapped Act, carrying out the Federal functions under the Uniformed \nand Overseas Voting Act, and servicing as a clearinghouse for \ninformation on federal elections and election administration.\n  In addition, the new Commission will engage in ongoing study and make \nperiodic recommendations on the best practices relating to voting \ntechnology and ballot design as well as polling place accessibility. \nThe Commission will also study and recommend ways to improve voter \nregistration, verification of registration, and the maintenance and \naccuracy of voter rolls. This is of special urgency in view of the \nallegations surfacing in this election of hundreds of felons being \nlisted on voting rolls and illegally voting, as reported last week in \nthe Miami Herald, while other law abiding citizens who allegedly \nregistered were not included on the voting rolls and were unable to \nvote. Such revelations from this year's elections coupled with the \nwell-known report by ``60 Minutes'' of the prevalence of dead people \nand pets both registering and voting in past elections make clear the \nneed for thoughtful study and recommendations to ensure that everyone \nwho is legally entitled to vote is able to do so and that everyone who \nvotes is legally entitled to do so--and does so only once. In addition \nto its studies and recommendations, the Commission will provide \nmatching grants to states working to improve election administration.\n  I think it is important that this Commission be established as a \npermanent, ongoing body. Many issues of election administration, such \nas polling place accessibility and alternative voting methods require \nongoing examination in view of ever-changing technology. A permanent \nCommission will be able to better facilitate timely information about \nnew, cost-effective technologies that can improve election \nadministration, such as technology to enable physically-challenged \ncitizens to vote with the same degree of privacy and dignity enjoyed by \nother citizens. In this age of rapid technological innovation, \ncontinuous, ongoing assessment of the ways technology can improve \nelection administration serves our nation's interest by ensuring that \noutmoded technology and procedures never again impede democracy in our \ngreat nation.\n  I am pleased to announce that Representative Tom Davis, along with \nRepresentatives Rothman and Kennedy, are introducing the House \ncompanion to our bill today. And finally, I would like to mention some \nof the citizens organizations that have announced their support for our \nbill. They include the Paralyzed Veterans of America, The Voting \nIntegrity Project, The National Council on Disability, and the National \nFoundation for the Blind.\n  Mr TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators \nMcConnell, Feinstein, Allard, Landrieu, Smith and Bennett to introduce \nthe Election Reform Act of 2000, bipartisan legislation that seeks to \nmodernize and improve the nation's election procedures. Although there \nis much about the aftermath of the November 7th elections upon which \nAmericans can disagree, this much should be clear: the United States is \na 21st century democracy with a 19th century election system. In order \nto maintain the legitimacy of our country's democratic institutions, we \nmust have an election system that is fair and accurate.\n  The antiquated voting equipment used in most counties around the \ncountry is perhaps the most startling revelation from this year's \nelection. Election Data Services reports that eighteen percent of \nAmericans vote using technology that prevailed around the time Thomas \nEdison invented the lightbulb and nearly thirty-three percent of \nAmericans vote by punching out unpredictable little chads, a system \nimplemented during the Johnson administration. In a nation where people \ncan confidently access the balance in their checking account on any \nstreet corner, it is unacceptable to have any less confidence in the \nexercise of the most fundamental of rights. Many states and localities \ncontinue to use outdated systems because of the cost of replacing them. \nElectronic voting machines with touch screens similar to bank ATMs, \nwhich are the most modern and accurate systems, cost about $5,000 each \nwhile replacing a punch-card system costs only about $225.\n  The inequity in quality of voting machines across the country raises \nfundamental questions of fairness and equal protection. Statistics from \nFlorida demonstrate that those individuals who voted in areas with \npunch cards had a much higher chance that their vote would not register \nthan those who voted with more modern equipment. For example, in \nFlorida predominantly African-American neighborhoods lost many more \npresidential votes than other areas largely because of the inferiority \nof their voting machines. Thus, thousands of legally qualified voters \nwere disenfranchised as a direct result of the financial resources of \ntheir community.\n  Therefore, in order to help improve and modernize the nation's \nelection procedures, the Election Reform Act establishes a permanent, \nfederal commission charged solely with the improvement of election \nadministration. By combining the Federal Election\n\n[[Page S11919]]\n\nCommission's Office of Election Administration (OEC) and the Department \nof Defenses' Office of Voting Assistance which facilitates voting by \nAmerican civilians and servicemen overseas, into the Election \nAdministration Commission, the bill will create one agency that can \nbring focused expertise to bear on the administration of elections. \nThis Commission will engage in ongoing study and make periodic, \nrecommendations on the best practices relating to voting technology and \nballot design as well as polling place accessibility. The Commission \nwill also study and recommend ways to improve voter registration, \nverification of registration, and the maintenance and accuracy of voter \nrolls. Finally, to help diminish the cost to states and localities of \nupdating their election procedures, the Commission will provide at \nleast $100 million a year in matching grants to states working to \nimprove election administration.\n  There can never be a sense again that an election in the United \nStates is settled on an arbitrary basis or that elections are an \napproximation. Constitutional guarantees of one person, one vote mean \nnothing in theory if they do not have any meaning in practice. So long \nas one voter, whether it be a senior citizen, an African-American, or \none in service to their country has doubt about whether their vote was \ncounted, our democracy suffers. That is an American, not a partisan \nproblem. The challenge before Congress is to make sure that the legacy \nof this election is not the confusion that has reigned for the past \nfive weeks but an enhancement of the legitimacy and credibility of our \ndemocratic processes.\n  Therefore, I look forward to working with the chairman of the Rules \nCommittee as well as my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to see \nthat this bipartisan legislation is the first priority of the 107th \nCongress. I am encouraged that both Vice-President Elect Cheney and \nSenator Joseph Lieberman have expressed their strong desire to make \nelection reform legislation their immediate priority in the next \nadministration and Congress. I am also pleased that Representatives \nRothman, Davis, Kennedy, and Alcee Hastings are introducing the House \ncompanion of this legislation today. Their support along with the \nendorsements of the Voting Integrity Project, Paralyzed Veterans of \nAmerica, the National Organization on Disability, and the National \nFoundation for the Blind gives me great confidence that this \nlegislation will gather strong support progress quickly.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to join with Senators \nMcConnell and Torricelli to introduce the Election Reform Act. I \nbelieve that this legislation will play an important role in improving \nelections in the United States.\n  The situation in Florida with different counties using different \nequipment, different standards and different methodologies in the \nconduct of the election is a clear indication that reform is needed. \nAlthough elections are within the purview of the states, if the Federal \ngovernment can provide incentives and financial assistance to update \nequipment and administration to ensure that every vote counts, that \nwould be a giant step forward.\n  Our democracy is based on the principle that our political leaders \nare chosen through a fair and accurate election process. While the \naftermath of this year's election brought much disagreement, it is \nclear that the voting system is antiquated and in need of reform.\n\n  This legislation establishes a permanent, federal Commission \ndedicated to election administration. This Commission will consist of \nfour Commissioners appointed by the President with the advice and \nconsent of the Senate. The Commissioners will serve four-year terms, \nwith no more than two Commissioners affiliated with the same political \nparty.\n  The Commission would do the following: study various aspects of \nelection administration and make periodic recommendations on such \ntopics as ballot design, accuracy, security, and technological advances \nin voting equipment; develop and update voluntary standards for voting \nsystems at least every four years; study accessibility to polling \nplaces and recommend voluntary guidelines to increase access to polling \nplaces; allocate $100 million in matching funds to States and \nlocalities that improve their voting systems in a manner consistent \nwith voluntary recommendations developed by the Commission.\n  This legislation has the support of the Voting Integrity Project, the \nCommittee for the Study of the American Electorate and the National \nOrganization on Disability, the American Foundation for the Blind, and \nthe Paralyzed Veterans of America.\n  As we move forward in the 21st century, it is essential that the all \nAmericans, and nations throughout the world, continue to have \nconfidence in our electoral process. This means modernizing the system \nto include new, cost-effective technologies that can improve election \nadministration. The reforms embodied in this legislation will permit \nthese advances. I am hopeful one of the first acts of the 107th \nCongress will be to pass this legislation.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join \nSenators McConnell, Torricelli, Feinstein, and Allard in the \nintroduction of the Election Reform Act. I think this last election \nmade it abundantly clear that the time has come to streamline and \nupdate our voting system's outmoded technology and procedures. As my \ncolleague Senator McConnell has pointed out, it is inexcusable that the \nworld's most advanced democracy relies on voting systems designed \nshortly after the Second World War.\n  The Election Reform Act will combine the functions of the Federal \nElection Commission's Election Clearinghouse and the Department of \nDefense Office of Voting Assistance, which facilitates voting by \nAmerican civilians and servicemen overseas, into a single Election \nAdministration Commission which will provide grants to states to \nmodernize their voting procedures. It is important to note that the \nCommission will in no way usurp what is rightfully the responsibility \nof the states to determine the times, places and manner of holding \nelections.\n  The Commission will study Federal, State, and local voting procedures \nand election administration and will develop, update and adopt every 4 \nyears, voluntary engineering and procedural performance standards for \nvoting systems. In addition, the Commission will engage in ongoing \nstudies of procedures and make periodic recommendations on the best \npractices relating to voting technology and ballot design. Another very \nimportant responsibility of the Commission will be to advise States \nregarding compliance with the requirements of the Voting Accessibility \nfor the Elderly and Handicapped Act and develop, update, and adopt \nvoluntary procedures for enhancing voting methods for voters, including \ndisabled voters. It is imperative that, as we pursue improvements in \nthe administration of our elections, we also have the most up-to-date \ninformation about new technologies to enable the elderly and the \ndisabled to vote with the same degree of privacy and dignity enjoyed by \nother citizens.\n  Mr. President, I believe this legislation will go a long way toward \nrestoring confidence in our voting systems, and I am hopeful that the \nSenate will pass the Election Reform Act very early in the new \nCongress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 3280. A bill to prohibit assistance to the Palestinian Authority \nunless and until certain conditions are met; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n\n\n    legislation conditioning assistance to the palestinian authority\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation at this \ntime which will put on the record factors which have been enormously \nharmful in the current violence which now occurs in Israel. This bill \nwould prohibit assistance to the Palestinian Authority or Palestinian \nprojects, unless and until certain conditions are met. The Oslo Interim \nAgreement of 1995 provided that the Palestinian Authority would:\n\n       . . . ensure that their respective educational systems \n     contribute to the peace between the Israeli and Palestinian \n     peoples and to peace in the entire region, and will refrain \n     from the introduction of any motifs that could adversely \n     affect the process of reconciliation.\n\n  Notwithstanding that commitment, the Palestinian Authority has filled\n\n[[Page S11920]]\n\nthe textbooks with the most vitriolic condemnation of Israel and the \nJews. For example, the ninth graders are taught:\n\n       One must beware of the Jews, for they are treacherous and \n     disloyal.\n\n  The ninth graders are further instructed:\n\n       One must beware of civil war, which the Jews try to incite, \n     and of scheming against the Muslims.\n\n  There are some extraordinarily vitriolic comments which are inciting \nthe young people, the Arabs, to turn to violence in the name of Allah, \nwith the instruction directing them that they will be doing Allah's \nwork, and if they are killed, they will go to heaven as Allah's \nmessengers, as Allah's assistants.\n  There are reports of 12-year-old boys who leave their homes telling \ntheir parents they are off to throw stones and otherwise incite \nviolence. The parents permit this under a fatalistic attitude of ``what \nwill be will be,'' and that it is something to be desired--incite to \nviolence and be killed in doing Allah's work.\n  The difficulties in the peace process are enormous. They are \ngenerational. There is absolutely no likelihood of success if the \nschoolchildren in the Palestinian Authority schools are going to be \ntaught hatred and violence and the most extraordinary forms of \nmisleading comment--about how to please Allah and how to go to heaven \nby getting themselves killed in the process of killing others and \ndestroying the peace process.\n  The United States and our allies have contributed very substantially \nto projects in the West Bank and Gaza. While the United States has not \ngiven aid directly to the Palestinian Authority since 1995, in fiscal \nyear 2000, the United States allocated $485 million in development \nassistance to non-governmental organizations working in the West Bank \nand Gaza. Between 1995 and 1998, international aid provided by 21 \ncountries and 4 international organizations amounted to almost $227 \nmillion. Between 1993 and 1999, the international community pledged a \ntotal of $5.7 billion for assistance in the West Bank and Gaza, and \nover $2.7 billion was disbursed by the end of 1999, according to the \nWorld Bank. I will go into the funding which the United States has \nprovided and which our allies have provided in greater detail.\n  This legislation would condition any assistance by the United States \nto the Palestinian Authority on changing those textbooks in accordance \nwith their commitments under the Oslo agreement, ceasing to publish \nmaps which omit Israel but instead refer only to Palestine, and \nchanging the vitriol which appears on the state-sponsored television. \nThese are absolutely minimal steps which have to be taken if there is \nto be any opportunity for success in the Mideast peace process.\n  In 1995, Senator Shelby and I introduced legislation which was \nenacted which conditioned U.S. aid on the Palestinian Authority \nchanging its charter which called for the destruction of Israel. That, \nin fact, did happen and perhaps our legislation was somewhat helpful in \ngetting that done. The legislation also conditioned aid on maximum \nefforts of the Palestinian Authority and Chairman Arafat to restrain \nterrorists. For a time, I think there was a real effort by Chairman \nArafat and many in the Palestinian Authority to do that, but that has \ntotally broken down.\n  Notwithstanding those grave difficulties, efforts must continue on \nthe peace process to try to terminate the violence there. I note in \nthis morning's press there are reports of additional meetings. I have \nboth privately and publicly commended President Clinton for his efforts \nin trying to mediate the difficulties between the Israelis and the \nPalestinians.\n  This business about teaching sixth graders, seventh graders, eighth \ngraders, and ninth graders to hate and to incite violence is just \nabsolutely intolerable if there is to be any chance at all for the \npeace process to succeed, and even in the next generation to find a way \nfor people to live in peace with the Jewish State of Israel, the \nPalestinian Authority and the Arabs, who are citizens of Israel, for \nthat matter.\n  I am introducing this bill on what is probably going to be the last \nday of our session so that these educational tools may become better \nknown. People will understand them and will join the fight to insist \nthat they be terminated.\n  Mr. President, to reinterate, I have sought recognition today to \nintroduce legislation to condition aid to the Palestinian Authority \nupon the removal of all anti-Semitic and anti-Israel content from their \nschool textbooks, and radio and television broadcasts at publically \nfunded facilities. The Palestinian Authority deliberately and \nconsciously disseminates messages filled with anti-Semitic and anti-\nIsrael hatred with the clear aim of promoting violence against Israel \nand the Jewish people. This is a clear violation of the spirit of the \npeace process.\n  A study by the Center for Monitoring the Impact of Peace, a \nJerusalem-based non-governmental organization, found that there is not \none example in the entire Palestinian school system of a positive \nreference to a Jew, Judaism, or to peace with Israel. I urge the \npassage of this legislation to send a clear signal to the Palestinian \npeople that the international community will not accept the fostering \nof hatred in textbooks and broadcast media in the West Bank and Gaza. \nThe United States provides assistance to the region in support of the \npeace process, and we must condition this assistance upon each party's \nfulfillment of the commitments made to bring peace to the region. \nFurthermore, we must vigorously press for our allies to do the same.\n  In years past, Palestinian schools in the West Bank used Jordanian \ntextbooks and the schools in Gaza used Egyptian textbooks. While the \nareas were under the control of the Israeli government, these books \ncontinued to be used but anti-Semitic and anti-Israel material was \nremoved. As a result of the 1993 Oslo Accords, the responsibility for \neducation in the West Bank and Gaza was transferred from the Israeli \ngovernment to the Palestinian Ministry of Education. While beginning to \ndevelop their own curriculum, the Palestinian Ministry of Education \ncontinued to use Egyptian and Jordanian books, but failed to remove the \nanti-Israel and anti-Semitic material. Currently, the Palestinian \nMinistry of Education is directly supervising the production of new \ntextbooks which are the first Palestinian-produced textbooks.\n  As part of a pilot program, the first new textbooks were introduced \nin the first and sixth grades in September 2000, as part of the new \ncurriculum which the Palestinian Authority plans to expand to cover the \ngrades first through twelfth over the next fours years. Many Israelis \nand others hoped these books would promote the peace process and teach \ncooperation and tolerance among the Israelis and the Palestinians. \nInstead, the new Palestinian textbooks continue to contain anti-Israel \nmaterial, such as a map denying the existence of Israel. The continued \npromotion of hatred by the Palestinian Authority is unacceptable, as it \nnot only violates the spirit of the peace process but also the letter \nof the Oslo Accords. The United States and the rest of the \ninternational community must send a message to the Palestinian \nAuthority that this will not be tolerated.\n  By means of both the new and old textbooks in their schools, the \nPalestinian Authority is raising an entire generation of Palestinian \nchildren to despise Jews and Israel. These teachings foster an \nenvironment of hatred and violence, not peace and conciliation. \nPalestinian school children are actively taught that the Jewish people \nand Israel are the enemy in a broad range of contexts, and that Jews \nare not to be trusted. For example, on page 79 of the textbook entitled \nthe Islamic Education for Ninth Grade, the book outlines lessons to be \nlearned by the students. Specifically, it says ``One must beware of the \nJews, for they are treacherous and disloyal.'' The book goes on to say \non page 94, ``one must beware of civil war, which the Jews try to \nincite, and of scheming against the Muslims.'' Reinforcing this \nmessage, students read on page 182, ``The Jews . . . have killed and \nevicted Muslim and Christian inhabitants of Palestine, whose \ninhabitants are still suffering oppression and persecution under racist \nJewish Administration.''\n  Another textbook, the Islamic Religious Education for Fourth Grade, \non page 44, states ``. . . the Jews--as is their way--do not want \npeople to live in peace. . .'' In the Reader and Literary Texts for \nEighth Grade, on pages\n\n[[Page S11921]]\n\n96 through 99, students are taught ``The Jews have clear greedy designs \non Jerusalem.'' Students are then asked to think about the following \nquestion: ``What can we do to rescue Jerusalem and to liberate it from \nthe thieving enemy. . .?'' The authors of these textbooks clearly \nintended not to foster an environment of trust between the Palestinian \npeople and their Jewish neighbors. Without a foundation of trust in the \nhearts and minds of the Palestinian people, the peace process is doomed \nto failure.\n  The school books also include lessons equating Zionism with Nazism, \nFascism, and racism. For example, the textbook entitled The \nContemporary History of the Arabs and the World, on page 123, states \n``The clearest examples of racist belief and racial discrimination in \nthe world are Nazism and Zionism.'' Lessons such as this one are \nclearly not intended to support peace between the Palestinians and \nIsraelis.\n  More alarmingly, in addition to anti-Semitic material, these \ntextbooks also teach children to pursue violence and the destruction of \nIsrael. The calls to fight and eliminate Israel through Jihad, holy \nwar, and martyrdom for Allah, appear frequently in the school \ntextbooks. The need to fight Israel is portrayed as a religious \nimperative in the books.\n\n  For example, a fifth grade textbook, Our Arabic Language for Fifth \nGrade on page 69 and 70, teaches children that ``there will be a Jihad \nand our country shall be freed. This is our story with the thieving \nconquerors. You must know, my boy, that Palestine is your grave \nresponsibility.'' The book also teaches children to ``remember: The \nArabs and the Muslims are fighting the Jews who fought against them and \noppressed them and drove them from their homes unjustly. The final and \ninevitable result will be the victory of the Muslims over the Jews.''\n  The violent message continues in the seventh grade textbook, Islamic \nEducation for Seventh Grade, on page 108, which states ``if the enemy \nhas conquered part of its land and those fighting for it are unable to \nrepel the enemy, then Jihad becomes the individual religious duty of \nevery Muslim man and woman, until the attack is successfully repulsed \nand the land liberated from conquest and to defend Muslim honor. . .''.\n  In addition to lessons on Jihad, students are instructed to adopt \nhostile attitudes on a particularly divisive topic--their \nresponsibility regarding holy sites. The seventh grade textbook, \nIslamic Education for Seventh Grade, on page 184, states ``Muslims must \nprotect all mosques. . . They must devote all their efforts and \nresources to repairing them and to protecting them and must wage a \nJihad both of life and property to liberate al-Aqsa Mosque from the \nZionist conquest.'' The inflammatory language is also included on page \n50, ``The Muslim connects the holiness of al-Aqsa Mosque, and its \nprecincts, with the holiness of the `Sacred Mosque' and Mecca. \nTherefore, any aggression against one is an aggression against the \nother and to defend them is to defend Islam. Disregard of the duty in \nrespect of them is a crime for which Allah will punish every believer \nin Allah and His Prophet.'' The aggressive message clearly encourages \nthe violence which is currently taking place in the Middle East.\n  The same seventh grade book also teaches children to fight and \nconquer Israel's capital, Jerusalem. For example, the book contains a \ncomposition question which asks: ``How are we going to liberate our \nstolen land? Make use of the following ideas: Arab unity, genuine faith \nin Allah, most modern weapons and ammunition, using oil and other \nprecious natural resources as weapons in the battle for liberation.'' \nIt is this type of violent message which leads young children to take \nto the streets and engage in stone-throwing and other violence.\n  However, this message is not limited to schoolbooks. The same hateful \nportrayal of Jews and Israel found in the school books is promoted \nregularly on Palestinian Television, which is also under direct control \nof the Palestinian Authority. For example, on May 14, 1998, Palestinian \ntelevision broadcast statements such as ``The Jewish gangs waged racial \ncleansing wars against innocent Palestinians . . . large scale \nappalling massacres saving no women or children.'' On May 14, 1998, \nZionism was presented as ``a cancer in the body of the nation.''\n  Palestinian television broadcasts a continuous flow of violent images \nwith messages glorifying the children in the streets as martyrs \nparticipating in Jihad. For example, television stations around the \nworld broadcast the image of Muhammad al-Durrah, the twelve year old \nboy who was killed while his father tried to shield him from the \ncrossfire on September 30, 2000. However, the image of the young man, \nwho had no intention when he left his house that day to become a \nmartyr, was instantly the symbol used by Palestinian television of the \ncontinued victimization of the Palestinian people at the hands of the \nso-called Israeli ``occupiers.''\n  By continually referring to the occupation of their land, Palestinian \ntelevision refuses to acknowledge the legitimacy of Israel. On May 19, \n1998, Palestinian television reported `` . . . the war of 1948 brought \nabout the establishment of the Zionist entity on Palestinian land.'' \nThe television broadcasts also declared in May 1998: ``This is our \nPalestine. We defend it with blood.''\n  The hate-filled broadcasts further reinforce the anti-Israel and \nanti-Semitic messages found in the school textbooks and explicitly aim \nto incite violence. We cannot tolerate this behavior by a society that \nclaims to be committed to pursuing the peace process. These teachings \nsend a direct message to young children to pursue violence and the \ndestruction of Israel, and the message appears to be reaching the \nchildren.\n  On October 6, 2000, the New York Times reported on Muhammad Ibrahim, \na Palestinian teenager engaged in the current violence in the streets. \nMuhammad joins his young friends on the streets and throws stones at \nIsraeli soldiers, even though his father asked him ``not to go down \nthat road'' and telling him ``we do not need another generation of \nvictims.'' When asked why he engaged in the stone throwing, Muhammad \nplainly stated, ``You want to express your anger. You know your stone \nmight not hit an Israeli soldier or might not even hurt him. But you \nwant to feel you've done something for the homeland.'' Muhammad made \nclear where he learned these lessons when he said, ``I was raised with \nstories of how they kicked us off our land.'' The young people out on \nthe streets today throwing stones have been raised on anti-Israel and \nanti-Semitic stories, which is formally reinforced in the textbooks \nused in the schools in the West Bank and Gaza and the television and \nradio broadcasts. If there is any hope for lasting peace in the region, \nthe next generation of leaders must not be raised on lessons of hatred \nand violence.\n\n  In signing the 1995 Interim Agreement on the West Bank and Gaza, the \nIsraeli government and the Palestinian Authority agreed to use their \nrespective educational systems to support the peace process. \nSpecifically, Article XXII of the Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement \non the West Bank and the Gaza Strip of 1995 declares that Israel and \nthe Palestinian Authority will ``ensure that their respective \neducational systems contribute to the peace between the Israeli and \nPalestinian peoples and to peace in the entire region, and will refrain \nfrom the introduction of any motifs that could adversely affect the \nprocess of reconciliation.'' The Palestinian Authority should be held \nto the commitments made in the peace process, not the least of which is \nto educate the young people of the West Bank and Gaza with a curriculum \nthat will contribute to peace between the Israeli and Palestinian \npeoples.\n  The United States provides assistance to the region in support of the \npeace process, and it is imperative to condition this assistance upon \nthe fulfillment of the commitments made to bring peace to the region. \nWhile the United States has not given aid directly to the Palestinian \nAuthority since 1995, in fiscal year 2000 the United States allocated \n$485 million in development assistance to non-governmental \norganizations working in the West Bank and Gaza, including funds for \neducational programs. It is of the utmost importance that the United \nStates conditions any aid to the Palestinian Authority on their \ncommitment\n\n[[Page S11922]]\n\nto the peace process, which must be demonstrated by the removal of the \nanti-Semitic and anti-Israel material from their textbooks and radio \nand television broadcasts.\n  It is also imperative that the United States urge our allies to \ncondition their aid to the Palestinian Authority on this issue. Between \n1995 and 1998 international aid provided by twenty-one countries and \nfour international organizations provided $226.9 million to educational \nprojects in the Palestinian Territories. Between 1993 and 1999, the \ninternational community pledged a total of $5.7 billion in assistance \nfor the West Bank and Gaza, and over $2.7 billion was disbursed by the \nend of 1999 according to the World Bank. From 1994 to 1999, the \nEuropean Community committed over $600 million. Recently, on December \n6, 2000, the World Bank also agreed to a grant to the Palestinian \nAuthority in the amount of $12 million.\n  The assistance to the Palestinian Authority, whether through \ninternational institutions or our allies, must include conditions which \nwill compel the Palestinian Authority to remove this unacceptable \nmaterial from the textbooks and the broadcast media. The assistance is \ngiven to the Palestinian Authority with the intent to support peace in \nthe region, and therefore, the aid should be conditioned on the removal \nof material which undermines the peace process from the Palestinian \neducational system and broadcast media. I urge my colleagues to join me \nin supporting this legislation which sends a clear signal to the \nPalestinian Authority that the use of anti-Semitic and anti-Israel \nmaterial in their schools and television and radio broadcasts will not \nbe tolerated.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3280\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION I. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Today in the West Bank and Gaza, textbooks used in \n     Palestinian schools are teaching hatred towards Jews and the \n     incitement towards violence.\n       (2) Article XXII of the Israeli-Palestinian Interim \n     Agreement of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip of 1995 \n     declares that Israel and the Palestinian Authority will \n     ``ensure that their respective educational systems contribute \n     to the peace between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples and \n     to peace in the entire region, and will refrain from the \n     introduction of any motifs that could adversely affect the \n     process of reconciliation''.\n       (3) As a result of the Oslo Accords, the responsibility for \n     education in the West Bank and Gaza was transferred from the \n     Government of Israel to the Palestinian Ministry of \n     Education.\n       (4) Since the early 1950s, Palestinian schools in the West \n     Bank have used Jordanian textbooks and the schools in Gaza \n     used Egyptian textbooks, but when these areas were under the \n     control of the Israeli government, anti-Semitic and anti-\n     Israel content was removed from the school books.\n       (5) While beginning to develop their own curriculum, the \n     Palestinian Ministry of Education continued to use Egyptian \n     and Jordanian books, but failed to remove the anti-Israel and \n     anti-Semitic content.\n       (6) The Palestinian Ministry of Education directly \n     supervised the production of new textbooks which are now used \n     in schools in the West Bank and Gaza.\n       (7) The new textbooks contain anti-Semitic and anti-Israel \n     content, and the Israeli government no longer has the \n     authority to change the content of the textbooks.\n       (8) Palestinian Authority school children are actively \n     taught that the Jews and Israel are the enemy in a broad \n     range of contexts, and for example, page 79 of the Islamic \n     Education for Ninth Grade reads, ``One must beware of the \n     Jews, for they are treacherous and disloyal''.\n       (9) The Islamic Education for Ninth Grade also instructs \n     that ``one must beware of civil war which the Jews try to \n     incite, scheming against the Muslims,'' on page 94.\n       (10) On page 182, the text of the Islamic Education for \n     Ninth Grade reads ``The Jews--have killed and evicted Muslim \n     and Christian inhabitants of Palestine, whose inhabitants are \n     still suffering oppression and persecution under racist \n     Jewish administration.''\n       (11) The Islamic Religious Education for the Fourth Grade \n     teaches students on page 44, ``. . . the Jews--as is their \n     way--do not want people to live in peace.''\n       (12) The books include lessons equating Zionism with \n     Nazism, Fascism, and racism, and for example, The \n     Contemporary History of Arabs and the World, on page 123, \n     states ``The clearest examples of racist belief and racial \n     discrimination in the world are Nazism and Zionism.''\n       (13) Islamic Education for the Fourth Grade teaches \n     children ``the Jews are the enemies'' on page 67.\n       (14) The new textbooks do not acknowledge the State of \n     Israel, but rather the creation of Israel is explained as the \n     Israeli occupation of 1948.\n       (15) All the maps of ``Palestine'', be they political, \n     historical, geographical, or natural resource maps in the \n     textbooks, erase mention of Israel.\n       (16) The calls to fight and eliminate Israel through Jihad \n     (Holy War) and Martyrdom for Allah, appear frequently in the \n     school books.\n       (17) In addition there is a separate recurring theme: the \n     children are taught to fight and conquer Israel's capital, \n     Jerusalem, and for example, the book Islamic Education for \n     Seventh Grade asks: ``How are we going to liberate our stolen \n     land? Make use of the following ideas: Arab unity, genuine \n     faith in Allah, most modern weapons and ammunition, using oil \n     and other precious natural resources as weapons in the battle \n     for liberation'' on page 15.\n       (18) The need to fight Israel, all of which is said to be \n     on ``occupied Arab Land'' becomes a religious imperative, \n     with teachings like the following from Islamic Education for \n     Seventh Grade, page 108:``if the enemy has conquered part of \n     its land and those fighting for it are unable to repel the \n     enemy, then Jihad becomes the individual religious duty of \n     every Muslim man and woman, until the attack is successfully \n     repulsed and the land liberated from conquest and to defend \n     Muslim honor. . ''.\n       (19) The same message appears in the fifth grade text Our \n     Arabic Language for Fifth Grade on pages 69 and 70, ``there \n     will be a Jihad and our country shall be freed. This is our \n     story with the thieving conquerors. You must know, my boy, \n     that Palestine is your grave responsibility.\n       (20) Children are specifically taught to protect all \n     mosques, and for example, Islamic Education for the Seventh \n     Grade instructs students that ``they must devote all their \n     efforts and resources to repairing them and to protecting \n     them and must wage a Jihad both of life and property to \n     liberate al-Aqsa Mosque from the Zionist conquest'' on page \n     184.\n       (21) Palestinian Authority television is under direct \n     control of the Palestinian Authority.\n       (22) The same hateful portrayal of Jews and Israel found in \n     the school books is promoted regularly on Palestinian \n     television, and for example, on May 14, 1998, Palestinian \n     television broadcast statements such as ``The Jewish gangs \n     waged racial cleansing wars against innocent Palestinians. . \n     . large scale appalling massacres saving no women or \n     children''.\n       (23) Also, radio and television broadcasts made by publicly \n     funded facilities in the Palestinian Authority-controlled \n     areas of the West Bank and Gaza include programs having an \n     anti-Semitic, anti-Israel content.\n       (24) On May 14, 1998, on Palestinian Television Zionism was \n     presented as ``a cancer in the body of the nation.''\n       (25) The Palestinian Television also refuses to acknowledge \n     the state of Israel, and broadcast in May 1998, ``the war of \n     1948 brought about the establishment of the Zionist entity on \n     Palestinian land.''\n       (26) The message of Jihad is also conveyed on the \n     Palestinian Television, and for example, the broadcasts \n     declared in May 1998, ``This is our Palestine. We defend it \n     with blood.''\n       (27) While the United States has not given aid directly to \n     the Palestinian Authority since 1995, in fiscal year 2000 the \n     United States allocated $485 million in development \n     assistance to non-governmental organizations working in the \n     West Bank and Gaza, including funds for education programs.\n       (28) Between 1995 and 1998 international aid provided by 21 \n     countries and 4 international organizations provided $226.9 \n     million to educational projects in the Palestinian \n     Territories..\n       (29) From 1994 to 1999, the European Community committed \n     over $600 million in assistance to the Palestinian \n     Territories, including funds for education programs.\n\n     SEC. 2. RESTRICTION ON ASSISTANCE.\n\n       (a) Restriction.--No assistance shall be provided to the \n     Palestinian Authority unless and until the President \n     certifies to Congress that the Palestinian Authority has \n     removed the anti-Semitic, anti-Israel content included in the \n     textbooks used in schools, and radio and television \n     broadcasts made by publicly funded facilities, in the \n     Palestinian Authority-controlled areas of the West Bank and \n     Gaza.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the President should urge allies of the United States to \n     apply an equivalent restriction on assistance as described in \n     subsection (a).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 3282. A bill to authorize funding for University Nuclear Science \nand Engineering Programs at the Department of Energy for fiscal years \n2002 through 2006; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n  Department of energy university nuclear science and engineering act\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President. I rise today to introduce a bill \nauthorizing\n\n[[Page S11923]]\n\nthe Secretary of Energy to provide for the Office of Nuclear Science \nand Technology to reverse a serious decline in our nation's educational \ncapability to produce future nuclear scientists and engineers. Let me \noutline how serious this decline is, after doing so I will outline its \nimpact on our nation and then discuss how this bill attempts to remedy \nthis situation.\n  As of this year, the supply of four-year trained nuclear scientists \nand engineers is at a 35-year low. The number of four-year programs \nacross our nation to train future nuclear scientists has declined to \napproximately 25--a 50 percent reduction since about 1970. Two-thirds \nof the nuclear science and engineering faculty are over age 45 with \nlittle if any ability to draw new and young talent to replace them. \nUniversities across the United States cannot afford to maintain their \nsmall research reactors forcing their closure at an alarming rate. This \nyear there are only 28 operating research and training reactors, over a \n50 percent decline since 1980. Most if not all of these reactors were \nbuilt in the late 1950's and early 60's and were licensed initially for \n30 to 40 years. As a result, within the next five years the majority of \nthese 28 reactors will have to be relicensed. Relicensing is a long, \nlengthy process which most universities cannot and will not afford. \nInterestingly, the employment demand for nuclear scientists and \nengineers exceeds our nation's ability to supply them. This year, the \ndemand exceeded supply by 350, by 2003 it will be over 400.\n  These human resource and educational infrastructure problems are \nserious. The decline in a competently trained nuclear workforce affects \na broad range of national issues.\n  We need nuclear engineers and health physicists to help design, \nsafely dispose and monitor nuclear waste, both civilian and military.\n  We rely on nuclear physicists and scientists in the field of nuclear \nmedicine to develop radio isotopes for the thousands of medical \nprocedures performed everyday across our nation--to help save lives.\n  We must continue to operate and safely maintain our existing supply \nof fission reactors and respond to any future nuclear crisis \nworldwide--it takes nuclear scientists, engineers and health physicists \nto do that.\n  Our national security and treaty commitments rely on nuclear \nscientists to help stem the proliferation of nuclear weapons whether in \nour national laboratories or as part of worldwide inspection teams in \nsuch places as Iraq. Nuclear scientists are needed to convert existing \nreactors worldwide from highly enriched to low enriched fuels.\n  Nuclear engineers and health physicists are needed to design, operate \nand maintain future Naval Reactors. The Navy by itself cannot train \nstudents for their four year degrees--they only provide advance \npostgraduate training on their reactor's operation.\n  Basically, we are looking at the potential loss of a 50 year \ninvestment in a field which our nation started and leads the world in. \nWhat is worse, this loss is a downward self-feeding spiral. Poor \ndepartments cannot attract bright students and bright students will not \ncarry on the needed cutting edge research that leads to promising young \nfaculty members. Our system of nuclear education and training, in which \nwe used to lead the world, is literally imploding upon itself.\n  I've laid out in this bill some proposals that I hope will seed a \nnational debate in the upcoming 107th Congress on what we as a nation \nneed to do to help solve this very serious problem. It is not a perfect \nbill, but I think it should start the ball rolling. I welcome all forms \nof bipartisan input on it. My staff has worked from consensus reports \nfrom the scientific community developed by the Nuclear Energy Advisory \nCommittee to the Department of Energy's Office of Nuclear Science and \nTechnology, in particular its Subcommittee on Education and Training. \nThe report is available on the Office's website. I encourage everyone \nto read and look at these startling statistics.\n\n  Here is an outline of what is in the bill.\n  First and foremost, we need to concentrate on attracting good \nundergraduate students to the nuclear sciences. I have proposed \nenhancing the current program which provides fellowships to graduate \nstudents and extends that to undergraduate students.\n  Second, we need to attract new and young faculty. I've proposed a \nJunior Faculty Research Initiation Grant Program which is similar to \nthe NSF programs targeted only towards supporting new faculty during \nthe first 5 years of their career at a university. These first five \nyears are critical years that either make or break new faculty.\n  Third, I've proposed enhancing the Office's Nuclear Engineering \nEducation and Research Program. This program is critical to university \nfaculty and graduate students by supporting only the most fundamental \nresearch in nuclear science and engineering. These fundamental programs \nultimately will strengthen our industrial base and over all economic \ncompetitiveness.\n  Fourth, I've strengthened the Office's applied nuclear science \nprogram by ensuring that universities play an important role in \ncollaboration with the national labs and industry. This collaboration \nis the most basic form of tech transfer, it is face-to-face contact and \nnetworking between faculty, students and the applied world of research \nand industry. This program will ensure a transition between the student \nand their future employer.\n  Finally, I've strengthened what I consider the most crucial element \nof this program--ensuring that future generations of students and \nprofessors have well maintained research reactors.\n  I've proposed to increase the funding levels for refueling and \nupgrading academic reactor instrumentation.\n  I propose to start a new program whereby faculty can apply for \nreactor research and training awards to provide for reactor \nimprovements.\n  I have proposed a novel program whereby as part of a student's \nundergraduate and graduate thesis project, they help work on the re-\nlicensing of their own research reactors. This program must be in \ncollaboration with industry which already has ample experience in \nrelicensing. Such a program will once again provide face-to-face \nnetworking and training between student, teacher and ultimately their \nemployer.\n  I have proposed a fellowship program whereby faculty can take their \nsabbatical year at a DOE laboratory. Under this program DOE laboratory \nstaff can co-teach university courses and give extended seminars. This \nprogram also provides for part time employment of students at the DOE \nlabs--we are talking about bringing in new and young talent.\n  In making all of these proposals, let me emphasize that each one of \nthese programs I have described is intended to be peer reviewed and to \nhave awards made strictly on merit of the proposals submitted. This \nprogram is not a hand out. Each element that I am proposing requires \nthat faculty innovate and compete for these funds. If they do not win, \nthen their reactors will simply be shut down by their institutions.\n  I have outlined a very serious problem that if not corrected now will \ncost far more to correct later on. If the program I have outlined is \nimplemented, then it will strengthen our reputation as a leader in the \nnuclear sciences, strengthen our national security and our ability to \ncompete in the world market place.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3282\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as ``Department of Energy University \n     Nuclear Science and Engineering Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) U.S. university nuclear science and engineering \n     programs are in a state of serious decline. The supply of \n     bachelor degree nuclear science and engineering personnel in \n     the United States is at a 35-year low. The number of four \n     year degree nuclear engineering programs has declined 50 \n     percent to approximately 25 programs nationwide. Over two-\n     thirds of the faculty in these programs are 45 years or \n     older.\n       (2) Universities cannot afford to support their research \n     and training reactors. Since 1980, the number of small \n     training reactors in the United States have declined by over \n     50 percent to 28 reactors. Most of these reactors\n\n[[Page S11924]]\n\n     were built in the late 1950s and 1960s with 30- to 40-year \n     operating licenses, and will require re-licensing in the next \n     several years.\n       (3) The neglect in human investment and training \n     infrastructure is affecting 50 years of national R \n     investment. The decline in a competent nuclear workforce, and \n     the lack of adequately trained nuclear scientists and \n     engineers, will affect the ability of the United States to \n     solve future waste storage issues, maintain basic nuclear \n     health physics programs, operate existing fission reactors in \n     the United States, respond to future nuclear events \n     worldwide, help stem the proliferation of nuclear weapons, \n     and design and operate naval nuclear reactors.\n       (4) Further neglect in the nation's investment in human \n     resources for the nuclear sciences will lead to a downward \n     spiral. As the number of nuclear science departments shrink, \n     faculties age, and training reactors close, the appeal of \n     nuclear science will be lost to future generations of \n     students.\n       (5) The Department of Energy's Office of Nuclear Science \n     and Technology is well suited to help maintain tomorrow's \n     human resource and training investment in the nuclear \n     sciences. Through its support of research and development \n     pursuant to the Department's statutory authorities, the \n     Office of Nuclear Science and Technology is the principal \n     federal agent for civilian research in the nuclear sciences \n     for the United States. The Office maintains the Nuclear \n     Engineering and Education Research Program which funds basic \n     nuclear science and engineering. The Office funds the Nuclear \n     Energy and Research Initiative which funds applied \n     collaborative research among universities, industry and \n     national laboratories in the areas of proliferation resistant \n     fuel cycles and future fission power systems. The Office \n     funds Universities to refuel training reactors from highly \n     enriched to low enriched proliferation tolerant fuels, \n     performs instrumentation upgrades and maintains a program of \n     student fellowships for nuclear science, engineering and \n     health physics.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to reauthorize and amend the Commodity Exchange Act \nto promote legal certainty, enhance competition, and reduce systematic \nrisk in markets for futures and over-the-counter derivatives, and for \nother purposes; read the first time.\n\n\n            THE COMMODITY FUTURES MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today with Senators \nGramm, Harkin, Fitzgerald, Hagel, and Johnson to re-introduce the \nCommodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000. This legislation is the \nSenate companion to H.R. 5660, which Congressman Thomas Ewing \nintroduced yesterday in the House of Representatives and which will be \nenacted as part of the final appropriations package today. This \nmonumental legislation is the culmination of two years worth of \nhearings and hard-fought negotiations, but I am confident that the \nresulting legislation will greatly benefit the U.S. financial industry. \nI commend all the Members and staff who have contributed to this bill. \nIn particular, I want to applaud Senator Gramm, Congressman Ewing and \nSenator Fitzgerald for their stewardship and determination in helping \npass a bill this year. Its enactment would not have occurred without \ntheir efforts. I also want to recognize Treasury Secretary Summers, \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, Chairman Bill Rainer and \nSecurities and Exchange Commission, SEC, Chairman Arthur Levitt as well \nas their staffs, who have played a pivotal role in bringing this bill \ntogether and garnering support for its passage.\n  This bill, which re-authorizes the Commodity Exchange Act for five\n\n[[Page S11925]]\n\nyears, would reform our financial and derivatives laws in five primary \nways. First, it would incorporate the unanimous recommendations of the \nPresident's Working Group on Financial Markets on the proper legal and \nregulatory treatment of over-the-counter, OTC, derivatives. Second, it \nwould codify the regulatory relief proposal of the CFTC to ensure that \nfutures exchanges are appropriately regulated and remain competitive. \nThird, this legislation would repeal the Shad-Johnson jurisdictional \naccord, which banned single stock futures 18 years ago. Fourth, this \nlegislation provides certainty that products offered by banking \ninstitutions will not be regulated as futures contracts. Finally, this \nbill provides legal certainty for institutional equity swaps by \nproviding the SEC with express but limited authorities over these \ninstruments.\n  Derivative instruments, both those that are exchange-traded and \ntraded over-the-counter, have played a significant role in our \neconomy's current expansion due to their innovative nature and risk-\ntransferring attributes. The global derivatives market has a notional \nvalue that now exceeds $90 trillion. Identified by Federal Reserve \nChairman Alan Greenspan as the most significant event in finance of the \npast decade, the development of the derivatives market has \nsubstantially added to the productivity and wealth of our nation.\n  Derivatives enable companies to unbundle and transfer risk to those \nentities who are willing and able to accept it. By doing so, efficiency \nis enhanced as firms are able to concentrate on their core business \nobjective. A farmer can purchase a futures contract, one type of \nderivative, in order to lock in a price for his crop at harvest. \nLikewise, automobile manufacturers whose profits earned overseas can \nfluctuate with changes in currency values, can minimize this \nuncertainty through derivatives, allowing them to focus on the business \nof building cars. Banks significantly lessen their exposure to interest \nrate movements by entering into derivatives contracts known as swaps, \nwhich enable these institutions to hedge their risk by exchanging \nvariable and fixed rates of interests.\n  Signed into law in 1974, the Commodity Exchange Act, CEA, requires \nthat futures contracts be traded on a regulated exchange. As a result, \na futures contract that is traded off an exchange is illegal and \nunenforceable. When Congress enacted the CEA and authorized the CFTC to \nenforce it, this was not a concern. The meanings of ``futures'' and \n``exchange'' were relatively apparent. Furthermore, the over-the-\ncounter derivatives business was in its infancy. However, in the 26 \nyears since the statute's enactment, the OTC swaps and derivatives \nmarket, sparked by innovation and technology, has significantly \noutpaced the exchange-traded futures markets. Thus the definitions of a \nswap and a future began to blur.\n\n  In 1998, the CFTC issued a document containing a concept release \nregarding OTC derivatives, which was perceived by many as a precursor \nto regulating these instruments as futures. Just the threat of reaching \nthis conclusion could have had considerable ramifications, given the \nsize and importance of the OTC market. The legal uncertainty \ninterjected by this dispute jeopardized the entirety of the OTC market \nand threatened to move significant portions of the business overseas. \nIf we were to lose this market, most likely to London, it would take \nyears to bring it back to U.S. soil. The resulting loss of business and \njobs would be immeasurable.\n  This threat led the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve, and the \nSEC to oppose the concept release and request that Congress enact a \nmoratorium on the CFTC's ability to regulate these instruments until \nafter the President's Working Group could complete a study on the \nissue. As a result, Congress passed a six-month moratorium on the \nCFTC's ability to regulate over-the-counter derivatives. Despite \nreservations, I supported this moratorium because it brought legal \nassurance to this skittish market and it allowed the Working Group time \nto develop recommendations on the most appropriate legal treatment of \nOTC derivatives. In November 1999, the President's Working Group \ncompleted its unanimous recommendations on OTC derivatives and \npresented Congress with these findings. These recommendations remain \nthe cornerstone of our bill.\n  Our bill contains several mechanisms for ensuring that legal \ncertainty is attained and that certain transactions remain outside the \nCommodity Exchange Act. The first, the electronic trading facility \nexclusion, would exclude transactions in financial commodities from the \nAct if conducted: (1) on a principal to principal basis; (2) between \ninstitutions or sophisticated persons with high net worth; and (3) on \nan electronic trading facility. The second would exclude these \ntransactions if (1) they are conducted between institutions or \nsophisticated persons with high net worth; and (2) they are not on a \ntrading facility.\n  These exclusions attempt to address the advent of electronic trading \nand the changing and innovating nature of the financial industry. \nIndeed, we are keenly aware that there are newly emerging electronic \nsystems that provide for the electronic negotiation of swaps agreements \nbetween and among large banks and other sophisticated major financial \ninstitutions acting as dealers. We do not intend for these systems to \ncome within the definition of trading facilities.\n  The third exclusion clarifies the Treasury Amendment language already \ncontained in the CEA. It would exclude all transactions in foreign \ncurrency and government securities from the Act unless those \ntransactions are futures contracts and traded on an organized exchange. \nAs recommended by the Working Group, the bill would give the CFTC \njurisdiction over non-regulated off-exchange retail transactions in \nforeign currency. Another important recommendation of the PWG was to \nauthorize futures clearing facilities to clear OTC derivatives in an \neffort to lessen systemic risk and this bill incorporates this finding.\n  As part of the legal certainty provisions, this legislation also \naddresses the concern that excluding OTC derivatives from the futures \nlaws will cause these products to be fully regulated as securities. \nWith Senator Gramm's leadership, this legislation adopts language that \nwould provide the SEC with limited authority over institutional swaps \nfor fraud, manipulation and insider trading. This language will help to \nprovide the legal certainty that these institutional transactions lack \nunder current law.\n\n  Title four of this bill also provides legal certainty for banking \nproducts. Senator Gramm has appropriately raised the concern that \ntraditional banking products should not be subject to the CEA. This \nlanguage provides an exclusion for traditional banking products as well \nas hybrid products that are predominantly banking in nature. New \nproducts offered by banks that are not in existence on December 5, \n2000, or are otherwise not excluded from the CEA would fall under a \n``jump ball'' provision of the bill. This section provides a mechanism \nfor the CFTC and the Federal Reserve to determine whether a new non-\ntraditional product offered by a bank should be regulated under the \nbanking laws or the futures laws.\n  The second major section of this legislation addresses regulatory \nrelief. In February of this year, the CFTC issued a regulatory relief \nproposal that would provide relief to futures exchanges and their \ncustomers. Instead of listing specific requirements for complying with \nthe CEA, the proposal would require exchanges to meet internationally \nagreed-upon core principals. The CFTC proposal creates tiers of \nregulation for exchanges based on whether the underlying commodities \nbeing traded are susceptible to manipulation or whether the users of \nthe exchange are limited to institutional customers. Unsure of whether \nthis legislation would be enacted, the CFTC went ahead and finalized \nits regulatory relief proposal on November 20, 2000.\n  When enacted, this legislation will largely incorporate the CFTC's \nframework. A board of trade that is designated as a contract market \nwould receive the highest level of regulation due to the fact that \nthese products are susceptible to manipulation or are offered to retail \ncustomers. Futures on agricultural commodities would fall into this \ncategory. This bill also sets out that in lieu of contract market \ndesignation, a board of trade may register as a Derivatives Transaction \nExecution\n\n[[Page S11926]]\n\nFacility, DTEF, if the products being offered are not susceptible to \nmanipulation and are traded among institutional customers or retail \ncustomers who use large Futures Commission Merchants, FCMs, who are \nmembers of a clearing facility.\n  Also, a board of trade may choose to be an Exempt Board of Trade, \nXBOT, and not be subject to the Act (except for the CFTC's anti-\nmanipulation authority) if the products being offered are traded among \ninstitutional customers only (absolutely no retail) and the instruments \nare not susceptible to manipulation. Our bill would allow a board of \ntrade that is a DTEF or an XBOT to opt to trade derivatives that are \notherwise excluded from the Act on these facilities and to the extent \nthat these products are traded on these facilities, the CFTC would have \nexclusive jurisdiction over them. With this provision, the intent is to \nprovide these facilities that trade derivatives with a choice--if \nregulation is beneficial, the facility may choose to be regulated. If \nnot, the facility may choose to be excluded or exempted from the Act.\n  By refraining from altering certain sections of the Act, this \nlegislation re-affirms the importance of specific authorities granted \nthe CFTC, including its anti-fraud and anti-manipulation powers. \nSection 4b is the principal anti-fraud provision of the Act and the \nCommission has consistently used Section 4b to combat fraudulent \nconduct by bucket shops and boiler rooms that entered into transactions \ndirectly with their customers and thus did not involve a traditional \nbroker-client type of relationship. There have been cases involving the \nfraudulent sale of illegal precious metals futures contracts marketed \nas cash-forward transactions (CFTC v. P.I.E., Inc., 853 F.2d 721 (9th \nCir. 1988)) as well as cases involving boiler room operations \nfraudulently selling illegal precious metals contracts to members of \nthe general public. (CFTC v. Wellington Precious Metals, Inc., 950 F.2d \n1525 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 113 S. Ct. 66 (1992)). This \nreaffirmation is consistent with both Congress' understanding of and \npast Congressional amendments to Section 4b that confirmed the \napplicability of Section 4b to fraudulent boiler rooms and bucket shops \nthat enter into transactions directly with their customers.\n\n  It is the intent of Congress in retaining Section 4b of the Act that \nthe provision not be limited to fiduciary, broker/customer or other \nagency-like relationships. Section 4b provides the Commission with \nbroad authority to police fraudulent conduct within its jurisdiction, \nwhether occurring in boiler rooms and bucket shops, or in the e-\ncommerce markets that will develop under this new statutory framework.\n  The bill's last section addresses the Shad-Johnson jurisdictional \naccord. In 1982, SEC Chairman John Shad and CFTC Chairman Phil Johnson \nreached an agreement on dividing jurisdiction between the agencies for \nthose products that had characteristics of both securities and futures. \nKnown as the Shad-Johnson Accord, this agreement prohibited single \nstock futures and delineated jurisdiction between the SEC and the CFTC \non stock index futures.\n  Meant as a temporary agreement, many have suggested that the Shad-\nJohnson accord should be repealed. The President's Working Group \nunanimously agreed that the Accord should be repealed if regulatory \ndisparities are resolved between the regulation of futures and \nsecurities. In March 2000, the General Accounting Office released a \nreport that found that there is no legitimate policy reason for \nmaintaining the ban on single stock futures since these products are \nbeing traded in foreign markets, in the OTC market, and synthetically \nin the options markets. Chairman Gramm and I sent a letter requesting \nthe CFTC and the SEC to make recommendations on reforming the Shad-\nJohnson ban. On September 14, 2000, the SEC and CFTC reached an \nagreement on the proper regulatory treatment of these instruments, and \nwe have incorporated this agreement into our legislation.\n  Under the legislation, the SEC and the CFTC would jointly regulate \nthe market for single stock futures and narrow-based stock index \nfutures. These products will be allowed to trade on both futures and \nsecurities exchanges. Single stock futures and narrow-based stock index \nfutures (i.e., security futures) would be statutorily defined as both \nsecurities and futures, allowing the agencies the authority to regulate \nthese instruments. However, to avoid redundancy, our legislation \nexempts these products from a series of regulations and requirements \nunder both the securities and futures laws.\n  Margin levels, listing standards, and other key trading practices \nwould be jointly supervised by the SEC and CFTC. At the outset, margin \nlevels for security futures products could not be lower than comparable \nmargin levels required in the options markets. The tax treatment of \nthese products would be comparable to the tax treatment of options on \nsecurities to ensure a level playing field between the markets.\n  Futures on broad-based indices would be under the exclusive \njurisdiction of the CFTC. The agreement sets out a ``bright-line'' \nformula for determining when an index is broad-based using the number \nand weighting of the securities contained in the index. This formula \nwould allow a broad-based index to contain as few as 9 securities.\n  The goal of this legislation is to ensure that the United States \nremains a global leader in the derivatives marketplace and that these \nmarkets are appropriately and effectively regulated. I believe that \nthis legislation meets these objectives while ensuring that the \npublic's interest in the financial markets is protected.\n  This long legislative journey began two years ago when the Senate and \nHouse Agriculture Committees held a two day roundtable, in which \ndistinguished individuals from the financial community participated. \nOne of those individuals was Merton H. Miller, the Nobel Prize winning \nprofessor of economics from the University of Chicago, who passed away \nthis summer. Professor Miller, known for his disarming sense of humor, \nhis plain-spokenness and his generosity, is dearly missed by his \nfamily, friends and colleagues. The impact of his death has been \nparticularly hard felt by the community of friends at the Chicago \nfutures markets. Professor Miller was the primary intellectual force \nbehind the development of the modern financial futures market and a \nstaunch defender of the free market system. His body of work helped \nbring academic legitimacy to these markets, and he is sorely missed by \nthem. As part of our roundtable discussion, we allowed each of the \nparticipants to make one wish for the coming 106th Congress. True to \nhis life's work in this area, Professor Miller told us that Congress \nneeded to lessen the cost of regulation on the futures and other \nfinancial markets in order to allow these markets to survive and \ncompete in the global economy. I find it particularly satisfying that \nwe are able to pass this historic legislation at the end of the 106th \nCongress and provide Professor Miller with his wish. I am confident \nthat his legacy will live on through the success and growth of the \nmarkets that are benefitted by this legislation.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, today I join with Senator Lugar, Chairman \nof the Senate Agriculture Committee, and several others of our \ncolleagues to introduce the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of \n2000. The formal purpose of this legislation is to reauthorize the \nCommodity Exchange Act, the legal authority for the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission. As important as that is, this legislation does far \nmore.\n  This is a landmark bill that addresses the two major purposes that \nSenator Lugar and I set out to achieve when we first began discussing \nthis legislation. First of all, this bill would repeal the so-called \nShad-Johnson Accord, the 18-year-old temporary prohibition on the \ntrading of futures based on individual stocks. Second, the bill \neliminates the legal uncertainty that today hangs as an ominous cloud \nover the $60 trillion financial swaps markets.\n  We are introducing the bill today as the finished product of years of \nwork involving half a dozen committees in both Houses of Congress, and \nas many agencies of the Federal government. This bill is identical to, \nand is the Senate companion to, H.R. 5660, introduced yesterday in the \nHouse and which will be approved by the House and the Senate today. We \nintroduce this bill in the Senate to demonstrate the bicameral \nauthorship and support for this important legislation.\n  For legislative history, I would direct my colleagues to statements \nmade\n\n[[Page S11927]]\n\nelsewhere in the Record in connection with House and Senate action on \nthe House companion, part of the package of legislation approved \ntogether with the Labor HHS appropriations bill for fiscal year 2001.\n  I would take this opportunity to thank Chairman Lugar and all who had \na hand in forming this important legislation. All who had a hand in it \ndeserve to be proud of this product.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 3284. A bill to amend title 5, United States Code, to establish a \nnational health program administered by the Office of Personal \nManagement to offer Federal employee health benefits plans to \nindividuals who are not Federal employees, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                           OPTION ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to make \navailable to all of our constituents the same range of private health \ninsurance plans available to Members of Congress and other federal \nemployees through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, FEHBP.\n  The OPTION Act--Offering People True Insurance Options Nationwide--\nwould expand insurance options by allowing individuals to enroll in \nprivate health insurance plans nearly identical to the plans federal \nemployees currently choose from. Though the OPTION program would be \nseparate from the federal employees program, it would be modeled after \nFEHBP and would draw from FEHBP's strengths: plan choice, group \npurchasing savings, comprehensive benefits, and open enrollment \nperiods.\n  Too many Americans do not have real insurance options. Many \nindividuals lack insurance because no insurer is willing to cover them \nat a reasonable price. Others work for employers who do not provide \nhealth insurance or offer only one insurance provider. The OPTION Act \naddresses these issues by giving individuals and businesses access to \nthe group purchasing power that undergirds FEHBP and the wide range of \nhealth plans in that program.\n  Under this legislation, all FEHBP health plans would be required to \noffer an OPTION health plan to non-federal employees with the same \nbenefits they offer federal employees through FEHBP.\n  OPTION enrollees would be placed in a separate risk pool, to prevent \nany effect on current FEHBP employees, and the OPTION Act would not \nresult in any changes in the premiums or benefits of today's FEHBP \nhealth plans.\n  One of the few differences from FEHBP is that OPTION plans would be \nallowed to vary premiums by age, so that younger enrollees would be \nmore likely to enroll. OPTION plans also would be required to offer \nrebates or lower premiums for longevity of health coverage. These \nprovisions would act as an incentive for people to sign up when they \nare young and to maintain continuous coverage.\n  OPTION health plans would not be allowed to impose any preexisting \ncondition exclusions on new OPTION enrollees who have at least one year \nof health insurance coverage immediately prior to enrollment in an \nOPTION plan. To prevent people from waiting until they get sick to \nenroll, health plans would be allowed to exclude coverage for \npreexisting conditions for up to one year for people without coverage \nimmediately preceding enrollment.\n  All employers would have the option of voluntarily participating in \nthe OPTION program and providing OPTION health plans to their \nemployees. To be eligible, a business would have to be willing to pay \nat least a minimum percentage of the premiums, varying from 30 percent \nto 50 percent depending on the size of the business. This innovative \nemployer option would encourage employer health coverage rather than \nshifting coverage away from the private sector. I want to emphasize \nthat employer participation would be entirely voluntary.\n  Opening up these health plans to employers would give small \nbusinesses a new opportunity to provide health coverage to their \nemployees. Premiums in today's market can be especially high for small \nbusinesses buying insurance on their own. The OPTION program will allow \nbusinesses to tap into the type of group buying power in the federal \nemployees program.\n  Premiums would not be government-subsidized and would instead be the \nresponsibility of the participating enrollees and those employers who \nchoose to participate.\n  Mr. President, I support efforts to provide financial assistance to \nthose who cannot afford health insurance and I have offered other \npieces of legislation to provide that assistance. We need to address \nthe fact that 42.6 million Americans, including 1.7 million \nIllinoisans, currently lack health insurance--up nearly 25 percent from \nthe 34.4 million in 1990. However, I am offering this measure on its \nown to focus specifically on expanding health coverage options and \nencouraging businesses to provide coverage. No one should be living \njust a serious accident or major illness away from financial ruin. \nMaking more insurance options available to a greater number of people \nin this country is a good first step toward universal coverage.\n  The OPTION program would be administered by the Office of Personnel \nManagement, OPM, which administers the FEHBP program, and would \ngenerally follow the rules for FEHBP. OPM has developed considerable \nexpertise in negotiating and working with health plans and has shown \nthat it can run a health program well at a minimum of cost. We can \nbuild on OPM's expertise to extend the same health insurance options to \nall Americans.\n  Finally, once it is up and running, the program would pay for itself. \nAdministrative costs would be covered from a portion of the OPTION \npremiums. Those who benefit from the program would pay for its overhead \ncosts.\n  Mr. President, this legislation could open the door for many \nAmericans to obtain good health insurance coverage. I am introducing it \nat this late point in the session so that it can stimulate discussion \nover the next few months. I will reintroduce the measure next year. I \nwelcome the input and support of my colleagues and hope the Senate will \nwork next year to reduce the number of uninsured Americans and expand \ninsurance options.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a fuller summary of the bill and a copy \nof the bill itself be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3284\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

To be eligible, a business \n     would have to be willing to pay at least a minimum percentage \n     of the premiums for its employees, with the amount varying \n     depending on the size of the business. A small business with \n     3-25 employees would have to pay at least 30% of the premium \n     for its employees, a larger business with 26-50 employees \n     would have to pay at least 40%, and a business with more than \n     50 employees would have to pay at least 50%. Employers would \n     be offered an incentive to begin enrolling their employees by \n     allowing them to pay as little as 20% of the premium for the \n     first year only. This innovative employer option would \n     encourage employer health coverage rather than shifting \n     coverage away from the private sector. Employer participation \n     would be entirely voluntary.\n       Under the OPTION Act, premiums would not be government-\n     subsidized. Enrollees, and those employers who choose to \n     participate, would be responsible for the cost of the \n     premiums. (Senator Durbin supports and has offered separate \n     legislation to provide financial assistance to those who \n     cannot afford health insurance but is offering this measure \n     on its own to focus specifically on expanding health coverage \n     options and encouraging businesses to provide coverage.)\n       One of the few differences from FEHBP is that OPTION plans \n     would be allowed to vary premiums by age, so that younger \n     enrollees would be more likely to enroll.\n       OPTION plans also would be required to offer rebates or \n     lower premiums to encourage and reward longevity of health \n     coverage. This would create an incentive for people to sign \n     up when they are young and maintain continuous coverage.\n       OPTION health plans would not be allowed to impose any \n     preexisting condition exclusions on new OPTION enrollees who \n     have at least one year of health insurance coverage \n     immediately prior to enrollment in an OPTION plan. To prevent \n     people from waiting\n\n[[Page S11929]]\n\n     until they get sick to enroll, health plans would be allowed \n     to exclude coverage for preexisting conditions for up to one \n     year for people without coverage immediately prior to \n     enrollment (reduced by one month for each month of \n     immediately previous coverage). OPTION enrollees who \n     terminate their coverage mid-year would have to wait to re-\n     join until the next annual open season that is at least six \n     months after the date of termination.\n       People who lost their previous health coverage and are not \n     eligible for COBRA would be allowed to enroll in an OPTION \n     plan at the start of the next month, just as newly hired \n     federal employees can enroll in FEHBP.\n       The benefits provided by OPTION plans would be the same as \n     the benefits in the corresponding FEHBP plans. (Current FEHBP \n     benefits include inpatient/outpatient hospital care; \n     physician services; surgical services; diagnostic tests; and \n     emergency care; as well as child immunizations; certain \n     cancer screening tests, including mammography; prescription \n     drugs, including contraceptives; mental health and substance \n     abuse treatment benefits with parity for mental and physical \n     health; organ transplantation; and a 48-hour minimum \n     inpatient stay for childbirth and mastectomies.)\n       The OPTION program would be administered by the Office of \n     Personnel Management (OPM), which administers the FEHBP \n     program, and would generally follow the rules for FEHBP. For \n     example, OPM would conduct the same annual open season for \n     enrollment and would negotiate premiums and benefits with \n     OPTION health plans as it does with FEHBP plans. OPM has \n     developed considerable expertise in negotiating and working \n     with health plans and has shown that it can run a health \n     program well at a minimum of cost. Its expenses are currently \n     limited to no more than one percent of the total premiums for \n     the FEHBP program. Rather than reinventing the wheel, we can \n     build on OPM's expertise to extend the same health insurance \n     options to all Americans.\n       Once it is up and running, the program would pay for \n     itself. Administrative costs would be covered from a portion \n     of the OPTION premiums.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 3285. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude \ntobacco products from qualifying foreign trade property in the \ntreatment of extraterritorial income; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               STOP GIVING SPECIAL TAX BREAKS TO TOBACCO\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nexclude tobacco from the Extraterritorial Income Exclusion tax benefit, \nwhich has replaced the Foreign Sales Corporation tax benefit.\n  This tax provision provides tax benefits to a variety of companies, \nincluding many in Illinois, and I understand how important it is to \nthem. But one product should be clearly, in law, excluded from this \nbenefit, and it is the one product which kills its user when used \naccording to the manufacturer's directions--tobacco.\n  The FSC replacement law already contains several exclusions from its \nbenefits. Oil, gas, and other primary products are excluded to help \nensure that natural resources in the United States are not depleted.\n  Unprocessed timber is excluded in order to ensure no displacement of \nU.S. jobs.\n  The law also excludes certain products in order to promote congruence \nwith other federal government policies. For example, there are \nexclusions relating to items subject to the Export Administration Act, \nwhich prohibits or severely restricts export of certain civilian goods \nand technology that have military applications. Similarly, we should \nnot be subsidizing tobacco products that are sold overseas while at the \nsame time trying to cut smoking rates in the U.S. Our trade and health \npriorities should be on the same page.\n  The biggest tobacco companies in America currently benefit handsomely \nfrom the Foreign Sales Corporation tax break and will benefit from the \nExtraterritorial Income Exclusion tax break. The latest available data \nfrom the Statistics of Income Division at the Internal Revenue Service \nshow tobacco products sold through 10 Foreign Sales Corporations for \ndomestic tobacco manufacturers accounted for about $100 million in lost \ntax revenue in 1996. There is no justification for compelling American \ntaxpayers to support a $100 million tax subsidy annually for the \nbenefit of U.S. tobacco companies.\n  Since 1990, while Philip Morris's sales have grown minimally in the \nU.S., they have grown by 80 percent abroad. Smoking currently causes \nmore than 3.5 million deaths each year throughout the world. Within 20 \nyears, that number is expected to rise to 10 million, with 70 percent \nof all deaths from smoking occurring in developing countries. Tobacco \nwill soon be the leading cause of disease and premature death \nworldwide--surpassing communicable diseases such as AIDS, malaria, and \ntuberculosis.\n  American taxpayers should not be partners in this export of disease \nand death where the result is more children around the globe smoking \nand more people getting sick and dying.\n  While it is true that tobacco companies are not receiving any special \ntreatment that other corporations don't get under the old FSC law or \nits recent replacement, we must remember that tobacco companies are not \nlike any other company. Internal tobacco industry documents have \nestablished that, starting as early as the 1950s, cigarette companies \nintentionally withheld information about smoking, including scientific \nresearch about its risks; made false and misleading statements about \nthe harm of tobacco products; attacked research findings despite \nknowing that the research was valid; failed to take steps to make their \nproducts safer; and marketed their products to children and youth.\n  As a matter of fact, Philip Morris recently posted a statement on its \nwebsite agreeing that smoking is harmful to your health and that there \nis no such thing as a safe or safer cigarette. The statement says, ``We \nagree with the overwhelming medical and scientific consensus that \ncigarette smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema and \nother serious diseases in smokers. Smokers are far more likely to \ndevelop serious diseases, like lung cancer, than non-smokers. There is \nno `safe' cigarette. These are and have been the messages of public \nhealth authorities worldwide. Smokers and potential smokers should rely \non these messages in making all smoking-related decisions.''\n  It is about time that the tobacco companies faced up to the fact that \ntheir products are harmful and highly addictive. In the U.S. alone, \nsmoking causes more than 400,000 deaths and costs more than $72 billion \nin health care costs every year.\n  We should not be subsidizing such an inherently dangerous product \nthat is being promoted and marketed so irresponsibly here and around \nthe world. With its devastating health effects, tobacco should not \nenjoy the same taxpayer-subsidized federal assistance as other \nproducts.\n  It's time to take another step toward bringing our nation's tax and \ntrade priorities in line with our clear understanding of the health \ndangers of tobacco. My legislation simply adds one additional category \nto the list of products excluded from the special tax treatment in the \nFSC Repeal and Extraterritorial Income Exclusion Act of 2000, which was \nrecently signed into law by the President. It shifts tobacco from being \npromoted by this tax benefit to being excluded from this tax benefit.\n  In my legislation, tobacco is defined as it is defined in Section \n5702(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, so it includes cigars, \ncigarettes, smokeless tobacco, and pipe tobacco. It does not apply to \nraw tobacco, so this legislation will not affect tobacco farmers' \nability to sell their product abroad.\n  Is it fair to exclude a legal product from this tax benefit? \nAbsolutely! Tobacco companies spend over $5 billion each year--that's \nnearly $14 million every day--in the U.S. alone to promote their \nproducts in order to replace the thousands of customers who either die \nor quit using tobacco products each day. In other countries, U.S. \ntobacco companies advertise their products near schools and in video-\ngame arcades. They also use children in other countries to peddle their \nproducts. Street lights with the Camel logo have been installed in \nBucharest, Romania. Toy cars with the Camel insignia are sold to \nchildren in Buenos Aires. Children's tatoos sporting the Salem logo are \ndistributed in Hong Kong. Arcade games in the Philippines are plastered \nwith the Marlboro label.\n  I urge my colleagues to send a message to U.S. tobacco companies as \nwell as the next Administration to take the logical next step and make \nchanges in the way tobacco products are sold and regulated to reflect \nthe magnitude of the danger.\n  The tobacco prevention agenda has been stalled in this Congress for \nfar too\n\n[[Page S11930]]\n\nlong. Let's work together, in a bipartisan fashion, to stop marketing \ntobacco products to children, to regulate tobacco products in a \nsensible way, and to adopt larger and clearer warning labels \ncommensurate with the risks of tobacco products. Let's take a close \nlook at all the forms of tobacco, including the new fad of bidis and \nthe resurgent use of cigars. They all have addictive levels of nicotine \nand deadly levels of carcinogens. It's time to put people's health \nahead of tobacco company profits.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this \nimportant legislation, to end the contradiction of using the tax code \nto continue to enrich U.S. tobacco companies, which export products \nthat addict children abroad to nicotine and push them down a path to \ndisease and death.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation be printed in \nthe Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3285\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. EXCLUSION OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS FROM QUALIFYING \n                   FOREIGN TRADE PROPERTY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 943(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 (relating to excluded property) is amended by \n     striking ``or'' at the end of subparagraph (D), by striking \n     the period at the end of subparagraph (E) and inserting ``, \n     and'', and by inserting after subparagraph (E) the following \n     new subparagraph:\n       ``(F) any tobacco products (as defined in section \n     5702(c)).''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall take effect as if included in the amendment made by \n     section 3(b) of the FSC Repeal and Extraterritorial Income \n     Exclusion Act of 2000.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Daschle, and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 3286. A bill to provide permanent funding for the Bureau of Land \nManagement Payment in Lieu of Taxes program and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n         pilt and refuge revenue sharing permanent funding act\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the bill I am introducing today, the \nPILT and Refuge Revenue Sharing Permanent Funding Act, deals with an \nissue that I believe must be addressed in the next Congress. The bill \nis a measure to make permanent funding for two important programs \nmanaged by the Department of the Interior: the Payment in Lieu of Taxes \nProgram (or PILT) in the Bureau of Land Management and the Refuge \nRevenue Sharing Program in the Fish and Wildlife Service. These \nprograms provide support to local governments in areas in which these \ntwo agencies hold land. Under the authorizations for these programs, \nthe funds are to be provided as an offset to the local property tax \nbase lost by virtue of the Federal ownership of these lands.\n  Federal ownership of lands in the American West, in states like New \nMexico, does not come without its share of burdens for local \ngovernments. If there is a fire or other emergency, they must help \nrespond. If there is increased traffic to and from the site, they must \nmaintain the public roads that provide the necessary access to the \npublic. In enacting the original authorizing legislation, Congress \ndecided that, as a matter of policy, it was appropriate for the Federal \nGovernment to bear a fair share in paying for these costs, in lieu of \nthe taxes that would be levied on any private landowner in these \nlocalities.\n  But in setting up these programs, Congress decided to make them \nsubject to annual appropriations, either partially (in the case of \nRefuge Revenue Sharing) or completely (in the case of PILT). In \nretrospect, this was a mistake. The annual appropriations process has \nnever come even close to providing the funds agreed upon by the \nunderlying authorizing law. Moreover, the amount made available has \nchanged significantly from one year to the next, frustrating the \nability of localities to plan effectively for the use of these funds. \nMany of the burdens they face as a result of Federal land ownership \nrequire expenditures and commitments that are long-term. If you want to \nhave a reasonable system of country roads, you need to have a \nconsistent multi-year plan. If you want adequate fire protection, you \ncan't be hiring a dozen new firefighters in one year and firing them \nthe next, as appropriation levels gyrate up and down.\n  The Federal Government needs to be a better neighbor and a more \nreliable partner to local governments in the rural West. Since the \nsystem of meeting our obligations to these localities through the \nannual appropriations process has not worked, I am proposing that we \nstart treating our payments in lieu of taxes in the same way that we \naccount for incoming tax revenues to the Federal Government--on the \nmandatory side of the Federal ledger. By making the funding for these \ncrucial programs full and permanent, we will be keeping the commitments \nto rural communities throughout the West made in the original PILT and \nRefuge Revenue Sharing authorizing legislation. It's a matter of simple \njustice to rural communities. I hope that enacting legislation along \nthe lines of what I am proposing today will receive high priority in \nthe next Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record following this statement.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3286\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) an important facet of the history of the United States \n     is the story of how the United States was populated;\n       (2) the migration, immigration, and settlement of the \n     population of the United States--\n       (A) is broadly termed the ``peopling of America''; and\n       (B) is characterized by--\n       (i) the movement of groups of people across external and \n     internal boundaries of the United Sates and territories of \n     the United States; and\n       (ii) the interactions of those groups with each other and \n     with other populations;\n       (3) each of those groups has made unique, important \n     contributions to American history, culture, art, and life;\n       (4) the spiritual, intellectual, cultural, political, and \n     economic vitality of the United States is a result of the \n     pluralism and diversity of the American population;\n       (5) the success of the United States in embracing and \n     accommodating diversity has strengthened the national fabric \n     and unified the United States in its values, institutions, \n     experiences, goals, and accomplishments;\n       (6)(A) the National Park Service's official thematic \n     framework, revised in 1996, responds to the requirement of \n     section 1209 of the Civil War Sites Study Act of 1990 (16 \n     U.S.C. 1a-5 note; Public Law 101-628), that ``the Secretary \n     shall ensure that the full diversity of American history and \n     prehistory are represented'' in the identification and \n     interpretation of historic properties by the National Park \n     Service; and\n       (B) the thematic framework recognizes that ``people are the \n     primary agents of change'' and establishes the theme of human \n     population movement and change--or ``peopling places''--as a \n     primary thematic category for interpretation and \n     preservation; and\n       (7) although there are approximately 70,000 listings on the \n     National Register of Historic Places, sites associated with \n     the exploration and settlement of the United States by a \n     broad range of cultures are not well represented.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to foster a much-needed understanding of the diversity \n     and contribution of the breadth of groups who have peopled \n     the United States; and\n       (2) to strengthen the ability of the National Park Service \n     to include groups and events otherwise not recognized in the \n     peopling of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 203.

Reserving the right to object, I have waited around this \nafternoon, this evening, to have an opportunity to direct a few \ncomments to the Senator from Alaska. I say to my friend from Alaska, I \nremember about a year ago at this time the Senator from Alaska gave me \nas a token of recognition a Tasmanian devil tie.\n  Now, coming from Senator Stevens, who has such a record in the \nSenate, that meant a lot to me. In celebration of our ending the \nsession today, I wore this tie. I say this because in all sincerity it \nmeant a lot to me when Senator Stevens gave me this tie. You have been \na role model for me since I came to Washington almost 20 years ago. You \nhave a record that is unsurpassed for doing good things for your State \nas well as being an effective leader. I have served with the Senator \nfrom Alaska my entire time in the Senate on the Appropriations \nCommittee, and I have admired the work done. I respected the tenacity \nshown, often for the people of the State of Alaska and other causes for \nwhich he believes.\n  I wish to publicly state how appreciative I am of this token, this \nhonor the Senator gave me.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am overwhelmed by that statement and my good friend. I \nnoticed the Tasmanian devil tie. I enjoy those ties, and I hope the \nSenator enjoys his. I certainly enjoy our association.\n  I served as whip for 8 years. I know the distinguished Senator from \nNevada\n\n[[Page S11941]]\n\nhas the same job I had. I was the minority whip for a while and the \nmajority whip for a while; he has, too, served in the capacity. We have \na great deal in common, and I am delighted to have him as a friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the previous request \nmade by the Senator from Alaska?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11941-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MEASURE READ FOR THE FIRST TIME--S. 3283\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate will today \ngive final approval to legislation I introduced to curb the \navailability of false identification via the Internet.\n  Let me thank my many colleagues in both the House and Senate for \ntheir hard work in moving this measure quickly through the legislative \nprocess. In particular, I appreciate the support and assistance of \nChairman Henry Hyde of the House Judiciary Committee, as well as the \nwork of Congressman Howard Coble, Congressman Howard Berman, \nCongressman John Conyers, and Congressman Bill McCollum. In addition to \ntheir efforts, I want to praise the strong support of Congressman Mark \nGreen, who introduced a similar bill in the House. Enactment of this \nbill would not have been possible without the consistent support of the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, as well as the \nassistance of Senators Kyl, Leahy, Feinstein, and Durbin.\n  The bill before the Senate today will make important improvements in \nour laws against the distribution and use of false identification. As I \nfound during a lengthy investigation of the availability of false \nidentification on the Internet, our current laws have done little to \nstop a growing Internet market in every imaginable type of false \nidentification. Whether via e-mail or from a Web site with a name such \nas thefakeidshop.com, everything from birth certificates, to Social \nSecurity cards, to driver's licenses, are being sold or traded through \nthe ease of cyberspace.\n  Testimony before the Subcommittee on Investigations demonstrated that \nthe availability of false identification documents from the Internet is \na growing problem. Special Agent David Myers, Identification Fraud \nCoordinator of the State of Florida's Division of Alcoholic Beverages \nand Tobacco, testified that two years ago only one percent of false \nidentification documents came from the Internet. Last year, he \ntestified, a little less than five percent came from the Internet. Now \nhe estimates that about 30 percent of the false identification \ndocuments he seizes comes from the Internet. He predicts that by next \nyear his unit will find at least 60 to 70 percent of the false \nidentification documents they seize will come from the Internet.\n  S. 2924 will put a stop to this widespread distribution of false \nidentification, which can be used to commit identity theft, to \nfacilitate serious financial crimes, and to facilitate the underage \npurchase of alcohol and tobacco. The new law will make clear that it is \na crime to transfer false identification documents by electronic\n\n[[Page S11942]]\n\nmeans, and that those documents can be in the form of computer files, \ndiscs, or templates.\n  I expect strong action by law enforcement agencies to enforce both \nthe existing provisions of title 18, section 1028, and the expanded \nauthority provided by this legislation. The intent of S. 2924 is simple \nand clear--to stop those who use the Internet to sell, distribute, or \nmake available false identification.\n  I am pleased that the new law will make it a crime to place false \nidentification, regardless of its format, on an on-line location. Thus, \nthe posting of such tools as scanned false identification documents or \ntemplates of state driver's licenses on Web sites will, without doubt, \nbe illegal.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that the House retained the provisions \nthat will establish a coordinating committee to concentrate resources \nof federal agencies on investigating and prosecuting the creation of \nfalse identification. This multi-agency effort should draw on the \nresources of several agencies to investigate and prosecute those who \nengage in the production and transfer of false identification of any \ntype. I urge the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Treasury to \ninvolve all agencies that can assist in curbing the use of false \nidentification.\n  The House also approved another important portion of the Senate \nbill--the elimination of a section of law that unfortunately allowed \ncriminals to manufacture, distribute, or sell counterfeit \nidentification documents by using easily removable disclaimers as part \nof an attempt to shield the illegal conduct from prosecution through a \nbogus claim of ``novelty.'' No longer will it be acceptable to provide \ncomputer templates of government-issued identification containing an \neasily removable layer saying that it is not a government document.\n  I thank my colleagues for their support of this important \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11942-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     COMPUTER CRIME ENFORCEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 2816.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is passing the \nComputer Crime Enforcement Act, which is now headed to President \nClinton for his signature into law. I introduced the Senate version of \nthis bill, S. 1314, on July 1, 1999, with Senator DeWine and is now \nalso co-sponsored by Senators Robb, Hatch and Abraham. This legislation \nalso passed the Senate as part of H.R. 46, the Public Safety Officer \nMedal of Valor Act. I thank my colleagues for their hard work on the \nComputer Crime Enforcement Act, especially Representative Matt Salmon, \nthe House sponsor.\n  The information age is filled with unlimited potential for good, but \nit also creates a variety of new challenges for law enforcement. A \nrecent survey by the FBI and the Computer Security Institute found that \n62 percent of information security professionals reported computer \nsecurity breaches in the past year. These breaches in computer security \nresulted in financial losses of more than $120 million from fraud, \ntheft of information, sabotage, computer viruses, and stolen laptops. \nComputer crime has become a multi-billion dollar problem.\n  The Computer Crime Enforcement Act is intended to help states and \nlocal agencies in fighting computer crime. All 50 states have now \nenacted tough computer crime control laws. They establish a firm \ngroundwork for electronic commerce, an increasingly important sector of \nthe nation's economy.\n  Unfortunately, too many state and local law enforcement agencies are \nstruggling to afford the high cost of enforcing their state computer \ncrime statutes.\n  Earlier this year, I released a survey on computer crime in Vermont. \nMy office surveyed 54 law enforcement agencies in Vermont--43 police \ndepartments and 11 State's attorney offices--on their experience \ninvestigating and prosecuting computer crimes. The survey found that \nmore than half of these Vermont law enforcement agencies encounter \ncomputer crime, with many police departments and state's attorney \noffices handling 2 to 5 computer crimes per month.\n  Despite this documented need, far too many law enforcement agencies \nin Vermont cannot afford the cost of policing against computer crimes. \nIndeed, my survey found that 98 percent of the responding Vermont law \nenforcement agencies do not have funds dedicated for use in computer \ncrime enforcement. My survey also found that few law enforcement \nofficers in Vermont are properly trained in investigating computer \ncrimes and analyzing cyber-evidence.\n  According to my survey, 83 percent of responding law enforcement \nagencies in Vermont do not employ officers properly trained in computer \ncrime investigative techniques. Moreover, my survey found that 52 \npercent of the law enforcement agencies that handle one or more \ncomputer crimes per month cited their lack of training as a problem \nencountered during investigations. Without the necessary education, \ntraining and technical support, our law enforcement officers are and \nwill continue to be hamstrung in their efforts to crack down on \ncomputer crimes.\n  I crafted the Computer Crime Enforcement Act, S. 1314, to address \nthis problem. The bill would authorize a $25 million Department of \nJustice grant program to help states prevent and prosecute computer \ncrime. Grants under our bipartisan bill may be used to provide \neducation, training, and enforcement programs for local law enforcement \nofficers and prosecutors in the rapidly growing field of computer \ncriminal justice. Our legislation has been endorsed by the Information \nTechnology Association of America and the Fraternal Order of Police. \nThis is an important bipartisan effort to provide our state and local \npartners in crime-fighting with the resources they need to address \ncomputer crime.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent the bill be read the third time \nand passed, the motion to reconsider be laid on the table, and any \nstatements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 2816) was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/15/senate-section/article/S11942-3", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THANKING OUR CREATOR\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.
