A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \nthe establishment of a homeland security academic centers for public \nhealth preparedness network; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill I call the \n``The Homefront Medical Preparedness Act.''\n  In the past century we have witnessed unprecedented advances in \nscience, technology and medicine and have seen limitless potential to \nimprove the human condition, cure disease, and advance human health in \nways that were once unimaginable. Yet, at the same time we have seen \nsome of these very advances have spawned new threats, threats that were \nsimply inconceivable 100 years ago. The recent outbreaks of anthrax in \nFlorida, New York City, and Washington, DC, coupled with the terrorist \nattack of September 11 have brought to light the compelling need to \nproperly prepare our communities for the threat of bioterrorists \nattacks.\n  A strong public-health infrastructure is the best defense against any \nbioterrorism attack. As a Nation we remain highly vulnerable, not \nbecause we are unprepared, but because we are under-prepared. The \nDepartment of Health and Human Services has made tremendous advances \nover the past few years. However, while significant progress has been \nmade, there are still large gaps in our current approach. Our goal must \nbe to eliminate these gaps and reduce the risk to our Nation and our \ncommunities. As a nation, we must prepare our communities, and improve \nour capacity to respond. Central to an effective response to a \nbioterrorist attack are detection, treatment and containment of a \ndisease epidemic and our Nation's public-health system is on the front \nline in this effort.\n  The Nation's public health system is a complex network of people, \nsystems, and organizations working at the local, State and national \nlevels. The Nation is served by more then 3,000 county and city health \ndepartments, more than 3,000 local boards of health, 59 State and \nterritorial-health departments, tribal-health departments more than \n160,000 public and private laboratories. Current estimates suggest that \nthe public-health workforce includes 500,000 professionals employed at \nthe local, State and national levels. According to the Health Resource \nand Services Administration in 1989 only 44 percent of these 500,000 \nworkers had formal, academic training in public health and those with \ngraduate public health degrees were an even smaller fraction. As of \n1997, 78 percent of local health departments executives did not have \ngraduate degrees in public health. Changes on the public health system \nhave brought new demands on the workforce and identified a need for \nadditional training and education. Many public-health workers do not \nhave the necessary skills and knowledge base to meet the needs of the \nemerging public-health system and public-health threats. These \nstatistics highlight the critical need to provide these professionals \nwith the most up-to-date training, technology, and tools necessary to \nmeet the increasing demands and emerging needs.\n  An important first step has already been taken. The Centers for \nDisease Control has created Centers for Public Health Preparedness \nacross the country. There are currently 14 centers total: 7 Academic \nCenters, 4 Speciality Centers, and 3 Local Exemplar Centers. The \nAcademic Centers link schools of public health, State and local-health \nagencies and other academic and community health partners to foster \nindividual preparedness on the front line. The Speciality Centers focus \non a topic, professional discipline, core public-health competency, \npractice setting or application of learning technology. And finally, \nthe Local Exemplar Centers develop advanced applications at the \ncommunity level in three areas of key importance to preparedness for \nbioterrorism and other urgent health threats: integrated communications \nand information systems across multiple sectors; advanced operational \nreadiness assessment; and comprehensive training and evaluation.\n\n  In Missouri we are fortunate to have not one, but two centers in St. \nLouis at St. Louis University School of Public Health: an Academic \nCenter the Heartland Center for Public Health Preparedness as well as a \nSpeciality Center The Center for the Study of Bioterrorism and Emerging \nThreats. The School of Public Health at St. Louis University has \nclearly been on the forefront of this issue. I was honored to have \nsecured Federal appropriations dollars necessary for startup costs for \nthe Center for the Study of Bioterrorism, the only specialty center \nwith a primary focus on bioterrorism in the country. The center \nprovides public-healthcare providers and healthcare facilities with the \ntools needed for preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation of \nintentional or naturally occurring outbreaks. Under the leadership of \nDr. Evans, the center has developed training curriculum that is being \nused nationwide to train healthcare providers and public-health \ndepartments. In fact, the center's training materials were used by the \nCDC to train emergency health personal, healthcare providers and other \npublic-health workers in New York to respond to the September 11 \nattack.\n  But more can and must be done. Today I introduced legislation which \nwill expand the national network of Centers of Public Health \nPreparedness by adding new centers across the country as well as \nfunneling more valuable resources to existing centers to meet urgent, \npublic-health training needs. This bill will authorize $50 million and \nwould instruct the Director of the Centers for Disease Control to \nestablish a\n\n[[Page S11942]]\n\nnational network of Centers for Public Health Preparedness utilizing \nthe existing Centers for Public Health Preparedness Program to train \nand to prepare the national public-health workforce, healthcare \nproviders and the general public to respond to bioterrorist threats.\n  Each center, housed at an accredited school of public health will 1. \nprovide training and education to local and state health department \nstaff, emergency first responders, and primary and acute care providers \non the best practices necessary to protect against, and respond to the \narray of potential threats facing the American public, including \nbioterrorism, infectious disease and weapons of mass destruction; 2. \nprovide information to healthcare [providers and other components of \nthe healthcare industry to protect against and respond to the threat of \nbioterrorism, infectious disease and weapons of mass destruction; and \n3. provide information and education on relevant bioterrorist threats \nto the public.\n  Under my legislation each center, both new and existing, will receive \nat least $1 million per year, but may receive additional sums per year \nif the CDC deems additional resources are necessary to carry out \nregional or national training activities at a particular center.\n  I believe that our schools of pubic health across the country, \nworking in conjunction with the CDC can provide training and education \nto local and State health department staff, emergency first responders, \nand primary and acute-care providers on the best practices necessary to \nprotect against, identify and respond to the wide array of potential \nthreats facing the American public, including bioterrorism, infectious \ndisease and weapons of mass destruction. The capacity and competency of \nour healthcare workforce is a critical component of the basic public-\nhealth infrastructure necessary to protect our communities. As with our \nmilitary, our public-health system must be prepared at all times to \nward off threats and respond to crises. Our national public-health \ninfrastructure is the first and in some cases the only line of defense. \nLike our military, our public-health system must be at a constant state \nof readiness nationwide and this legislation will enable our public \nhealth system to better achieve this goal. If the public-health system \nis fully prepared then communities across the country will be better \nprotected.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN:\n  S. 1706. A bill to provide for the enhanced control of biological \nagents and toxins; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, in May 1995, Larry Wayne Harris of Ohio \nordered three vials of the bacterium that causes bubonic plague to be \nFedEx'ed from a company in Rockville, MD. At the time, all he needed \nwas a credit card and letterhead. He invented both the letterhead and \nthe lab he claimed to be from. In fact he was a member of a white \nsupremacist group who would later tell of plans to kill hundreds of \nthousands of Americans with the plague. But when he was arrested with \nthe vials, he was only charged with mail fraud for misrepresenting \nhimself. No Federal license, registration, or even notification was \nrequired to obtain, own, or work with the plague.\n  Partly as a result of this incident, Congress in 1996 passed \nprovisions in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act to \nclose the specific loophole. This bill required the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services to regulate transfer of a select list of biological \nagents. But it did not regulate possession or use of the agents. The \nsubsequent regulations incorporated safety standards for labs receiving \nthese agents, but set virtually no security standards to make sure \nthese agents don't end in the wrong hands. They carved out broad \nexemptions, including all certified clinical laboratories. And they \nincluded little means of enforcement.\n  I think most Americans would be shocked to learn that we still have \nno idea who has anthrax, plague, or other biological agents in their \nfreezer. Labs have had to register only if they have sent or received \none of the agents since 1996. We know the recent attacks with anthrax \nused the so-called ``Ames'' strain of anthrax, which was identified at \nIowa State University some decades ago, but we don't know how many labs \nin the United States have samples of this strain today. If we had that \ninformation before the next attack, especially if a less common agent \nor strain were used, it could be the starting point for the next \ninvestigation.\n  We can and we must do better. We have long had relatively tight \ncontrols on materials that can be used in nuclear weapons. You must \nhave a license from the NRC or an agreement state to possess these \nnuclear materials. There are strict safety and security requirements on \nthe licensees, and a small army of inspectors to make sure they comply. \nLicensees must report all shipments and receipts, and report any losses \nfrom their inventory of a gram or more of the most dangerous materials. \nBioweapons have been called ``the poor man's nuclear bomb'' because \nthey could cause similar devastation, but are easier and cheaper to \nobtain. It's time we place reasonable controls on biological agents \ntoo.\n  That is why I am introducing the Bioweapons Control and Tracking Act \nof 2001. This bill would for the first time impose five important \ncontrols on dangerous biological agents and toxins to reduce the risk \nof an accident or terrorist attack. First, the bill would direct the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to regulate the possession and \nuse of select biological agents as well as their transfer.\n\n  Second, the regulations would require registration with the \nDepartment for possession, use, and transfer of select agents and \ntoxins. The registration would include known characterization of the \nagents, such as the strains, in order to facilitate their traceability. \nThe Department would be required to maintain a database of locations \nand characterizations of the agents using the registration information.\n  Third, the regulations would also have to include safeguards and \nsecurity standards, as well as safety standards. Labs would be required \nto restrict access to the agents to people who need to handle them. And \na process would be set up to screen people who do have access to the \nagents.\n  Fourth, the bill requires that any exemptions from these regulations \nbe consistent with public health and safety. Any exemptions from \nregistration requirements would have to still allow a complete database \nof agents of concern, but exemptions could be allowed either for a lab \nthat only temporarily possesses the agent or for samples that could not \nbe useful for making a weapon. These exemptions are intended to avoid \nan unnecessary burden on thousands of clinical labs that receive \ndiagnostic samples for testing and, if the test is positive for a \nselect agent, quickly pass the sample on to a government lab or destroy \nit.\n  Fifth, the bill includes strong enforcement measures. The bill \nspecifically authorizes inspections to ensure compliance. To give teeth \nto the enforcement, it enacts a civil penalty for violating the \nregulations of up to $250,000 for an individual of $500,000 for a \ngroup. And it enacts a criminal penalty up to 5 years in prison for \npossession or transfer of select agents by someone who is not \nregistered, and also for transfer to a person who is not registered.\n  In addition, the bill exempts information about specific labs from \ndisclosure under the Freedom of Information Act to prevent one-stop-\nshopping for information by would-be bioterrorists. It requires \nbiennial review of the list of biological agents and toxins of concern. \nAnd it codifies the law in Public Health Service Act, maintains current \nregulations until the Secretary issues new ones, and sets a deadline \nfor the registration and associated penalties.\n  I have been working with several of my colleagues on a $4 billion \npackage to strengthen our response to a possible bioterrorism attack, \nso that we can stop a terrible attack from becoming a national or world \ncalamity. We need these funds to strengthen the public health \ninfrastructure, monitor food safety, and build our capacity for \nvaccinations. But for just a few millions dollars we may be able to \nprevent an attack, to stop bioterrorists before they even get hold of \nthe necessary agents. We must no delay.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself and Ms. Landrieu):\n  S. 1708. A bill to amend the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and \nEmergency Assistance Act to ensure the\n\n[[Page S11943]]\n\ncontinuity of medical care following a major disaster by making private \nfor-profit medical facilities eligible for Federal disaster assistance; \nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Parity in \nEmergency Preparedness and Response Act of 2001. The horrific attacks \nof September 11 and subsequent anthrax exposures have focused our \nattention on the need to prepare and respond to emergencies, whether \nthey result from acts of nature or the misdeeds of man. The legislation \nI introduce today will correct a provision in current law that prevents \nmany hospitals from working with the Federal Government to prevent and \nrespond to disasters. When tragedy strikes, the most important \nconsideration shouldn't be a hospital's tax status, but rather its \nability to care for the injured.\n  In 1974, Congress enacted the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and \nEmergency Assistance Act, commonly referred to as the Stafford Act. \nThis important legislation helps States and communities plan for \nemergencies and take steps to minimize the damage inflicted by a \npotential disaster. Once a disaster strikes, the Stafford Act \nauthorizes the President to provide communities the resources they need \nto respond quickly and recover completely.\n  While the Stafford Act has helped countless communities respond to \ndisasters, it has one glaring shortcoming, it prohibits the President \nand Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, from offering assistance \nto hospitals that are owned or managed by private companies. As a \nresult, there are 36 hospitals in my home State of Kentucky which are \nineligible to receive Federal disaster mitigation and recovery funds.\n  I find it incomprehensible that the Federal Government would deny \nneeded disaster assistance to a county hospital, simply because of its \nownership, management structure, or tax status. Is a tornado any less \ndevastating in one community than another, simply because of a local \nhospital's tax status? Are they any less deserving of the Federal \nGovernment's support? I think not.\n  What I find most troubling about this disparity is that it \ndisproportionately affects rural communities, whose hospitals are \nfrequently owned by the community but operated by private companies. \nMany small towns and rural counties prefer this sort of relationship \nbecause it allows them to ensure their citizens have access to needed \nhealth care services, while relieving themselves of the burdens of \noperating a modern hospital. In the rural Kentucky communities of \nCaldwell, Cumberland, Crittenden, Fleming, Marshall, Monroe, Ohio and \nBell Counties, the community owns the hospital but contracts with a \nprivate management firm to direct the hospital's day to day operations. \nAs a result of this relationship, these publicly owned hospitals are \nnot eligible for Federal disaster mitigation or recovery assistance.\n  Hospitals are critical community resources which must be able to \nprovide services in an emergency, regardless of their ownership or \nmanagement structure. That is why I am proud to introduce the Parity in \nEmergency Preparedness and Response Act with my colleague from \nLouisiana, Ms. Landrieu. This legislation would eliminate the disparity \nwhich exists between nonprofit and investor-owned hospitals and allow \nall eligible hospitals to apply for disaster mitigation and recovery \nfunds. Our bill does not create an entitlement for hospitals that are \nowned or operated by private companies. The Stafford Act is clear in \nstating the President ``may make contributions'' to help damaged \nhospitals respond to and recover from an emergency, and this \nlegislation does nothing to diminish the President's discretion in this \nregard.\n  Since September 11, 2001, the need to ensure that our Nation's public \nhealth infrastructure is capable of responding to unanticipated \nemergencies has received renewed attention in Congress. In fact, the \nSenate will soon consider comprehensive legislation to address the \ngrowing threat of bioterrorism and protect the safety of our food \nsupply. While I strongly support the intent of this legislation, it \nwill be woefully incomplete if it does not allow all hospitals, \nincluding investor-owned hospitals, to apply for disaster assistance.\n  Hospitals play a vital role in responding to emergencies, regardless \nof their management structure. I look forward to working with Ms. \nLandrieu and our colleagues in the Senate to pass this legislation and \nensure that all of America's hospitals are prepared to respond to \ndisasters.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of hospitals which would become \neligible for disaster assistance under my legislation be printed in the \nRecord, and I ask unanimous consent the text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1708\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to designate the James Peak Wilderness and the James \nPeak Protection Area in the State of Colorado, and for other purposes; \nto the\n\n[[Page S11944]]\n\nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the ``James Peak \nWilderness and Protection Area Act.'' This language is the product of \nyears of detailed negotiations regarding an area of great majesty in my \nhome State of Colorado.\n  When discussing public lands issues, the potential uses for land are \nas varied and numerous as the diverse groups of users. Oftentimes, one \ncamp is pitted against another, each convinced that its view is right \nto the point that it necessarily excludes the other interested party. \nAnd the result is that nothing viable happens. No land is protected and \nno uses of land are preserved. Instead, we read of angry exchanges, \nthat if it were not for one side being so stubborn in its view, then we \nwould have had a bill, while ignoring their own immobile position.\n  This bill, I am very proud to say, is different from the all-too-\ncommon discourse that I described.\n  This bill stands as a testament to what can be achieved when \ninterested parties stop for a moment and listen to each other. I would \nlike to take this moment to commend the work of my friends in the \nHouse, Representatives Udall and McInnis for their efforts on this \nissue.\n  The ``James Peak Wilderness and Protection Area Act'' respects the \ndiverse uses of Colorado's lands and recognizes those differences \naccordingly. This bill designates about 14,000 acres in Boulder, Clear \nCreek, and Gilpin Counties as Wilderness, and enlarges the existing \nIndian Peaks Wilderness by an additional 3,195 acres. Further, this \ncarefully balanced approach designates 16,000 acres of national forest \nland as the ``James Peak Protection Area.'' The Protection Area in \nGrand County would disallow development of the land, but would permit \nrecreational use for the public's continued enjoyment.\n  I am pleased with the careful compromises that were necessary in \ncrafting this bill and proudly introduce it today. I only wish this \nkind of cooperation was more evident in the other discussions about \npublic lands in America.\n  I hope for quick passage of this important bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1711\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the procedures that apply to consideration \nof interstate class actions to assure fairer outcomes for class members \nand defendants, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Class \nAction Fairness Act of 2001.'' I am pleased to be joined by Senators \nKohl, Hatch, Carper, Thurmond, Chafee and Specter. The Class Action \nFairness Act of 2001 will help curb class action lawsuit abuses and \nprotect consumers who find themselves as potential members of class \naction lawsuits. At the same time, the bill will preserve class action \nlawsuits as an important tool that brings representation to the \nunrepresented.\n  In the last Congress, Senator Kohl and I introduced S. 353, the \n``Class Action Fairness Act of 1999.'' We worked diligently and in good \nfaith to address concerns expressed by members of the Judiciary \nCommittee, as well as others interested in this issue. The Judiciary \nCommittee marked up and favorably voted out a Hatch/Grassley/Kohl \namendment in the nature of a substitute. Unfortunately, S. 353 was not \nconsidered by the full Senate in the 106th Congress because of the \npress of other legislative business.\n  Today, we are introducing the bill that the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee agreed to in the last Congress, with minor modifications. We \nhave also included a few more provisions that will better protect class \nmembers. I am hopeful that in this Congress, the Senate will consider \nthis bill promptly and enact the much needed changes to the current \nsystem.\n  Presently, the class action system is awash with problems. More and \nmore class action lawsuits are being filed to the benefit of attorneys, \nwhere attorneys agree to settlements that give them huge fees while \ntheir clients get little of value or nothing. A 1999 Rand Report on \nclass actions found that state courts often give most of the money in a \nsettlement to the lawyers, not the class members they supposedly \nrepresent. The Judiciary Committee held hearings where we heard about \nsettlement after settlement where class members got coupons or nothing, \nbut the lawyers got millions of dollars in attorneys' fees. We heard \nabout class members being awarded restrictive coupons for airline \ntickets, as well as class members who received a lawyers' bill that was \nhigher than the compensation for their injury. But the lawyers got all \nthe money in fees.\n  Is this fair? I thought the lawyers were supposed to represent their \nclients, not themselves. I am not saying that attorneys should not be \npaid for their work, but it seems to me that lawyers have found class \nactions to be an easy way for them to make money.\n  The Judiciary Committee also heard that lawyers game the class action \nrules to keep class actions in certain State courts, particularly \ncourts that are quick to certify a class without adequately considering \nthe interests of all class members or courts that aren't careful in \nevaluating whether the proposed class meets the required class \ncriteria. Those State courts are also more likely to rubber-stamp \nsettlement proposals without scrutinizing them for fairness. For \nexample, we learned that in some cases members of a class that lived \ncloser to the courthouse in which the settlement was filed got a larger \nrecovery than others. We also learned about settlements where a bounty \nwas paid to class representatives which was disproportionately larger \nthan that provided to absent class members.\n  It's easy for lawyers to forum-shop and keep these cases in State \ncourt, for example, attorneys name irrelevant parties to their class \naction suits in an effort to destroy diversity. Attorneys make \ninaccurate statements about the jurisdictional amount to keep the \ndefendant from transferring the case to Federal court, but then retract \nthem one year later when removal is barred. In addition, similar class \nactions are filed in many State courts and cannot be consolidated, \nincreasing the chances for collusive settlements or situations where \nthere is a ``race to settlement'' by the attorneys. This also creates \nsignificant inefficiencies and waste of court resources.\n  A much more troublesome effect of this problem is the fact that State \ncourts are making decisions for the entire country. The 1999 Rand Study \nand a more recent study by the Manhattan Institute found that most of \nthe increase in class action lawsuits is occurring in State courts. \nWith this happening, basically State courts are dictating national \npolicy. Class actions are usually the cases that involve the most \npeople, the most money, and the most interstate commerce issues. But it \nis clear that these cases really belong in Federal court. And there is \na constitutional basis for this. Article 3, section 2 of the \nConstitution states that controversies between citizens of different \nStates should be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal courts. \nHowever, the present Federal jurisdiction statutes were originally \nenacted over a century ago, so they do not take the modern day class \naction into account and basically exclude them from the Federal court \nsystem.\n  Consequently, the current system produces aberrant results as to what \ncan or cannot proceed in Federal court. For example, right now, a slip \nand fall case worth $75,001 involving two residents from different \nStates can be heard in Federal court. But a nationwide class action \nthat involves millions of citizens residing in all 50 States, that \nseeks billions of dollars in damages, implicates the laws of every \nState, and involves interstate commerce issues, is mainly confined to \nthe State courts. Why should a State county court with an elected judge \ndecide these cases, but not a Federal judge?\n  By only allowing State courts to hear nationwide class actions, State \ncourts can dictate national policy or improperly impose their State's \nlaws on the citizens of other States. Let me illustrate this serious \nproblem with the State Farm case. In a large class action case brought \nagainst State Farm on the issue of auto insurers' use of \n``aftermarket'' auto parts in automobile repairs, an Illinois court \napplied Illinois auto insurance law to the other 49 States. Several \nState attorneys general intervened in the case and expressed their \nopposition to the court's application of Illinois law to their \ncitizens. The National Association of State Insurance Commissioners and \nPublic Citizen also expressed concern over the outcome of this case. \nThe reason for this opposition was because State laws and policy on the \nuse of aftermarket parts varies widely State by State, yet the Illinois \nState court imposed its auto insurance laws on the other States. The \nability of a State court to have such a monumental impact on the laws \nof other States, by basically overturning national policy and the laws \nor regulations of the other 50 States is more than troubling.\n  So, there are compelling reasons for us to take remedial steps \nregarding the class action system. The Class Action Fairness Act of \n2001 takes a good first step at addressing some of the problems we have \nidentified. To address the problem of class members not knowing\n\n[[Page S11947]]\n\nwhat is going on in a class action or settlement, or not being clear as \nto what their rights are, the Class Action Fairness Act of 2001 has a \nprovision that notice to class members needs to contain an explanation \nof their rights and other matters concerning settlement terms, \nincluding attorneys' fees, in a plain and easy to understand language.\n  To address the problem where class members get nothing and attorneys \nget millions, the Class Action Fairness Act of 2001 provides that \nnotification of any proposed settlements must be given to the State \nattorneys general or the primary regulatory or licensing agency of any \nState whose citizens are involved. This is so that the State attorney \ngeneral or responsible agency can intervene in the case to ensure that \nsettlements are fair. To address the problem of special bounties that \nunfairly impact the absent members of a class, the bill contains a new \nprovision that would prohibit the payment of bounties to class \nrepresentatives that are disproportionately larger than that provided \nto absent class members. To address the problem of discrimination \nbetween class members based on geographic location, the bill contains a \nnew provision that prohibits courts from approving settlements that \naward some class members a larger recovery than others based on \ngeography.\n  To start responding to the issue of outrageous attorneys fees, the \nClass Action Fairness Act of 2001 asks the Judicial Conference to \nreport back to Congress in a year after studying attorneys' fees in \nclass actions and how judges can do a better job in making sure that \nclass action settlements are fair. The bill also includes new \nprovisions that protect class members against net losses and require \nthe courts to make specific findings as to the fairness of coupon and \nother non-cash class action settlements.\n  To respond to the problem where plaintiff lawyers game the system to \nimproperly keep class action cases in State court, or where similar \nclass action suits are being filed in different State courts, or where \nState courts are imposing their laws on citizens of other States and \nformulating national policy, the Class Action Fairness Act of 2001 \nloosens diversity and removal requirements so that class action cases \nwith national ramifications can be heard in Federal courts and similar \nclass actions can be consolidated. The bill is crafted so that it will \nnot harm federalism or deprive State courts of their ability to \nadjudicate cases for their own citizens. That is because there is a \nconstitutional basis for class actions to proceed in Federal court. \nClearly, the Federal courts are a better forum for these kinds of cases \nthat are of nationwide importance.\n  In conclusion, there is substantial evidence that class action abuse \nis going on and we should do something about it. I think that the Class \nAction Fairness Act of 2001 is a good, balanced bill that addresses \nsome of the problems that we've identified. Moreover, there has been a \nlot of compromise to address concerns about the bill. We have also \nimproved the bill by adding additional consumer protections. So, the \nClass Action Fairness Act of 2001 will preserve the class action \nprocess, but put a stop to the more egregious abuses in the system.\n  In addition, I'd like to thank my friend Senator Kohl, who has worked \nso closely with me over the years in bringing the issue of class action \nabuse to the forefront. We both share a deep concern over protecting \nthe rights of consumers, while making sure that the due process rights \nof all litigants are preserved. I'd also like to thank Senator Hatch, \nwho worked with us to move this bill forward in the Judiciary Committee \nlast year, and worked on improvements to the bill.\n  I urge all my colleagues to join Senators Kohl, Hatch, Carper, \nThurmond, Chafee and Specter in supporting this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1712\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Class action lawsuits are an important and valuable \n     part of the legal system when they permit the fair and \n     efficient resolution of legitimate claims of numerous parties \n     by allowing the claims to be aggregated into a single action \n     against a defendant that has allegedly caused harm.\n       (2) Over the past decade, there have been abuses of the \n     class action device that have--\n       (A) harmed class members with legitimate claims and \n     defendants that have acted responsibly; and\n       (B) undermined public respect for our judicial system.\n       (3) Class members often receive little or no benefit from \n     class actions, and are sometimes harmed, such as where--\n       (A) counsel are awarded large fees, while leaving class \n     members with coupons or other awards of little or no value;\n       (B) unjustified awards are made to certain plaintiffs at \n     the expense of other class members; and\n       (C) confusing notices are published that prevent class \n     members from being able to fully understand and effectively \n     exercise their rights.\n       (4) Abuses in class actions undermine the national judicial \n     system and the concept of diversity jurisdiction as intended \n     by the framers of the United States Constitution, in that \n     State and local courts are--\n       (A) keeping cases of national importance out of Federal \n     court;\n       (B) sometimes acting in ways that demonstrate bias against \n     out-of-State defendants; and\n       (C) making judgments that impose their view of the law on \n     other States and bind the rights of the residents of those \n     States.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n       (1) assure fair and prompt recoveries for class members \n     with legitimate claims;\n       (2) restore the intent of the framers of the United States \n     Constitution by providing for Federal court consideration of \n     interstate cases of national importance under diversity \n     jurisdiction; and\n       (3) benefit society by encouraging innovation and lowering \n     consumer prices.\n\n      SEC. 3.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The amendments made by this Act shall apply to any civil \n     action commenced on or after the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senators Grassley, \nHatch, Carper, and Thurmond in introducing the Class Action Fairness \nAct of 2001. This legislation addresses the growing problems in class \naction litigation, particularly unfair and abusive settlements that \nshortchange plaintiff class members.\n  We have worked together on this legislation in past Congresses. In \nfact, last year a similar version of class action reform passed the \nHouse of Representatives and was approved by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. Unfortunately, the session ended before we could bring it to \na vote of the full Senate.\n  The problem that this bill addresses is simple. Too often, the class \naction procedure is being hijacked by unscrupulous parties who are more \ninterested in making a dollar for themselves than helping the plaintiff \nclass members remedy a legitimate harm. Let me give you just one well \nknown example of the unfairness this bill attempts to correct.\n  A few years ago, a class action lawsuit was begun against the Bank of \nBoston. Martha Preston from Baraboo, WI was an unnamed class member of \nthat suit against her mortgage company. The case involved allegations \nthat the bank had overcharged its mortgage customers and had kept \nexcess money in their escrow accounts. It was ultimately settled. Ms. \nPreston was represented by a group of plaintiffs' lawyers who she had \nnever met. The settlement they negotiated for her was a bad joke. She \nreceived four dollars and change in the lawsuit, while her attorneys \npocketed $8 million in fees.\n  Soon after receiving her four dollars, Ms. Preston discovered that \nher lawyers helped pay for their fees by taking $80 from her escrow \naccount. Naturally shocked, she and the other plaintiffs sued the \nlawyers who in turn sued her in Alabama, a State she had never visited, \nfor $25 million. Not only was she $75 poorer for her class action \nexperience, but she also had to defend herself against a $25 million \nsuit by the very people who took advantage of her in the first place.\n  In response to this case and many more like it, we developed a \nmeasured, reasoned response to protect class action plaintiffs against \na system which is subject to abuse. As in past years, the bill can be \ndivided into three main sections, all of which provide enhanced \nprotections for individual plaintiffs.\n  First, the bill provides that every class action notice be written in \nplain, easily understandable English. Too many of the class action \nnotices are written in legalese, designed to make it impossible for the \naverage American to comprehend his rights and responsibilities as a \nmember of the plaintiff class. The bill requires that a statement be \nincluded at the beginning of the notice written in large, bold type \nalerting the plaintiff that he is involved in a class action lawsuit \nand that his legal rights are affected by the contents of the notice. \nThis means that every class member will understand the subject matter \nof the case and his rights and responsibilities as a participant in the \nlawsuit.\n\n  Further, if the case were settled, the notice to the class members \nwould clearly describe the terms of the settlement, the benefits to \neach plaintiff and a summary of the attorneys fees in the case and how \nthey were calculated. Currently, none of this information is clearly \ncommunicated to the class members.\n  Second, the bill requires that notice be given to State Attorneys \nGeneral or the appropriate State regulatory authorities about proposed \nclass settlements in Federal court which affect their constituents. \nThis encourages a neutral third party to weigh in on whether a \nsettlement is fair and to alert the court if they do not believe that \nit is. The Attorney General review is an extra layer of security for \nthe plaintiffs and is designed to ensure that abusive settlements are \nnot approved without a critical review by one or more experts.\n  Third, the bill makes it easier to move State class action cases to \nFederal court by changing the diversity rules governing these actions. \nClass action cases often have national implications and are joined by \nplaintiffs from many, if not most, States. Currently, class actions are \nfrequently heard by a State court judge in a venue chosen by the \nplaintiffs' attorneys to maximize the chance that the class action will \nbe certified.\n  For class actions, the certification process is usually more than \nhalf the battle. Once a set of plaintiffs succeeds in getting a judge \nto certify them as a class, the defendants are often faced with \nextraordinary costs associated with preparing for trial and dealing \nwith a multitude of plaintiffs. So, the defendants settle the case at \nterms beneficial to the plaintiffs' attorneys, often at the expense of \nthe plaintiffs themselves.\n  A recent study on the class action problem by the Manhattan Institute \ndemonstrates that class action cases are being brought \ndisproportionately in a few counties where plaintiffs expect to be able \nto take advantage of lax certification rules.\n  The study focused on three county courts, Madison County, IL; \nJefferson County, TX; and Palm Beach County, FL, that have seen a steep \nrise in class action filings over the last several years that seems \ndisproportional to their populations. They found that rural Madison \nCounty, IL ranked third nationwide, after Los Angeles County, \nCalifornia and Cook County, Illinois, in the estimated number of class \nactions filed each year, whereas rural Jefferson County and Palm Beach \nCounty ranked eighth and ninth, respectively. As plaintiff attorneys \nfound that Madison County was a welcoming host, the number of class \naction suits filed there rose 1850 percent between 1998 and 2000.\n  Another trend evident in the research was the use of ``cut-and-\npaste'' complaints in which plaintiffs' attorneys file a number of \nsuits against different defendants in the same industry challenging \nstandard industry practices. For example, within a one-week period \nearly this year, six law firms filed nine nearly identical class \nactions in Madison County alleging that the automobile insurance \nindustry is defrauding Americans in the way that they calculate claims \nrates for totaled vehicles.\n\n  The system is not working as intended and needs to be fixed. The way \nto fix it is to move more of these cases currently being brought in \nsmall state courts like Madison County, IL to Federal court.\n  The Federal courts are better venues for class actions for a variety \nof reasons articulated clearly in a RAND study. RAND proposed three \nprimary explanations why these cases should be in federal court. \n``First, Federal judges scrutinize class action allegations more \nstrictly than State judges, and deny certification in situations where \na State judge might grant it improperly. Second, State judges may not \nhave adequate resources to oversee and manage class actions with a \nnational scope. Finally, if a single judge is to be charged with \ndeciding what law will apply in a multistate class action, it is more \nappropriate that this take place in federal court than in State \ncourt.''\n  We all know that class actions can result in significant and \nimportant benefits for class members and society, and that most class \nlawyers and most state courts are acting responsibly. Class actions \nhave been used to desegregate racially divided schools, to obtain \nredress for victims of employment discrimination, and to compensate \nindividuals exposed to toxic chemicals or defective products. Class \nactions increase access to our civil justice system because they enable \npeople to pursue claims that collectively would otherwise be too \nexpensive to litigate.\n  The difficulty in any effort to improve a basically good system is \nweeding out the abuses without causing undue damage. The legislation we \npropose attempts to do this.\n  Let me emphasize the limited scope of this legislation. We do not \nclose the\n\n[[Page S11951]]\n\ncourthouse door to any class action. We do not require that State \nattorneys general do anything with the notice they receive. We do not \ndeny reasonable fees for class lawyers. And we do not mandate that \nevery class action be brought in Federal court. Instead, we simply \npromote closer and fairer scrutiny of class actions and class \nsettlements.\n  Right now, people across the country can be dragged into lawsuits \nunaware of their rights and unarmed on the legal battlefield. What our \nbill does is give back to regular people their rights and \nrepresentation. This measure may not stop all abuses, but it moves us \nforward. It will help ensure that unsuspecting people like Martha \nPreston don't get ripped off.\n  We believe this is a moderate approach to correct the worst abuses, \nwhile preserving the benefits of class actions. It is both pro-consumer \nand pro-defendant. We believe it will make a difference.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, there is little doubt that serious problems \nexist within our Nation's judicial system, especially in the way that \ninterstate class action lawsuits are handled and administered in local \ncourtrooms across this country. Increasingly, parties to class actions \nhave taken to forum shopping to pick sympathetic local courts where, \nmore and more often, plaintiffs are offered coupon settlements and \nlawyers are awarded enormous fees.\n  According to recent studies, while Federal class action filings over \nthe past 10 years have increased over 300 percent, class action filings \nin State courts have increased over 1,000 percent. However, interstate \nclass actions involve more citizens in more States, more money, and \nmore interstate commerce ramifications than any other type of civil \nlitigation. They are the paradigm of what our Framers envisioned when \nthey invented Federal diversity jurisdiction, as reflected in Article \nIII of the Constitution. These State court statistics are even more \ntroubling in light of the fact that many State courts have crushing \ncaseloads and far fewer resources available to them than their Federal \ncounterparts to manage these important and complex cases.\n  The primary reason that interstate class actions have remained in \nState court despite their complex nature is because it is relatively \neasy for plaintiffs' class attorneys to defeat both the statutory \n``complete diversity'' requirement by adding non-diverse parties and \nthe $75,000 ``amount in controversy'' requirement by aggregating \nindividual claims to be less than this amount. Interestingly, the \n``complete diversity'' requirement was adopted by Congress in the late \n1700s, well before the development of modern class action lawsuits.\n  Simply put, the Class Action Fairness Act would allow Federal courts \nto adjudicate class actions where the collective amount in controversy \nis more than $2 million, and where any member of the class of \nplaintiffs is from a different State than any defendant. This means \nthat many State class actions may be removed to Federal court. \nNonetheless, the bill does not extend Federal jurisdiction to encompass \nintrastate class actions, where the claims are governed primarily by \nthe laws of the State in which the case is filed and the majority of \nthe plaintiffs and the primary defendants are citizens of that State. \nSo there is no federalism issue here. All the bill does is to protect \nconstitutionally mandated diversity jurisdiction--``suits between \nCitizens of different States.''\n  I am aware that there are those that say that the bill would \n``flood'' Federal courts. But, again, according to Article III of the \nConstitution and our Founding fathers, these cases belong in Federal \ncourt. Critics making the judicial overload argument also ignore the \nfact that this bill does not require that interstate class actions be \nheard in Federal courts. It simply provides the option for either side. \nIn jurisdictions where the State courts provide a relatively level \nplaying field, there is no reason to believe that all class actions \nwill be removed to Federal court.\n  I should also point out that this bill would not prohibit any class \naction from being filed. It is merely a process or procedural bill. It \nsimply determines the court in which interstate class actions with \nsignificant national implications should be adjudicated--that is, in \nFederal court.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt this common-sense legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL:\n  S. 1714.

A bill to improve the ability of the United States to \nprepare for and respond to a biological threat or attack; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Kennedy, and a number of our colleagues to introduce \nvitally important legislation, the ``Bioterrorism Preparedness Act of \n2001.'' This bipartisan bill, which represents the very best effort of \na number of our colleagues in the Senate, responds to the threat of \nbioterrorism by focusing our Nation's efforts to prevent, prepare for \nand respond to any future bioterrorist attacks.\n  Events of recent weeks have made clear the danger we currently face. \nIn the aftermath of the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center \nand Pentagon, terrorists have used the mail to deliver anthrax to \ncommunities across America. In doing so, they have also spread fear \nacross our great nation and have underscored the threats that \nbioterrorism poses. If they had employed a more sophisticated delivery \nmechanism, or weaponized smallpox or another communicable virus, our \nhealth care system may have been overwhelmed.\n  Last year, Congress enacted bipartisan legislation to revitalize our \npublic health defenses at the local, State and national levels. The \nFrist-Kennedy ``Public Health Threats and Emergencies Act of 2000'' \nauthorized a series of important initiatives to strengthen the Nation's \npublic health system, improve hospital response capabilities, upgrade \nthe rapid identification and early warning systems at the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, CDC, improve the training of health \nprofessionals to diagnose and care for victims of bioterrorism, enhance \nour research and development capabilities, and take additional steps \nnecessary to prevent, prepare for and respond to biological attacks.\n  Today's legislation, the ``Bioterrorism Preparedness Act of 2001,''\n\n[[Page S11952]]\n\nbuilds on the foundation laid by the Public Health Threats Act, a \nfoundation built on prevention, preparedness, and response.\n  The ``Bioterrorism Preparedness Act'' takes a number of steps to \nprepare our Nation for these threats. It includes important measures to \nimprove our health system's capacity to respond to bioterrorism, \nprotect the Nation's food supply, speed the development and production \nof vaccines and other countermeasures, enhance coordination of \ngovernment agencies responsible for preparing for and responding to \nbioterrorism and increase our investment in fighting bioterrorism at \nthe local, State, and national levels.\n  The bill authorizes roughly $3.2 billion in fiscal year 2002 \nemergency funding toward these critical activities. I believe it is \nimportant that this funding be considered in the context of the \nexisting agreement limiting overall appropriations this year to $686 \nbillion in addition to the $40 billion emergency supplemental \nappropriations bill. I will work very hard to ensure that \nthe priorities outlined in this authorization legislation are included \nwithin this framework.\n\n  The ``Bioterrorism Preparedness Act of 2001'' is a comprehensive bill \nthat takes a major step toward better preparing our nation to respond \nto the special challenges posed by biological weapons. We have worked \ndiligently with many of our colleagues and the administration over the \nseveral weeks, and I believe that the product of those efforts \nrepresents a strong bill that includes some of the best ideas of both \nRepublicans and Democrats.\n  I know the bill is stronger due to the input of so many of our \ncolleagues and the leadership and guidance of the administration, and I \nwould like to thank several of my colleagues for their efforts. \nSpecifically, I would like to thank Senator Collins for her \ncontributions regarding food safety and the appropriate emphasis on \nchildren, Senator Hutchinson for his assistance with the provisions \nrelated to vaccine development and production, Senator Roberts and \nMajority Leader Daschle for their contributions to this bill in the \narea of agricultural safety, and many of our other colleagues who \ncontributed in a bipartisan way--Senators Gregg, Hagel, DeWine, Hatch, \nMikulski, Dodd, and Clinton.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to see that this \nimportant legislation becomes law this year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill be printed in the \nRecords.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Summary--The Bioterrorism Preparedness Act of 2001\n\n       The ``Bioterrorism Preparedness Act of 2001'' is designed \n     to address gaps in our nation's biodefense and surveillance \n     system and our public health infrastructure. This new \n     legislation builds on the foundation laid by the ``Public \n     Health Threats and Emergencies Act of 2000'' by authorizing \n     additional measures to improve our health system's capacity \n     to respond to bioterrorism, protect the nation's food supply, \n     speed the development and production of vaccines and other \n     countermeasures, enhance coordination of federal activities \n     on bioterrorism, and increase our investment in fighting \n     bioterrorism at the local, state, and national levels. The \n     legislation would authorize approximately $3.2 billion in \n     funding for Fiscal Year 2002 (and such sums in years \n     thereafter) toward these activities.\n\n\n         Title I--National Goals for Bioterrorism Preparedness\n\n       Title I of the ``Bioterrorism Preparedness Act'' states \n     that ``the United States should further develop and implement \n     a coordinated strategy to prevent and, if necessary, to \n     respond to biological threats or attacks.'' It further states \n     that it is the goal of Congress that this strategy should: \n     (1) provide federal assistance to state and local governments \n     in the event of a biological attack; (2) improve public \n     health, hospital, laboratory, communications, and emergency \n     response preparedness and responsiveness at the state and \n     local levels; (3) rapidly develop and manufacture needed \n     therapies, vaccines, and medical supplies; and (4) enhance \n     the safety of the nation's food supply and protect its \n     agriculture from biological threats and attacks.\n\n\n        Title II--Improving the Federal Response to Bioterrorism\n\n       Title II requires the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services (HHS) to report to Congress within one year of \n     enactment, and biennially thereafter, on progress made toward \n     meeting the objectives of the Act. It provides statutory \n     authorization for the strategic national pharmaceutical \n     stockpile, provides additional resources to the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to carry out education \n     and training initiatives and to improve the nation's federal \n     laboratory capacity, and establishes a National Disaster \n     Medical Response System of volunteers to respond, at the \n     Secretary's direction, respond to national public health \n     emergencies (with full liability protection, re-employment \n     rights, and other worker protections for such volunteers \n     similar to those currently provided to those who join the \n     National Guard).\n       The bill further amends and clarifies the procedures for \n     declaring a national public health emergency and expands the \n     authority of the Secretary during the emergency period. In \n     declaring such an emergency, the Secretary must notify \n     Congress within 48 hours. Such emergency period may not be \n     longer than 180 days, unless the Secretary determines \n     otherwise and notifies Congress of such determination. During \n     that emergency period, the Secretary may waive certain data \n     submittal and reporting deadlines.\n       A recent report by the General Accounting Office raised \n     concerns about the lack of coordination of federal anti-\n     bioterrorism efforts. Therefore, the bill contains a number \n     of measures to enhance coordination and cooperation among \n     various federal agencies. Title II establishes an Assistant \n     Secretary for Emergency Preparedness at HHS to coordinate all \n     functions within the Department relating to emergency \n     preparedness, including preparing for and responding to \n     biological threats and attacks.\n       Title II also creates an interdepartmental Working Group on \n     Bioterrorism that includes the Secretaries of HHS, Defense, \n     Veteran's Affairs, Labor, and Agriculture, the Director of \n     the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Attorney General \n     of the United States, and other appropriate federal \n     officials. The Working Group consolidates and streamlines the \n     functions of two existing working groups first established \n     under the ``Public Health Threats and Emergencies Act of \n     2000.'' It is responsible for coordinating the development of \n     bioterrorism countermeasures, research on pathogens likely to \n     be used in a biological attack, shared standards for \n     equipment to detect and protect against from biological \n     pathogens, national preparedness and response for biological \n     threats or attacks, and other matters.\n       Title II also establishes two advisory committees to the \n     Secretary. The National Task Force on Children and Terrorism \n     will report on measures necessary to ensure that the health \n     needs of children are met in preparing for and responding to \n     any potential biological attack or event. The Emergency \n     Public Information and Communications Task Force will report \n     on appropriate ways to communicate to the public information \n     regarding bioterrorism. Both of these committees sunset after \n     one year.\n       The title also contains a Congressional recommendation that \n     there be established an official federal internet website on \n     bioterrorism to provide information to the public, health \n     professionals, and others on matters relevant to \n     bioterrorism. The title further requires that states have a \n     coordinated plan for providing information relevant to \n     bioterrorism to the public.\n       Additionally, Title II helps the federal government better \n     track and control biological agents and toxins. The Secretary \n     of HHS is required to review and update a list of biological \n     agents and toxins that could pose a severe threat to public \n     health and safety and to enhance regulations regarding the \n     possession, use, and transfer of such agents or toxins. \n     Violations of these regulations could trigger civil penalties \n     of up to $500,000, and criminal sanctions may be imposed. \n     Existing law already regulates the transfer of these \n     pathogens.\n\n\n     title iii--improving state and local preparedness capabilities\n\n       Numerous reports in recent years have found the nation's \n     public health infrastructure lacking in its ability to \n     respond to biological threats or other emergencies. For \n     example, nearly 20 percent of local public health departments \n     have no e-mail capability, and fewer than half have high-\n     speed Internet or broadcast facsimile transmission \n     capabilities. Before September 11, only one in five U.S. \n     hospitals had bioterrorism preparedness plans in place.\n       Title III addresses this situation by including several \n     enhanced grant programs to improve state and local public \n     health preparedness. In addition to converting the current \n     public health core capacity grants established under the \n     ``Public Health Threats and Emergencies Act of 2000'' to non-\n     competitive grants, the bill replaces the current 319F \n     competitive bioterrorism grant with a new state bioterrorism \n     emergency program that provides resources to states based on \n     population and that would guarantee each state a minimum \n     level of funding for preparedness activities. States must \n     develop bioterrorism preparedness plans to be eligible for \n     such funding. Activities funded under this grant include \n     conducting an assessment of core public health capacities, \n     achieving the core public health capacities, and fulfilling \n     the bioterrorism preparedness plan. This program would only \n     be authorized for two years.\n       The bill also establishes a new grant program for hospitals \n     that are part of consortia with public health agencies, and \n     counties or cities. To be eligible for the grant, the \n     hospital's grant proposal must be consistent with their \n     state's bioterrorism preparedness plan. Using these grants, \n     hospitals with acquire the capacity to serve as regional \n     resources during a bioterrorist attack. This program is \n     authorized for five years.\n\n[[Page S11953]]\n\n      title iv--developing new countermeasure against bioterrorism\n\n       To better respond to bioterrorism, Title IV expands our \n     nation's stockpile of smallpox vaccine and critical \n     pharmaceuticals and devices. The bill also expands research \n     on biological agents and toxins, as well as new treatments \n     and vaccines for such agents and toxins.\n       Since the effectiveness of vaccines, drugs, and \n     therapeutics for many biological agents and toxins often may \n     not ethically be tested in humans, Title IV ensures that the \n     Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will finalize by a date \n     certain its rule regarding the approval of new \n     countermeasures on the basis of animal data. Priority \n     countermeasures will also be given enhanced consideration for \n     expedited review by the FDA.\n       Because of the lack of or limitations on a market for \n     vaccines for these agents and toxins, Title IV gives the \n     Secretary of HHS authority to enter into long-term contracts \n     with sponsors to ``guarantee'' that the government will \n     purchase a certain quantity of a vaccine at a certain price. \n     The government has the authority, through an existing \n     Executive Order, to ensure that sponsors through these \n     contracts will be indemnified by the government for the \n     development, manufacture and use of the product as prescribed \n     in the contract.\n       Title IV also provides a limited antitrust exemption to \n     allow potential sponsors to discuss and agree upon how to \n     develop, manufacture, and produce new countermeasures, \n     including vaccines, and drugs. Federal Trade Commission and \n     the Department of Justice approval of such agreements is \n     required to ensure such agreements are not anti-competitive.\n\n\n              Title V--PROTECTING OUR NATION'S FOOD SUPPLY\n\n       With 57,000 establishments under its jurisdiction and only \n     700-800 food inspectors, including 175 import inspectors for \n     more than 300 ports of entry, FDA needs increased resources \n     for inspections of imported food. The President's emergency \n     relief budget included a request for $61 million to enable \n     FDA to hire 410 new inspectors, lab specialists and other \n     experts, as well as invest in new technology and equipment to \n     monitor food imports.\n       Title V grants FDA needed authorities to ensure the safety \n     of domestic and imported food. It allows FDA to use qualified \n     employees from other agencies and departments to help conduct \n     food inspections. Any domestic or foreign facility that \n     manufacturers or processes food for use in the U.S. must \n     register with FDA. Importers must provide at least four hours \n     notice of the food, the country of origin, and the amount of \n     food to be imported. FDA also receives authority to prevent \n     ``port-shopping'' by making food shipments denied entry at \n     one U.S. port to ensure such shipments to do reappear at \n     another U.S. port.\n       The bill gives additional tools to FDA to ensure proper \n     records are maintained by those who manufacture, process, \n     pack, transport, distribute, receive, hold or import food. \n     The FDA's ability to inspect such records will strengthen \n     their ability to trace the source and chain of distribution \n     of food and to determine the scope and cause of the \n     adulteration or misbranding that presents a threat of serious \n     adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals. \n     Importantly, the bill also enables FDA to detain food after \n     an inspection for a limited period of time if such food is \n     believed to present a threat of serious adverse health \n     consequences or death to humans or animals. The FDA may also \n     debar imports from a person who engages in a pattern of \n     seeking to import such food.\n       Title V also includes several measures to help safeguard \n     the nation's agriculture industry from the threats of \n     bioterrorism. Toward this end, it contains a series of grants \n     and incentives to help encourage the development of vaccines \n     and antidotes to protect the nation's food supply, livestock, \n     or crops, as well as preventing crop and livestock diseases \n     from finding their way to our fields and feedlots.\n       It also authorizes emergency funding to update and \n     modernize USDA research facilities at the Plum Island Animal \n     Disease Laboratory in New York, the National Animal Disease \n     Center in Iowa, the Southwest Poultry Research Laboratory in \n     Georgia, and the Animal Disease Research Laboratory in \n     Wyoming. Also, it funds training and implements a rapid \n     response strategy through a consortium of universities, the \n     USDA, and agricultural industry groups.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Frist, to introduce this bipartisan \nlegislation to respond to one of the most severe dangers of terrorism, \nthe grave threat of bioterrorist attacks. I commend Senator Frist for \nhis impressive continuing leadership on this vital issue.\n  We are all well aware of the emergency we face. In recent weeks, 15 \nanthrax cases stretched our health care system to the breaking point. A \nlarger attack could be a disaster for whole communities of Americans. \nThe anthrax attack of the past weeks has sounded the alarm. The clock \nis ticking on America's preparedness for a future attack. We've had the \nclearest possible warning, and we can't afford to ignore it. We know \nthat hundreds, even millions, of lives may be at stake--and we're not \nready yet.\n  The needs are great. A summit meeting of experts in bioterrorism and \npublic health concluded that $835 million was needed just to address \nthe most pressing needs for public health at the State and local \nlevels.\n  The National Governor's Association has said that states need $2 \nbillion to improve readiness for bioterrorism. John Hopkins is spending \n$7.5 million to improve its ability to serve as a regional bioterrorism \nresource for Baltimore. Equipping just one hospital to this level in \neach of 100 cities across America would cost $750 million.\n  Clearly, our legislation is an important downpayment on preparedness. \nBut we must make sure that our commitment to achieving full readiness \nis sustained in the weeks and months to come.\n  Since September 11, the American people have supported our commitment \nof billions of dollars and thousands of troops to battle terrorism \nabroad. But Americans also want to be safe at home. We have an \nobligation to every American that we will do no less to protect them \nagainst terrorism at home than we do to fight terrorism abroad.\n  The need for help at the State and local level is especially urgent. \nIn the first 3 weeks of October alone, State health departments spent a \nquarter billion dollars responding to the anthrax attack. Many \ndepartments were forced to put aside other major public health \nresponsibilities.\n  Hospitals across the country have immediate needs. According to the \nAmerican Public Health Association, hospitals are hard-pressed even \nduring a heavy flu season, and could not cope with a lethal contagious \ndisease like smallpox.\n  The Bioterrorism Preparedness Act we are proposing will address these \ndeficiencies. It provides new resources for bioterrorism preparedness \nto the States under a formula that guarantees help to each State. These \nresources will be available to improve hospital readiness, equip \nemergency personnel, enhance State planning, and strengthen the ability \nof public health agencies to detect and contain dangerous disease \noutbreaks.\n  Federal stockpiles of antibiotics, vaccines, and other medical \nsupplies are an essential part of the national response. We have a \nstrategic petroleum reserve to safeguard our energy supply in times of \ncrisis. We need a strategic pharmaceutical reserve as well, to ensure \nthat we have the medicines and vaccines stockpiled to respond to \nbioterrorist attacks. Our legislation establishes this reserve, and \nauthorizes the development of sufficient smallpox and other vaccines to \nmeet the needs of the entire U.S. population.\n  The legislation will also help protect the safety of the food supply, \nthrough increased research and survelliance of dangerous agricultural \npathogens.\n  Every day we delay means that States can't buy the equipment to \nimprove their labs and hire the personnel they need. It means another \nday in which hospitals can't purchase stocks of antibiotics or add \nemergency room capacity. It means further delay in building up \npharmaceutical stockpiles and producing essential vaccines. We face an \nextraordinary threat, and we must take immediate action to combat it.\n  Our legislation draws on the work and suggestions of numerous \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle. One of the important areas \naddressed in the legislation is the threat of agricultural \nbioterrorism. Deliberate introduction of animal diseases could pose \ngrave dangers to the safety of the food supply. Such acts of \nagricultural bioterrorism would also be economically devastating. The \noutbreaks of ``mad cow'' disease in Europe cost over $10 billion, and \nthe foot and mouth outbreak cost billions more. We must guard against \nthis danger.\n\n  Protecting the safety of the food supply is a central concern in \naddressing the problem of bioterrorism. Senator Clinton, Senator \nMikulski, Senator Harkin, Senator Collins and Senator Durbin have all \ncontributed thoughtful proposals about food safety. Our bill will \nenable FDA and USDA to protect the Nation's food supply more \neffectively.\n\n[[Page S11954]]\n\n  We're grateful for the leadership of other Senators who have made \nsignificant contributions to this legislation. Senator Bayh and Senator \nEdwards contributed important proposals on providing block grants to \nstates, so that each State will be able to increase its preparedness. \nTheir proposal ensures that each state will receive at least a minimum \nlevel of funding.\n  We're also grateful for the contributions that many of our \ndistinguished colleagues have made to address the special needs of \nchildren. Senator Dodd, Senator Collins, Senator Clinton, Senator \nDeWine and Senator Murray have emphasized the crucial needs of children \nrelating to bioterrorism. The legislation includes important \ninitiatives to provide for the special needs of children and other \nvulnerable populations.\n  The events of recent weeks have shown the importance of effective \ncommunication with the public. Our legislation incorporates proposals \non improving communication offered by several of our colleagues. \nSenator Carnahan has recognized the importance of the internet in \nproviding information to the public. The legislation includes the \nprovisions of her legislation to establish the official Federal \ninternet site on bioterrorism, to help inform the public.\n  Senator Mikulski also contributed provisions on improving \ncommunication with the public. The high level, blue ribbon task force \ncan provide vitally needed insights on how best to provide information \nto the public. Senator Mikulski also recommended ways to ensure that \nstates have coordinated plans for communicating information about \nbioterrorism and other emergencies to the public.\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have a leading role in \nresponding to bioterrorism. Senator Cleland has been an effective and \nskillful advocate for the needs of the CDC. Our legislation today \nincorporates many of the proposals introduced by Senator Cleland in his \nlegislation on public health authorities.\n  Hospitals are also one of the keys to an effective response to \nbioterrorism. We must do more to strengthen the ability of the nation's \nhospitals to cope with bioterrorism. Senator Corzine has proposed to \nstrengthen designated hospitals to serve as regional resources for \nbioterrorism preparedness, I commend him for his thoughtful proposal, \nwhich we have incorporated into the legislation.\n  We must also ensure that we monitor dangerous biological agents that \nmight be used for bioterrorism. There is a serious loophole in current \nregulations, and we are grateful for the proposals offered by Senator \nDurbin and Senator Feinstein to achieve more effective control of these \npathogens.\n  In a biological threat or attack, mental health care will be \nextremely important. We are indebted to Senator Wellstone for his \nskillful and compassionate advocacy for the needs of those with mental \nillnesses. In the event of a terrorist attack, thousands of persons \nwould have mental health needs, and our legislation includes key \nproposals by Senator Wellstone to address these needs.\n  Mobilizing the nation's pharmaceutical and biotech companies so that \nthey can fully contribute to this effort is critical. Senators Leahy, \nHatch, DeWine, and Kohl made thoughtful contributions to the antitrust \nprovisions of the bill, which will help encourage a helpful public-\nprivate partnership to combat bioterrorism.\n  This legislation is urgent because the need to prepare for a \nbioterrorist attack is urgent. I look forward to its prompt passage so \nthat the American people can have the protection they need.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of \nthe Bioterrorism Preparedness Act, a comprehensive package of measures \nto improve our Nation's capability to respond to a future biological \nweapons attack against the United States. This bill, introduced by \nSenators Kennedy and Frist, would authorize $3.25 billion in funding \nfor fiscal year 2002, a substantial boost in resources for the measures \noutlined in the bill. I applaud Senators Kennedy and Frist for coming \ntogether in a bipartisan spirit and putting forth a bill that takes the \nfirst important step towards truly protecting our Nation against future \nacts of bioterrorism. When Sam Nunn testified in early September before \nthe Foreign Relations Committee on the threat posed by biological \nweapons, he was very clear, bioterrorism is a direct threat to the \nnational security of the United States and we need to invest the \nnecessary resources to counter this threat accordingly.\n  As troubling as the recent spate of anthrax by mail attacks was, we \nwere very fortunate that this was a comparatively small-scale attack. \nSeventeen Americans contracted inhalation or cutaneous anthrax; \nunfortunately, four individuals died. The next time a biological \nweapons attack occurs, we may not be so fortunate in dealing with a \nsmall number of victims who emerge over a period of weeks. Instead, we \nmay face thousands of victims flooding local emergency rooms and \noverwhelming our hospitals in a matter of hours. Let's be real here, \nthe anthrax attacks, as small-scale as they have been, have greatly \nstressed our national public health infrastructure. One out of every \neight Centers for Disease Control employees at their headquarters in \nAtlanta is working on the current anthrax outbreak, forcing the CDC to \nsideline other essential core activities for the time being. Folks, \nwhat we have just been through is small potatoes compared to what we \npotentially will face. Plain and simple, we can't afford to be so \nunderprepared in the future.\n  Among Sam Nunn's recommendations for countering biological terrorism, \nhe declared, ``We need to recognize the central role of public health \nand medicine in this effort and engage these professionals fully as \npartners on the national security team.'' There are many good things in \nthis bill, ranging from the expansion of the National Pharmaceutical \nStockpile to efforts to enhance food safety, but I am especially please \nthat the Bioterrorism Preparedness Act provides direct grants to \nimprove the public health infrastructure at the State and local level. \nOur doctors, nurses, emergency medical technicians, and other public \nhealth personnel are our eyes and ears on the ground for detecting a \nbiological weapons attack. We can't afford not to do everything we can \nto make sure they have the necessary tools and resources in containing \nany BW attack. This bill goes a long way towards fulfilling that core \ncommitment.\n\n  So I strongly support the Bioterrorism Preparedness Act and I look \nforward to its early passage and entry into law before the Congress \nadjourns for the year. But I am deeply concerned that the bill ignores \nthe international aspects to any effective response to potential \nbioterrorism. As chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, I know \nthat we cannot address the threat of bioterrorism within the borders of \nthe United States alone.\n  Let me be clear, a biological weapons attack need not originate in \nthe United States to pose a threat to our Nation. A dangerous pathogen \ndeliberately released anywhere in the world can quickly spread to the \nUnited States in a matter of days, if not hours. The scope and \nfrequency of international trade, travel, and migration patterns offer \nunlimited opportunities for pathogens to spread across national borders \nand even to move from one continent to another. Therefore, we need to \nview all infectious disease epidemics, wherever they occur, as a \npotential threat to all nations.\n  It is for this reason that Senator Helms, the distinguished ranking \nmember on the Foreign Relations Committee, and I worked together in \nseeking to insert provisions in this bill to enhance global disease \nmonitoring and surveillance. With Senator Kennedy's strong backing, we \nwanted to ensure the full availability of information, i.e. disease \ncharacteristics, pathogen strains, transmission patterns, on infectious \nepidemics overseas that may provide clues indicating possible illegal \nbiological weapons use or research. Even if an infectious disease \noutbreak occurs naturally, improved monitoring and surveillance can \nhelp contain the epidemic and tip off scientists and public health \nprofessionals to new diseases that may be used as biological weapons in \nthe future.\n  The World Health Organization, WHO, established a formal worldwide \nnetwork last year, called the Global Alert and Response Network, to \nmonitor and track infectious disease outbreaks in every region of the \nworld.\n\n[[Page S11955]]\n\nThe WHO has done an impressive job so far working on a shoestring \nbudget. But this global network is only as good as its components, \nindividual nations. Many developing nations simply do not possess the \npersonnel, laboratory equipment or public health infrastructure to \ntrack disease patterns and detect traditional and emerging pathogens. \nIn fact, these nations often just seek to keep up in treating those who \nhave already fallen ill.\n\n  Doctors and nurses in many developing countries only treat a small \nfraction of the patients who may be ill with a specific infectious \ndisease--in effect, they are only witnessing the tip of a potentially \nmuch larger iceberg. According to the National Intelligence Council, \ngovernments in developing countries in Africa and Asia have established \nrudimentary or no systems at all for disease surveillance, response or \nprevention. For example, in 1994, an outbreak of plague occurred in \nIndia, resulting in 56 deaths and billions of dollars of economic \ndamage as trade and travel with India ground to a halt. The plague \noutbreak was so severe because Indian authorities did not catch the \nepidemic in its early stages. Authorities had ignored or failed to \nrespond to routine complaints of flea infestation, a sure warning \nsignal for plague.\n  Owing to the lack of resources, developing nations are the weak spots \nin global disease monitoring and surveillance. Without shoring up these \nnations' capabilities to detect and contain disease outbreaks, we are \nleaving the entire world vulnerable to either a deliberate biological \nweapons attack or an especially virulent naturally occurring epidemic.\n  Therefore, Senator Helms and I worked together in proposing language \nfor this bill to authorize $150 million in fiscal year 02 and fiscal \nyear 03 to strengthen the capabilities of individual nations in the \ndeveloping world to detect, diagnose, and contain infectious disease \nepidemics. The proposed title would have helped train entry-level \npublic health professionals from developing countries and provide \ngrants for the acquisition of modern laboratory and communications \nequipment essential to any effective disease surveillance network. Upon \nfirst glance, $150 million is chump change in a bill that authorizes \nmore than $3 billion. But I have been assured by public health experts \nthat $150 million alone can go a long ways in making sure that \ndeveloping countries acquire the basic disease surveillance and \nmonitoring capabilities to effectively contribute to the WHO's global \nnetwork. The bottom line is that these provisions would have offered an \ninexpensive, commonsense solution to a problem of global proportions.\n  I was greatly disappointed, therefore, when the White House weighed \nin late in the negotiations and expressed its strong insistence that \nthe language Senator Helms and I worked out should be dropped from this \nbill. While administration officials assured me that they liked our \nideas, they asserted any bioterrorism bill passed this year should only \ninclude those provisions that carry a domestic focus and meet the test \nof urgency.\n\n  Let me respond to those arguments. It is extremely short-sighted to \ndraw artificial boundaries between ``domestic'' and ``international'' \nresponses to bioterrorism. I have already pointed out that pathogens \ndeliberately released in an attack anywhere in the world can quickly \nspread to the United States if we are unable to contain the epidemic at \nits source. The National Intelligence Council has concluded that \ninfectious diseases are a real threat to U.S. national security. To \nignore the international arena in favor of domestic solutions alone is \nprofoundly misguided. As for urgency, I can think of few things more \nurgent than taking the necessary steps to respond to bioterrorism in a \nglobal context. Americans have been repeatedly warned by their \ngovernment leaders to expect other terrorist attacks in the near \nfuture; we cannot limit ourselves to thinking these attacks will occur \nin a conventional form or location. Just this fall, the WHO has had to \nrespond to natural outbreaks of hemorrhagic fever in Pakistan and \nyellow fever in the Ivory Coast. An effective global disease \nsurveillance network cannot come into existence soon enough.\n  I therefore intend to offer an amendment, when this bill comes to the \nfloor later this year, to re-insert the provisions to enhance the \ncapabilities of developing nations to track, diagnose, and contain \ndisease outbreaks resulting from both BW attacks and naturally \noccurring epidemics. It is not my intention to slow down this overall \nbill or raise any obstacles; on the contrary, I want to see \ncomprehensive bioterrorism legislation reach the President's desk this \nyear. But we cannot address the full scope of the threat posed by \nbiological weapons without including the international component of the \nsolution.\n  Let me close with an excerpt of testimony from the Foreign Relations \nCommittee hearing on bioterrorism in September from Dr. D.A. Henderson, \nthe man who spearheaded the international campaign to eradicate \nsmallpox in the 1970s. Today, he is the director of the newly-formed \nOffice of Emergency Preparedness in the Department of Health and Human \nServices, which has the mandate to help organize the Federal \nGovernment's response to future bioterrorist attacks. Dr. Henderson was \nvery clear on the value of global disease surveillance: ``In \ncooperation with the WHO and other countries, we need to strengthen \ngreatly our intelligence gathering capability. A focus on international \nsurveillance and on scientist-to-scientist communication will be \nnecessary if we are to have an early warning about the possible \ndevelopment and production of biological weapons by rogue nations or \ngroups.'' I am hopeful that a majority of my colleagues will recognize \nwe cannot leave the rest of the world to fend for itself in combating \nbiological weapons and infectious diseases in general if we are to \nensure America's security as well.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nBioterrorism Preparedness Act. I am proud to join Senator Kennedy, \nSenator Frist, and Senator Gregg as an original cosponsor of this \ntimely bipartisan legislation. Senator Kennedy and Senator Frist have \nbeen leaders on this issue even before the events of September 11. In \nJune of 2000, they introduced the Public Health Threats and Emergencies \nAct, which was enacted into law last year.\n  The recent anthrax attacks have shown that Congress must do much more \nto prepare our country for possible future bioterrorist attacks. We \nneed to e4nsure that all of our communities across the country, both \nrural and urban, are equipped to respond to a bioterrorism attack in \nthe event that such an unfortunate act should occur.\n  The Bioterrorism Preparedness Act would put in place a comprehensive \nnational strategy to combat bioterrorism. This legislation would \nimprove preparedness at the Federal, State, and local levels. It would \nincrease investments in public health surveillance systems and public \nhealth laboratories to improve our ability to detect an attack. \nMoreover, the Act would strengthen our ability to contain the spread of \na bioterrorism attack by increasing the Nation's stockpile of vaccines \nand treatments.\n  One critical component of a national strategy on bioterrorism is \ncommunication between the government and the public. Americans have \nmany questions about what bioterrorism is and how they can protect \ntheir families. They need a reliable source of information where they \ncan go to get accurate answers to their questions, thereby alleviating \nsome of their anxiety and fears. Several weeks ago, I introduced the \nBioterrorism Awareness Act, S. 1548, to address this need. S. 1548 \ncalls for the creation of a single website containing information on \nbioterrorism that would serve as the official federal government source \nof information for the public. This website will provide ``one-stop \nshopping'' for people who need to find answers to questions about \nbioterrorism. For so many of us, the fear of bioterrorism is a fear of \nthe unknown. Knowledge is power, and the more knowledge we have about \nterrorism, the more power we have to overcome our fears.\n  I am pleased that my proposal has been included as a key part of the \nnational communications strategy in the Bioterrorism Preparedness Act. \nThis legislation calls for the creation of a new official Federal \nwebsite to serve as the definitive source of bioterrorism for the \npublic and other targeted populations. For example, farmers and others \nindividuals involved in the Nation's\n\n[[Page S11956]]\n\nfood supply need accurate information on bioterrorism. This website \nwould include information geared specifically towards the needs of \nagricultural workers and the unique challenges they might encounter in \nthe event of a bioterrorism attack on our food supply. I encourage the \ndevelopment of this website as soon as possible.\n  The Bioterrorism Preparedness Act also contains other provisions \naimed at protecting our food supply. It recognizes that our Nation's \nfood supply cannot be left vulnerable to a terrorist attack. The bill \nwould authorize funds to increase the Food and Drug Administration's \nauthority to perform food inspections. It would also authorize funds to \nimprove security at facilities belonging to the Department of \nAgriculture, the Department of Health and Human Services, and \nuniversities across the country, where potential animal and plant \npathogens are housed or researched.\n  I know that farmers in Missouri, as well as across the country, are \nconcerned about protecting their crops and livestock. A terrorist \nattack on these targets has the potential to not only disrupt the food \nsupply in the U.S., but throughout the world. The potential economic \nimpact on farmers' livelihood would be devastating to them and their \nfamilies. The food safety provisions in this bill go far in protecting \nthis essential national resource.\n  Another key component in dealing with bioterrorism is providing \nstates with the resources to be equipped to respond. The bill would \naward block grants to states for improving preparedness and \ncoordination in the event of an attack. These grants would allow States \nto improve their surveillance and detection capabilities. Further, they \nwould allow states to bolster their public health infrastructure to \nbest protect the public from an attack.\n  These block grants are especially important because when it comes to \nprotecting our nation from terrorism, the Federal Government cannot do \nit alone. We need the cooperation and support of State and local \ngovernments to protect the citizens at all levels. These funds will \nhelp ensure that State governments have the resources they need to \nprevent and respond to a bioterrorism attack.\n  This bipartisan legislation would allow our Nation to improve its \nability to prevent, detect, contain, and respond to a possible \nbioterrorist attack. In this time of uncertainty, preparation is our \nbest defense. This bill provides the necessary resources to strengthen \nthat defense throughout all levels of government--Federal, State, and \nlocal. I urge my colleagues to support the ``Bioterrorism Preparedness \nAct'' and to act on it expeditiously.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, along with Senators Frist, Roberts, \nCollins, Bond, Hagel, Snowe, DeWine, and other colleagues, I rise today \nin support of the Bioterrorism Preparedness Act of 2001.\n  As the fight against terrorism heats up, it is critical that we \ndedicate sufficient resources to the growing threat of bioterrorism. \nThis legislation will enhance the capabilities of Federal, State, and \nlocal governments to coordinate emergency preparedness efforts, \nstockpile vaccines and medical supplies, link channels of \ncommunication, modernize biosecurity facilities, and ensure the safety \nof America's health and food supply. In other words, it will help the \nU.S. protect its citizens.\n  I am proud to have worked with my colleague, Senator Roberts, to \naddress the concerns about our food supply and vital agricultural \neconomies. The agricultural bioterrorism provisions in this legislation \nwill authorize the U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA, to strengthen \nits capacities to identify, prepare for, and respond to such \nbioterrorism threats to our farms, ranches, livestock, poultry, crops, \nand food processing, packaging, and distribution facilities and \nsystems.\n  We have a clear priority to ensure the safety of our food, and to \nmaintain the public's confidence regarding this. To do so, we must \nidentify and quickly control the threats to our food supply, currently \nthe world's safest and most abundant and affordable.\n  Bioterrorism has always been a question of when it would strike, not \ncould it occur, especially since the cold war. During the cold war, it \nwas known that the former Soviet Union had a bio-weapons program that \nincluded bio-agents aimed at agriculture, while during the gulf war our \nown soldiers have shown evidence of possible use of biological weapons. \nFrom the terrorist attacks on Japan's subway system to the foot-and-\nmouth and ``mad-cow'' disease outbreaks in Europe to the recent anthrax \nattacks here, even the public is now acutely aware of this threat.\n  For this reason, this bill is critical, both for the results it will \nachieve and the reassurance it will provide. USDA will be expanded to \nenhance inspection capability, implement new information technology, \nand develop methods for rapid detection and identification of plant and \nanimal disease. USDA's Veterinary Services will be authorized to \nestablish cooperative agreements with state animal health commissions \nand regulatory agencies for livestock and poultry health, and private \nveterinary practitioners to enhance its ability to respond to outbreaks \nof animal disease.\n  We must emphasize and promote collaboration to strengthen America's \nresearch and development capacity. Therefore, USDA is instructed to \nestablish a Consortium for Countermeasures Against Agricultural \nBioterrorism to form long-term programs of research and development to \nenhance the biosecurity of U.S. Agriculture. America's institutes of \nhigher education that have a demonstrated expertise in animal and plant \ndisease research, strong linkages with diagnostic laboratories, and \nstrong coordination with state cooperative extension programs will \nprovide the resources and expertise that will prove invaluable in the \nwar on agricultural bioterrorism.\n  This is the first modern war where the front lines lie on our own \nshores, farms and fields, but I know we are up to the challenge, \nespecially as Texas will proudly serve as one of the States on the \nfirst lines of defense for our entire country. States where agriculture \nis critical are vulnerable to a bioterrorism attack, but they will also \nprove invaluable in the war on bioterrorism when they provide the first \nevidence of an attack.\n  To protect our citizens, our economy and our food supply, I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Bioterrorism Preparedness Act of 2001.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Inouye, \n        and Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 1716. A bill to speed national action to address global climate \nchange, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise before you today to introduce the \nGlobal Climate Change Act of 2001. I am pleased to have Senators \nStevens, Hollings, Inouye, and Akaka join me as original cosponsors.\n  We face a fundamental environmental challenge. Scientists have warned \nthat pollution and deforestation are raising atmospheric concentrations \nof greenhouse gases, raising global temperatures and altering the \nworld's climate system with adverse and potentially catastrophic \nimplications for the global environment. And, while sea levels rise, \nspecies extinction, drought, disease migration and other potential \nimpacts cannot be known with certainty, we know enough to understand \nthat the threat of harm is real and that worst-case scenarios under \ncurrent ``business-as-usual'' practices are disastrous.\n  The best indicator that other nations believe action is desperately \noverdue is the conclusion of an agreement to implement the Kyoto \nProtocol last week in Marrakesh, Morocco. Incredibly, the Marrakesh \nAccords, under which rules for compliance and international greenhouse \ngas emissions trading were reached, were concluded without U.S. \nsupport.\n  Although the Administration abandoned the Kyoto process in March, to \nour national detriment, it is critical that the United States map out a \nclear path to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across the economy. In \nthe Commerce Committee we have held several hearings to examine the \nscience and the solutions to global warming. We have heard testimony \nabout the potential for wind and other renewable energy to provide our \nnation the power it needs emissions free. We have heard from companies \nleading the push for hydrogen fuel cells to provide distributed \ngeneration and transportation energy with low emissions. And we've\n\n[[Page S11957]]\n\nheard from automakers designing the technology for more fuel efficient \ncars. The Commerce Committee has jurisdiction over of the Corporate \nAverage Fuel Economy, CAFE, program and will continue a series of \nhearings on the issue that was delayed by the attacks of September 11. \nThe United States must assert itself as a leader in research, \ndevelopment and deployment of these and other technologies.\n  The Global Climate Change Act of 2001 would help us move down a path \nof scientific understanding, research, policy innovation and \ntechnological innovation. The bill will complement other legislation \nunder consideration in other Senate committees for reducing our \ngreenhouse gas emissions, as well as legislation to improve CAFE in the \nCommerce Committee. The Global Climate Change Act of 2001 will also \nprovide a solid technical basis upon which to build any future \ngreenhouse emissions tracking, reduction, or trading programs.\n  The bill contains provisions aimed at bringing the world-class \nscience, technology, and planning expertise of the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration, NOAA, the National Institute of Standards \nand Technology, NIST, and other Department of Commerce programs to bear \non this problem, whether it is in climate observation, measurement and \nverification, information management, modeling and monitoring, \ntechnology development and transfer, or hazards planning and \nprevention.\n  First, the bill would endorse the elevation of climate change issues \nin the Administration, identifying the Office of Science and Technology \nPolicy, OSTP, as the coordinating entity in the White House. An \ninteragency task force on global climate change action chaired by the \nSecretary of Commerce would be responsible for developing a multi-\nfaceted climate change action strategy, including development of \nmitigation approaches.\n  Second, it would create an emissions reporting system to ensure \naccurate measurement, reporting, and verifica-tion of greenhouse gas \nemissions, which is essential to any efforts to reduce our emissions. \nThe bill utilizes the technical capabilities of the NIST and NOAA to \nestablish uniform and credible new measurement methods and \ntechnologies. It establishes a mandatory reporting system for \ngreenhouse gas emissions for entities operating in the U.S. with \nsignificant emissions. The system will maximize completeness, accuracy \nand transparency and minimize costs for covered entities. It will be \ndesigned to ensure interoperability of any U.S., state or international \nsystem of reporting and trading greenhouse gas emissions. It would also \nrequire Commerce to issue annual reports showing greenhouse gas \nemissions and trends, including areas where reductions have occurred.\n  Third, the bill would ensure that we in Congress get the best \nindependent scientific and technical expertise in our climate change \noversight role. The bill would create a Science and Technology \nAssessment Service that would provide ongoing science and technology \nadvice to Congress. Since the Office of Technology Assessment, OTA, was \neliminated in 1995, experts agree that Congress has suffered from lack \nof ongoing, credible advice. While some objected to the OTA structure, \nall agree that expert technical advice for Congress is essential to \nensuring we hold up our end in efforts to make progress on this \nimportant issue. Congressional requests for advice are overburdening \nthe National Academy of Sciences and threatening to compromise its \nindependent stature. The bill would economize on resources and \npersonnel by utilizing the administrative services of the Library of \nCongress and the expertise of the National Research Council, and \nprovide an ongoing separate service to Congress that will not threaten \ncompromise NAS's independent role.\n\n  Fourth, the bill revises the Global Change Research Act of 1990 and \nthe National Climate Program Act, so that interagency and Commerce \nDepartment programs focus on improving detection, modeling and regional \nimpact assessments and are better managed to provide useful information \nto government decisionmakers and managers. In addition, the legislative \nchanges would direct improvements in atmospheric monitoring and \nestablish a new integrated coastal and ocean observing system to ensure \nwe understand and predict the role of oceans in climate. Finally, it \nwould create an integrated program office for the USGCRP within the \nOffice of Science and Technology Policy to ensure budget coordination, \nusing models established under the multiagency National Oceanographic \nPartnership Program and the NPOESS, polar satellite, convergence \nprocess.\n  Fifth, the bill addresses a critical component of reducing greenhouse \ngas emissions: technology innovation. The bill is aimed at increasing \nthe Department of Commerce's technology innovation role in reducing \ngreenhouse gas emissions. Specifically, it would utilize the Advanced \nTechnology Program, ATP, to promote and commercialize energy efficient \ntechnologies and the Manufacturing Extension Program for small \nmanufacturers. This section would also direct NIST to develop methods \nand technologies, including process improvements, that can be used in a \nvariety of sectors to reduce production of greenhouse gases.\n  Finally, we must admit that even if we stopped all greenhouse gas \nemissions tomorrow, the effects of climate change and variability will \nnot end. It is in our interest to undertake assessments and actions now \nthat will help us address safety and infrastructure issues that will \nlikely accompany climate variability and change in the future. There is \ncurrently no way for State governments or coastal communities to plan \nfor change on a 20-50 year time horizon. The bill would require NOAA to \nevaluate vulnerability of regions of the United States, particularly \ncoastal regions, to effects of climate change, including drought and \nsea level rise, and develop a strategy for helping states deal with the \nissues. The bill also directs NOAA to work with NASS to develop remote \nsensing technologies that will help coastal managers identify hazards \nand make intelligent planning decisions.\n  This legislation neatly rolls into one package key components of any \nnational plan to address climate change: coordinated research, \nmonitoring, reporting and verification, mitigation technology, impact \nassessment, and adaptation planning. This package is but one of many I \nhope to see my colleagues in Congress develop to help the United States \nreduce the threat of global climate change now. The Climate Change \nmeetings in Marrakesh last week show that other nations are ready to \nact. We can, and must, do the same, even without leadership from this \nAdministration.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Kerry as a \ncosponsor of the Global Climate Change Act of 2001. The Senate Commerce \nCommittee has worked hard to ensure that the Federal Government has the \nbest research and information possible about global warming, as well as \nother types of climate changes. Our investments are bearing fruit and \nwe are identifying ways to focus our research to help us make decisions \nnow and in the decades ahead.\n  During the 1980s, a number of us on the Committee became increasingly \nconcerned about the potential threat of global warming and loss of the \nozone layer. In 1989, I sponsored the National Global Change Research \nAct, which attracted support from many members still serving on the \nCommerce Committee. In 1990, after numerous hearings and roundtable \ndiscussions, Congress enacted the legislation, thereby creating the \nU.S. Global Climate Research Program.\n  When we passed the Global Change Research Act, we knew it was the \nfirst step in investigating a very complex problem. We placed a lot of \nresponsibility in NOAA, the scientific agency best suited to monitor \nand predict ocean and atmospheric processes. We need to renew this \nocean research commitment to ensure we better understand the oceans, \nthe engines of climate. The so-called ``wild card'' of the climate \nsystem, the oceans are capable of dramatic climate surprises we should \nstrive to comprehend.\n  I am glad to report that the research accomplished under the National \nGlobal Change Research Act has led to increased understanding of global \nclimate change, as well as regional climate phenomena like El Nino/\nSouthern Oscillation, ENSO. We now have a better understanding of how \nthe Earth's oceans, atmosphere, and land surface\n\n[[Page S11958]]\n\nfunction together as a dynamic system, but we cannot stop there. Only \nrecently, NOAA measured an important increase in temperature in all the \nworld's oceans over a 40 year period. We need to understand the causes \nand how that will affect us. All this research ensures that federal and \nstate decision-makers get better information and tools to cope with \nsuch climate related problems as food supply, energy allocation, and \nwater resources.\n  While we have learned an astonishing amount about climate and other \nearth/ocean interactions in only a decade, we have other critical \nquestions that require further research to answer. Many of these \nquestions are relevant not only to improving our scientific \nunderstanding, but also to contributing to our future social and \neconomic well-being. For example, climate anomalies during the past two \nyears, most directly related to the 1997-1998 El Nino event, have \naccounted for over $30 billion in impacts worldwide. When impacts from \nthe recent floods in China are included, these direct losses could rise \nto $60 billion. This most recent El Nino claimed 21,000 lives, \ndisplaced 4.5 million people, and affected 82 million acres of land \nthrough severe flood, drought, and fire. When we better understand the \nglobal climate system, and its relationship to regional climate events \nlike El Nino, we may be able to find ways, such as improved forecasting \nand early warning--to avoid some of the severe impacts.\n  Understanding these and other impacts of climate change at the \nregional level is a critical step in preparing for these changes. We \nmust maintain our commitment to research and further refine our \nexisting modeling capabilities. The second critical need is planning \nfor sea level rise and other inevitable results of climate change. It \nis costly in human lives and real dollars to manage our response in a \ncrisis mode. Just as we needed to modernize our National Weather \nService, we need to strengthen and modernize our National Climate \nService, which can help the U.S. predict and plan for climate events. \nThis includes establishing a national ocean and coastal observing \nsystem using the expertise and resources of a variety of federal \nagencies. In addition, this bill will help our coastal communities at \nrisk from future climate-related hazards create plans that will help us \nadapt to such changes without catastrophic disruptions experienced in \nAlaska by my friend Senator Stevens.\n  Not only do we need continued support for technological research and \ndevelopment, we must also consider the method in which this information \nis delivered to Congress. Before it was abolished in 1995, the Office \nof Technology Assessment, OTA, was responsible for providing Congress \nwith balanced, independent scientific and technological advice. Since \n1995, the function of the National Academy complex, particularly the \nNational Research Council, NRC, has been forced to expand its role in \nproviding research and information to Congress. However, the NRC \nstudies have their limitations. The reports, often slow and expensive, \nprovide limited opportunity for formal input and review by affected \nparties. Furthermore, unlike OTA, they often make specific \nrecommendations rather than laying out a range of alternative policy \noptions.\n  The problems addressed by Congress are becoming increasingly complex. \nScience and technology play a crucial role in addressing problems in \nenergy, defense, aviation and the environment. Without a permanent, \nnon-partisan source of independent scientific and technical policy \nanalysis, Congress become lost in the wealth of information provided by \nscientists, think tanks, and interest groups. The Global Climate Change \nAct of 2001 addresses this problem by creating a service that would \nprovide ongoing science and technology advice to Congress, but avoid \nthe criticisms leveled at OTA. It would economize on resources and \npersonnel by utilizing the administrative services of the Library of \nCongress and the expertise of the National Research Ccouncil. \nCongressional requests for advice are overburdening NRC and threatening \nto compromise its independent stature as it is increasingly asked to \nfill the role of OTA. This provision would defer to NRC as the source \nof outside, unbiased advice and experts, but also provide an ongoing \nseparate service to Congress. This service would also be asked to \nreview the report of the Climate Change Action Task Force.\n  The Global Climate Change Act of 2001 demonstrates that the Committee \non Commerce, Science and Transportation is serious about climate \nchange, and I commend this Act to you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/02/senate-section/article/S11945-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n[[Page S11945]]\n\nSenate\n\n\n(Legislative day of Friday, September 22, 2000)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/02/senate-section/article/S11945-2", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11945-S11946]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE COMMITTEE ON VETERANS' AFFAIRS\n\n Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \nsummarize for my colleagues, and for the public, the activities and \naccomplishments of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs during the 106th \nCongress. I am pleased to report, as chairman of the committee, that \nthis Congress has been one of significant accomplishment.\n  When this Congress convened, it was determined that three veterans' \npriorities needed to be met. We had to increase the availability of \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA)-provided health care services, \nparticularly long-term care services, to World War II veterans. We had \nto improve educational assistance benefits--so-called Montgomery GI \nbill or MGIB benefits--made available by VA to veterans, principally \nyoung veterans, newly released from service. And we had to address and \nrectify vestigial elements of discrimination against women contained in \nveterans' statutes. With the assistance of the committee's ranking \nminority member, Senator John D. (``Jay'') Rockefeller IV, and in \nbipartisan partnership with all of the committee's members, we have \nachieved all three of these goals--and more.\n  First, with the enactment of the Veterans Millennium Health Care and \nBenefits Act of 1999, Public Law 106-117 (Millennium Act), the Congress \nprovided for the first time that the most deserving of veterans--those \nwith severe service-connected disabilities--will be assured of \nreceiving nursing home care should they need it--and so long as they \nneed it. Under the terms of the Millennium Act, any veteran who needs \nnursing home care to treat a service-connected disability will get it. \nSimilarly, any veteran who is rated as 70 percent disabled or higher by \nVA due to a service-connected cause will be provided with needed \nnursing home care--even if the condition which causes the need for such \ncare is not itself service-connected. Further, all veterans who are \nenrolled for VA care--even those who do not have service-connected \ndisabilities--will, under the terms of the Millennium Act, receive any \nand all non-institutional alternatives to inpatient long-term care--\nservices such as home health aide services, adult day health care \nservices, and the like--as they might need to forestall the day on \nwhich they will have to resort to inpatient long-term care. Finally, \nthe Millennium Act mandates that VA maintain the nursing home capacity \nthat it now has, and that it initiate pilot programs to determine, \nfirst, the most cost-effective ways of providing more nursing home care \nto more veterans and, second, the feasibility of providing to veterans, \nand their spouses, assisted living services.\n  With enactment last month of the Veterans Benefits and Health Care \nImprovement Act of 2000, Public Law 106-419, the other two priorities \nwhich had been identified at the outset of the 106th Congress were also \nmet. Under that statute, a veteran who has served a three-year \nenlistment and who returns to school after service will be eligible to \nreceive as much as $800 per month in assistance payments while he or \nshe is in school. In January 1997, when I assumed the chairmanship of \nthe committee, veteran-students could receive no more than $427 per \nmonth in Montgomery GI bill assistance; thus, in four years, assistance \nto full time veteran students has been increased by 87 percent.\n  The Veterans Benefits and Health Care Improvement Act also addressed \ntwo issues of importance to women veterans: It provided that special \ncompensation benefits--those provided to male veterans when they lose, \ndue to a service-connected cause, a so-called creative organ--will also \nbe afforded to women veterans who sustain the service-connected loss of \na breast. And it provided--based on sound scientific evidence--that \nchildren with birth defects of women Vietnam veterans will be provided \ncompensation, health care, and job training benefits.\n  These three measures--addressing the disparate needs of older, \nyounger, and women veterans--are not the only veterans-related \nlegislative accomplishments of the 106th Congress. To the contrary, the \nlist of other legislative achievements is long. In addition to \nproviding the long-term care benefits I have already outlined, the \nMillennium Act also specifies that VA will itself provide, or reimburse \nthe uninsured costs of, emergency care needed by any veteran enrolled \nfor VA care. It mandates, further, that VA enhance the services it \nprovides to homeless veterans, and to veterans with post-traumatic \nstress disorders, drug abuse disorders, and injuries from sexual \ntrauma. It provides, in addition, that higher priority access to VA \ncare will be provided to veterans who were wounded in combat and are, \nas a consequence, recipients of the Purple Heart. And, finally, it \nauthorizes VA to provide enhanced care, as space is available, to \nactive duty service personnel and military retirees (who normally \nreceive care from their respective military services), and reauthorizes \nthe provision of health care evaluations to the spouses and children of \nPersian Gulf war veterans.\n  Further in the area of health care benefits, the Millennium Act and \nthe Veterans Benefits and Health Care Improvement Act jointly enhance \nservices provided to veterans by improving VA assistance to State-run \nveterans' nursing home facilities; by authorizing 13 major hospital \nconstruction projects; by improving provisions of law relating to \nnurse, dentist, and pharmacist pay and the recruitment of\n\n[[Page S11946]]\n\nphysician assistants, social workers, and medical support staff; by \nincreasing VA incentives to collect reimbursements from non-service-\ndisabled veterans' health insurance carriers--funds that are not \nremitted to the Treasury but are funneled back into VA hospitals; and \nby encouraging increased VA and Department of Defense cooperation in \nthe procurement of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies. And last, but \nsurely not least in the area of health care, VA's health care system \nreceived the two greatest increases ever in funding for fiscal years \n2000 and 2001, increases of $1.7 billion and $1.4 billion respectively. \nThe ranking member and I very much appreciate that the chairman and \nranking member of the VA, HUD and Independent Agencies Appropriations \nSubcommittee, Senators Bond and Mikulski, heard our call for such \nfunding increases.\n\n  In the area of veterans' readjustment benefits and other non-\nhealthcare-related benefits provided by VA, I have already outlined the \nsignificant increases in monthly Montgomery GI bill benefits that have \nbeen gained since 1997, and the improvements in women veterans' \nbenefits. Beyond these accomplishments, there is a lengthy and strong \nrecord of accomplishment. In addition to increasing veterans' \neducational assistance allowances, the Veterans Benefits and Health \nCare Improvement Act also increased education assistance benefits \nprovided to the widows and surviving children of persons who were \nkilled in service or who died after service from service-connected \ncauses. And these survivors' educational assistance benefits were, for \nthe first time, ``indexed'' by the Veterans Benefits and Health Care \nImprovement Act so that they will keep pace with inflation. The \nVeterans Benefits and Health Care Improvement Act and the Millennium \nAct also improved VA educational assistance programs by allowing \nbenefits to be paid to students taking test preparation courses and \ncertification or licensing examinations, and by paying benefits to \nstudents during term breaks and, retroactively, to students who are \nveterans' survivors and who are deemed eligible for such benefits only \nafter their educations have begun. In addition, those statutes also \nexpanded eligibility standards applicable to post-Vietnam era veterans \nby allowing those who had participated in the less generous Veterans \nEducational Assistance Program or VEAP program of the late 1970's and \nearly 1980's to convert to Montgomery GI bill eligibility. Finally, the \nVeterans Benefits and Health Care Improvement Act liberalized MGIB \nparticipation rules so that officer candidates and veterans serving \nsecond enlistments would not, due to technicalities in the law, be \ndenied Montgomery GI bill eligibility.\n  Benefits other than educational assistance benefits were also \nimproved by the Veterans Benefits and Health Care Improvement Act, the \nMillennium Act, and other committee-approved legislation. Compensation \nbenefits provided to radiation-exposed veterans were modified by the \naddition, under the Millennium Act, of bronchiolo-alveolar cancer to \nthe listing of diseases that are presumed to be service-connected if \nthey are contracted by radiation-exposed veterans. The Veterans \nBenefits and Health Care Improvement Act specifies that compensation \nwill be provided, for the first time, to reservists who suffer heart \nattacks or strokes while on active duty and to veterans who are injured \nwhile participating in VA-sponsored compensated work therapy programs. \nIn addition, that statute provides for a long-overdue increase in the \nnet worth threshold at which compensation payments are suspended in \ncertain cases involving veterans who are hospitalized on a long term \nbasis, though I hasten to add that a repeal of this limitation--which, \nunder current law, applies to mentally incompetent hospitalized \nveterans but not to other hospitalized veterans--will remain a top \npriority of mine. And benefits provided to veterans' widows were \nimproved by liberalizing eligibility for survivors of former prisoners \nof war and widows who have remarried. In addition, the Veterans Claims \nAssistance Act of 2000, Public Law 106-475, reinstated and improved \ncourt-struck provisions of law requiring that VA assist veterans and \nother claimants--principally, widows and surviving children--in the \npreparation of their claims to VA for benefits. And Public Laws 106-118 \nand 106-413 increased VA compensation, survivors' benefits, and other \ncash-transfer benefits by 2.4 percent and 3.5 percent, respectively, \nthereby assuring that VA benefits keep pace with inflation.\n  In the area of insurance benefits, the Veterans Benefits and Health \nCare Improvement Act increased the amount of life insurance available \nto service members from $200,000 to $250,000, and authorized insurance \nprogram participation by members of the Reserves. That statute also \nfreezes premiums paid by certain insured veterans who have reached the \nage of 70. And, in the area of housing benefits, the Veterans Benefits \nand Health Care Improvement Act improved remodeling grant programs to \nassist disabled veterans in making their homes accessible, and the \nMillennium Act extended mortgage loan guarantee benefits to members of \nthe Reserves.\n  In order to assist veterans in gaining meaningful post-service \nemployment, the Veterans Benefits and Health Care Improvement Act \nextends eligibility for Federal contractor outreach programs to \nrecently-separated veterans. In addition, the Veterans Entrepreneurship \nand Small Business Development Act of 1999, Public Law 106-50, provides \ntechnical, financial, and procurement assistance to veteran-owned small \nbusinesses.\n  Finally, in the area of memorial affairs, the Millennium Act mandates \nthat VA establish six new national cemeteries in areas which VA had \nidentified as being underserved. In addition, the Millennium Act \nfacilitated last month's dedication of the World War II Memorial on the \nNational Mall by authorizing the American Battle Monuments Commission \nto borrow funds needed to proceed now while World War II veterans \nremain alive to see the memorial they earned. Finally, the Veterans \nBenefits and Health Care Improvement Act extended eligibility for \nburial, and funeral expense and plot allowances, to certain U.S.-\ncitizen Filipino veterans, improved VA assistance to States in \nestablishing State cemeteries, and extended job-protection benefits to \nReserve and Guard members who take leave from their civilian jobs to \nhonor veterans by serving in burial details.\n  Mr. President, I commend and thank the ranking minority member of the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee, and all of the committee's members, for \ntheir extraordinary diligence and cooperation in assisting me in \npressing forward the numerous improvements to veterans programs that I \nhave outlined in this statement. The Veterans' Affairs Committee \noperates in an unusually bipartisan way--a way that might be a model \nfor constructive activity in the 107th Congress. We will continue to so \nact, and we anticipate that the 107th Congress will show a record of \naccomplishment similar to that which characterizes the 106th.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/02/senate-section/article/S11946-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11946-S11947]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE COMMODITY FUTURES MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2000\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask to print in the Record a \nletter from the President's Working Group on Financial Markets strongly \nsupporting the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000.\n  The act provides certainty for over-the-counter swaps and authorizes \na new financial product, the ``security future,'' to be traded under a \nregulatory scheme that protects investors against fraud, market \nmanipulation and insider trading.\n  The act contains three principal components. It would provide legal \ncertainty that specified types of swaps which are traded over-the-\ncounter are not regulated as futures. The Report of the President's \nWorking Group on Over-the-Counter Derivatives Markets and the Commodity \nExchange Act, issued in November 1999, strongly recommended that \nCongress enact legislation to provide OTC swaps with legal certainty in \norder to ``reduce systemic risk in the U.S. financial markets and \nenhance the competitiveness of the U.S. financial sector.''\n  In addition the act would authorize trading in futures on single \nstocks and narrow-based stock indices. These are new investment \nproducts which, until now, have been prohibited from trading by the \nShad-Johnson Accord, which this act would repeal. By authorizing\n\n[[Page S11947]]\n\nsecurities futures, the act would allow financial markets to increase \nthe number of products they trade and give investors additional \ninvestment options. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission negotiated the proposed regulatory \nregimen over securities futures, which is designed to protect investors \nagainst fraud, insider trading and market manipulation. The regulatory \nregimen will call for joint regulation by both the SEC and CFTC of \nthese markets and the intermediaries that trade in them. Imposing \nstrong investor protections is absolutely necessary if we are to allow \ntrading in these new investment products.\n  The act also contains regulatory relief provisions for the futures \nmarkets that would codify recent CFTC regulations.\n  I would like to highlight certain important aspects of titles III and \nIV of the act.\n  Title III addresses the SEC's authority over security-based swap \nagreements. It carefully carves out products traditionally viewed as \nsecurities in exclusions from the definition of swap agreements. It is \nimportant to note that title III does not eliminate the SEC's existing \nauthority to regulate products that are securities.\n  Title III applies anti-fraud and anti-manipulation provisions of the \nFederal securities laws to securities-based swap agreements, including \nthose entered into by banks. Title III amends section 10(b) of the \nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 and its anti-fraud protections to apply \nto ``any securities-based swap agreement.'' In extending these \nprotections, the act makes explicit that rules promulgated under \nsection 10(b) to address fraud, manipulation, or insider trading apply \nto securities-based swap agreements. Thus, current and future anti-\nfraud rules will apply to swap agreements to the same extent as they do \nto securities. This will enhance protection for investors and for the \nfinancial markets, and will permit the SEC to respond as necessary to \ndevelopments in these markets.\n  Title III states that existing judicial precedent relating to various \nsecurities statutes and rules is applicable to securities-based swaps \nto the same extent as it is to securities. Thus, for example, cases \ninterpreting these statutory provisions which establish theories of \nliability and private rights of actions would apply directly to \nsecurities-based swaps.\n  Title IV, Legal Certainty for Bank Products Act of 2000, clarifies \nthe current law, under which the CFTC does not regulate traditional \nbanking products. Such products include deposit accounts, CDs, banker's \nacceptances, letters of credit, loans, credit card accounts, and loan \nparticipations. When a question arises, title IV provides a mechanism \nfor determining whether a product is an ``identified,'' or traditional, \nbanking product. To qualify as an identified banking product, section \n403 requires two conditions to be met: (1) that the product cannot have \nbeen either prohibited by the Commodity Exchange Act or regulated by \nthe CFTC on or before December 5, 2000, and (2) that the bank has \nobtained a certification from its regulator that the bank product was \ncommonly offered by any bank prior to December 5, 2000. The latter test \nrequires that the product was actively bought, sold, purchased, or \noffered by or to multiple customers and is not just a transaction \ncustomized for a single client or handful of clients.\n  Section 405 excludes a hybrid product from the Commodity Exchange Act \nif under a ``predominance test'' it is primarily an identified banking \nproduct and not a contract, agreement or transaction appropriately \nregulated by the CFTC. The act dictates how to resolve disputes about \nthe application of this test.\n  The bill's definition of ``security future'' does not include \nproducts excluded under title IV and other sections of the Commodity \nExchange Act, e.g., certain swaps, identified banking products, etc. \nThus, the new grants of authority of this act to the SEC would not \nextend to these products. However, these exclusions do not limit the \ndefinition of ``security'' or the SEC's jurisdiction under existing \nstatutes. For example, the SEC has, and will continue to have, \njurisdiction over all over-the counter options.\n  The act will have a significant impact on the futures markets as well \nas on the securities markets and investors. The United States \ninvestment markets are the envy of the world. This act is intended to \nstrengthen those markets as it provides legal certainly for over-the-\ncounter swaps, authorizes the trading of futures on single stocks and \nnarrow-based stock indices, and gives regulatory relief for the futures \nmarkets.\n  The letter from the President's Working Group on Financial Markets \nfollows:\n\n                                                December 15, 2000.\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \n         Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: The Members of the President's \n     Working Group on Financial Markets strongly support the \n     Commodities Futures Modernization Act. This important \n     legislation will allow the United States to maintain its \n     competitive position in the over-the-counter derivative \n     markets by providing legal certainty and promoting \n     innovation, transparency and efficiency in our financial \n     markets while maintaining appropriate protections for \n     transactions in non-financial commodities and for small \n     investors.\n           Sincerely,\n     Lawrence H. Summers,\n       Secretary, Department of the Treasury.\n     Alan Greenspan,\n       Chairman, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve.\n     Arthur Levitt,\n       Chairman, Securities and Exchange Commission.\n     William J.
