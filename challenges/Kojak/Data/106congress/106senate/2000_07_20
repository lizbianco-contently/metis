The pending business is the Harkin amendment \nNo. 3938. There is no time limitation.\n  Mr. HARKIN. There is no time limit?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am sorry; I was under the mistaken \nimpression that there was a time limit. I stand corrected. I want to \ntalk for a few minutes about the pending amendment.\n  In some conversations I had last night and earlier this morning \nprevious to coming to the floor, I found that there may be some \nmisconceptions about my amendment and what it seeks to do. So I would \nlike to take the time to try to clarify it.\n  I did not think there would be opposition to it. It was merely to \nclarify a situation that has arisen in a court case in Texas. So in the \nnext few minutes I will try, as best I can, to try to outline it and \nclarify exactly what this amendment is and what it intends to do.\n  Everyone in the food chain, from the farm on through to the table, \nhas a vital stake in the USDA food safety and inspection system for \nmeat and poultry products. This goes back many years. As the years have \nevolved, and\n\n[[Page S7304]]\n\nas our processes for growing, slaughtering, processing, packaging, \ntransporting, and the selling of meat and meat products and poultry \nproducts has changed, we have changed the way we do things.\n  As Secretary Glickman once I think so adroitly explained, the days of \npoke and sniff have to be over. We need new inspection standards \nbecause of the rapidity of the lines, the tremendous increase in the \nproduction of meat and meat products, which are good sources of protein \nfor our people and for export. We need the change. So that is what we \nhave done.\n  But the linchpin in all of this is consumer confidence. Our food \nsafety system must adequately protect consumers. It must assure \nconsumers that their food is safe. If consumers lack confidence in the \nsafety of meat and poultry products, they will not be good customers. \nThat means less demand and lower prices and income for livestock and \npoultry producers, as well as for our packers and processors.\n  On May 25, a huge cloud of uncertainty was cast over USDA's meat and \npoultry inspection system when the Federal district court for the \nNorthern District of Texas held that USDA does not have the statutory \nauthority to enforce its pathogen reduction standards for salmonella in \nground beef.\n\n  The pathogen reduction standards are a critical part of the new food \nsafety system which was adopted by the USDA in 1996 in the hazard \nanalysis critical control point and pathogen reduction rule. It is \notherwise known by its acronym HACCP, something that many of us in the \nSenate and the House have worked on for many years to bring about.\n  That system was designed to protect human health by reducing the \nlevels of bacteria contamination in meat and poultry products. I might \nadd that the HACCP rule was broadly supported by consumer groups, by \npackers, by processors, by the meat and poultry industry, as being a \nstep in the right direction from the kind of inspection procedures that \nwe had before.\n  The HACCP and the pathogen reduction rule established a modern \ninspection system based on two fundamental principles.\n  First, the meat and poultry industry has the primary responsibility \nand the flexibility to design plans for producing safe products and \nthen to follow those food safety plans. So the industry has the primary \nresponsibility. And they should have the flexibility to design plans \nfor producing safe products and then to follow those plans. That is the \nfirst principle.\n  The second principle is that the public health is best served by \nreducing the level of pathogens on meat and poultry products \nnationwide--a very commonsense principle. To accomplish this, USDA \ndeveloped pathogen reduction standards using salmonella as the \nindicator bacteria. These standards set targets that plants have to \nmeet for reducing microbial pathogen levels. If a plant repeatedly \nfails to meet salmonella targets, USDA may refuse to inspect the \nplant's products, thereby effectively shutting the plant down until the \nplant implements a corrective action plan to meet the pathogen \nreduction standard.\n  What happened was the district court in Texas held that USDA does not \nhave the statutory authority to enforce its food safety standards \ndesigned to reduce pathogen levels in ground beef.\n  The court stated, in its June 13 final judgment, that the salmonella \nreduction standard ``is hereby declared to be outside the statutory \nauthority of the United States Secretary of Agriculture and the United \nStates Department of Agriculture to the extent that it allows the \nSecretary and/or USDA to withdraw or suspend inspection services or \nwithhold the mark of inspection on the basis of an alleged failure to \ncomply with the Salmonella performance standard for ground beef. . . \n.''\n  That is the quote from the finding of the district court.\n  Keep in mind, if USDA cannot withdraw or suspend inspection, it is \npowerless to enforce the pathogen reduction standards. Refusing \ninspection is USDA's only enforcement tool. Again, the Texas decision \nwas based on an interpretation of USDA's statutory authority to enforce \nthe salmonella reduction standard.\n  I am aware there has been a lot of discussion about the legitimacy of \nthe salmonella standard. Is it science based? Does it rationally relate \nto food safety? Those are legitimate questions to raise. But the court \ndid not even get to those questions. It just ruled that the USDA did \nnot have the statutory authority to enforce its standard designed to \nreduce pathogenic bacteria.\n  I believe the American public would be shocked to be told that the \nU.S. Department of Agriculture does not have the authority, under our \nmeat and poultry inspection laws, to require reductions in microbial \ncontamination of meat and poultry.\n\n  If USDA lacks the authority to enforce pathogen reduction standards, \nthen, surely, we stand at the edge of a food safety debacle, a chasm. I \nam going to repeat that. The American public would be shocked to find \nthe USDA does not have the authority, under our existing meat and \npoultry inspection laws, to require reductions in microbial \ncontamination of meat and poultry. Think about that.\n  Frankly, I have my doubts about the reasoning of the court in the \nTexas case. But the court has held that the USDA lacks this authority \nto enforce the pathogen reduction standards.\n  That decision has created an intolerable degree of uncertainty about \nUSDA's authority to ensure the safety of meat and poultry products, not \nonly in Texas but anywhere in the entire United States.\n  Plainly and simply, all my pending amendment does is to clarify that \nthe USDA has the legal statutory authority to require reductions in \npathogenic bacteria in meat and poultry products.\n  Let me explain why it is so critically important that we clarify this \nand that USDA has that authority. I have some charts to show that. This \nchart has some very sobering statistics.\n  In the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention, foodborne pathogens are responsible for 76 million \nillnesses, 325,000 hospitalizations, and 5,000 deaths every year.\n  That is an estimate by the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention.\n  The economic impact of foodborne illness for the United States is \nestimated to be $6.6 to $37.1 billion per year. Just to clarify, these \nstatistics include all foods--not just meat and poultry but all foods. \nMeat and poultry are certainly a substantial portion of the cases; I \ndon't want to mislead anyone. This covers lettuce, tomatoes, fruits, \nvegetables, and everything else. Again, these are not just illnesses, \nhospitalizations, and deaths that result simply from the failure to \nreduce pathogens in the processing and packaging stream. This could \ncome about from mishandling of food at the consumer level, at the \npurchasing level, storage, miscooking, and inapplicable storage of \npartially cooked food.\n  I want to illustrate the dimensions of foodborne pathogens in our \ncountry. Again, I am not condemning the meat and poultry industry. I am \nnot trying to frighten consumers. Yet there is no denying that we have \nmuch more foodborne illness than we should. Consumers are paying \nattention. Consumers are concerned about the safety of their food. \nAgain, I come back to the matter of consumer confidence. What industry \ncan build markets if it fails to build confidence in its customers? If \nyou support the meat and poultry industries, as I do, then you also \nhave to support a food safety and inspection system that effectively \nassures the safety and quality of meat and poultry products.\n  The second chart shows some of the progress we have made since we \nestablished the new pathogen reduction standards which the USDA has \nbeen implementing. Salmonella levels on meat and poultry products have \nfallen. Salmonella rates in ground beef have dropped 43 percent for \nsome of our small plants, 23 percent for large plants. In fact, in the \nentire United States, only three plants have failed to meet the \nstandard. I think this is strong evidence that the standard works and \nthat it is reasonable. Yet the court in Texas says USDA does not have \nthe legal authority to do what it has been doing to reach these \ndropping rates in salmonella levels. It says USDA does not have the \nauthority to continue to do that.\n\n  The next chart indicates the success of the USDA new food safety \nsystem for meat and poultry. This chart shows the rate of foodborne \nillnesses has fallen from 51.2 per 100,000 people in 1996,\n\n[[Page S7305]]\n\nwhen the HACCP rule was implemented, to 40.7 per 100,000 people in \n1999. That is a 20.5-percent decrease in total foodborne illnesses in \nthe last 4 to 5 years. That is a major success story in food safety. \nBut now the Texas court's decision has rejected USDA's authority to \nreduce pathogens on meat and poultry products which led us to this \ntremendous reduction.\n  The salmonella standard is not perfect, from what I am told by \nscientists and others. That is why I have carefully crafted my \namendment so it does not codify or lock into place the existing \nsalmonella standard. My amendment would do nothing to prevent changing, \nimproving, or even challenging a pathogen reduction standard. I want to \ncontinue to work with producers, the meat and poultry industries, \nconsumers, and the USDA to see that we have science-based, workable \nperformance standards that protect the public health. Again, what my \namendment does, and all it does, is to make certain that USDA has the \nlegal, statutory authority to enforce pathogen reduction standards that \nare critically important to assuring food safety.\n  I am willing to engage in any colloquies about this amendment. Keep \nin mind, this court decision was only 2 months ago. Quite frankly, if \nwe don't act soon, I think there is going to be great concern among \nconsumers, customers in the export markets, about our commitment to \nreducing pathogens, reducing bacteria in our meat, livestock, and \npoultry products.\n  We are not trying to lock in a standard. As I said in my opening \nstatement, times change, conditions change. We have to be able to do \nthat. But the authority to do that, as it has been going back probably \nalmost 70 years--80 years almost--the authority for meat and poultry \ninspection has been with the U.S. Department of Agriculture. To be \nsure, during most of that time, they were not involved in the reduction \nof pathogens and bacteria. But with the new changes in how we do \ninspections, with HACCP, we decided, and the processors and the \nconsumers decided, that we needed to do everything possible to reduce \nbacteria contamination on our meat and poultry products.\n  As I said, we have done a great job in that. We have reduced it. We \nare on our way. Most of the plants in America have met these \nrequirements. They have used HACCP. They have been responsible. Only \nthree plants in the entire United States failed to meet the standard. I \nthink if the court had gotten beyond the statutory problem and gotten \nto the essence, the substance of it, the court, on the weight of the \nevidence, would have had to decide that the reduction standard is \nreasonable. Obviously, if all the plants in the country are doing it \nand only three have not met it, a reasonable person--and I believe the \ncourt is reasonable--would say, obviously, it has to be a pretty decent \nstandard. But the court didn't even get there. They just said, sorry, \nyou don't have the authority, which really has opened up a chasm.\n\n  That is why it is so critically important for us to address this \nissue this year. The only vehicle we have that I can see right now is \nto do it on the Agriculture appropriations bill, which is a good bill \nand which I hope will make its way through and be signed by the \nPresident. I think it is critically important to give them that \nauthority. That is all my amendment does right now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this amendment, on its face, looks as \nthough the Senate is being asked to vote in favor of supporting the \nDepartment of Agriculture's standards for meat inspection that include \nthe power to shut down a plant if it is found that the product being \nproduced contains a contaminant. In the case in Dallas, TX, the Senator \ncites, it was salmonella.\n  The plant operated by Supreme Beef in that area was shut down by the \nDepartment of Agriculture and, according to testimony in the case in \nTexas, it was shut down solely on the basis of the fact that the \nproduct being produced contained a prohibitive level of salmonella, or \nsome salmonella.\n  What the court said was that the Department of Agriculture wasn't \ngiven that kind of power by the Congress to impose regulations of that \nkind, and that to shut down a plant there had to be some connection \nbetween the operation of the plant and the presence of the salmonella \nin the product. In other words, if the plant was totally sanitary, \nobeyed every rule of law or regulation of the Department of Agriculture \nfor safe and sanitary operation, just because of the test, the \nDepartment was without the power under the law to shut down the plant.\n  This amendment--if we adopt it--as suggested by the Senator from \nIowa, would impose a new legal authority that is not now present, which \nwould give the Department of Agriculture more power than it has, more \npower than it has asked for, and, I suggest, more power than we ought \nto give on an appropriations bill, without more careful review; that \nis, the power to arbitrarily shut down a plant, whether it is being \noperated correctly and in a sanitary manner, with all due regard for \nthe product that is being produced, the safety of that product for \nhuman consumption.\n  Because of this court case that puts in question the Department's \nauthority that it exercised in this one case, we are being asked now to \nsay that these standards, which are regulations in effect, ought to be \ncodified; they ought to be put in the form of a law.\n  Now, that is a step that we, in my view, ought not to take--not on \nthis bill, not as an amendment to an appropriations bill, not on the \nbasis of one district's court's finding in the State of Texas, which \ndoesn't have application and is not being honored by the Department's \nregulators anywhere else in the United States except in that Federal \ncourt jurisdiction.\n  The Department of Agriculture has not asked for this amendment. I am \nadvised that the Department of Agriculture doesn't support this \namendment. The Department of Agriculture has not yet decided whether to \nappeal this decision of the district court. It may decide to modify its \nregulations because of this district court decision. So we would be \nacting prematurely and, in response to the suggestion in this \namendment, we would be exceeding even the decision being made now in \nthe Department of Agriculture, or the Department of Justice, which has \nto prosecute the appeal. So the Department of Justice hasn't decided, I \nam told, whether to appeal this decision to the court of appeals. The \nDepartment hasn't decided that yet. Yet we are being asked to reverse, \nin effect, by legislation, the decision of that district court.\n  We are not an appellate court. I suggest that the Senate should not \nact today favorably on this amendment as if we are reviewing the legal \nintricacies involved in this case and are making some careful, \nthoughtful determination about whether or not that case ought to stand \nor whether it ought to be reversed. I am going to suggest to the Senate \nthat what we ought to do is look at the implications through hearings \nin the Agriculture Committee or in the committee that has jurisdiction \nover other food safety concerns. Our Appropriations Subcommittee could \nconduct hearings--and that might be the appropriate thing to do--and \nhear from the Department of Agriculture and hear from others who have \nviews on this subject. And then we could make a recommendation to the \nSenate.\n  But this is a brand new decision, as the Senator said; it was made, I \nthink, in May. It is a recent decision. We ought to let the legal \nprocess work its way to a conclusion with the Department of \nAgriculture, the Department of Justice, and the packing company \ninvolved in this case. They must have had some persuasive evidence to \npresent to the court as to why the Department of Agriculture acted \narbitrarily and improperly, or without the sanction of law, to shut \ndown this plant as they did. And here we are going to substitute our \njudgment collectively for the judgment of the district court judge who \nheard all the evidence, who saw the witnesses, including Department of \nAgriculture officials who described what they did and why they did it.\n  The Senate needs to know that there is a committee that is available \nto the Department of Agriculture that is called the Advisory Committee \non Microbiological Criteria. The Department of Agriculture and the \nSecretary look to this committee normally for advice and consult on \nissues of this kind. No consultation, as I understand\n\n[[Page S7306]]\n\nit, has taken place with this special committee of experts who are \nbrought together for the purpose of providing scientifically based \nopinions to the Secretary of Agriculture on the question of \nadulteration and sanitation issues of meat and poultry packing and \nprocessing plants.\n  So let's not pretend that we know as much as this advisory committee. \nLet's not pretend that we have a better reason for making a decision in \nthis case than the district court did, which found just the opposite of \nwhat the Senator is asking this Senate to find. So I am suggesting that \nthis is premature. It is inappropriate for us to legislate in this \nfashion on an appropriations bill, without the benefit of facts and \nexpert opinions and views on the subject.\n  So it is my intention, without cutting off anyone's right to speak, \nto move to table the Senator's amendment and to ask for the yeas and \nnays on that vote. But I do not want to make that motion right now \nwithout notice to my friend and colleague from Iowa or any other \nSenator who wants to be heard. We had told all Senators they could \nexpect a vote on an amendment on this bill at or about 10:30. I hope we \ncan keep that commitment to the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I appreciate the chairman not moving to \ntable right now. I listened as closely as I could, while conversing \nwith my staff, to the comments made by my friend. I hope we can engage \nin a colloquy on this. We are talking past each other.\n  Obviously, the chairman had to leave the floor, but I hope we can \nengage in a colloquy on this because this is a very serious matter. I \ndon't want there to be misperceptions out there.\n  The Senator from Mississippi just got through saying, more than once, \nthat what we are being asked to do is codify a regulation. I would like \nthe Senator from Mississippi to show where in my amendment it codifies \na regulation. It is not there. I challenge my friend from Mississippi \nto show that. It is not there. I said explicitly in my statement that \nmy amendment does not codify any regulation. It is not there. So if the \nSenator from Mississippi says that my amendment codifies a regulation, \nI challenge him to show where and how. I think that is a misperception.\n  Secondly, again, let's be clear on what we are talking about here. Is \nit reasonable, I ask, for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which has \nthe statutory power to inspect meat and poultry products, which it has \nfor many years, is it reasonable for the USDA to also inspect and set \nsome standards for the reductions of packaging bacteria that is on our \nmeat and poultry products?\n  If the answer to that is no, it is not reasonable, then I guess you \ncould vote to table my amendment because that is where we will be. We \nwill be at a point where what we would be saying is that the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture should not have any authority to establish \npathogen reduction standards nor any authority to enforce them. I \nsuppose they could test them. But they could never enforce them. I \nthink that is what we have to ask ourselves: Is it reasonable for the \nU.S. Department of Agriculture to set pathogen reduction standards and \nthen to be able to enforce them?\n  I said in my opening statement, and I say again to my friend from \nMississippi, my amendment does not codify any regulation. Yet, if I am \nnot mistaken, I heard my friend from Mississippi state in his comments \nthat we are being asked to codify a regulation. I carefully drafted the \namendment not to do that.\n  If the Senator from Mississippi can show how we codify our \nregulation, we would be glad to change the amendment. It is not there. \nThat is a misperception. All this amendment says is that the USDA has \nthe statutory authority to both set a pathogen reduction standard and \nthen to enforce it. That does not mean a packer or a processor couldn't \nchallenge those standards as being unreasonable or not applicable. That \nstill can be challenged. Any rule or regulation can be challenged in \ncourt.\n  Let's take the Supreme Beef case, I say to my friend from \nMississippi, where the Supreme Beef packing plant had failed the \nsalmonella standard reduction three times. They had failed it three \ntimes before the USDA stepped in and withdrew its inspection, thereby \nbasically shutting the plant down.\n  Again, keep in mind that the plant did not go to court to challenge \nthe standard. They went to court and said USDA doesn't have the \nstatutory authority to set the standard or to enforce it. The court \nfound that USDA did not have that statutory authority. Here is a plant \nthat failed three times to meet the salmonella reduction standard. They \nhad been warned. They knew it.\n\n  Keep in mind that a lot of this ground beef from Supreme Beef goes \ninto our School Lunch Program. Go out and tell the parents of America \nthey can send their kids to school and they can eat ground beef in \nschool but we are not going to enforce any bacteria reduction standards \nsuch as salmonella in our packing plants. Supreme Beef failed it three \ntimes. Now they can fail it four or five times. They will have no \nstandards whatsoever--none, zero, zip--because the USDA will not be \nable to enforce its salmonella reduction standards.\n  I think what Supreme Beef should have done was challenge, if they \nwanted to, the reasonableness of that standard. They could go to court \nand get a stay to keep operating and then show the court that the \nstandard that was imposed on them by USDA and by which USDA is shutting \ndown their plant by refusing inspection is unreasonable, unwarranted, \nand inapplicable. Fair enough; let them do that. But they cannot even \nget there because they said USDA doesn't have the authority to do it.\n  That is where we are. If we take no action, that is where we are. \nSupreme Beef can go ahead and keep right on operating. They don't have \nto worry about any salmonella reduction. They can keep pumping that \nfood right into the School Lunch Program.\n  The chairman indicated that there is a USDA scientific advisory \ncommittee that may review this standard this fall. I welcome that. \nNothing in my amendment would prevent changes based on those \nrecommendations. Nothing in this amendment would do that.\n  Again, one has to ask oneself, should the USDA have the authority \nunder the HACCP program to issue pathogen reduction standards and then \nto be able to enforce those?\n  Again, I go back to my chart. Since the pathogen reduction standard \nfor salmonella went into effect in 1996--it is so prevalent and makes \npeople pretty sick--rates in ground beef dropped 43 percent in our \nsmaller packing plants and 23 percent in our larger plants.\n  That is success. That is why plants all over America have not \nchallenged this in court. They seem to be doing quite well with it. \nOnly three plants in the entire United States have failed to meet this \nstandard--three--Supreme Beef, of course, being one of them.\n  As I said, since the HACCP rule was implemented in 1996, 51.2 \nfoodborne illnesses per 100,000 people went down to 40.7. It is \nworking. Yet because of one plant in Texas that decided to thumb its \nnose at the salmonella reduction standard--obviously, they had a good \nattorney--they went to court and said USDA does not have the authority \neither to set the standard or to enforce it. The court said: You are \nright, they don't, because Congress never gave them that authority.\n  I want to clear up one other thing. I am told the USDA is not opposed \nto this amendment. They are not taking a position because of pending \nlitigation because they are in the courts right now because of this \npending litigation.\n  The USDA has a charge to ensure lower bacteria counts. Again, it is \nnot the power to arbitrarily shut down a plant because of the \nappropriateness of a specific USDA standard. The standard is still \nsubject to review by a court. I want to make that as clear as I can.\n\n  No. 1, I challenge my friend from Mississippi to show me how my \namendment codifies the regulation. I challenge my friend to show that. \nHe has said that. I have carefully drafted it so that it does not \ncodify any regulation. The regulations can change. The advisory \ncommittee can meet. Maybe they want to change these standards--I am \nspeaking here regarding this amendment--but I don't know why they would \nwant to change a standard that has been so successful, by which every\n\n[[Page S7307]]\n\npacking plant in America today is abiding, except three, one of them \nbeing Supreme Beef that brought this case.\n  It is not that technical. All we are doing is asking, through this \namendment, to give USDA the authority to set the standard and enforce \nit--not what standard. This amendment does not give the USDA the \nauthority to set a standard that I specify and to enforce that \nstandard. It says to set pathogen reduction standards and to enforce \nthem. Obviously, if they set a standard that is unreasonable, \ninappropriate, and inapplicable, that can be challenged in court. They \ncan be challenged in the rulemaking process. That is the way it is \ndone.\n  But if we continue as we are right now, there is no reason for any \nplant in America to abide by these salmonella reduction standards \nbecause USDA has no authority to enforce them. They could go into a \nplant and say: Gee, you know, you are right above salmonella; that is \nabove our standard. The plant can say: So what. Get out of here. We \ndon't have. I don't think that is what the American people want or the \nAmerican consumers want. I don't believe it is what the vast majority \nof packers and processors in America want. They want the public to have \nthe highest level of confidence that their meat and poultry and meat \nproducts and poultry products are wholesome and without bacterial \ncontamination.\n  It is too bad because of one bad actor--one plant in Texas that \nfailed three times to meet the standard, and on the fourth time, after \nhaving clear warnings, the USDA came in and withdrew the inspection, \nwhich effectively shuts down the plant--we have to throw the whole \nsystem out and say the USDA does not have the authority. That can open \nthe floodgates for plants all over America.\n  I say to my friend from Mississippi, there is no codification of any \nregulation, none whatever. It is only giving the USDA the authority \nunder which it has been operating for 4 years, which has been \nsuccessful. Only three plants in America have failed to meet standards. \nI think that is a good success story. I don't think we ought to not \ngive the authority to the USDA to continue on this pathway simply \nbecause of one bad actor in Texas and because of the fact that we \nfailed in our statutory deliberations and in our statutory approach to \ngive the USDA this authority. I am not pointing the finger at anybody.\n  We should have at some point statutorily given the USDA this \nauthority. We did not do so. That is what this amendment seeks to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

The question is on the amendment?\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3995 To Amendment No. 3938\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the amendment to \nthe desk and ask it be reported.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3955 to amendment No. 3938.\n       On page 2 of the amendment: Strike ``established by the \n     Secretary'' and insert in lieu thereof: ``promulgated with \n     the advice of the National Advisory Committee on \n     Microbiological Criteria for Foods and that are shown to be \n     adulterated''.\n\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this amendment states that the \nmicrobiological standards imposed by the Secretary of Agriculture, in \nsituations involving those described by the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Iowa, must be imposed pursuant to the Administrative Procedures \nAct and be subject to notice and comment procedures under that act.\n  It additionally requires the Secretary, in instances involving \ncontamination of meat and poultry products that are subject to \ninspection and plant inspection by the Secretary, to seek the advice of \nthe National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods. \nThis is a panel of scientists, with members appointed by the Secretary \nof Agriculture. The purpose of the panel is to provide advice and \ncounsel on matters of this kind from experts to the Secretary of \nAgriculture.\n  We understand that this panel has not had an opportunity to make \nrecommendations or observations about the standards that are the \nsubject of these USDA regulations that were litigated in this court \ncase because the Department of Agriculture decides when they meet, and \nit is my understanding that the next meeting is scheduled for the fall. \nThere has not been a special meeting called. And the issue has not been \nplaced on the agenda.\n  If my amendment is adopted, the Senate would suggest to the Secretary \nthat this issue ought to be presented to this panel of expert witnesses \nand the advice of that panel sought in this situation.\n  The Department of Agriculture has indicated that it does not support \nthe Harkin amendment. The Senator said that it has decided to take no \nposition on the amendment because it involves a case that is subject to \njudicial proceedings at this time.\n  To remind Senators, this is a court case the Senator is asking be \nreversed by the Senate. The time for appeal has not yet expired. The \nDepartment has not decided whether to appeal. The Department of Justice \nhas not made a recommendation, as I understand it, whether it thinks an \nappeal should be prosecuted or not. They may decide this court was \nright and then come to the Congress to ask for additional authority, \nand the Congress may very well decide to give the Department additional \nauthority.\n  But the adoption of this amendment, without suggesting the Department \nneeds to consult first on modifying its standards with an expert panel, \nthat was created for the purpose of providing information, would be \npremature also.\n  So we hope the Senate will adopt this modification to the Harkin \namendment. The vote on the motion to table was a tie vote, and \ntherefore the motion failed. We could let the Senate vote on the \namendment of the Senator from Iowa without any further amendment.\n\n[[Page S7308]]\n\nAnd if there is another tie vote, the amendment would fall.\n  But in order to try to resolve the issue, for the moment, my \nsuggestion is that the Senate should adopt this amendment, putting in \nthe extra provision of consultation with the National Advisory \nCommittee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods, and suggest that, if \nthis standard is given the force and effect of law, there must be some \nconnection between the contaminated product and unsanitary conditions \nor the way in which the processing plant was being operated in order to \njustify the Department withdrawing its inspectors and therefore closing \nthe plant.\n  We want to continue to ensure--and this ought to be clear--that our \nNation's food supply is safe; that it is processed in the most sanitary \nconditions possible; that it is inspected to ensure that the food is \nsafe for human consumption, all of that will continue to be reflected \nin the adoption of this amendment.\n\n  What we add is that scientific advice and counsel be sought by the \nDepartment of Agriculture on this subject with respect to this standard \nthat has been thrown out by a court. If it can be modified to ensure \nthat we continue to see the force and effect of the standards enforced \nby the courts, then that is what we would like to see happen. We would \nlike it to be done in a process that gives respect for the power of a \ncourt and the judicial process that is in place but also the \nprerogatives of the Congress. The Congress has not empowered the \nDepartment of Agriculture to issue a standard of the kind the court \nsaid it could not enforce. That is a point to remember, too. The \nadoption of the Harkin amendment would give that power legislatively, \ngive that power to the Secretary of Agriculture without a careful \nreview of the implications of that new power by the Congress.\n  I am hopeful that this will resolve the issue for the time being, for \ntoday. The legislative committee has a right to look at it, to have \nhearings, to propose changes in the authorities the Department has in \nsituations such as this. That would be the appropriate way to resolve \nthe issue for the long term. But for today, I am hopeful the Senate \nwill agree to this amendment, maybe on a voice vote, and then we can \nadopt the amendment of the Senator on a voice vote and proceed to other \nissues.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/20/senate-section/article/S7308-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7308-S7310]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING SENATOR PAUL COVERDELL\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Paul \nCoverdell, our friend and colleague. Paul was an extraordinary human \nbeing who really cared. He looked at his opportunity to serve in the \nSenate as a way to make a difference in the lives of his fellow man.\n  I will never forget Paul Coverdell. He was one of the first people \nwho reached out to me when I first came to this body, greeting me with \na warm welcome and caring advice. Although he was in leadership and had \nmany demands on his time, he always had time for me and truly listened \nto what I had to say. He had common sense and a common touch. I have \ntruly enjoyed working with him on several legislative initiatives, \nparticularly education and the Ed-Flex bill we passed last year.\n  Paul had a wonderful knack for being able to work with people and to \nget things done. He led by example. He understood that to be a leader \none had to serve. There was no job so small that he would not take it. \nHis commitment and ability always made you want to be on his team. His \nenthusiasm was contagious. He made you feel good just being around him.\n  My regret is that because of my short tenure in the Senate, I did not \nget to know Paul or spend as much time with him as many of my \ncolleagues.\n  He gave witness to his Christian faith every day. He will continue to \nbe my role model in the Senate. Paul Coverdell will be missed by all of \nus, but my faith tells me that he is eternally happy with our Father in \nHeaven. I pray that thought will give comfort to his wife Nancy and the \nmembers of his family.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as have so many of my colleagues, I speak \nwith a sense of loss and sadness about the passing of our friend, Paul \nCoverdell. Over the years serving in the Senate, I have seen too often \nthe flowers on a Senator's desk and known, by that unique tradition of \nour body, the reflection that we have lost somebody in an untimely \nfashion--no one more untimely than the Senator from Georgia.\n  I have had the honor to serve with many Senators during the time the \npeople of Vermont have been kind enough to let me be here. Each of \nthese Senators has brought special qualities. It might be a knack for \nfiery oration or professorial intelligence. But Paul Coverdell brought \na special formula of kindness and quiet persistence.\n  I first knew Paul when he was director of the Peace Corps. I was \nchairman of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee which handled his \nbudget. I recall times when there would be an issue that would come up \nof some contention. I remember President Bush calling and saying: Pat, \nsit down with Paul. I assure you you can work it out.\n  We would sit quietly in my office. We would go over the issues, and \nwe would work it out. We would work it out because I knew that Paul \nCoverdell would keep his word; he knew I would mine. I also knew that \nneither of us would read about the intricacies of our agreements in the \npaper the next day. We would keep each other's confidence.\n  When he came to the Senate, he was first and foremost a tireless \nchampion for the interests of the people of Georgia. We all remember \nhis relentless advocacy for some of the military bases in his home \nState and how proud he was to represent the State that hosted the \nOlympic games in 1996. In that regard he entered the sometimes messy \nrealm of appropriations to bring full Federal support to that gigantic \neffort.\n  In many ways, these efforts were an embodiment of the people of \nGeorgia, possessing a boundless energy, ambition, and generosity.\n  What I remember most, though, about Paul Coverdell--and so many of \nour colleagues have said the same thing--is how he worked on everything \nwith a paradoxically quiet energy. He was not one to seek the cameras \nand head to the floor to yell about every disagreement. If he had a \ndisagreement, he would call you. He would go and work with you face to \nface. He was often convincing. I know he changed my mind on issues.\n  I think one of the reasons he was so convincing is that he was always \nopen-minded and attentive. I don't think there is any case more obvious \nabout that than the Senate's recent consideration of the supplemental \nappropriation for antidrug assistance in Colombia.\n  There were many disagreements on this aid package. But everybody, \nwhether they were on his side or on the opposite side, admired the \nstrength of his conviction and the depth of the knowledge of the \nregion.\n  I was privileged to work closely with him on a resolution on a recent \npresidential election in Peru. Senator Coverdell and I believed \nstrongly that it was important for the United States to send a strong \nmessage throughout the hemisphere in support of democracy and to \ncondemn the blatant subversion of democracy by the Fujimori government. \nAgain, it was the strength of Paul's convictions and willingness to \nstand for the most important principles this country stands for. That \nis why the resolution was there.\n  Our mutual concern for international human rights extended to the \neffort to establish a global ban of antipersonnel landmines. I was so \npleased to work with Paul on this issue. He would always consider my \nproposals thoughtfully and thoroughly. He brought a very special \nperspective. For him, banning landmines was about protecting Peace \nCorps volunteers and the communities they served. He had this unique \nway of looking at an issue that went way beyond warring parties. He was \nconcerned about innocent civilians.\n  Paul took part in these debates and he worked behind the scenes with \na\n\n[[Page S7309]]\n\nbig-hearted kindness. He was one of the kindest people to grace this \nfloor, and there was a certain peacefulness about him that was always \npleasantly contagious. In a sometimes very divisive Senate, that \npeacefulness was so respected.\n  That is why when I look at the flowers, like many of us who have \nserved here a long time, I think we have seen those flowers too often. \nBut it is hard to think of a time when both Republicans and Democrats \nhave felt the pain more than on this occasion. Paul, we will all miss \nyou.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, all of use are saddened by the death in \nour Senate family. I join Senators on both sides of the aisle in \nmourning the loss of our colleague and friend, Paul Coverdell, and I \nextend my deepest condolences to the members of his family.\n  Senator Coverdell and I differed on many of the major issues of the \nday. But it was obvious to all of us who served with him that he was a \nleader of genuine conviction, deep principle, great ability, and high \npurpose.\n  His commitment to public service was extraordinary. It was always a \nprivilege to work with him.\n  I especially admired his dedication to seeking common ground--to \nexploring every aspect of every issue, and to learn as much as possible \nabout it--to going the extra mile to achieve worthwhile compromise \ninstead of confrontation--and above all to finding practical answers to \nthe many serious challenges we face together in the Senate.\n  He was deeply committed to enhancing the qualify of life for all \nAmericans. We both shared a strong commitment to improving education in \nall of the Nation's schools. I'm saddened that he will no longer be \nwith us as the Senate turns again in coming days to the important \ndebate on support for elementary and secondary education in schools and \ncommunities across the country.\n  I also particularly admired Paul Coverdell's leadership role as \nDirector of the Peace Corps in the Bush administration from 1989 to \n1991, before he came to the Senate.\n  Over the years, the Peace Corps has had special meaning for all of us \nin the Kennedy family, because it is one of the finest legacies of \nPresident Kennedy. I know that my brother would have been proud of Paul \nCoverdell's commitment to the Peace Corps and its ideals and its \nservice to peoples in need in many different lands.\n  In a very real sense, the campaign slogan that Paul Coverdell used so \neffectively in his successful Senate re-election campaign in Georgia 2 \nyears ago sums up his extraordinary career, and tells why he had so \nmuch respect and friendship from all of us. That slogan consisted of \ntwo simple words--``Coverdall Works.'' And it was true, in every sense \nof the word. Paul Coverdell served the Senate well, the Nation well, \nand the people of Georgia well, and we will miss him very much.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, Howell Raines, Editorial Page Editor of \nThe New York Times has written a warm and wonderful tribute to Paul \nCoverdell, recalling his career in the Georgia State Senate in the \n1970s. It is part of his life story that is not widely known here in \nWashington--certainly not by me--and helps to account for the great \naffection and respect in which he was held here in the United States \nSenate.\n  Withal this adds a touch to our mourning, we are much indeed indebted \nto Mr. Raines memoir.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the ``Editorial Notebook'' from this \nmorning's New York Times be printed in full in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 20, 2000]\n\n                      A Quiet Man in a Noisy Trade\n\n                           (By Howell Raines)\n\n\npaul coverdell's leap to the senate marked a shift in southern politics\n\n       Senator Paul Coverdell of Georgia was a mild-mannered \n     Republican seasoned in political obscurity. As minority \n     leader of the Georgia State Senate in the 1970's, he was part \n     of a legislative bloc so small and impotent that it was \n     ignored, steamrolled and sometimes openly ridiculed by the \n     Democrats who controlled the legislature as if by birthright. \n     None of us covering the Georgia Capitol in those days would \n     have picked Mr. Coverdell, who died Tuesday at age 61, as a \n     future United States senator. Now, in retrospect, we can see \n     him as part of the second of two transforming waves that \n     swept Georgia politics in the last third of the 20th century.\n       The first wave of change was driven by law. The Voting \n     Rights Act of 1965 brought hundreds of black Democrats into \n     office. The second wave of change was demographic, as \n     exemplified by fast-growing Atlanta. Georgia's progressive \n     Democrats had long dreamed of the day when Atlanta would be \n     big enough to outvote the state's rural conservatives. What \n     they had not foreseen was that thousands of the newcomers \n     flooding into the Atlanta suburbs would be out-of-state \n     Republicans who rejected both the Democratic power structure \n     and the Goldwater Republicans then in control of the Southern \n     G.O.P.\n       They created a ready-made constituency for Mr. Coverdell, a \n     classic mainstream Republican who was fiscally conservative \n     yet moderate on social issues. ``That was what made the \n     Republican Party attractive to these people who came in,'' \n     said Bill Shipp, a veteran political commentator from \n     Atlanta. ``Until Coverdell and Johnny Isakson [another \n     Atlanta moderate] came along, Georgia Republicans were \n     disgruntled segregationist Democrats.''\n       Unlike the sprinkling of ultraconservative Republicans \n     elected during the Goldwater boom, Mr. Coverdell was not \n     hostile to black aspirations. Indeed, by the time he left the \n     Georgia Senate in 1989, he had gained enough influence to \n     make his mark as a reliable legislative advocate for \n     Atlanta's black mayors. He was known as a policy wonk and a \n     nice guy, traits that would mark his service as director of \n     the Peace Corps under President George Bush. He worked hard \n     in that position to promote a program that is unpopular with \n     many Republicans because of its identification with President \n     John F. Kennedy.\n       A similar earnestness would mark Mr. Coverdell's career in \n     the United States Senate, but he did not get there by wearing \n     a halo or emphasizing his credentials as a moderate. He won \n     his seat from Wyche Fowler, a Democrat popular with liberals, \n     by running to the right, especially on the abortion issue.\n       It is, of course, always tricky to define political \n     moderation among Southern Republicans. By any measure, Mr. \n     Coverdell, a big booster of tax cuts and school vouchers, was \n     plenty conservative. Lately he had grown close to Trent Lott, \n     the Senate's tough-guy majority leader. But his primary \n     alliances were with less hard-edged types like President Bush \n     and his son George W. Bush, the Texas governor. He helped \n     plan the coming Republican Convention. In the event of a \n     Republican victory, according to Senator Max Cleland of \n     Georgia, a Democrat, Mr. Coverdell, ``would have played a big \n     role in a Bush administration, in the cabinet or as a special \n     adviser.'' But in a region that still tends to celebrate pols \n     who are loud and flashy, Mr. Coverdell will be remembered for \n     his general decency, his serious interest in good government \n     and his unlikely leap from the back benches of the Georgia \n     Capitol.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to remember our friend Paul \nCoverdell. The state of Georgia and the United States have lost a \ntalented and dedicated statesman.\n  Senator Coverdell's workmanlike approach to government was a breath \nof fresh air in today's atmosphere of glamour politics. He didn't \naspire to be in the spotlight, but he fought tirelessly to spotlight \nthe issues in which he believed. Whether you agreed with his position \non those issues or not, you admired his style--his lack of pretense, \nwillingness to complete tedious, but important tasks, and pleasant \ndemeanor during a tough debate.\n  His office was one floor above mine in the Russell Building and we \noften rode the subway together over to the Capitol. His easygoing \nnature always struck me as particularly Southern. We shared a love for \nthat slow, gracious lifestyle of our home states and enjoyed working \ntogether when it served the similar needs of our constituents.\n  Paul had a deep appreciation for the office of U.S. Senator having \npersevered in his quest for a Senate seat in 1992 despite a highly-\ncompetitive race that featured two runoffs. For the next eight years, \nhe never took the privilege of serving the people of Georgia or the \nnation lightly. We can all learn something from his example.\n  Service was an evolving theme in Paul Coverdell's life, beginning \nwith an overseas stint in the U.S. Army, later followed by almost two \ndecades in the Georgia state Senate and a post in President Bush's \nadministration as Director of the U.S. Peace Corps. He was well-\nprepared when he arrived in the Senate chamber and used his experience \nto advance an aggressive legislative agenda. It was a pleasure to serve \nin the U.S. Senate with Paul Coverdell. He fought fairly, was gracious \nin victory and honorable in defeat.\n\n[[Page S7310]]\n\n  My sympathy goes out to his wife, Nancy, and other family members and \nto the people of Georgia.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the senior \nSenator from Georgia, Paul Coverdell, who passed away Tuesday in \nAtlanta.\n  While Senator Coverdell and I came from different political parties \nand ideologies, we shared several things in common. We both served our \ncountry in the U.S. Army, and after our service we both returned home \nto run successful businesses.\n  With our military and business background we decided to turn our \nattention to serving the public, and Senator Coverdell had an \nimpressive record of public service.\n  Senator Coverdell served in the Georgia State Senate--rising to the \nposition of minority leader. He then served as Director of the Peace \nCorps under President Bush, focusing on the critical task of serving \nthe emerging democracies of post-Soviet Eastern Europe. In 1992, he was \nelected to serve in the United States Senate.\n  Although we failed to agree on many issues before this body, Senator \nCoverdell always demonstrated honor and dignity in this Chamber. He \nargued seriously for the positions he believed in. When he pushed \nlegislation to fight illegal drugs or promote volunteerism, it was \nobvious that his heart was always in it. And his motivation was sincere \nand simple--to help the people of Georgia and the Nation.\n  I send my deepest sympathies to his wife Nancy, his parents, and the \nentire Coverdell family. I also extend my sympathy to the people of \nGeorgia.\n  We will all miss Senator Paul Coverdell of Georgia.\n  Mr. L. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my sympathy to \nthe Coverdell family and my own sorrow at the death of Senator Paul \nCoverdell. May his family find solace in their memory of Paul's many \ncontributions to a better Georgia, a better United States, and a better \nworld. I followed Paul onto the Foreign Relations Committee and also \ninto his chair of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee. I will do my \nbest to carry on your good work there, Paul.\n  As many people have said, Paul Coverdell was a gifted communicator. \nTo every organization those skills are valuable and especially here in \nCongress. Perhaps Paul learned those skills at the prestigious Missouri \nSchool of Journalism from which he graduated. But I suspect, despite \nhaving known him only a short time, that Paul's easy manner and obvious \nkindness were inherent traits. He was a natural communicator and we \nmourn his loss.\n  Once again, my heartfelt sympathy to Nancy and all of Paul \nCoverdell's family and friends.\n  Rest in peace.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Senator Paul Coverdell was a rare and wonderful man--and \na spectacular Senator. Anyone who had the good fortune to work with him \nleft more hopeful, more committed, more convinced we could all make a \ndifference.\n  Much is being said about his extraordinary ability to get things \ndone; I would like to talk about how he was able to accomplish so much. \nSenator Coverdell had many talents, but perhaps the secret to his \nsuccess was high ability to bring people together. In times of \nfriction, fractiousness, and pressure, he was always the one who \nremained focused and calm in the eye of the legislative storm.\n  It was a common for him to hold meetings in his office where \nconservatives and moderates, strategists and ideologues, listened to \neach other, shared ideas and figured out not just ways of accomplishing \ndiverse goals, but also what those goals really should be. And his \nenergy and willingness to take on the most difficult task with little \npublic recognition or thanks was legendary.\n  Senator Coverdell was a man who listened. He listened to Senators and \nstaff and policy experts. He listened to those he agreed with and those \nhe didn't--and merged it all into a comprehensive, concise and workable \nplan. He respected all individuals with an honesty and sincerity that \nset the tone for working together.\n  Most of all, and through it all, Senator Coverdell was kind and \ngracious in his dealings with everyone. The country, his state, and all \nof us who have been privileged to know him will miss him terribly. We \njoin in praying for his family as they suffer his loss. We have all \nlost a very good friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/20/senate-section/article/S7310-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7310-S7349]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND \n          RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2001--Continued\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \nCochran amendment be laid aside.\n  Mr. REID. Objection.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, at the appropriate time I intend to \npropose an amendment. I will be glad to discuss it at this time. \nPerhaps the Senator from Nevada could clarify for me when it might be \nappropriate.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, when Senators Voinovich and Leahy took the \nfloor, the purpose was to allow them to speak about our dearly departed \nfriend. At the time the quorum was called for, we were trying to \nresolve this issue that was on the floor--the Harkin amendment and the \nsecond degree by the manager of the bill. We are almost ready to do \nthat. I was asked by the Senator from Iowa to hold things up until that \nwas resolved. That is why I offered the objection. We should be in a \nposition soon to move forward, but I think the Senator should go ahead \nand speak.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, is it the desire of the distinguished \nmanager, the Senator from Mississippi, that I go ahead and discuss the \namendment or wait until a resolution of the pending Harkin and Cochran \namendments?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I have no objection to the Senator \nproceeding. I think it would expedite the proceedings of the Senate if \nhe would discuss his amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I am prepared to enter into a time agreement on this \namendment. Whatever is agreeable to the Senator from Mississippi and \nthe Senator from Wisconsin would be fine.\n  I will be proposing an amendment, joined by Senators Gregg and \nSchumer, that will stop the Federal Government from wasting taxpayers' \ndollars on an unnecessary and outdated sugar program that costs \nconsumers as much as $2 billion in inflated sugar prices.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have Senator Lugar added as a cosponsor of \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The amendment is simple. It withholds funding for the \ncostly Federal sugar program for fiscal year 2001.\n  Mr. President, my colleagues and I are here today to say enough is \nenough. The American taxpayers have subsidized the sugar industry, with \nprice support loans and strict import quotas in various forms, since \n1934. Each year American taxpayers pay close to $2 billion in \nartificially high sugar prices and this year paid an additional $60 \nmillion to bail out sugar producers facing massive loan defaults.\n  We're not here today to dispute the choice of sugar as a consumer \nproduct. Most Americans buy some type of sugar product on a daily \nbasis--a can of soda or a candy bar--and most Americans buy various \ntypes of sugar products every time they shop in a supermarket. What we \nobject to, as consumers purchase these products, is that the federal \ngovernment is unfairly overcharging them.\n  The sugar program has outlived other agricultural commodity subsidies \nthat have since been phased out through past farm bills. However, the \nretention of this flawed program has not been dictated by common sense \nor sound economics, but political influence.\n  Originally, the sugar program was intended to prop up sugar prices to \nensure a profit for sugar farmers. Unfortunately, the higher prices \nresult in the usual ``trickle-down'' effect. Food companies have to pay \nthe higher price for sugar, which is then passed on in the form of \nhigher prices for sugar products. The average consumer ends up paying \nthe cost of sugar subsidies in the grocery store.\n  Let me take a few moments to explain why federal assistance for the \nsugar program should end.\n  First of all, it is unfair to American consumers. A recent GAO report \nconfirms what we have known all along,\n\n[[Page S7311]]\n\nthat American consumers pay close to $2 billion each year in inflated \nsugar prices. Mandatory price quotas are imposed on American-grown \nsugar at roughly 22-24 cents a pound compared to 6 cents a pound for \nsugar grown in other parts of the world.\n  This past year, in 1999, U.S. sugar prices were four times higher \nthan the world price.\n  The benefits of the sugar program are hopelessly lopsided. \nApproximately 42 percent of all sugar program benefits go to 1 percent \nof growers. These are not small family farmers, but big sugar tycoons \nwho obtained millions through this federal subsidy. Four sugar cane \ncompanies in Florida received more than $20 million. One grower \nreceives close to $65 million annually from this subsidy. About 30 \nsugar growers were also able to collect one million each from this \nsubsidy. That is not small business; that is not a small farmer.\n  Mr. President, these sugar growers--and I will be naming them and \nidentifying them--have been incredibly generous politically. They have \nbeen heavily involved in contributing to both parties in very large \namounts of money.\n  Second, the federal sugar program is anti-free market and anti-free \ntrade. The sugar program severely limits imports of lower-priced \nforeign sugar into the American market so farmers can make a profit \nthrough higher prices.\n  The end result, unfortunately, is that this overpricing has caused an \noverproduction of sugar. This excess supply of sugar drives prices \nbelow the guaranteed price level. This type of policy is absurd and has \ndamaged our credibility in the world market.\n  Large-scale sugar growers in Florida contribute directly to the \ndevastation of the Everglades wetlands through increasing sugar cane \nproduction. Again, high sugar prices lead to overproduction of sugar. \nFlorida's sugarcane industry is situated near one of America's most \npristine freshwater lakes. The direct conversion of sensitive wetlands \nto sugarcane production and the accompanying agricultural runoff \nflowing into the Everglades have a direct impact in the decimation of \none of America's most treasured ecosystems.\n  For years, sugar cane producers were able to resist and avoid any \nresponsibility for cleanup. The small portion they are now required to \npay for cleanup hardly makes a dent into the billions estimated for \nrestoration of the Everglades.\n  Who makes up the difference in these costs? Again, the taxpayers make \nup the difference by paying nearly a third of the restoration costs.\n  I have spent a fair amount of time in the State of Florida. There is \na growing, deep, and very legitimate concern about the Everglades. \nThere is no doubt that the flow of pesticides into the Everglades is \ndirectly related to sugarcane growing and has had a direct impact on \nthe ecology of that very fragile ecosystem which is an American \ntreasure, not just a Florida treasure. We should at best not subsidize \npeople who engage in the growing of sugarcane which causes direct \ndamage to one of the most beautiful spots in all the world.\n  Finally, American taxpayers had to pay for a multi-million bail out \nfor sugar processors who did not meet their loan obligations. Earlier \nthis year, the administration spent $60 million to purchase more than \n150,000 tons of surplus sugar to prevent mass forfeitures.\n  Why are taxpayers bearing the brunt of these defaulted loans? Because \na fundamental flaw in the federal sugar policy allows sugar producers \nto forfeit their crops to USDA if the market price falls below the loan \nrate. Sugar producers turn over excess sugar to USDA, keep their loan \nmoney and the federal government has to absorb the loss. In other \nwords, if sugar producers are unable to sell their sugar, the federal \ngovernment promises to buy all the sugar they produce.\n  Often, forfeited sugar is sold at a substantial loss to the federal \ngovernment. The federal government has no options under the existing \nsugar program--if the government does not spend millions buying excess \nsugar, it loses out anyway as sugar processors default on their loans \nand are not required to pay back to the federal government. With a \nsurplus of sugar in the world market, the federal government will not \nbe able to sell this excess unwanted sugar. It's a double-whammy.\n  Mr. President, these forfeitures are a direct cost to the American \ntaxpayers.\n  And, even worse, this may be only a foreshadowing of a tidal wave yet \nto come. The federal government may be forced to spend millions more in \npurchasing additional sugar if the sugar industry has their way. The \nbig sugar lobby is already pressuring USDA to purchase more sugar at a \ncost of $100 to $500 million on further sugar bail-outs before the end \nof this year.\n  How is this absurdity allowed to continue?\n  Mr. President, the answer is clear. The sugar program is alive \nbecause of well-financed sugar interests, or the ``Iron Triangle'' of \nthe commodity world. Sugar interest represent one of the highest soft \nmoney contributors nationwide.\n  Between 1995 to 1999, the sugar industry contributed more than $7 \nmillion in soft-money contributions, more than any other commodity \ngroup. In 1999 alone, the sugar industry contributed $1.5 million in \nsoft-money contributions to both sides of the aisle. The famous Fanjul \nfamily of Flo-Sun sugar industries, known as the ``First Family of \nCorporate Welfare,'' are among the most generous benefactors in soft \nmoney contributions. Sugar interests are cashing in at the register at \nthe expense of consumers, and turning that profit into political \ninfluence to keep their stronghold on this federal subsidy.\n  Before I conclude, I want to highlight several commentaries about the \nsugar program in a few prominent media programs and articles.\n  Fallacies of the sugar program earned special coverage as part of a \n``Fleecing of America'' segment on NBC's ``Nightly News with Tom \nBrokaw.'' During this segment, Art Jaeger from the Consumer Federation \nof America claims, ``the program gives too little money to the farmers \nwho need the help, too much money to farmers who don't need the help.''\n  ABC World News Tonight highlighted sugar subsidies as part of its \n``Its Your Money'' segments, telling all Americans that maintaining the \nsugar program is a way ''to guarantee that even more farmers will take \nadvantage of this sweet deal, producing even more sugar, meaning more \ntaxpayer bailouts.''\n  The Center for Responsive Politics touts the sugar program as ``white \ngold'' for sugar producers and characterizes it as the ``Energizer \nBunny of U.S. government policy,'' It keeps going and going with no end \nin sight.\n  The Center for International Economics stated that the ``U.S. Sugar \nProgram does not sit comfortably as part of U.S. trade policy. High \nsugar protection harms the credibility of U.S. initiatives for freer \ntrade.'' The World trade Organization has pointed out its \ninefficiencies. The World Bank has dedicated consideration attention to \nthe high costs of U.S. sugar policies.\n  The National Center for Public Policy Research concluded that the \nsugar program was ``one of the federal government's most ridiculous \nprograms'' and should be ended.\n  In a recent USA Today editorial, advice was offered to politicians--\n``Repeal this sweetheart deal before another crop of unneeded sugar \ngets planted.''\n  The Coalition for Sugar Reform also supports elimination of this \ncostly program. The Coalition represents such groups as Citizens \nAgainst Government Waste, Everglades Trust, Consumers for World Trade, \nand the United States Cane Sugar Refiners' Association.\n  In a letter of support for ending the program, the Coalition states \nthe amendment we are offering today ``will finally compel change in a \nprogram that can no longer be sustained or justified.''\n  What more evidence do we need to end this lop-sided sugar policy? Why \nshould the federal government and American taxpayers be expected to \ncontinue support for this program that is running rampantly out of \ncontrol and clearly violates free market and free trade principles?\n  Mr. President, I want to make clear once again--today's vote is \nimportant to protect American consumers and taxpayers.\n  The recent million-dollar sugar bail-out is the final straw that will \nbreak the camel's back for this failed program.\n\n[[Page S7312]]\n\n  I would like to quote from the New York Times editorial of July 14, \n1997.\n\n       A combination of import restrictions, guaranteed prices and \n     subsidized loans keeps sugar prices artificially high, \n     roughly twice the level in other countries, and thus \n     transfers about $1.5 billion a year from consumers to a \n     handful of large sugar growers. Almost half of the benefits \n     from the sugar program go to little more than 1 percent of \n     growers. The high prices act like a tax on food, hitting \n     hardest at poor families who typically spend a large fraction \n     of their budget on food and other necessities. If the \n     Schumer-Miller proposal passes, sugar prices could fall 20 \n     cents for a five-pound bag.\n       The sugar growers justify their subsidies as needed to \n     counter foreign-subsidized imports and to protect the jobs of \n     domestic workers. Neither argument withstands scrutiny. There \n     are ample rules to prevent foreign countries from ``dumping'' \n     government-subsidized sugar in United States markets. Also, \n     by propping up raw sugar prices, the program has driven half \n     the United States sugar refiners out of business or out of \n     the country, taking jobs with them.\n       There is a second, powerful reason to eliminate sugar \n     subsidies. They breed excessive production of sugar cane in \n     environmentally sensitive areas. In the Florida Everglades, \n     about a half-million acres of wetlands have been converted to \n     sugar cane production. Excessive sugar cane production has \n     interrupted water flows and contaminated the Everglades with \n     polluted agricultural run-off.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the New York Times \neditorial and the Wall Street Journal article of April 27, 2000, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, April 27, 2000]\n\n          Big Sugar Seeks Bailout, Gives Money to Help Get Way\n\n                          (By Bruce Ingersoll)\n\n       Washington.--Never have old hands at the Agriculture \n     Department seen such a turnout: 11 U.S. senators trooping \n     into Secretary Dan Glickman's office to lobby for a big \n     sugar-industry bailout.\n       ``When you have 11 senators showing up,'' says Florida \n     sugar-company executive Robert Buker, ``that's horse-\n     power''--enough power, he believes, to push an ambivalent \n     Clinton administration into an unprecedented market \n     intervention to bail out distressed U.S. sugar producers.\n       The producers are floundering beneath a market-depressing \n     glut of sugar. Comes October, they face another problem: a \n     ten-fold jump in Mexican sugar imports. The federal sugar-\n     loan program, which has cosseted them for nearly two decades \n     is suddenly in danger of imploding.\n       So, to shore up the domestic market, sugar lobbyists are \n     imploring administration officials to authorize a bold sugar-\n     buying spree. Only by spending $100 million now to buy sugar \n     and boost market prices, they contend, can the government \n     hope to head off a much costlier wave of sugar-loan \n     forfeitures later this summer, in the midst of an election \n     campaign.\n       Fighting the sugar lobby at every turn is a well-financed \n     alliance of consumer groups, candy makers, confectioners and \n     other major users of sweeteners. Their vision of the sweet \n     hereafter is a deregulated sugar industry, and they want the \n     administration to let the market sink. Says Jeff Nedelman, \n     spokesman for the Coalition for Sugar Reform: ``The whole \n     house of cards is starting to collapse.''\n       The government has long managed to keep U.S. sugar prices \n     far above the world price, largely by curtailing imports of \n     lower-cost sugar. That benefits producers, obviously, though \n     it also means consumers get stuck with a price-support tab--\n     estimated at more than $1 billion a year--in the form of \n     higher sugar, candy and soft-drink prices.\n       But in recent months, due to rising sugar plantings and \n     improving yields, prices have fallen below the guaranteed \n     price-support levels of 18 cents a pound for raw cane sugar \n     and 22.9 cents for refined beet sugar. Lately, price are up a \n     little in anticipation of a bailout. Under the loan program, \n     sugar processors who put up sugar as collateral are entitled \n     to forfeit their crop, keep the loan money and let the \n     government eat the loss.\n       Processors are threatening to forfeit as much as 1.4 \n     million tons of sugar valued at an estimated $550 million. \n     The sugar lobby's pitch to Mr. Glickman and White House \n     officials is that buying 300,000 to 350,000 tons immediately \n     will give the market enough lift to avert massive forfeitures \n     at the end of August and September. Sugar prices are at a 20-\n     year low,'' says Sen. Larry Crag, an Idaho Republican. ``The \n     potential for loan forfeitures . . . is very real.''\n       The senators visiting Mr. Glickman on March 26--all but one \n     from major sugar-producing states--told the agriculture \n     secretary that ``he needed to get on the stick,'' says Mr. \n     Buker, senior vice president of United States Sugar Corp., \n     the nation's largest processor. On April 6, a dozen sugar-\n     state lawmakers met with White House Chief of Staff John \n     Podesta. They and the industry fear costly forfeitures would \n     be a public-relations debacle, sparking moves in Congress to \n     scrap the shaky program.\n       Administration officials wouldn't be so hesitant about \n     buying heaps of sugar if they knew what to do with it. One \n     option is to sell excess sugar on the world market at cut-\n     rate prices, but that would-be just as controversial as \n     Europe's oft-deplored dumping practices. Another is to donate \n     it overseas as humanitarian aid, but so far no country has \n     shown any interest in empty calories.\n       Limited amounts could possibly be used for school lunches \n     and other feeding programs. The only other viable option is \n     to use it as feedback for ethanol plants, but it would have \n     to be dirt-cheap to compete with corn, which sells for a \n     nickel a pound.\n       Diverting sugar into ethanol, a fuel additive, would \n     displace corn, costing farmers $100 million a year, the \n     National Corn Growers Association argues. They shouldn't have \n     to ``shoulder the burden'' of bailing out sugar producers, \n     the association says.\n       Adding to the difficulty of a bailout is the opposition \n     from politicians who represent more sugar consumers than \n     producers. Splurging on sugar would be a ``quick fix'' of \n     ``dubious legality,'' 15 House members asserted in a \n     bipartisan letter. It would bestow a ``bonanza'' on \n     processors, without preventing forfeitures in the end, Senate \n     Agriculture Committee Chairman Richard Lugar cautioned last \n     week. The Indiana Republican also warned that ``dumping'' \n     sugar overseas would infuriate trading partners.\n       Ultimately, though, such considerations may not offset the \n     political leverage of Big Sugar, which gave Democrats and \n     Republicans $7.2 million between 1995 and 1999, more than any \n     other commodity group in Washington. The fact that the \n     meeting with Mr. Glickman was attended by New Jersey Sen. \n     Robert Torricelli, who hails from a state with no sugar \n     growers but is chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign \n     Committee, highlights sugar's importance in an election year.\n       At least three sugar states--Michigan, Ohio and Florida--\n     are seen as being in play in the presidential race. Earlier \n     this year, Florida Crystals Inc., owned by the Cuban-born \n     Fanjul family, gave Sen. Torricelli's committee $50,000. Last \n     July, Alfson Fanjul hosted a $25,000-a-couple dinner, \n     attended by President Clinton, raising more than $1 million \n     for the Florida Democratic Party. Mr. Fanjul is renowned for \n     calling up the president to discuss sugar-related issues.\n       Particularly desperate are three big Hawaiian sugar-cane \n     producers, Gay & Robinson Sugar Co., an Alexander & Baldwin \n     Inc. subsidiary and Amfac/JMB-Hawai; Inc., whose first \n     shipload of the season is due to reach the mainland next \n     week. Unlike their counterparts, they are ``price-takers,'' \n     says the lobbyist, Dalton Yancey. Under an exclusive contract \n     with a refinery on San Francisco Bay, they are obligated to \n     base the price of arriving shiploads on the going New York \n     price, no matter how far it falls below the guaranteed price-\n     support level. The contract doesn't allow putting sugar under \n     loan or forfeiting it.\n       Adding to the industry's problems is a looming surge of \n     Mexican imports. In October, under, terms of the North \n     American Free Trade Agreement, Mexico will be free to ship \n     250,000 metric tons of low-duty sugar into the U.S.\n       Despite more than a 20% drop in prices since 1996, sugar \n     production is still much more profitable than raising grain \n     or cotton. The result is that the nation's 10,000 cans and \n     beet growers are shifting more land into sugar. Their \n     lobbyists portray them as suffering from agriculture's woes, \n     including crop failures and lost markets, when in fact most \n     fare better than nonsugar producers.\n       All told, the sugar problem threatens to haunt the White \n     House and Vice President Al Gore's presidential bid. It could \n     complicate the coming visit of Mexico's president to \n     Washington, and could further hamstring U.S. efforts to open \n     up overseas markets for meat, corn sweetener and other \n     foodstuffs.\n       Ironically, the administration could have avoided the whole \n     sticky mess. But Messrs. Glickman and Podesta, under intense \n     industry pressure, went along with an administrative decision \n     last fall to reinstate the guaranteed minimum price, even \n     though under a 1996 change in the loan program it shouldn't \n     have been offered to processors.\n       Now, the industry is arguing that ``sugar is in crisis,'' \n     in the words of Jack Roney, economist for the American Sugar \n     Alliance.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 14, 1997]\n\n                         End Sugar's Sweet Deal\n\n       The House will vote again soon on whether to eliminate loan \n     subsidies that keep sugar prices high while fostering \n     destruction of the Florida Everglades. A bipartisan proposal \n     sponsored by Charles Schumer, Democrat of New York, and Dan \n     Miller, Republican of Florida, to phase out sugar subsidies \n     barely lost last year. It may come up for another vote this \n     week in the form of an amendment to an appropriations bill. \n     That will give the House a second chance to put the interests \n     of consumers and the environment over those of a small crowd \n     of politically powerful sugar growers.\n       A combination of import restrictions, guaranteed prices and \n     subsidized loans keep sugar prices artificially high, roughly \n     twice the level in other countries, and thus transfers about \n     $1.5 billion a year from consumers to a handful of large \n     sugar growers. Almost half of the benefits from the sugar \n     program go to little more than 1 percent of growers. The high \n     prices act like a tax on food, hitting hardest at poor \n     families who typically\n\n[[Page S7313]]\n\n     spend a large fraction of their budget on food and other \n     necessities. If the Schumer-Miller proposal passes, sugar \n     prices could fall 20 cents for a five-pound bag.\n       The sugar growers justify their subsidies as needed to \n     counter foreign-subsidized imports and to protect the jobs of \n     domestic workers. Neither argument withstands scrutiny. There \n     are ample rules to prevent foreign countries. from \n     ``dumping'' government-subsized sugar in United States \n     markets. Also, by propping up raw sugar prices, the program \n     has driven half the United States sugar refiners out of \n     business or out of the country, taking jobs with them.\n       There is a second, powerful reason to eliminate sugar \n     subsidies. They breed excessive production of sugar cane in \n     environmentally sensitive areas. In the Florida Everglades, \n     about a half-million acres of wetlands have been converted to \n     sugar cane production. Excessive sugar cane production has \n     interrupted water flows and contaminated the Everglades with \n     polluted agricultural run-off.\n       When the Schumer-Miller bill comes up for a vote, \n     representatives who claim to defend the interests of ordinary \n     consumers ought to vote yes. The bill lost narrowly last year \n     in part because some urban representatives--including Gary \n     Ackerman, Jose Serrano and Thomas Manton of New York--voted \n     no. They harmed their own constituents but can make amends \n     this week.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I now quote from the April 27, 2000, \narticle from the Wall Street Journal entitled ``Big Sugar Seeks \nBailout.''\n\n       Never have old hands at the Agriculture Department seen \n     such a turnout: 11 U.S. senators trooping into Secretary Dan \n     Glickman's office to lobby for a big sugar-industry bailout.\n       ``When you have 11 senators showing up,'' says Florida \n     sugar-company executive Robert Buker, ``that's horsepower''--\n     enough power, he believes, to push an ambivalent Clinton \n     administration into an unprecedented market intervention to \n     bail out distressed U.S. sugar producers.\n       The producers are floundering beneath a market-depressing \n     glut of sugar. Come October, they face another problem: a \n     tenfold jump in Mexican sugar imports. The federal sugar-loan \n     program, which has cosseted them for nearly two decades, is \n     suddenly in danger of imploding.\n       So, to shore up the domestic market, sugar lobbyists are \n     imploring administration officials to authorize a bold sugar-\n     buying spree. Only by spending $100 million now to buy sugar \n     and boost market prices, they contend, can the government \n     hope to head off a much costlier wave of sugar-loan \n     forfeitures later this summer, in the midst of an election \n     campaign.\n\n  Mr. President, the article is very revealing in that it describes the \ntop contributors in the year 1999 and the amounts of money that have \nbeen distributed. It is quite remarkable in its entirety.\n  I quote from an article in Time magazine, November 1998, entitled: \n``Sweet Deal, Why Are These Men Smiling? The Reason is in Your Sugar \nBowl.''\n\n       Occupying a breathtaking spot on the southeast coast of the \n     Dominican Republic, Casa de Campo is one of the Caribbean's \n     most storied resorts . . . and that's truth in advertising. \n     The place has 14 swimming pools, a world-class shooting \n     ground, PGA-quality golf courses and $1,000-a-night villas.\n       A thousand miles to the northwest, in the Florida \n     Everglades, the vista is much different. Chemical runoff from \n     the corporate cultivation of sugar cane imperils vegetation \n     and wildlife. Polluted water spills out of the glades into \n     Florida Bay, forming a slimy, greenish brown stain where \n     fishing once thrived.\n       Both sites are the by-product of corporate welfare.\n       In this case the beneficiaries are the Fanjul family of \n     Palm Beach, Fla. The name means nothing to most Americans, \n     but the Fanjuls might be considered the First Family of \n     Corporate Welfare. They own Flo-Sun Inc., one of the nation's \n     largest producers of raw sugar. As such, they benefit from \n     federal policies that compel American consumers to pay \n     artificially high prices for sugar.\n       Since the Fanjuls control about one-third of Florida's \n     sugar-cane production, that means they collect at least $60 \n     million a year in subsidies, according to an analysis of \n     General Accounting Office calculations. It's the sweetest of \n     deals, and it's made the family, the proprietors of Casa de \n     Campo, one of America's richest.\n       The subsidy has had one other consequence: it has helped \n     create an environmental catastrophe in the Everglades. \n     Depending on whom you talk to, it will cost anywhere from $3 \n     billion to $8 billion to repair the Everglades by building \n     new dikes, rerouting canals and digging new lakes.\n       Growers are committed to pay up to $240 million over 20 \n     years for the cleanup. Which means the industry that created \n     much of the problem will have to pay only a fraction of the \n     cost to correct it. Government will pay the rest. As for the \n     Fanjuls, a spokesman says they are committed to pay about \n     $4.5 million a year.\n\n  Do a little arithmetic. We got $60 million in Federal subsidies, of \nwhich they will pay $4.5 million for the Everglades. Not a bad deal.\n\n       How did this disaster happen? With your tax dollars. How \n     will it be fixed? With your tax dollars.\n       It is not news that sugar is richly subsidized, or that the \n     Fanjuls have profited so handsomely. Even as recently as \n     1995, when Congress passed legislation to phase out price \n     supports for a cornucopia of agricultural products, raw sugar \n     was spared. Through a combination of loan guarantees and \n     tariffs on imported sugar, domestic farmers like the Fanjuls \n     are shielded from real-world prices. So in the U.S., raw \n     sugar sells for about twenty-two cents a pound, more than \n     double the prices most of the world pays. The cost to \n     Americans: at least $1.4 billion in the form of higher prices \n     for candy, soda and other sweet things of life. A GAO study, \n     moreover, has estimated that nearly half the subsidy goes to \n     large sugar producers like the Fanjuls.\n       A spokesman for Flo-Sun, Jorge Dominicis, said the company \n     disagrees with the GAO's estimate on the profits the Fanjuls \n     and other growers derive from the program.\n       ``That is supposed to imply somehow that our companies \n     receive $60 million in guaranteed profits,'' he said, ``and \n     that is flat-out not true. Our companies don't make anywhere \n     near that kind of profit.''\n       Dominicis, like other proponents of the sugar program, \n     contends that it doesn't cost taxpayers a penny and is not \n     unlike government protection of other American industries. \n     ``If our [sugar policy] is corporate welfare, which I don't \n     believe it is, then all trade policy is corporate welfare,'' \n     he says.\n       Flo-Sun is run by four Fanjul brothers, Alfonso \n     (``Alfie''), Jose (``Pepe''), Andres and Alexander. Their \n     family dominated Cuba's sugar industry for decades, and they \n     came to this country with their parents in 1959, after Fidel \n     Castro seized power. The Fanjuls arrived just as a U.S. Army \n     Corps of Engineers project to control the flow of water in \n     the Florida Everglades made large-scale development possible. \n     The total acreage planted in sugar cane there soared--from \n     50,000 acres in 1960 to more than 420,000 today.\n       Within that swampy paradise lies yet another subsidy. Each \n     year, according to a 1997 estimate, the Army Corps of \n     Engineers spends $63 million to control water flow in central \n     and south Florida. This enables growers to obtain water when \n     they need it or restrain the flow during heavy rains. Of the \n     $63 million, the Corps estimates $52 million is spent on \n     agriculture, mainly sugar-cane farmers, in the Everglades.\n\n  The article further states:\n\n       Though by no means the largest special interest in \n     Washington, the sugar lobby is one of the most well-heeled. \n     And among growers, the Fanjuls are big givers. And among \n     growers, the Fanjuls are big givers. Family members and \n     corporate executives have contributed nearly $1 million so \n     far in this decade, dividing the money fairly evenly between \n     political parties.\n       This knack for covering for political bases carries all the \n     way to the top of the Fanjul empire. Alfonso Fanjul served as \n     co-chairman of Bill Clinton's Florida campaign in 1992. His \n     brother Pepe was national vice chairman of finance for Bob \n     Dole's presidential campaign in 1996 and was host to a \n     $1,000-a-head fund raiser for Dole at his Palm Beach mansion. \n     After Clinton's 1992 victory, Alfie was a member of the \n     select group invited by the Clinton camp to attend the \n     President-elect's ``economic summit'' in Little Rock, Ark.\n       Careful readers of Kenneth Starr's impeachment report to \n     Congress will note that on Feb. 19, 1996. . . . The two spoke \n     for 22 minutes. The topic: a proposed tax on sugar farmers to \n     pay for the Everglades cleanup. Fanjul reportedly told the \n     President he and other growers opposed such a step, since it \n     would cost them millions. Such a tax has never been passed.\n  That is access.\n  I will be glad to continue this debate, and I will be glad to again \nenter into a time agreement on this amendment when it is appropriate \nfor me to have it considered by the full Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Brownback and Senator \nFitzgerald as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask my colleague from Mississippi--I know he has the \nright to the floor--could I make a request to my colleagues? I have \nbeen on the floor for several hours waiting to introduce an amendment. \nI ask unanimous consent that after the McCain amendment I be allowed to \nintroduce an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I understand we have been able to reach an agreement on \nthe list of amendments remaining in order to be offered to this bill.

Mr. President, I understand not all of the agreement can \nbe agreed to at this point, but I will recite that which can be agreed \nto if there is no objection. We will see if there is.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following amendments be the only \nremaining first-degree amendments in order to the pending Agriculture \nappropriations bill, that they be subject to relevant second-degree \namendments, and no points of order be considered waived by this \nagreement.\n  I will submit a list of amendments rather than reading them.\n  The list follows:\n\n       Jeffords: Drug importation.\n       Burns: Crop Insurance Program.\n       B.

Mr. President, I could spend more time. I ask unanimous \nconsent an article from the Savannah Morning News entitled ``Two Sides \nof the American Dream'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Savannah Morning News, August 3, 1997]\n\n                    Two Sides of the American Dream\n\n                            (By Bob Sechler)\n\n       By some accounts, Alfonso and Jose Fanjul personify the \n     American Dream--Cuban-born immigrants who arrived in the \n     United States almost 40 years ago, emerging as millionaire \n     sugar growers through pluck and hard work.\n       But others say the brothers are better symbols of what ails \n     the country. Their ostentatious lifestyles, complete with \n     Palm Beach, Fla., mansions, yachts and chauffeured \n     limousines, are the spoils of a corporate welfare system that \n     rewards wheeler-dealers willing to ante up for political \n     influence, critics say.\n       ``They know how to play the game, and they know who to hire \n     to play the game,'' said Joe Garcia, a representative of Save \n     the Everglades in Florida, an environmental group that has \n     tangled repeatedly with the Fanjuls (pronounced Fahn-hool) \n     and their Flo-Sun sugar empire.\n       Regardless of which Fanjul family portrait proves most \n     accurate, Savannahians likely will get to know the brothers \n     well.\n       The Fanjuls and Flo-Sun will hold a controlling interest in \n     Savannah Foods and Industries--a major local employer and an \n     80-year corporate fixture in Chatham County--if a proposed \n     merger with a Flo-Sun subsidiary is approved by Savannah \n     Foods' stockholders in October.\n       ``One thing you can say about them is they know sugar,'' \n     said Tom Hammer of the Sweetener Users Association.\n       Hammer's group, which represents candy manufacturers and \n     other industrial sugar users, has lined up against the \n     Fanjuls--and lost--in political battles over the federal \n     sugar program, which provides huge benefits to growers such \n     as Flo-Sun.\n       Still, Hammer voices a grudging respect for the family and \n     its sugar success.\n       ``They are formidable opponents in terms of knowing what is \n     the best system for them and being willing to stand up for \n     it,'' he said. ``That is the political system at work.''\n\n\n                          from cuba to florida\n\n       The Fanjuls' roots in sugar date to pre-revolutionary Cuba, \n     where their family had dominated the industry since the 19th \n     century.\n       But the family fled Cuba when Fidel Castro came to power, \n     buying 4,000 acres in Florida in 1960 and beginning Flo-Sun.\n       The company's success since then has been phenomenal, \n     ballooning to 180,000 acres of cane fields and accounting for \n     40 percent of the sugar grown in Florida. The worth of the \n     private sugar empire has been estimated at $500 million, not \n     including extensive outside holdings by the family elsewhere \n     in the United States and in the Dominican Republic.\n       But the success of Flo-Sun, and of the Fanjul brothers who \n     now run it, is attributable as much to acknowledge of the \n     sugar industry as it is to a knack for American-style \n     politics.\n       The Fanjuls--Alfonso, 59, Jose, 53, and other family \n     members--have been active at all levels of government when \n     their interests are at stake, and they've always been willing \n     to back up their positions with their checkbooks.\n       They helped fight off a proposed Florida measure last year \n     that would have assessed a penny-a-pound tax on raw sugar to \n     fund Everglades restoration. Flo-Sun and other Florida sugar \n     growers combined on a $22.7 million campaign aimed at \n     defeating the plan, compared to $13 million spent by Florida \n     environmentalists and other proponents of it.\n       Neither brother is a U.S. citizen, but Alfonso co-chaired \n     President Clinton's 1992 Florida campaign and Jose served on \n     the campaign finance committee of 1996 GOP contender Bob \n     Dole. The two Fanjuls recently applied for U.S. citizenship.\n       Flo-Sun and its subsidiaries donated $224,500 to the \n     national Democratic Party from 1995-1996 and $319,000 to the \n     Republicans. The amounts don't include contributions to \n     individual candidates.\n       ``The Fanjul brothers play interesting, both-sides-of-the-\n     street politics here in Washington,'' said Burton Eller, who \n     has faced off against Flo-Sun as chairman of the Coalition \n     for Sugar Reform, a group bent on dismantling the federal \n     program that benefits sugar growers such as Flo-Sun.\n       Some observers say the goal of the brothers' two-pronged \n     politicking has been to preserve the status quo--which \n     includes a lucrative federal system of price supports and \n     import quotas that benefit domestic sugar growers.\n       Others dismiss the criticism as the whining of losers.\n       ``Their efforts to be involved in government are \n     commendable,'' said U.S. Rep. Mark Foley, a Florida \n     Republican who represents the Fanjuls' south Florida home \n     base.\n       ``When has that become a crime?'' asked Foley, who \n     collected $4,000 in contributions from the brothers and Flo-\n     Sun last year. ``They live here. They pay taxes. They employ \n     people, and they live within the boundaries of the system.''\n       Flo-Sun received up to $64 million in benefits in one year \n     alone under the federal sugar program, according to an \n     estimate by the government's General Accounting Office.\n       The Fanjuls and other sugar growers won a heated political \n     battle last year to maintain the program. The federal price \n     supports and import quotas that benefit sugar growers are \n     preserved in the 1996 federal Farm Bill, which outlines farm \n     policy through 2002, even though subsidies for many other \n     farm products are being phased out.\n\n\n                           Expensive victory\n\n       But the win in the Farm Bill fight cost the Fanjuls more \n     than money. It came at a time of increased scrutiny on \n     campaign finance and when consumer advocacy groups were \n     blasting the federal sugar program as nothing more than a \n     handout to big sugar growers.\n       The timing brought unwanted focus on the Fanjuls--known for \n     being intensely private--and resulted in them being dubbed \n     ``poster boys for corporate welfare,'' among other things, in \n     unflattering profiles in several national publications.\n       Photographs of their sports cars and mansions and \n     descriptions of a jet-setting lifestyle fueled the fire.\n       Flo-Sun spokesman Jorge Dominicis said the Fanjuls couldn't \n     comment this week because of a mandated Securities and \n     Exchange Commission ``quite time'' leading up to all mergers \n     involving public companies, such as Savannah Foods. \n     Representatives of Savannah Foods have declined comment for \n     the same reason.\n       But Foley said much of the focus on the Fanjuls' lifestyle \n     and political activity has been unfair.\n       ``Some of it is born out of, I don't want to say prejudice, \n     but they are Cubans and they've come here and they've been \n     very successful,'' he said.\n       ``They came from a land where all their property was taken \n     (by Castro), and they've emerged very successful. It's been \n     called corporate welfare, but they play on the same playing \n     field as everyone else.''\n       Luther Markwart, chairman of the U.S. Sugar Beet Growers \n     Association, an ally of cane growers such as Flo-Sun, also \n     said the criticism of the Fanjuls is baseless.\n       ``They're very smart businessmen and their family has been \n     in sugar for six generations,''. Markwart said. ``The people \n     that are calling them the names, are the big industrial users \n     (of sugar) and some of the environmentalists down there'' in \n     Florida.\n       None of the public criticisms of the Fanjuls has questioned \n     their business acumen.\n       Still, Savananah Foods stock has plummeted since the \n     announcement several weeks ago of the proposed merger with a \n     Flo-Sun subsidiary. Stock in Savannah Foods has dropped from \n     nearly $19 a share prior to the announcement to $14.12 a \n     share now.\n       The slide is being attributed largely to a sense that \n     Savannah Foods isn't reaping full value for its assets in the \n     proposed merger.\n       Under the terms of the deal, the Fanjuls and Flo-Sun will \n     control 83 percent of shareholder voting strength in the \n     merged company despite owning only 58 percent of the shares.\n       ``It's basically a question of a public company that is \n     going to be in the hands of private people, for the most \n     part,'' said Victor Zabavsky, an analyst with Value Line \n     Publishing in New York who follows Savannah Foods.\n       But if the merger goes through, Foley said average \n     Savannahians who look to Savannah Foods as a major employer \n     and a good corporate citizen have nothing to fear.\n       ``A lot of the media spotlight on (the Fanjuls) has been \n     negative,'' Foley said. ``But that's not the Fanjuls--they \n     want to be good corporate citizens. They're certainly going \n     to be very concerned with the community and the employment \n     base of Savannah Foods.\n       ``Its not just political coffers they pour money into,'' he \n     said. ``They help virtually every charity that asks. They are \n     very philanthropic.''\n\n\n                              Top stories\n\n     Alfonso Fanjul, 59\n       A native of Cuba who received a bachelor's in business \n     administration from Fordham University in New York City.\n       Chairman and chief executive officer of Flo-Sun.

But \n     last year's Farm Bill fight, along with renewed calls for \n     campaign finance reform, have focused national media \n     attention on Flo-Sun's Fanjul family and its practice of \n     lavish political contributions. Here is a breakdown of what \n     some publications and organizations have had to say about \n     Flo-Sun and the Fanjuls.\n       Center of Responsive Politics: ``With their wealth \n     conservatively estimated at several hundred million dollars, \n     the Fanjuls can afford to spread around lots of political \n     money. And they do. . . . The Florida sugar cane industry's \n     campaign contributions may have helped preserve the federal \n     price-support system for sugar.''\n       George magazine: ``Though Cuban citizens, the Fanjul \n     brothers had proved quick students of American-style wheeling \n     and dealing and before long were living much as they had in \n     their pre-Castro homeland--only protected by even more \n     wealth, power and Teflon.''\n       Mother Jones magazine: ``The Fanjuls' total (political) \n     giving has been consistently underreported because they give \n     through an array of family members, companies, executives and \n     PACs. During the 1995-96 election cycle, members of the \n     Fanjul family contributed $774,500 to federal campaigns. . . \n     . It's an excellent investment. In return, a grateful \n     Congress maintains a sugar price support program worth \n     approximately $65 million annually to the Fanjuls.''\n     U.S. Sugar Corp.\n       U.S. Sugar Corp., another large Florida sugar grower, also \n     is a major beneficiary of the federal sugar program. U.S. \n     Sugar donated a combined $230,000 to the national Democratic \n     and Republican parties in 1995-96, not including \n     contributions to individual candidates.\n       National Enquirer: ``It's the sweetest deal on earth. Every \n     time you buy a pound of sugar grown by the Fanjuls and other \n     U.S. sugar growers, you pay more than a nickel extra--and the \n     money goes right into their pockets.''\n       New York Times: ``The support program (for sugar) has kept \n     some marginal producers in business while producing big \n     profits for more efficient companies. The most conspicuous \n     example of the latter is Flo-Sun, a huge operation north of \n     the Everglades controlled by two brothers, Alfonso and Jose \n     Fanjul . . . Given their obvious interest in keeping the \n     subsidy program alive, the Fanjuls are lavish contributors to \n     politicians in both parties--giving as much as $3 million \n     since 1979, by one estimate.''\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. There was an Associated Press article of May 12 entitled \n``Sugar Growers Get Bailout: Purchase of Surplus Will Cost Taxpayers \nAbout $60 Million.'' I ask unanimous consent that be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Sugar Growers Get Bailout--Purchase of Surplus Will Cost Taxpayers \n                           About $60 Million\n\n                          (By Philip Brasher)\n\n       Washington, May 12--The government plans to buy and store \n     150,000 tons of surplus sugar to bail out farmers who have \n     produced so much of the stuff that prices have dropped 25 \n     percent over the past year.\n       The Agriculture Department put off the decision about what \n     to do with the sugar, which will cost taxpayers about $60 \n     million. The department has considered donating it overseas \n     or else selling it at a steep discount for refining into \n     ethanol, a fuel additive normally made from corn.\n       Growers have been threatening to forfeit to the government \n     as much as $550 million worth of sugar pledged as collateral \n     on federal marketing loans.\n\n\n                       fend off loan forfeitures\n\n       ``We are acting to help address dramatically low sugar \n     prices,'' Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said in \n     announcing the planned purchase. ``By buying U.S. sugar now, \n     we expect to save as much as $6 million in administrative \n     costs that the government might otherwise incur from expected \n     loan forfeitures later this summer.''\n       A coalition of candy- and food-makers, consumer advocates \n     and environmental groups that opposes the sugar program had \n     urged the administration to let prices fall.\n       ``Obviously, the administration has no plan for disposing \n     of the sugar,'' Jeff Nedelman, a spokesman for the group, \n     said today.\n       ``They cannot dump it overseas for fear of igniting a trade \n     war. They cannot give it away for humanitarian aid, because \n     no country wants it, and they cannot refine it into ethanol \n     without fear of depressing corn prices. They have a crisis of \n     their own making and no good answer.''\n\n\n                      further action a possibility\n\n       The department did not rule out buying more sugar. Farmers \n     expect the Clinton administration ``will take further action, \n     as needed, to avoid forfeiture of sugar under loan to the \n     government,'' said Ray VanDriessche, president of the \n     American Sugarbeet Growers Association.\n       Glickman's decision came on the eve of a visit by President \n     Clinton to Minnesota, a major sugar-growing state. Clinton \n     and Glickman were to visit a farm outside of the Minneapolis-\n     St. Paul area today to appeal for Congress to approve \n     permanent trade relations with Cuba.\n       The government guarantees farmers a minimum price for \n     domestic sugar through the loan program and quotas on \n     imports, but increases in domestic production are making it \n     difficult for USDA to control domestic prices.\n       Growers who put their sugar up as collateral for a federal \n     loan have the right to forfeit the crop to the government if \n     prices fall below the guaranteed price.\n\n\n                     surgery needed, not band-aids\n\n       ``The sugar program does not need Band-Aids, it needs major \n     surgery,'' groups opposed to the program said in a letter \n     last month to Glickman.\n       Glickman urged sugar growers to cut back on plantings by \n     idling land in the government's Conservation Reserve Program, \n     which pays farmers to take acreage out of production.\n       ``We expect the sugar industry to rapidly develop \n     conservation and production options that can form the basis \n     of a sustainable sugar policy,'' Glickman said. ``Simply \n     relying on continued government purchases over the longer \n     term is neither feasible nor realistic.''\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I quote:\n\n       The Agriculture Department put off the decision about what \n     to do with the sugar, which will cost taxpayers about $60 \n     million. The department has considered donating it overseas \n     or else selling it at a steep discount for refining into \n     ethanol, a fuel additive normally made from corn.\n       ``The sugar program does not need Band-Aids, it needs major \n     surgery,'' groups opposed to the program said in a letter \n     last month to Glickman.\n       Glickman urged sugar growers to cut back on plantings by \n     idling land in the government's Conservation Reserve Program, \n     which pays farmers to take acreage out of production.\n\n  Obviously, that has not happened.\n  I want to quote from an interesting one on June 16. Brian Williams of \nNBC Nightly News:\n\n       Now time for ``The Fleecing of America.'' We have told you \n     here before about price supports for sugar producers in this \n     country, consumers paying what amounts to a hidden tax. Now, \n     according to a new report from the General Accounting Office, \n     what some already consider an outrageous fleecing of America \n     is about to get even worse. Here's NBC's Lisa Myers.\n       Lisa Myers, reporter. For sugar beet farmers like Craig \n     Halfmann, what critics claim already is a sweet deal is \n     getting even sweeter. The government is using seventy million \n     of your tax dollars to buy a hundred fifty thousand tons of \n     sugar from farmers like Halfmann, enough sugar to lay five-\n     pound bags end-to-end from New York to Los Angeles three \n     times. Why? To prop up sugar prices by reducing supply.\n       Craig Halfmann, sugar beet farmer. We're in a crisis \n     situation and we're just asking the USA to help us out as \n     farmers.\n       Myers. But critics say it's ridiculous and a windfall, \n     especially for big sugar producers, people who make millions. \n     But we'll get to them in a moment. You see, those seventy \n     million taxpayer dollars are in addition to the inflated \n     prices you already pay for sugar and don't even know it.\n       Senator Richard Lugar. This is one of the most serious \n     outrages in the agriculture side consumers have never \n     understood, that they are paying a tax every time they get a \n     pound of sugar.\n       Myers. And a candy bar, and cereal, even canned ham. It's \n     all because of the sugar program, and here's how it works. \n     The government uses import restrictions and price supports to \n     keep the sugar supply down and drive prices up. Today the \n     world price of sugar is about eight cents a pound. But US \n     growers get more than twice that much, about twenty cents. \n     And it all shows up right here, in what you pay. Experts \n     estimate the average family of four spends an extra twenty-\n     six dollars a year for sugar because of the program. This \n     government report says that that works out to almost two \n     billion dollars straight from your pockets to sugar \n     producers. Supporters of the program insist it doesn't cost \n     that much, and say struggling farmers need even more help \n     this year, since bumper sugar crops drove down prices.\n\n[[Page S7317]]\n\n       Unidentified Man. All the government has done is to come in \n     and buy some of the surplus sugar. The government is holding \n     that sugar. They will sell it eventually, possibly even at a \n     profit.\n       Myers. The Agriculture Department claims that buying excess \n     sugar now may save taxpayer money.\n       Keith Collins, USDA Chief Economist. Well, who benefits \n     from the purchase, I think, is the taxpayer. We think that \n     actually saves us some money and at the same time supports \n     prices a little bit now.\n       Myers. Not so, say consumer advocates.\n       Art Jaeger, Consumer Federation of America. The program \n     gives too little money to the farmers who need the help, too \n     much money to farmers who don't need the help.\n       Myers. In fact, the biggest winners of all, critics say, \n     are the biggest sugar growers, like Pepe and Alfonso Fonhoul \n     (sp?) of Palm Beach, Florida. They've earned as much as \n     sixty-five million dollars a year from the program.\n       Jaeger. Anytime you ask consumers to pay one-point-five to \n     two billion dollars a year more for food and the \n     beneficiaries are largely wealthy sugar cane growers in south \n     Florida, I think that's a fleecing of America.\n\n  Mr. President, I am sure I will hear from the opponents of \neliminating this subsidy that this is simply a program for small \nfarmers, for small growers. The facts do not bear that out. I want to \nrepeat, the majority of this sugar subsidy money goes to the large \nsugar farmers who also, coincidentally, happen to be major political \ndonors in the American political process.\n  I do not quite understand how my free-enterprise, free-market, less-\ngovernment-intervention, less-government-regulation colleagues will \ncome here to the floor and argue that somehow this program is good for \nAmerican citizens. It is not. Clearly, the facts state that it is a \nsubsidy paid to a privileged few and it costs American taxpayers and \nAmerican families a great deal of additional money.\n  I know there are a lot of abuses. I know there are a lot of programs \nthat favor a privileged few in American government. But this one is \nperhaps one of the most egregious, and we should stop it.\n  I say to my friends who will oppose this amendment: No. 1, I will be \nglad to means-test this amendment; No. 2, I will be glad to have a \nphaseout of the sugar subsidies as well. If you agree to neither, you \nare basically saying let's let the Fanjul brothers continue to get $65 \nmillion a year in subsidies and let's let the American family pay it.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, today I join my colleague, Senator \nMcCain, to offer an amendment that phases out the Federal sugar \nprogram.\n  The current sugar program is one of the last vestiges of a \ncentralized, subsidized U.S. farm sector which has mostly gone by the \nwayside. This is a special interest program that benefits a handful of \nsugar barons at the expense of every man, woman and child in America.\n  Several years ago, the GAO estimated that consumers paid $1.4 billion \nmore at the cash register because of the sugar price support. Today, \nbecause the world price for sugar is lower and the price paid in the \nU.S. is higher, the cost to consumers could be twice as high.\n  And, and let's not forget that the sugar support system has already \ncost America thousands of refinery jobs. Why? Because the sugar program \nis such a bitter deal, refiners cannot get enough raw cane sugar to \nremain open. In Brooklyn and in Yonkers, we have lost one-third of our \nrefinery jobs in the last decade. And it has already cost the \nEverglades hundreds of acres of pristine wilderness.\n  Four years ago, when we came within five votes in the House of \nterminating the sugar program, the world market price for sugar was \nabout ten cents and the U.S. price about 20 cents. Today the world \nprice is less than a nickel and the U.S. price is almost a quarter. In \nother words, the gulf between the free market and the sugar program is \ngetting wider.\n  Under any reasonable and rational measure the sugar program should be \nrepealed. If the issue is jobs, the environment or the consumer--then \nwe have no choice but to repeal. Standing with me are liberal, moderate \nand conservative members of Congress. Standing with us are liberal, \nmoderate and conservative public interest organizations. At all ends of \nthe political spectrum the answer is the same--it's time to repeal the \nsugar program.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the McCain \namendment today. I certainly will not rise to the challenge the Senator \nfrom Arizona has placed. I never rise to the challenge of the editorial \nboard of the New York Times or the tabloid test of NBC's ``Fleecing of \nAmerica.'' I did that once with the ``Fleecing of America.'' I did \nbecause they were wrong. They had misused their facts, as they are \nmisusing them now, and the Senator from Arizona has brought in those \nfacts.\n  The reality is, I stand on the floor today to defend about 1,000 \nfarmers in my State of Idaho, and I think you will hear from others \ntoday who defend American agriculture and its productive power and its \nability to sustain itself within a world market and our willingness to \nput up reasonable safeguards to assure that sustainability at the local \nlevel. In my case, in Idaho, with nearly 1,000 sugar beet farmers, it \nis necessary and appropriate. I stand, not to apologize whatsoever, but \nto strongly support what I think is a necessary and appropriate \nprogram.\n  As with other commodities, those of us from agricultural States know \nthat many in agriculture today are in crisis. They are at or below \nbreak even by a substantial amount. There is no difference between the \npotato farmer of Idaho or the sugar beet farmer of Idaho or the corn \nfarmer of Iowa today.\n  In the case of sugar, prices this year compared to last summer are \ndown by about 26 percent, and as a result of that, the Government has \nresponded aggressively and appropriately to the crisis in rural \nAmerica, making approximately $70 billion of total expenditures since \n1966 to America's agricultural producers.\n  I am not going to apologize for that, and here is why: Banks are not \ngoing under; farms are not going under; America's food supply on the \nshelf is more abundant, safer, and of a higher quality than ever, at a \nlower price. The American consumer today spends less of his or her \nconsumer dollar for American food, including sugar, than any other \nconsumer in the world.\n  Should we apologize for that? I think not. What we have tried to do--\nand I think we have been reasonably successful--is balance out a \ndomestic program with foreign competition while consistently working to \nopen up foreign markets and clearly to liberalize the whole of the \nagricultural programs of this country.\n  USDA recently did purchase sugar. The Senator from Arizona has spoken \nto that. The reason they did was to try to stabilize the market and \nstabilize the price. There is no question that thousands of jobs in \nrural America depend on that action. I defended that action and I do \nnow with no apology.\n  Sugar policy has run at largely no cost to the U.S. Government since \n1985. I say that because what the Senator from Arizona failed to talk \nabout was the amount of money directly contributed by the industry \nitself. In fact, it has been a revenue raiser. Since 1991, $279 million \nhave been placed in the Treasury by a special marketing tax paid \ndirectly by the sugar producers. Did the Senator from Arizona mention \nthat? Oops, I guess the Wall Street Journal did not mention it, nor did \nthe New York Times mention it, nor did the ``Fleecing of America'' \nmention it. Of course, if they did not mention it, it ``ain't'' worth \nmentioning.\n  The probable net cost of the announced purchase and removal of sugar \nhas been more than covered by the revenues of the sugar policy. As I \nhelped other Members of this Senate design that policy, that is exactly \nwhat we tried to do: to balance it out so the industry itself was self-\nfinancing.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will not at this time. Let me finish my statement.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator mentioned a very important marketing \nassessment, which had been taken out in last year's omnibus bill.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Since 1991, the marketing assessment has raised $279 \nmillion. That was my quote. That is a fact the Senator cannot dispute. \nThis 132,000-ton purchase is a step toward\n\n[[Page S7318]]\n\npreventing the forfeiture of a much larger amount of sugar. USDA has \nestimated that 600,000 tons could be forfeited at a much higher cost to \nthe Government--the Senator from Arizona is correct--based on current \nprograms and current forfeitures. Pulling that sugar from the market \nnow costs substantially less. The purchase saves the Government money \nand promotes the stopping of this kind of effort based on forfeiture, \nand that does save the American taxpayer money.\n  The purchase would not have been necessary and there would be no \nthreat of forfeiture if sugar producers were not required, under the \nWTO and the North American Free Trade Agreement, to import about 15 \npercent of our consumption. I happen to have voted against the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement because I felt this was a loophole that \nwould potentially cost the producers of the State of Idaho their crops \nand maybe their farms. Now, of course, reality begins to bear itself \nout.\n  Further compounding the problem has been extensive import quota \ncircumvention by a term that is now well known by those of us who are \ninterested in agriculture. It is known as stuffed molasses. Low prices \nfor other crops driving producers to beet and cane sugar production and \nextremely favorable weather conditions for the last 2 years have all \ncontributed to the oversupply of sugar and the need for Government \nintervention.\n  Stuffed molasses, as my colleagues know, is a way of circumventing \nthe law by loading up molasses with sugar, moving it through import \ninto this country, then pulling it in and refining the sugar out of it. \nIt is kind of like covering up, violating the law, if you will, in a \nlegal way. It certainly violates the spirit of the trade agreement.\n  Allowing sugar prices to continue to fall will put more sugar farmers \nout of business, but it will not help consumers one bit. There is a \ngeneral assumption on the part of those who oppose the sugar program \nthat once you drop the price of sugar to the world price, all of a \nsudden candy bars get cheaper, soda pop gets cheaper, confectionery \nfoods get cheaper, and we know that is not the fact. It has never been \nthe fact. We might transfer a little profitability from the sugar \nfarmer to the candy maker or to the soft drink producer, or to those \nwho generally supply confectionery goods to the consumers of this \ncountry.\n  Does it translate through to the farmer? No, it does not, and it \nnever has.\n  While the price food manufacturers and makers of candy--cereal, ice \ncream, cookies, and cakes--pay for sugar--they will always pay that \namount. That is the character of the way the industry works. They \nsimply either make a little more or make a little less, based on the \nmargins in which they buy.\n  The truth of the matter is that in the U.S., the sugar program has \nsaved the consumer money by stabilizing the price across the board and, \ntherefore, consistency. I remember long before I served in the Senate, \nwithout this sugar program, there were dramatic fluctuations in the \nmarketplace. People were going in and out of business. Confectionery \nproducers and soft drink suppliers were arguing at one point that sugar \nwas so dramatically high that they had to raise their prices, and then \nsugar fell dramatically, but those prices did not come down. U.S. \nconsumers pay about 20 percent less for sugar than does a consumer in \nother developed countries of the world.\n  It is strange that I could use that figure--and it is a figure of \nfact, well established in the marketplace. Why don't other developed \ncountries' consumers pay what we do? They buy on the world market. They \nbuy, as the Senator from Arizona suggests, at a much cheaper price. The \nreason is the stability we have offered and, therefore, the averages \nthat are very important to look at when you are looking at an overall \nprice of the issue.\n  Do I support the program? Yes, I do. Am I apologetic for it? No, I am \nnot. The reason is very simple. Over the years, we have worked to craft \na program that balances itself out and, in large part, has paid for \nitself. As we work to create a more open market and phase these kinds \nof programs out, I will support those efforts, too.\n   It is very important for the whole of this country that I think we \ncreate that kind of stability. I hope we can do so.\n  At the appropriate time, I, or the chairman of the subcommittee, will \nmove to table the amendment of the Senator from Arizona for the simple \nreason that we think it would destabilize the markets of this country. \nIt certainly would have a dramatic impact on my State and the 1,000-\nplus farmers who make up the sugar portion of Idaho's agriculture \nproduction.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise, as well, in defense of this \nprogram. I rise in defense because I represent a State that is one of \nthe most agricultural States in the Nation. The fact is, this program \nhas helped stabilize an otherwise disastrous situation.\n  This chart shows what has happened to sugar prices since the most \nrecent farm bill. This is what has happened to refined beet sugar \nprices. On this chart it looks like a cliff because it is. Prices have \ncollapsed. If we did not have something to counter the cycle, we would \nsee mass bankruptcy in rural America. That is a fact.\n  The Senator from Arizona comes out and he reads clippings from \nvarious news articles. Unfortunately, those people know virtually \nnothing about what they are writing about. They say, over and over, \nthat the world price of sugar is 8 cents a pound. Absolute nonsense. \nThe world price of sugar is not 8 cents a pound. The vast majority of \nsugar in the world moves under long-term contract at much higher prices \nthan the 8 cents a pound. About 18 cents a pound--that is what most \nsugar in the world sells for. What the Senator from Arizona is talking \nabout is what is reported in the popular press--repeatedly--which is \nflat wrong.\n  The price they are talking about is not the world price; the price \nthey are talking about is the world dump price for sugar. It is what \nsugar sells for that is not under contract that is hard to sell. That \nis a dump price. It is far below the cost of production. It does not \nrepresent what sugar sells for in the world. It is an absolute fiction.\n  Every time we have ended the program, what has happened to prices? \nLet's ask that question. Because the suggestion from the Senator from \nArizona is, if you would end this program--you phase it out--prices to \nconsumers would go down.\n  Let's have a reality check.\n  What has happened in the times we have ended the program? Did prices \ngo down or did prices go up? You know what happened? Prices \nskyrocketed. That is what happened when the program ended. The fact is, \nthis is a program that stabilizes prices. And that is critical to the \nsurvival of thousands of family farmers.\n  The Senator from Arizona talks about one large interest as though \nthat represents the totality of producers. Let me say to the Senator \nfrom Arizona, and to those who write these articles that attack the \nprogram and talk about one small group with large economic resources, \nwhat they are not doing is telling the whole story and telling the \nAmerican people that literally thousands and thousands of family \nfarmers are dependent on the stabilization this program provides. That \nis a fact.\n  Come to my State. Go farm to farm. Meet these families. They are not \nwealthy people. They are people trying to make it in an environment in \nwhich the prices of the products that they make have plunged. Without \nthis program to stabilize prices, there would be financial ruination \nall across the heartland of America. Is that what the Senator from \nArizona advocates? Is that what he wants to have happen? Because \nassuredly that would be the case.\n  One of the things that gets missed in this debate is this notion that \nsomehow the United States is an island unto itself and that we do not \nhave to worry about what the rest of the world is doing. If one would \npay a little attention to what the rest of the world is doing, what one \nwould find is that the United States is giving support to its producers \nat a level much lower than our major competitors.\n  This chart shows what our major competitors are doing in terms of \nsupport for their producers--$324 an acre.\n\n[[Page S7319]]\n\nHere is the support we are giving our producers--$34 an acre. By the \nway, these are not Kent Conrad's numbers. These are numbers from the \nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\n  Our major competitors are outgunning us 10-1. I would suggest the \nSenator from Arizona is recommending unilateral disarmament for our \nagricultural producers in what is, in effect, a trade war. He would \nnever do it in a military confrontation--never. If the other side had \n50,000 tanks, and we had 10,000 tanks, would the Senator from Arizona \nbe out here recommending we cut the number of our tanks in half? Would \nthat be the first move? I do not think so.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator allow me to answer his question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. After I complete my thought and presentation, I will be \nhappy to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is too bad the Senator will not yield.\n  Mr. CONRAD. No. I will be happy to after I complete my statement, as \nI allowed the Senator to complete his. I ask for the same courtesy from \nthe Senator from Arizona as I extended to him.\n  We are outgunned 10-1. If our opposition had 50,000 tanks and we had \n10,000, would the Senator from Arizona advocate cutting our number of \ntanks in half? That is exactly what we did in the last farm bill. They \nwere supporting their producers at $50 billion a year. We were \nproviding on average of $10 billion of support. And we cut our support \nin half.\n\n  I would be happy to yield to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I say to the Senator from North Dakota, it is a frivolous \nstatement. It has no connection to the estimated $1.5 billion. The \nSenator from North Dakota said that I have been quoting from newspaper \narticles, et cetera. The Senator from North Dakota usually relies on \nthe GAO.\n  I have heard him quote from the GAO quite often. What the GAO is \nsaying is the sugar program cost domestic sweetener users about $1.5 \nbillion in 1996 and $1.9 billion in 1998.\n  If a foreign government was subsidizing anything--as they are Airbus; \nand the United States with Boeing--of course, I would take my complaint \nto the World Trade Organization and we would see about the outcome. I \nwould not build further protectionist barriers for a private \nmanufacturer of any product whether they be tanks or not.\n  The Senator from North Dakota recently espoused fervently that we \nmeans test the estate taxes, the so-called death taxes. There was great \nlamenting on the other side of the aisle about the fact that wealthy \npeople would get off scot-free, and that we should not let them be \ncompletely absolved from estate taxes.\n  Will the Senator from North Dakota agree to a means testing on the \namount of money so that the Fanjul brothers will not get $65 million a \nyear of Arizona taxpayers' and North Dakota taxpayers' dollars? At \nleast you could agree to a means testing of this, rather than 42 \npercent of all these subsidies going to 1 percent of the sugar growers \nin America.\n  So my answer to the question from the Senator from North Dakota: No, \nI would never agree to what he is saying. I would agree, however, to \ntake the proper measures to remove protectionism on both sides of the \nAtlantic and all over the world. That is why I am a supporter of free \ntrade.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I just say that the Senator from Arizona says he would \nnot do something, but that is precisely what he is doing on the floor \nof the Senate--precisely what he is doing--engaging in unilateral \ndisarmament on behalf of our producers, when they are already being \noutspent 10-1 by our major competitors, the Europeans.\n  What the Senator from Arizona says is: Let's just abandon our folks. \nWe are going to play by a different set of rules. We are going to be \npurists on this side of the Atlantic. On the other side of the \nAtlantic, they get to take these markets the old-fashioned way. They \nget to go out and buy them. The result will be exactly what is \nhappening, I say to the Senator from Arizona, whom I respect and \nadmire.\n  I disagree firmly with him on this point. I respect and admire the \nSenator from Arizona; I make that clear. We have a spirited debate and \ndiscussion going here, and that is in the best tradition of the Senate. \nThis has no personal feeling attached to it.\n  I want the Senator from Arizona to know, I think this is precisely \nwrong. The fundamental reason it is wrong is because this is not the \nway world agriculture is working. What is happening in world \nagriculture today is our major competitors are going out and buying \nthese markets. If we don't give some assistance to our producers, what \nwill happen is the other side will take market share, as they are. The \nUSDA now projects that this year for the first year the Europeans are \ngoing to surpass us in world market share. Why? Because they are going \nout in a very concentrated, calculated way and buying market after \nmarket from us. If we are going to throw in the sugar market, as we \nhave thrown in the wheat market, as we have thrown in the barley \nmarket, pretty soon we will find an America that is second rate with \nrespect to agriculture production. That would be a tragedy. It would be \na mistake.\n  The Senator references the GAO report. GAO is not perfect. If we look \nat this report and study it objectively, USDA put a team together and \nlooked at this report. They concluded the validity of the results are \nsuspect and should not be quoted authoritatively. Here is a sampling of \nsome of the words USDA career analysts used in describing the GAO \nreport: naive, arbitrary, in error, inconsistent, inadequate, a \npuzzlement, inflammatory and unprofessional, not well documented, \nincomplete, unrealistic. In a nutshell, the instant experts at GAO \ncompared the U.S. price--the same thing the Senator from Arizona has \ndone, the 8 cents he quotes--to a world dump market price that is a \nfraction of the cost of producing sugar and assumed that if grocery \nchains and food manufacturers could have access to that dump market \nsugar, they would pass 100 percent of their savings along to consumers.\n  I have seen this over and over and over. It is an easy mistake to \nunderstand because people are writing about this industry who know \nnothing about it. They say over and over, the world price of sugar is 8 \ncents. That is absolute nonsense. It is not true. It is not accurate. \nThat is the dump price for world sugar. It would be the same as talking \nabout the world steel price and failing to look at all of the steel \nthat sells to the automobile industry around the world under contract, \ninstead to look at the dump market where just a fraction of world steel \nand world sugar sells.\n  It is economic know-nothingism, frankly, to make that reference. It \nis not reality.\n  We have very difficult issues to deal with in world agriculture. In \nour country, the No. 1 issue is right here. Are we going to let our \nproducers get swamped by a flood of European money, by tough \ncompetitors who have made a determination that what they want to do is \ndominate world agriculture and they are going to do it the old-\nfashioned way. They are going to go out and buy these markets from us. \nThat is what they are doing--$324 an acre of support on average versus \nour $34. If we want to continue to engage in unilateral disarmament and \nlet American agriculture go right down the tubes, this is a good place \nto start, right here, today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise to talk on this issue. It is an \nimportant issue to this country; it is an important issue to my State.\n  I suspect much of what I state may have perhaps already been said. \nNevertheless, I think it is important that we take a continuing look at \nthe facts of the issue. We have heard a lot of emotional discussion \nwith respect to it. The fact is, we have been through this before. \nAbout every year we seem to go through the same discussion.\n  It does impact many people. It is not something where just a few rich \npeople are involved. It provides 420,000 jobs in 40 States. Many \nagriculture communities are dependent on sugar production, as are some \nin my State. Frankly, it is one of the few products that is processed \non to retail use. It comes out of the State ready to put on the grocery \nstore shelf. Seldom does that happen in my State.\n  It provides a $26 billion annual economic activity and is a very high \nquality product, one that is changing. We\n\n[[Page S7320]]\n\ntalked about the candy and so on. Most of that comes from corn \nsweeteners. Nevertheless, it is very important. It is a very efficient \nindustry; by world standards, we have the 18th lowest cost of \nproduction out of 96 producing countries, despite the fact that we have \nhigh-cost environmental standards and those kinds of costs.\n  As the Senator from North Dakota made quite clear, we keep talking \nabout the ``world'' price. It isn't the world price. It is the dump \nprice. Almost all the countries are subsidized. After they raise more \nthan the subsidy applies to, it is dumped on the market. That needs to \nbe understood.\n  We need to understand that consumers have benefited from this \nprogram. Retail sugar prices are virtually unchanged since 1990 and are \n20 percent below the developed country average. It is about the most \naffordable in the entire world, as a matter of fact.\n  We have talked about taxpayer benefits. Until this year, the sugar \nprogram has been a zero cost program for 15 years, since 1985. It \ngenerated $279 million in revenue since 1991 that was paid by the \nindustry into the Government. It is WTO, NAFTA compliant. Prices have \nbeen very low for the producers, very low in the industry.\n  Unfortunately, there has not been a passthrough. What we find is the \ngrocery stores have not lowered their price. The price of sweetened \nproducts is up 7 to 9 percent. At the same time, the grower price has \nbeen down approximately 20 percent. We find a great deal of activity \nthere.\n  We have heard several times about the GAO report. The Senator talked \nabout that. Certainly, the findings of USDA were such that they \nconfused the world market with the dump price, as was pointed out. They \nalso assumed that the lower costs were being passed on 100 percent \nthrough the retail market. That is not the case. Even though I am a \ngreat supporter of GAO, that study was not one that has been \nparticularly useful.\n  The wholesale price for refined sugar has been down, is down, 25.9 \npercent in the last 3\\1/2\\ years. At the same time, the price for \nrefined retail sugar is about the same. Ice cream is up. Candy is up. \nCookies are up. Cereal is up. We haven't seen that pass through to the \nproduct.\n  I will not continue to go through this. I think we have covered many \nof the facts. This is a very important industry in my State. Our sugar \nbeet production is one of the most efficient in the world. We have \nthree refineries. It is very important to us. We have been through this \nwhole discussion before. I think we agreed, then, this is an important \nmatter to the country, to agriculture. I rise in opposition to the \namendment of the Senator from Arizona.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I thank all of our colleagues who have \nengaged in the debate so far.\n  It is summertime in Washington so I guess that means it is sugar \namendment time. The Senate essentially voted on this once before. It \nseems we do it every July and August, during the summer months. The \nexact same amendment was voted on last August 4. The Senate rejected \nthe amendment by a vote of 66-33, a 2-to-1 margin. I think the reason \nit was rejected by such a large margin is that Members are finally \nbeginning to understand the sugar program and what it really involves \nand why it has worked for so many years as a benefit both to producers \nand also to the consumers of sugar and sugar products. It is not a \nperfect program, but it is one that has improved over the years. I will \nmake a couple of comments about it.\n  Before that, I want to mention the fact that not too far back, this \nCongress was really involved in the crisis involving the increase in \ngasoline prices. We talked about gasoline prices going up 25 cents a \ngallon, 30 cents a gallon, 50 cents a gallon, and everybody being in an \nuproar about it.\n  The sugar program has been at a loan rate of 18 cents since 1985. It \nhasn't gone up one-half cent since 1985. What I want to do is take a \nmoment to try to explain, as briefly as I can, how the program works. \nWe have had talk on the floor this afternoon about these ``huge'' \nsubsidies being given to some wealthy family, I heard, somewhere in \nFlorida. I have almost 700 sugar cane farms in Louisiana and the \ngrowers would be very surprised to learn there is a big subsidy program \nout there, because the sugar program is not a direct subsidy from the \ntaxpayer by any stretch of the imagination.\n  What sugar farmers get is a loan, as other commodities also get, such \nas rice, cotton, and other farm products. The loan is 18 cents per \npound for sugar. It is a non-recourse loan. What that means, simply, to \npeople not in the agriculture business, is it gives farmers the option \nof putting their crop under loan at harvest time. They have the option \nto either pay back the loan in dollars or, if the market price falls so \nlow they cannot do that, they can forfeit their sugar to the Government \nas payment for the loan.\n  The interesting thing is that, since 1985, there has not been one \nsingle forfeiture under the loan program. Not one. Farmers have put \ntheir crop under loan and they have paid back the loan when the loan \nwas due to the Federal Government. That is how the program works. There \nis no direct subsidy to make up the difference in a price, where \ntaxpayers have to dip into their pockets to give to a sugar farmer. It \nis a non-recourse loan, which means they can either pay it back in \ndollars or forfeit the amount of sugar that they have put under loan.\n  Some would say, well, the sugar program protects domestic sugar by \npreventing sugar imports from coming into this country. That is not \ntrue. In fact, the sugar we are importing varies between 15 and 20 \npercent. It comes from 40 countries around the world. It is GATT legal. \nIt comes into this country, under the program, from 40 different \ncountries around the world.\n  Here is the thing that I think is really interesting, because I guess \nin addition to saying it is a huge subsidy program--which it is not; it \nis simply a loan program--is that somehow consumers are being harmed by \nthis program. This chart, I think, is consistent with what Senator \nConrad from North Dakota was pointing out. We have a bar chart; I think \nhe had a graph. It is essentially the same thing. This is data from the \nDepartment of Agriculture. It is not from the sugar industry; it is \nfrom the USDA. It indicates that it has been 3\\1/2\\ years since the \nstart of the 1996 farm program when we put the new and improved program \ninto effect.\n  The chart from USDA indicates that the prices for producers have \nfallen, and the consumer prices for sugar and sweetened products have \nrisen. This shows sugarcane farmers in Florida, Louisiana, Texas, \nHawaii, which produce the bulk of the sugarcane used for sugar. Since \n1996, when we put the program into place, the price of sugarcane to the \nproducer, to the farmer, has fallen 14.6 percent. These are USDA \nnumbers. The prices for wholesale refined sugar, beet sugar, USDA tells \nus, have fallen 31.9 percent. These are USDA numbers. They show prices \nfalling to the producers, the farmers of cane sugar, and prices falling \nto the producers of sugar from sugar beets.\n  You would think that if the price to the farmer is falling by 31.9 \npercent, in one case, and 14.6 percent for sugarcane farmers, my \ngoodness, that must be great for consumers, right? Everything that uses \nsugar should have a corresponding fall in its price, right? Wrong.\n  Look at what happened to the price of sugar on the shelf. The price \nof sugar on the shelf has risen a very small amount, while the price \nfor the people producing sugar cane and sugar beets has been \ndrastically falling. But the price of sugar on the shelf has been on \nthe increase when you would expect that it would be going down. Look at \nwhat happened. Here is where the complainers were. How many Members of \nCongress have gotten letters from people saying gas prices are too \nhigh? Probably quite a few of us. ``Do something, Senator. Gas prices \nare too high.'' How many people have gotten a letter from a housewife, \nor somebody running a home, saying, ``You know, my biggest problem is \nthat I went to buy 5 pounds of sugar and it is so high I have to choose \nbetween clothes and shoes and sugar.'' Nobody is writing about that and \ncomplaining about the price for 5 pounds of sugar going through the \nroof. Do you know why? Because it is not.\n\n  Here is what has been happening. The people who use it--the large \nmanufacturers who make candy--and I can name them, but I will spare \nthem the\n\n[[Page S7321]]\n\nembarrassment--have had their prices go up 6.4 percent, while a main \ningredient, sugar, has been plummeting over here. Not the price of \ncandy. A main ingredient's price has been going down, but the price of \ntheir product has been going up.\n  Cookies and cakes are big users of sugar. The most important thing in \nthese products is probably sugar. Their prices have gone up 6.6 \npercent, according to the USDA, while the price of sugar, a main \ningredient, has plummeted. Cereal? Big users. There are a lot of sugar-\ncoated flakes for kids. Cereal prices have gone up 8.3 percent. The \nprice of sugar to the farmer has plummeted.\n  The last one is ice cream. I love it. I would buy it no matter what \nit costs. It has gone up 9.8 percent. There is a lot of sugar in ice \ncream. What they are paying for the sugar is a lot lower than it used \nto be. Boy, their product price doesn't reflect that. If there are \nproblems here, they are candy, cookies, cereal, and ice cream. It used \nto be the soft drink industry, but they got out and quit using sugar. \nToday the price of their product is more than it was when they were \nusing sugar. And then look at the cans of artificially sweetened soft \ndrink products and the cans of the naturally sweetened soft drinks; the \nprice of an artificially sweetened soft drink is no less than the price \nof the one that is using the natural sweetener. Try to explain that \nwhen they say the real problem is sugar prices.\n  These are USDA figures, not mine and not sugar producers. Their \nprices have plummeted under the program. There is no direct Government \nsubsidy. It is a loan. Sugar farmers have never forfeited one single \nloan since 1985. They have paid it back, and paid it back in dollars, \nand it has been the same loan rate since 1985. It has been 18 cents. \nThat program, designed to help everybody, has seemingly not helped the \nfarmer very much. But it is the only thing we have. Like every other \nproduct and commodity that we try to help in a balanced fashion, it has \ndone that.\n  I will conclude by saying that this is the same vote we had last \nAugust. The Senate spoke very clearly then, 66-33. I hope that we will \ndo the same thing today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I guess I have been around this old \nbusiness of agriculture about as long as anybody. We have seen high \ncommodity prices and we have seen low commodity prices. Years ago, when \nwe would get a high surplus of any type of commodity, the price went \ndown and so did the price in the grocery store. We had to eat our way \nout of this thing, so to speak. It happened in livestock, pork and beef \nand chicken products. But that is not the case anymore.\n  I was interested in his chart showing how, even though the price of \nsugar has gone down, the prices of candy, cookies, other baked goods, \ncereal, and ice cream has continued to go up. I don't want anybody \nfiddling with my ice cream. I like it like it is. If it goes up a \nlittle bit, that is OK. But don't come back and say if all of the \nsupport is taken away from sugar, the prices will go down in the store. \nIt doesn't work with this product. It was about a year and a half ago \nthat live hogs hit an all-time low and got down to around 10 cents a \npound. Yet, when I went to my grocery stores out here in Springfield, \nVA, and back in Billings, MT, guess what? Boned out, double-cut pork \nchops were still around $5 to $6 a pound.\n  Folks, I don't know how sharp your pencil is. But that ``don't \npencil.'' That just ``don't pencil.''\n  We are looking at a program that has cost the taxpayer virtually \nnothing. Yet it sustains many small farmers. Sure, there are a couple \nof big ones down in Florida. But there are a couple of big ones in \neverything. For the most part, this is support for farmers in the Big \nHorn Basin of Wyoming and the Yellowstone Valley between Billings and \nSidney. It keeps them in business.\n  I ask the American people, when it comes to farm programs or \ninsurance, do you insure your car? Yes. You do. Do you insure your \nhouse? Yes. You insure your house. Do you insure your life? Yes. We do \nthat. I look upon this as just a little insurance policy. It doesn't \ncost us very much money, but it ensures that your grocery stores will \nbe full of the most nutritious and safe food of any grocery store in \nthe world and priced less than the percentage of the disposable income \nof any other place in the world. That is a pretty good insurance \npolicy. We don't have to garden. We don't have to plant, or seed, or \nweed, harvest, or process. We can continue to do what we want to do in \nour profession. It is guaranteed that you are going to have that supply \nin any amount and fixed in any way and processed in any way.\n  We already talked about the numbers. But we are basically looking at \npeople who have a great deal on the line. They risk a lot. They are \nsubject to the elements. They have no control over that. They have no \ncontrol over the retail end of the product--none whatsoever. If we are \ngoing to keep this very efficient food machine alive, this is the \ninsurance policy that we all have. It serves this country very well.\n  I suggest that you not support the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Arizona. It is well intentioned. As the Senator from Louisiana \nsaid, it is indeed July.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I see my friend from North Dakota on the \nfloor. Of course our entire relationship is characterized by respect. \nObviously he makes a strong case for his point of view. I not only \nrespect but I appreciate and enjoy the verbal exchanges we have from \ntime to time. He is a worthy adversary. I will not take very long.\n  It was alleged that marketing assessments are large amounts of money. \nThat is true. I believe it is $272 million or something such as that. \nBut I think it is appropriate to mention that those marketing \nassessments in last year's omnibus bill were done away with. The sugar \nproducers do nothing to address the budget deficit. I think an argument \ncan be made that this Senator from Arizona may not be the most expert \non agricultural issues. I plead guilty to that. I believe there are \nother issues in which I am better informed.\n  A cosponsor of this amendment is the chairman of the Committee on \nAgriculture, Senator Lugar. Senator Lugar is in support of this \namendment. I am honored that the chairman of the committee is in \nsupport of this amendment. I think his viewpoint should also be taken \ninto consideration, particularly with more gravity than mine.\n  There was a study conducted by the Center for International \nEconomics. It was prepared as part of the trade agenda and conference \non the 1st and 2nd of October 1999 in Geneva. I will read the beginning \nof this study:\n\n       If ever there was a case for multilateral trade \n     liberalisation, and if ever there was a liberalisation from \n     which the global economy stood to gain, it is sugar. The \n     world sugar market contains some of the largest and most \n     blatant forms of trade protection. Many of these have a 300 \n     year history. The worst of the worst are in developed \n     countries. They greatly distort trade and prices. Although \n     the world economy, consumers and efficient sugar producers \n     stand to gain substantially from liberalisation, some \n     producers, especially those in developed countries, stand to \n     lose. And herein lies a political challenge--there are large \n     vested interests that are likely to oppose sugar trade \n     liberalisation. In the Uruguay Round these vested interests \n     won hands down. Should they win again, they are likely to \n     further undermine developed country credibility in the WTO \n     and the WTO itself. Ultimately countries unilaterally \n     liberalise trade. The best that multilateral forums can do is \n     to assist that process. The biggest gains in trade \n     liberalisation come form reducing the biggest distortions \n     first. Giving prominence to sugar and other highly protected \n     products in the WTO millennium round makes economic sense. \n     Such prominence is also needed to help counter the vested \n     interests opposed to reform.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       This taxation of consumers and protection of producers is \n     highest in Japan, Western Europe and the United States.\n\n  We are the leading proponent of free and open trade. The United \nStates has an enviable record, whether it be the North American Free \nTrade Agreement. Whether it be expansion of economic trade relations \nwith China through Democrat and Republican administrations, we have \nbeen in pursuit of free trade. Clearly, we lose credibility when we \nstand as one of the highest protectionists for our sugar industry.\n\n[[Page S7322]]\n\n  I say again with respect to my friend from North Dakota and the \nopponents of this amendment that I will be glad to work with them at \nleast to means test this subsidy. Why in the world should one family \nget $65 million in subsidies? That is remarkable when you think about \nit. Adding to that, they are harming the Everglades. Every objective \nstudy indicates that the runoff from pesticides and other pollutants in \nthe Everglades is dramatically damaging the Everglades. Yes. The sugar \ncompanies are paying some money, but in comparison to the overall cost, \nthe estimated cost of fixing the Everglades is minuscule.\n  I am not without sympathy for the farmers in North Dakota. I am not \nwithout sympathy for the farmers in Montana, Louisiana, and Idaho. But \nwhen they are encouraged to grow a crop which they would not grow if it \nwere not for the subsidies, and in addition in some parts of America \nthey are doing damage to our environment, then it is time we said \nenough.\n  Again, I strongly support a proposal to means test and to phase out \nthese sugar subsidies. We phased out a large number of subsidies when \nwe passed the Freedom to Farm Act. I would agree that the Freedom to \nFarm Act has had very mixed results. In fact, there are questions \nraised by many.\n  We eliminated and phased out wool, butter, cheese, powdered milk, and \nother dairies. We capped cotton and reduced peanuts, wheat, and others. \nBut we retain two quite remarkable products; that is, sugar and \ntobacco. I promise not to bore my colleagues with a tirade about \ntobacco. But the fact is that the sugar subsidy is one which needs to \nbe eliminated. I think we all know that.\n  It is my understanding that the Senator from North Dakota, Senator \nDorgan, after his remarks, will make a motion to table. I am certainly \nin agreement with that, or if there are other speakers, I would be glad \nto join into a time agreement, whatever is agreeable, with the Senator \nfrom Mississippi and the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am happy to oblige the Senator from \nArizona and set up a unanimous consent agreement to limit time, if \nthere are other Senators who want to speak.\n  I see the Senator from North Dakota on his feet. I assume he wants to \nspeak on the amendment. I know of no other Senators who wish to speak \nwho have not already spoken.\n  Senator Craig indicated an interest in making a motion to table the \nMcCain amendment. We are about at that point where we are ready for a \nmotion to table the amendment.\n  I will yield the floor if anyone wants to speak on the amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask the indulgence of my friend for a \nunanimous consent agreement that has been cleared on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. McCAIN. This allows the Commerce Committee to meet off the floor \nfor the purposes of approving the nomination of Mr. Norman Mineta to be \nthe Secretary of Commerce.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. No objection on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n            Unanimous consent agreement--executive calendar\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask consent, notwithstanding any rule or other order, \nit be in order for the Commerce Committee to meet in executive session \nfor the purpose only of reporting nominations to the Executive \nCalendar. Among those nominations is that of Mr. Norman Mineta, former \nCongressman and nominee to be Secretary of Commerce, immediately \nfollowing the next rollcall vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. In the spirit of the unanimous consent agreement, let me \ntry this: I ask unanimous consent the Senate vote on or in relation to \nthe McCain amendment at 2 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to oppose the \namendment offered by my colleague and friend from Arizona, Senator \nMcCain. I want to talk about a number of things that have been \ndiscussed about sugar, the sugar program, in this amendment.\n  First, let me talk about ``free trade.'' There is not free trade in \nsugar around the world. It is not the case that the price that is \ndescribed as the world price for sugar represents a free trade price. \nIt is a fact that most sugar that is bought and sold around the world \nis bought and sold on contracts between countries. The quantity of \nsugar that is produced above that is sold on the dump market for dump \nmarket prices, but most sugar is traded or sold between countries on \ncontract. So the price that is quoted as the world price for sugar is \nnot the world price for sugar at all. That is a myth. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, the issue of who is getting a subsidy; is someone getting a \nlarge subsidy? There aren't any subsidies. This is not a program that \nhas a subsidy. This is not a program in which the taxpayer is taxed and \nmoney comes to the Federal Government and money is given to a producer. \nThere are no payments to producers. There are no subsidies. That is the \nsecond point.\n  There are forces that have wanted to abolish the sugar program for \nsome long while. The sugar program is not a program that gives a \npayment to a producer. It does create a circumstance of balance between \nproduction and imports in order to achieve a domestic price that \nprovides stability for consumers and stability for producers. Some \ndon't like that. Who are they? Well, they call themselves the Coalition \nfor Sugar Reform. Who or what is the Coalition for Sugar Reform? Anyone \ncan guess that. The American Bakers Association, the National \nConfectioners Association, the Biscuit and Cracker Manufacturers \nAssociation, the Chocolate Manufacturers Association, the Independent \nBakers Association.\n  Let's look at these groups. The price of sugar has dropped 30 percent \nsince last summer, to a 22-year low. The price of sugar has dropped by \na third. Anyone who listens to me should ask themselves, have I \npurchased a candy bar lately? If so, did I see a reduction in the cost \nof the candy bar? Did I buy a can of soda? If so, was it cheaper than \nit used to be? The answer, clearly, is no. Sugar prices have dropped by \n30 percent. Chocolate and candy prices are up by 6 percent. Cookies, \ncakes, and other bakery products are up by 7 to 8 percent. Cereal and \nice cream prices are up by 9 percent. Buy just a bag of sugar at the \nstore and see whether it costs 30 percent less.\n  Let's figure out where sugar comes from. It comes from a family farm \nin the Red River Valley of North Dakota. This family raises sugar \nbeets. They buy a tractor, they buy other equipment with which to plant \nthe seeds; then they buy fuel, they buy fertilizer, they get up in the \nmornings and gas up the tractor and go break the ground. They do the \nthings farmers do. They take all the risks. They do all the work. And \nthen they hope. They hope something doesn't happen to the crop. They \nhope it doesn't get burned out, flooded out, or have disease. If all of \nthose hopes are realized, maybe at the end of the year they get a \ncrop--maybe.\n  After risking all their money and working all year, if they get a \ncrop, then maybe they get a crop that has a price above the cost of \nproduction. But maybe not.\n  Some say: It doesn't matter who is producing these things; we really \ndon't care--talking about the organizations, the Coalition for Sugar \nReform--we don't care where it comes from; we just want to get the \nworld price for sugar, the dump price for sugar.\n  What is the result of that? The result means devastation of family \nfarms in many parts of this country--those families who are out there \ntrying to earn a living as best they can, whose fortune, whose future \nis based on events around the globe over which they have no control and \nwhom these organizations would like to link to the world dump price for \nsugar. They can't make it. They wouldn't make it.\n\n  We have to ask the question, Is it reasonable for us in this country \nto decide we want to do a couple of things at once? One, provide stable \nprices for sugar for the American consumer. We\n\n[[Page S7323]]\n\nhave done that. U.S. retail prices for sugar are virtually unchanged \nfor more than a decade. How many prices exist on the grocery store \nshelf where we can say that price is largely unchanged for an entire \ndecade? Not very many. Sugar, we can.\n  Why is it we have price stability for consumers? It has not always \nbeen that way. We have seen times when the price of sugar has spiked \nup, up, way up. The sugar program has provided stability of price for \nthe consumer. At the same time, it has tried to provide some basic \nstability of price for the producer that takes the risk of producing. \nSome don't like that. They say producers don't matter much here. They \ndo matter. They are part of the economic backbone of this country. They \nare the salt of the Earth. The folks who are out there trying to make a \nliving on America's family farmers--and yes, I say to those questions, \nyes, they are family farmers. If you doubt it, come with me and I will \ntake you to a few. We will drive in the yard, see the equipment, talk \nto the family. These are family farmers producing sugar beets.\n  On another point about how well they do, the cost of production for \nsugar in this country is well below the cost of production in the world \naverage. In fact, we have the lowest cost of beet sugar producers in \nthe world. Yet they couldn't compete against dumped sugar at dump sugar \nprices. Should they have to compete in a global economy against dump \nsugar prices? The answer is no, of course not.\n  We ought to be willing to stand up for this country's producers. I am \nnot at all embarrassed, and I will never be embarrassed, for standing \nup for the economic interests of America's producers, to say to them, \nyou deserve an opportunity to have a fair return. That is what this \nprogram is all about. In my judgment, this amendment ought to be tabled \nby this Senate. I believe it will be tabled. I have a series of charts, \nbut I think my colleague from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, and Senator \nBreaux and Senator Craig and others have used the charts. They show \nprices. They show what has happened to our producers--a devastating \nprice collapse.\n\n  Let me make one other parenthetical point. It seems to me, if you are \ngoing to start dealing with farm issues, the last thing you would want \nto do is go to one part of the farm program that historically has \nworked pretty well. We have had some problems with it in recent months \nfor a number of reasons. Historically, this program has been the one \npart of the farm program that has worked. It seems to me you would not \ngo to that one and take that apart. Make the rest of them work as well. \nBut I think it is interesting that the same people who are the \nCoalition for Sugar Reform, they have one common ingredient in the \nthings they produce--grains, oilseed, dairy and sugar. In every \ncircumstance, the return for these commodities to the people who \nproduce them--the people who get up in the morning, do all the work, do \nthe chores, spend the day in the field, harvest the crops, and take all \nthe risks--in every circumstance, we have seen a substantial decline: \nWheat, corn, soybean prices less than half what they were 4 years ago; \nmilk prices a little more than half what they were a year ago; sugar \nprices down by a third.\n  That is not, in my judgment, what this Congress, what this Senate \nought to be expecting to have happen for our producers. I hope we will \ndecide today, by an overwhelming margin, to table this amendment.\n  Let me end as I began. I have great respect for the Senator from \nArizona and others who may feel the way he does. I do not in any way \nsuggest what he is doing is something he does not believe passionately \nabout. But I believe very strongly this amendment ought to be tabled. \nThis Congress ought to be about the business of strengthening the sugar \nprogram and making that sugar program work as it has worked for so many \nyears, not taking it apart. This is not a circumstance where our \nfarmers are competing in free trade. There is not free trade in sugar. \nIt is not a circumstance where farmers are getting a subsidy. There is \nno subsidy paid to sugar producers. It is a circumstance where this is \na program that deserves the support of the Senate this afternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, it is my understanding we have a unanimous \nconsent agreement to hold a vote on or about the McCain amendment at 2 \no'clock, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. CRAIG. With that in mind, Mr. President, I move to table the \nMcCain amendment. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator withhold? I would like to have another \nchance to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote is not to occur until 2 o'clock.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Can I not register that at this time, with the intent that \nit occur at 2 o'clock? That is my intent, not to shut off debate but \nsimply to register a motion to table at this time.\n  I call for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, does that allow debate to continue?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It does.\n  Mr. CRAIG. It would allow debate to continue.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I was intending to offer the motion to table. I \nunderstood the Senator from North Dakota wished to speak. I think, if \nthe Senator from Idaho is offering the motion to table, as long as \nthere is debate time remaining, I support that.\n  Mr. CRAIG. There is time remaining for this or other amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the amendment \nintroduced by the Senator from Arizona, Senator John McCain, to strike \nfunding for the sugar program. I cannot stress enough how important \nthis program is to the sugar beet growers in my state of Wyoming and \nagricultural communities throughout the nation.\n  The sugarbeet farmers in Wyoming are already facing hard times. \nAlmost one sixth of the sugar acreage in my State was just ravaged by a \nhailstorm and some fields are facing a complete loss. Since last \nsummer, there has been a 30 percent drop in sugar prices to \napproximately $0.19 per pound--a 22 year low. And this October, Mexico \nis scheduled to increase its sugar exports to the American market \ntenfold, to 250,000 metric tons. And now we are considering dropping \nthe sugar program. This amendment simply kicks these farmers while they \nare down, taking away what little price stability there is in their \nbusiness.\n  I would like to share with you a letter I just received from Wade \nSteiger, a sugar beet farmer in Frannie, Wyoming. Mr. Steiger writes \n``Dear Senator, I am currently in the sugar production business in the \nstate of Wyoming and am wondering if I should remain in the business. \nWhat I need from you is your best assessment of the current mood in the \nbody politic as to the direction of U.S. sugar policy * * * With the \ndeck stacked against me like this, it would seem foolish to remain in \nthe sugar business.''\n  Frankly, I'm not sure what to tell him. I know what I would like to \ntell him. I would like to tell him that we in Congress are committed to \nmaking sure that he will be able to get a fair price for his product \nand that we understand the cyclical nature of his business and that \nthere is a need for a progrma--a no-cost program--that offers a little \nstability to sugar prices. If this amendment passes, I will have to \ntell him otherwise.\n  The sugar program has operated at no cost to the federal government \nsince 1996 and the sugar purchase is not an outright payment to \nproducers. This program covers the cost of purchasing surplus sugar \nwhich the government can then turn around and sell at a later date to \nrecoup what is sometimes a large part of the up-front cost. Moreover, \nthe sugar industry has already more than covered the cost of these \npurchases, with over $279 million paid into the U.S. Treasury during \nthe 1990's in a special sugar marketing tax.\n  Without this program, year-to-year supply changes caused by natural \nfactors will lead to such price fluctuation that the profitability of \nsugar production would be too volatile for most farmers to stay in \nbusiness. I believe that the government has a role to play in \nstabilizing commodity prices, especially when the program operates at \nno\n\n[[Page S7324]]\n\nnet cost to the taxpayers, as is the case with this program.\n  The U.S. produces beet sugar more efficiently and at a lower cost \nthan any other country in the world, but currently these producers are \nat a disadvantage on the artificial world market. If every government \naround the world stayed out of the sugar production business, we \nwouldn't need a program to keep our farmers competitive. But the fact \nis that world sugar production is heavily subsidized, and it simply \ndoes not make sense for us to send U.S. jobs overseas by destroying our \nown sugar program.\n  I have the utmost faith in my farmers back in Wyoming, that in a \ntruly free market they could grow sugar more efficiently and profitably \nthan anyone else in the world. But because of subsidies paid to protect \nless efficient farmers in the European Union, Brazil and other \ncountries, the world dump market prices have averaged only about half \nof the price it would be in the absence of subsidies.\n  The E.U. remains committed to pouring money into a sugar support \nprogram that holds its prices at approximately $.31 per pound.\n  Brazil's sugar production exploded in the past twenty years in the \nwake of its subsidy to produce ethanol from cane sugar. As Brazil has \ncut back its ethanol subsidy, the cane has been used to produce sugar \nand since the mid-1990's, it sugar production has doubled and its \nexports have tripled--all through its generous subsidies.\n  In their race to produce subsidized sugar, Brazilian farmers have \nalso had the benefit of far lower labor and environmental standards \nthan American sugar farmers. Brazil's cane industry turned valuable \nforest land into farmland and continues to employ tens of thousands of \nchildren in the dangerous work of cutting cane.\n  I believe the time has come to draw the line in this constant attack \non rural America. This is not about farm welfare. This is not about \nprotectionism. This is about giving our family farmers like Mr. Steiger \na fair shake. I urge my colleagues to support a no-cost program that \nbenefits these farmers and oppose this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Steiger's letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                 Wade Steiger,\n\n                                        Frannie, WY, July 3, 2000.\n       Dear Senator: I am currently in the sugar production \n     business in the state of Wyoming and am wondering if I should \n     remain in the business. What I need from you is your best \n     assessment of the current mood in the body politic as to the \n     direction of U.S. sugar policy. As I read the current policy, \n     the Mexicans will have free access to the U.S. market in the \n     near future, and the Mexicans have just signed a NAFTA-like \n     deal with the E.U. Under this arrangement the E.U. will have \n     access to a U.S. taxpayer supported U.S. sugar market and \n     would therefore effectively be getting a subsidy from both \n     their own government as well as ours. With the deck stacked \n     against me like this, it would seem foolish to remain in the \n     sugar business.\n       My read on the political mood is that the sugar industry \n     has been laid on the altar of free trade and, if politically \n     expedient, will be sacrificed. I need to know if you or any \n     of your colleagues intend to do anything to change the \n     current situation before I decide whether or not to continue \n     in this business. I understand that giving a straight answer \n     to this question is politically risky, but I would appreciate \n     an answer with a minimum of political ``cover your ass''. I \n     am willing to take an answer in a non-recordable fashion, but \n     I prefer that you take a clear stand on the issue.\n       Sincerely,\n                                                     Wade Steiger.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, we are again debating the amendment by the \nSenator from Arizona. My colleagues may recall that this body rejected \nan identical amendment last year by a vote of 66-33.\n  As I mentioned on the floor last August, the sugar program remains a \ngreat bargain for the American consumer. It's also one of the least \nexpensive food items you will find in an American kitchen. Sugar is \nprobably the best bargain you can find at the grocery store today. \nAmerican sugar farmers and the U.S. sugar program help make sugar \naffordable.\n  Consumers elsewhere around the globe do not enjoy the low prices we \nhave in America. If you visit a grocery store in other industrialized \nnations you will get ``sticker shock'' when you pass the sugar display. \nThanks to a farm program that assures stable supplies at reasonable \nprices, sugar is a remarkable value for American consumers. U.S. \nconsumers pay an average of 17 cents less per pound of sugar than their \ncounterparts in other industrialized nations. Low U.S. prices save \nconsumers more than a billion dollars annually. That's why I say that \nthe sugar program is a great deal for American consumers. Thanks to the \nsugar program, U.S. consumers enjoy a plentiful supply of sugar at \nbargain prices.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment. If Congress terminates \nthe sugar program, not only will a dynamic part of the economy \ndisappear from many rural areas, but consumers will also lose a \nreliable supply of high-quality, low-price sugar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I will go back to some of the things that \nwere said here so the Record is crystal clear. When the Senator from \nArizona says there are massive subsidies being paid to sugar producers, \nit is just wrong. That is not the way the sugar program works. There is \nnot one nickel of payment made by the Federal Government to sugar \nproducers--not one, not a penny. It is not a subsidy program here. That \nis not the way it works.\n  That is part of the problem we have. We have people who do not know \nthe program--really do not know the economics of world agriculture, \nreally know nothing about the sugar industry and the sugar program--out \nhere trying to pass laws that would have draconian, dramatic effects. \nThey really are ill-informed. I don't know a nicer way to say it.\n  When they say the world price of sugar is 8 cents, it is an \nabsurdity. It costs 16 cents to 18 cents to produce sugar. How could \nthe world price of sugar be 8 cents? It is not the world price of \nsugar, as has been said on the floor. The vast majority of sugar in the \nworld sells under contract and those contract prices are not part of \nthe calculation of what the Senator from Arizona calls the world price \nof sugar. That is excluded from those calculations. So when they talk \nabout a world price of sugar, that is not the world price; it is a dump \nprice. It is that sugar which is left over which is a small part of the \nworld sugar supply that sells that was not part of a contract. It is \nnot a world price. That is a misnomer. It is factually incorrect.\n  Now let's go to the underlying assumption. The underlying assumption \nis that somehow the rest of the world is engaged in free market \neconomics with respect to agriculture production. False. That is not \neven close to being right. Our major competitors, the Europeans, are \nspending about $50 billion a year to support their producers--$50 \nbillion. Here are the comparisons. This is from the Organization for \nEconomic Cooperation and Development. They are the ones who are in \ncharge of keeping score on the question of who supports their producers \nat what level. Here is the European Union, our major competitor. They \nare supporting their producers on average $324 an acre. Here we are: \n$34 an acre. They are outgunning us 10 to 1.\n  What the Senator from Arizona says to us is we ought to cut this some \nmore. We ought to cut our level of support even further. Let's engage \nin total unilateral disarmament in this world battle over agriculture \nmarkets.\n  What sense does that make? We tried that in the last farm bill. In \nthe last farm bill, we cut our support for producers on average from \n$10 billion to $5 billion. We cut it in half on the theory that was \ngoing to be a good example for the Europeans and they would similarly \nreduce their support.\n  What happened? They did not cut their support by a nickel. Instead, \nthey stayed steady on course, buying up world market after world \nmarket. The USDA tells us they are going to surpass the United States \nin world market share for the first time in anyone's memory. That is \nwhere we are headed. We are headed for a circumstance in which America, \nwhich has dominated world agricultural trade, is headed for the No. 2 \nposition. And the Europeans believe, as they have told me, we are so \nprosperous that we will not fight back and, in fact, we will give up \nthese markets.\n\n[[Page S7325]]\n\n  I say to the Senator from Arizona, he would never engage in \nunilateral disarmament in a military confrontation. Why is he insisting \non it in an agricultural market confrontation? It makes no sense. Here \nwe are, outgunned 10 to 1, and he wants to make it an even greater \ndisparity; to say to our producers: We abandon you. We wave the white \nflag of surrender; we want the Europeans to take over these world \nagricultural markets that have long been ours.\n  We have to quit being naive on what is going on in world trade. It is \nnot free market. It is not free trade. It is managed trade; it is \nmanaged markets; it is a heavily subsidized battle over world market \nshare. That is what is going on. We can choose to give up and run to \nthe sidelines and give in or we can fight back. I hope the United \nStates decides to fight back. I hope we decide we are not going to \nabandon our producers and allow our major competitors, the Europeans, \nto dominate world agricultural trade. In the long term, that would be \nan economic disaster for this country and certainly for the tens of \nthousands of farmers all across America who are dependent on the wisdom \nof this body to recognize what is happening, and to stand by their side \nand be ready to fight because I can assure you, that is what the \nEuropeans are doing. They are fighting for world market share.\n\n  As one of the top Europeans described to me: Senator, we believe we \nare in an agriculture trade war with the United States. We believe that \nat some point there will be a cease-fire in this trade war, and we \nbelieve that whoever occupies the high ground will be the winner.\n  The high ground is world market share. They have told me at some \npoint they think there is going to be a cease-fire, and whoever \noccupies the high ground will be the winner, and the high ground is \nworld market share. That is what this is all about. The Europeans are \naggressively spending to gain world market share to be in a position of \nworld dominance in agriculture, and that strategy and that plan is \nworking.\n  If one looks at the trend lines over the last 20 years, one will find \nthe Europeans have gone from being the major importing region in the \nworld to the major exporting region today. They have done it in 20 \nyears. They have done it by discipline. They have done it by a plan. \nThey have done it by a strategy. They are counting on us not to be \npaying attention. They are counting on us to give up. They are counting \non us to give in. They are counting on us to wave the white flag of \nsurrender.\n  I pray this body does not go any further down this road of unilateral \nsurrender in world agriculture because we have already given up too \nmuch. The Europeans support their producers $324 an acre. The United \nStates supports its producers $34 an acre.\n  The Senator from Arizona said: Let's make this disparity even \ngreater. That is a disaster. That is a disaster, and we have the chance \nto stop it by this vote at 2 o'clock. I hope we take the opportunity.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside for the purpose of Senator Wellstone offering an \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3922\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3922.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone], for himself, \n     Mr. Harkin, Mr. Daschle, and Mr. Feingold, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3922.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To provide increased funding for the Grain Inspection, \n      Packers and Stockyards Administration for investigations of \n   anticompetitive behavior, rapid response teams, the Hog Contract \n   Library, examinations of the competitive structure of the poultry \n   industry, civil rights activities, and information staff, with an \n                                offset)\n\n       On page 9, line 6, strike ``$67,038,000'' and insert \n     ``$63,088,000, of which not less than $12,195,000 shall be \n     used for food assistance program studies and evaluations''.\n       On page 23, line 21, strike ``$27,269,000: Provided,'' and \n     insert ``$31,219,000: Provided, That not less than $3,950,000 \n     shall be used for investigations of anticompetitive behavior, \n     rapid response teams, the Hog Contract Library, examination \n     of the competitive structure of the poultry industry, civil \n     rights activities, and information staff: Provided \n     further,''.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nHarkin, Daschle, and Feingold be added as original cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, before proceeding, I say to the Senator \nfrom Nevada, the Democratic whip, if we have a vote at 2, I believe I \ncan finish with my presentation on this amendment and I will be pleased \nto go to another amendment right after the vote if my colleague wants \nme to move this along.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Minnesota --Senator \nCochran is not here--we have been alternating back and forth. We \nappreciate the cooperation.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I will do \nthis amendment and if there is a Republican amendment next, I will then \nfollow that next Republican amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to offer this amendment, again, \nwith Senators Harkin, Daschle, and Feingold, about competitive markets. \nI am hoping there will be a strong, if you will, free enterprise, pro-\ncompetition vote for this amendment, especially when it comes to \nlooking out for the interests of our producers, in particular our \nNation's livestock producers.\n  This amendment will fully fund the President's budget request for the \nGrain Inspection, Packers, and Stockyard Administration, called GIPSA, \nfunding they need to look at market concentration.\n  What we see right now--and it is a disturbing trend in our economy \nand certainly a disturbing trend in the food industry--is an increasing \nconcentration of power. We see inadequate price information both for \nproducers and consumers. We see lack of competition. We see \nanticompetitive practices. Consequently, GIPSA has been asked to assume \na more prominent role, as they should, in ensuring competitiveness--\nthat is all this amendment is about--and fairness in the livestock \nindustry. GIPSA is conducting a growing number of investigations on \nmarket concentration in agriculture, and they should be doing just this \nwork. The point is, they should be adequately funded to do the job.\n  What this amendment does is ensure GIPSA has the resources to meet \nthese additional responsibilities, and it increases funding for GIPSA--\nI say to Senators and staff, Democrats and Republicans, who are \nlistening--by a total of $3.95 million to fund these essential \nprograms. I am going to list these programs in a moment.\n  I recall a gathering I attended in Iowa. Senator Harkin I believe was \nthere. Senator Grassley was there. At this gathering, we had one family \nfarmer after another basically saying: Where is the Packers and \nStockyard Administration? Why are they not involved in representing us? \nWhere are they as we see more and more of these conglomerates taking \nover more and more of the market and we do not have the opportunity to \ncompete? They should be doing their job.\n  What we heard in return from Mike Dunn was: We will do the job, but \nwe need the resources.\n  That is what this amendment is about: making sure they have the \nresources to do the job they are supposed to do by virtue of the law of \nthe land.\n\n  What will the amendment do? It will add $1.2 million for \nanticompetitive behavior investigations. This is to look at what is \ngoing on in the industry and aggressively pursue especially \ninvestigations into anticompetitive activity in the livestock industry.\n  There will be $1.3 million for rapid response teams. This will \nenhance GIPSA's effectiveness in addressing\n\n[[Page S7326]]\n\nmajor investigative issues of immediate concern when it comes to \nanticompetitive practices or trade practice issues.\n  It will allow for $200,000 for the hog contract library. This will be \nused to comply with section 22 of the fiscal year 2000 Ag \nappropriations bill. This is the mandatory price reporting.\n  There will be $800,000 to examine the competitive structure of the \npoultry industry which will permit GIPSA to expand its activity in the \npoultry market to take a close look at characteristics of markets for \npoultry grower services.\n  There will be $100,000 for civil rights activities which will allow \nGIPSA to resolve its backlog of EEO complaints and to increase emphasis \non proactive efforts to maintain EEO goals and objectives. All of us \nare familiar with the grievances and the just cause of many African \nAmerican farmers in our country.\n  There will be $350,000 for information staff at GIPSA that will \nenable them to develop new educational programs which will be targeted \nto small and socially disadvantaged farmers and improve relations with \nproducers.\n  This is a modest amendment. There should be strong support for this \namendment. It is all about putting some free enterprise back into the \nfree enterprise system. It is all about being on the side of our \nproducers.\n  It simply says: Let's get the funding up to the administration's \nrequest. I think we should be doing much more than this, and I hope \nthat by the end of this Congress--in fact, I do not hope, it absolutely \nhas to happen--we will pass the Farmers and Ranchers Fair Competition \nAct which has been introduced by Senators Daschle and Leahy, and a \nnumber of others of us who have worked on this as well. Really, what we \nought to be talking about is some legislation that makes antitrust \naction a reality in this country. In the food industry we need it.\n\n  When I travel in the countryside--and I do quite often--the one issue \non which farm organizations agree--they don't agree on many--the one \nissue that brings farmers and rural people together is that we need to \nhave more competition. We need to have some antitrust action. These \nconglomerates have muscled their way to the dinner table, and they are \nforcing us out.\n  I do not know why we are so slow to take up this cause.\n  Let me give this amendment a little bit of context.\n  In the past decade and a half, we have seen an explosion of mergers \nand acquisitions and anticompetitive practices with record \nconcentration in American agriculture.\n  The top four pork packers have increased their market share from 36 \npercent to 57 percent.\n  The top four beef packers have expanded their market share from 32 \npercent to 80 percent.\n  The top four flour millers have increased their market share from 40 \npercent to 62 percent.\n  The market share of the top four soybean crushers has jumped from 54 \npercent to 80 percent.\n  Forty-nine percent of all chicken broilers are now slaughtered by the \nlargest four firms.\n  The list goes on and on.\n  The four largest grain buyers control nearly 40 percent of the \nelevator facilities in the country.\n  The result of this is that you have had this surge of concentration. \nYou have these conglomerates which have a tremendous amount of power, \nyou have GIPSA which does not have the resources to do the job, and you \nhave the Senate that has not passed a strong piece of legislation that \ncalls for antitrust action. As a result of that, the farmers, \neverywhere they turn, don't get a fair shake. When they look to whom \nthey buy from, it is a few large firms that dominate the market. When \nthey look to whom they sell to, it is a few large firms that dominate \nthe market.\n  Everybody in this Chamber knows that if you are at an auction, you \nare more likely to get a good price when there are a lot of bidders. I \nthink all of us are for competition. We need to have more competition, \nbut we need to have a level playing field for our producers.\n  I want to report on both the horizontal concentration, that was \nreflected in the statistics I mentioned, but also the ways in which we \nhave the vertical integration.\n  Take the pork industry. Pork packers are buying up what is called \ncaptive supply--hogs that they own or have contracted under marketing \nagreements. If this trend continues, you are going to see grain, \nsoybean production--it will be basically from the very beginning, from \nthe very point level of production, all the way to the supermarket.\n  The problem with this kind of vertical concentration is it destroys \ncompetitive markets. Potential competitors often don't know the sale \nprice for the goods at any point in the process. There is no price \ndiscovery--essentially no effective competition. If it continues at the \ncurrent pace, we are going to basically have all the industry dominated \nthis way.\n  Moreover, the vertical integration stacks the deck against the \nfarmers.\n  In April 1999, there was a report from the Minnesota Land Stewardship \nProject that found: Packers' practice of acquiring captive supplies \nthrough contracts and direct ownership is reducing the number of \nopportunities for small- and medium-sized farmers to sell their hogs. \nWith fewer buyers, and more captive supply, there is less competition \nfor our independent producers.\n\n  I want to make sure we can at least get this additional $3.95 million \nto GIPSA so they can do the job of being there on the side of \nproducers, so they can do the job of investigating potential or real \nanticompetitive practices.\n  It is a modest amendment, but it is hugely important to family \nfarmers.\n  Leland Swensen, president of the National Farmers Union, recently \ntestified--he is right--\n\n       The increasing level of market concentration, with the \n     resulting lack of competition in the marketplace, is one of \n     the top concerns of [American] farmers and ranchers. At most \n     farm and ranch meetings, market concentration ranks as either \n     the first or second in priority of issues of concern. Farmers \n     and ranchers believe that lack of competition is a key factor \n     in the low commodity prices they are receiving.\n\n  Some of these big packers are raking in record profits while our \nlivestock producers are facing extinction. The farm/retail spread, as \nevery Senator from every agriculture State knows, is growing wider and \nwider and wider, between what our producers get paid for what they \nproduce and what consumers pay. There is a whole lot of money and a \nwhole lot of profit that is made in the middle. I do not mind that, but \nI would like to see the livestock producers and our other producers in \nour farm States get a fair shake.\n  If there is one thing farmers ask for more than anything else, it is \na level playing field. If there is one thing they are worried about, it \nis this increasing concentration. We ought to be able to get this \nadditional money to GIPSA.\n  The vote on this amendment is all about whether or not we are willing \nto be there on the side of these family farmers, whether we are on the \nside of making sure we deal with anticompetitive practices, and whether \nwe take their concerns seriously.\n  One of the reasons I bring this amendment to the floor--yes, the \nadministration asked for this additional $3.95 million. I remember the \nmeeting in Iowa with Senator Grassley and Senator Harkin. And I \nremember Mike Dunn saying: Give us the money to do the job. That is \ntrue.\n  As I have said, these conglomerates have muscled their way to the \ndinner table, and they have pushed our producers out. We have too few \nfirms that dominate too much of the market, and we do not have enough \ncompetition. That is what this is about. I have said that.\n  But I also want all Senators to understand that this amendment is \nalso offered in the context of the record low prices and the record low \nincome. To tell you the truth, the AMTA payments are the only reason \nsome of our producers are able to continue, although those payments all \ntoo often amount to a subsidy in an inverse relationship to need, and \nfarmers are still demanding a decent price.\n  But the whole issue of price, the whole issue of producers getting a \nfair price, is highly correlated to whether or not there is going to be \nsome competition. It is highly correlated to whether or not we are \ngoing to take antitrust action seriously.\n\n  There is a reason we passed the Sherman Act in the late 1800s. There \nis a reason we passed the Clayton Act in the early 1900s. The reason \nis, to be there on the side of our producers.\n\n[[Page S7327]]\n\n  This amendment is a small amendment. It is a modest amendment. But I \nthink it puts Senators on record as to whether or not we are serious \nabout antitrust action.\n  The health and the vitality of rural America, our communities--I say \nto the Presiding Officer, who knows quite a bit about agriculture, \ncoming from the State of Illinois--is not based upon the number of \nacres of land that someone farms; it is not based upon the number of \nanimals someone owns. The health and the vitality of rural America is \nbased upon the number of family farmers who live in the community, \nbecause when family farmers live in a community, somebody is going to \nown the land; no question about it.\n  We will always have an agriculture industry. We are always going to \nhave a food industry. What is a more precious commodity than food? It \nis more precious than oil. The question is, How many farmers are going \nto live in the community that supports the schools, that supports the \nchurches, that supports the synagogues, that supports small businesses? \nThe farm dollar, if you are talking about a family farm, multiplies in \nthe community where people live, where they buy--a community they care \nabout. When you move to these conglomerates basically being in control \nand absentee investment, absentee ownership, when they make a profit, \nthey don't invest it back into the community.\n  John Crabtree of the Center for Rural Affairs sums it up this way:\n\n       Replacing mid-size farms with big farms reduces middle-\n     class entrepreneurial opportunities in farm communities, at \n     best replacing them with wage labor.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       A system of economically viable, owner-operated family \n     farms contributed more to communities than systems \n     characterized by inequality and large numbers of farm \n     laborers with below-average incomes and little ownership or \n     control of productive assets.\n\n  Can't we get at least a little additional funding to GIPSA so they \ncan do the job, so they can be there on the side of our producers, so \nthey can investigate whether or not we have monopoly practices, so they \ncan investigate whether or not family farmers are getting a decent \nprice, so they can investigate whether or not we have a few packers who \nare in collusion, who are involved in anticompetitive practices? I \nthink we can.\n  To provide a little more context, we are living in a time of merger \nmania. Joel Klein, who is doing a great job, head of the Justice \nDepartment's antitrust division, has pointed out that the value of last \nyear's mergers equaled the combined value of all mergers from 1990 to \n1996.\n  I heard Senator McCain make part of his argument. I am not sure I \nagreed with all of his argument, but one of the things Senator McCain \nfocuses on, which is fair enough, is the whole issue of money and \npolitics. I would argue that here we have a perfect example. Pick your \nindustry. In agriculture, I am talking about the way in which these \nconglomerates have controlled the market. How about the airline \nindustry? In my State of Minnesota, we are reading every other day that \nNorthwest might merge with American Airlines. We have already heard \nabout U.S. Air and United. We only have about six airlines now. We \nmight get down to three megacompanies. The question is, What is the \nimpact on consumers and what is the impact on the employees? What is \nthe impact on the State?\n\n  I could talk about banking. I could talk about energy. I could talk \nabout health insurance. I could talk about any number of sectors of the \neconomy. I could talk about telecommunications. Look at what has \nhappened since we passed that bill. Where is the protection for \nconsumers? And with all due respect, when we talk about a key issue, \nthe flow of information in a democracy, we don't want to have a few \nmedia conglomerates controlling almost all of the flow of information \nin a democracy.\n  I am speaking about the food industry, this very modest amendment. We \nmake policy choices. We paved the way for family farming with the \nHomestead Act. It was a good thing to do. We enacted parity legislation \nwhich was all about better prices, fair prices for family farmers in \nthe 1940s. It was a good thing to do. Then we cut loan rates in the \n1950s and 1960s. We passed the ``freedom to fail'' bill--I call it the \n``freedom to fail'' bill--a few short years ago. It dramatically \nreduced prices farmers got in the marketplace. I don't think it was a \nvery wise thing to do. Above and beyond all of that, today, what I am \nsaying is, let's at least vote for this modest amendment.\n  Going back to Lee Swenson's testimony, of the National Farmers Union:\n\n       The remaining firms are increasing market share and \n     political power to the point of controlling the governments \n     that once regulated the firms. Some of the biggest \n     corporations have gotten tax breaks or other government \n     incentives. . . . Corporate interests have also called on the \n     government to weaken environmental standards and immigrant \n     labor protections in order to allow them to reduce production \n     costs.\n\n  The bigger these agribusinesses get, the more influence they have \nover our policy choices. The bigger they get, the more money they can \nspend on political campaigns. The bigger they get, the more lobbyists \nthey can hire. The bigger they get, the more likely they are to be \nnamed special U.S. trade representatives, as is the case with the CEO \nof Monsanto. The bigger they get, the more likely public officials will \nbe to confuse their interests with the public interest, even if they \ndon't already do that. And the bigger they get, the more weight they \nwill pull in the media. It is a vicious cycle. These conglomerates have \nentirely too much political power. Their overwhelming size makes it too \neasy for them to dictate policies and to get even bigger.\n  There is something we can do in the short term. That is what this \namendment is about. We can provide GIPSA with adequate funding to \nconduct on-the-ground investigations of market concentration.\n  This is a modest amendment. We ought to have 100 votes for this \namendment. Over the longer term, we ought to do more. We ought to focus \non how we can enhance the bargaining power of our producers. We ought \nto figure out how we can be there on the side of producers, on the side \nof farmers, on the side of ranchers, on the side of rural America, and \non the side of consumers. I look forward to bringing a significant \npiece of antitrust legislation that Senator Daschle has introduced to \nthe floor of the Senate and having a major debate about what kind of \nantitrust action makes sense.\n\n  Referring to the minimum wage, in many ways that is what family \nfarmers are saying, too. We have families in the country who are \nsaying: We want to be able to make enough of a wage that we can support \nour families. We have family farmers who are saying: We want to be able \nto get at least a decent price so that we can afford to support our \nfamilies.\n  We should be sensitive to that concern. We should do no less than to \nat least pass this very modest amendment. This amendment would increase \nthe fund for GIPSA by $3.95 billion to fund essential programs. The \noffset comes out of ERS.\n  I think this vote is a vote that is critically important in farm \ncountry. It is also a critically important vote for Senators who are on \nthe side of consumers. I hope we will have strong support for it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, to my understanding, the Senator from \nMississippi, the manager of the bill, wishes to make a motion to table. \nIf that is the case, I would like to enter into a unanimous consent \nrequest that the vote occur following the vote on the motion to table \non the sugar amendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, it was my \nintention to move to table the Wellstone amendment, but I understand \nthere may be other Senators who want to speak on that amendment. I do \nnot want to cut off anybody. I do not intend to move to table at this \ntime.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague for his courtesy.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am hopeful that the Senate will \nseriously consider the proposal the Senator from Minnesota made. \nSenator Wellstone offered an amendment to actually cut the Economic \nResearch Service funding provided in this bill and add the money to the \nGrain Inspection, Packers, and Stockyards Administration for some \ninvestigations. He lists the investigations that ought to be \nundertaken,\n\n[[Page S7328]]\n\nwhich would be funded by this additional money. The fact is, any amount \nof money could be spent investigating these subjects. He lists these: \ninvestigations of anticompetitive behavior; rapid response teams; the \nhog contract library; examinations of the competitive structure of the \npoultry industry, civil rights activities, and informational staff.\n  What I am saying is that I would hate for the Senate to be put into a \nposition of having to analyze this and trying to figure out if we have \nenough money for the Grain Inspection, Packers, and Stockyards \nAdministration and all of the responsibilities they have. We have tried \nto go through the President's budget request, analyze it carefully, and \nthen present to the Senate an allocation of limited funds, and suggest \nthat this is appropriate for the Senate to pass. We think the Economic \nResearch Service, to be cut as proposed by Senator Wellstone, would be \nput in a difficult position of trying to provide accurate, reliable \ninformation that is helpful to farmers who are in the business of \nproducing crops and commodities, who make their living at this, and who \ndepend upon the Government agency that will be cut by this amendment. \nWe think the funds are needed. We have checked with that agency to see \nwhat the impact of this offset would be on them, and they--maybe \npredictably--suggest that it would work a real hardship.\n  We have had a difficult time making available funds for some of these \nagencies to accommodate pay increases, staffing requirements, and all \nof the other items of expense in the operation of the Department of \nAgriculture that would support important economic activities in our \ncountry. And so rather than try to figure out what to try to do with \nthis amendment and how to resolve it, I really think the best thing to \ndo is to move to table it and ask the Senate to support the committee's \njudgment.\n  I have a lot of regard for the Senator from Minnesota and his \nenthusiasm for these subjects. I sympathize with his concerns. He has \nmade a good speech. He has made a persuasive appeal to the Senate. In \nspite of that, I really think we need to stick with the committee's \njudgment on this. This bill has been developed on a bipartisan basis, \nwith the full participation of Senators on the Democratic side. We have \nlistened to suggestions from all Senators on both sides. So my hope is \nthat the Senate will trust the committee. That is what the committee \nstructure is about when it comes to questions such as this. There is no \nway for each individual Senator to look at this amendment and figure \nout all the practical consequences of it, consider the offset \nsuggested, and then make a decision.\n  Do you support the amendment offered by the Senator from Minnesota or \ndo you support the committee? That is the issue. I hope the Senate will \nsupport the committee's judgment on this issue.\n  I know now, after inquiry, that there are no other Senators who have \nasked to speak on this amendment. I move to table the Wellstone \namendment and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on \nthe Wellstone amendment occur immediately following the vote on the \nmotion to table the McCain amendment, which is going to take place at 2 \no'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that no second-\ndegree amendments be in order to the Wellstone amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3917\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I know we are getting ready to vote in a \nfew minutes. I wanted to thank my distinguished colleagues from \nMississippi and Iowa for managing an important appropriations bill. It \nis so important to my State of Louisiana and to many States and \ncommunities in this Nation.\n  I want to take 2 minutes, though, to address the sugar issue that was \nearlier debated on the floor and to submit some things for the Record. \nI listened to the debate this morning, and I know the sugar program, \nevery year, seems to conjure up all sorts of images that the opponents \nof this cost-effective program try to use: ``It is a sweet deal.'' ``It \nis a candy-coated program.'' ``It leaves a sour taste in people's \nmouths.'' Don't let these quick sound bites fool you. All the sugar \nfarmers and sugar beet farmers and producers in Louisiana and other \ncommunities who support these farmers and producers want is fairness.\n  Mr. President, there is nothing sweet about fatigue. That is what \nmany of our farmers in this Nation are experiencing this year--fatigue. \nThey are tired. They are stressed. Prices are low. There is drought in \nmany areas of our Nation. Farmers have been through a tough time, and \nsugar farmers are no exception.\n  This is a program that works. This is a program to which the \ntaxpayers provide very little money. This is a loan program. Actually, \nas has been said in the Record over and over again, the sugar policy \nthat we now have supported overwhelmingly--good support year after \nyear--doesn't cost the Government anything. It has been a revenue \nraiser of nearly $300 million during the decade of the nineties. All of \nthe 300 to 400 sugar farmers in Louisiana, their suppliers, and the \ncommunities that support them want is fairness. They would be shocked \nto know that the program that we understand as a loan program is termed \nby some as a ``giveaway'' program because they believe they are giving \nback. They believe they are paying taxes, and they are. They believe \nthey are supporting communities in Louisiana and others around the \nNation. It is not just Louisiana; it is Florida, Texas, California, \nWyoming, and Montana, as I can see and share from the map in front of \nme.\n  This is an important industry in our Nation, and I think the \nunderlying amendment would be devastating, obviously, to eliminate this \nprogram at a time when there is such a great need and at a time when it \nis actually a revenue raiser.\n  Let me also make a point that the opponents of the sugar program \nargue that we are trying to kill all imports. Nothing could be further \nfrom the truth. Nearly 20 percent of all of our sugar needs are met \nfrom imports from 40 different nations. This program works. It is a \nloan program. It is an issue of fairness. It is a time of difficulty. \nIt is not time to eliminate this program now.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote against the \nunderlying amendment that would eliminate this program, which has been \nhelpful not only to Louisiana but to many States and many communities \naround the Nation.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the McCain amendment. The yeas and nays have been ordered, and \nthe clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, could I just offer a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield without losing my right to the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                       Explanation For Not Voting\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, on rollcall vote No. 219 I was \nunavoidably detained and missed the vote. Had I been present, I would \nhave voted for the motion to table the McCain amendment. I ask \nunanimous consent that I be so recorded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Record will reflect the Senator's \ndecision.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, Senator Durbin and I wanted to take this \nopportunity to urge support for our amendment which is intended to \nspeed up generic drug reviews at the Food and Drug Administration. We \nare pleased to announce that the Hatch-Durbin amendment is cosponsored \nby Senators DeWine, Leahy, Wyden, Feinstein, Graham of Florida and \nVoinovich.\n  Specifically, our amendment increases funding for FDA's Center for \nDrug Evaluation and Review by $2.0 million over the Committee-\nrecommended amount.\n  We intend these funds to be used to provide much-needed additional \nresources, that is, appropriately-equipped staff, to the Office of \nGeneric Drugs. This will help them reduce review times for generic \nalternatives to brand-name pharmaceuticals, a considerable benefit to \nthe consumer.\n  One way they can do this is by establishing an additional chemistry \ndivision which will allow OGD to increase its efficiency thus \npermitting applications for new generic drugs to be considered and \napproved much more rapidly, giving patients access to these products \nmuch more quickly.\n  Mr. President, when I travel throughout my home state of Utah, I am \nbesieged by constituents who raise very valid complaints about the need \nto improve drug coverage for the elderly and others who cannot afford \nneeded medicines. I am very sympathetic to those concerns, and have \nmade this a high legislative priority.\n  But while we are in the midst of devising a program to improve \nMedicare coverage of pharmaceuticals, it is important to remember that \ngeneric drugs offer a less-costly, safe alternative to brand-name \nmedicines for seniors and others who cannot always afford prescription \ndrugs.\n  Our amendment will help offer those who are struggling to make ends \nmeet a viable alternative. It will help get less expensive and more \naffordable prescription drugs on the market more quickly so that \nseniors will have additional choice when it comes to purchasing their \nmedications.\n  None of us wants these vulnerable citizens to be faced with the \nHobson's choice of whether to purchase food or needed medications. The \nAmerican public, especially our seniors, can only benefit from having \nmore generic drug products available to them.\n  The problem we face is that the level of FDA resources devoted toward \nthe review and approval of generic drugs can be termed ``modest'' at \nbest.\n  The Office of Generic Drugs is currently funded at $37.8 million and \nwas flat-lined in the Administration's FY 2001 budget request.\n  In contrast to this relatively modest sum available for generic drug \nreview, I would point out that the overall budget for human drug review \nat the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research is $308 million. \nThis represents a total of 2,554 full time equivalents.\n  So the amount devoted to generic drug barely exceeds 10 per cent of \nthe human drug review budget.\n  Hiring additional professional review personnel, together with the \nnecessary computer equipment, at OGD would cost about $100,000 per \nreviewer. So our amendment will translate into about 20 additional \nstaff members and the computer equipment they need which would \ncertainly be adequate to fund a new chemistry division.\n  The FDA generic drug program currently utilizes about 370 staff \nmembers. This amendment, coupled with the $1.2 million, already in the \nSenate bill will give the generic drug unit at FDA a needed shot in the \narm.\n  As a principal author of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term \nRestoration Act of 1984, I have long been interested in how we can \nprovide better access to pharmaceuticals, which can do so much to \nimprove the health of the American public. Our nation needs both \ninnovative new drugs and affordable generic drugs.\n  I am particularly pleased that today about 40 percent of all U.S. \nprescriptions are written for generic products--most of which were made \navailable for generic competition under the 1984 law.\n  These generic drugs save consumers about $8 billion to $10 billion \neach year. And that's according to a CBO estimate based on 1994 data, \nso it seems reasonable to project that today's savings must be even \nhigher than the old $8 billion to $10 billion annual savings estimate.\n  Many of us have been pleased to learn that, since 1994, generic drug \napproval times have generally decreased: the median approval time was \n26.9 months in 1994; 27.0 months in 1995; 23 months in 1996; 19.3 \nmonths in 1997; and, 18 months in 1998.\n  Unfortunately, this five year downward trend was reversed in 1999. \nThe approval time rose to 18.6 months. This was in a year when the \nnumber of products approved actually fell from 225 drugs to 186 drugs. \nSo the time per completed review grew for the first time in 5 years and \nit is now growing at\n\n[[Page S7330]]\n\na time when many important drug products will be coming off patent.\n  We cannot afford to let this continue.\n  The data on the monthly averages rending applications are also \ntroublesome. Under the law, FDA has 180 days to act on a generic drug \napplication.\n  Let's look at what is happening with the number of generic drug \napplications that are overdue--that is at FDA for more than 6 months. \nIn 1995 the monthly average of backlogged generic drug applications was \n46 applications.\n  This number increased to 59 in 1996.\n  It jumped to 109 in 1997.\n  In 1998, it rose to 127 overdue applications.\n  And last year, the average monthly number of overdue generic \napplications rose again to 147 overdue applications.\n  So the number of overdue generic drug applications has grown by more \nthan 300 percent since 1995.\n  Clearly, this trend needs to be reversed.\n  It seems obvious to me that we want FDA to have sufficient resources \nto efficiently evaluate generic drug applications. The funds the Hatch-\nDurbin amendment provides would be sufficient to fund about 20 full-\ntime equivalents (or ``FTEs'') in the Office of Generic Drugs.\n  Given the fact that so many important medications are about to lose \ntheir patent status, it is imperative that FDA has the necessary \nskilled personnel and computer equipment to do the job of assuring the \nAmerican public that generic drug products come on the market as soon \nas possible.\n  We need to make sure that FDA's Office of Generic Drugs has \nsufficient resources to conduct timely reviews of generic drug \napplications. That's what this amendment accomplishes, and that is why \nSenator Durbin and I have joined together in a bi-partisan manner to \nwork to see that the promise of more affordable generic drug products \nreach the American public.\n  Mr. President, this is an important amendment. I am pleased that the \nmanagers are willing to put it into the bill. I think it is something \nthat will benefit everybody in this country. Hopefully, we can resolve \nsome of these conflicts with regard to generic drugs and help bring the \nprice of drugs down, as the Hatch-Waxman bill has done for the last 16 \nyears.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I join my colleague, the Senator from \nUtah, Mr. Hatch, in offering this amendment for consideration by the \nSenate.\n  This is an amendment which will provide $2 million more for the \nprocessing of approvals of generic drugs.\n  We are all familiar with the issue of prescription drug prices. We \ncertainly understand that Congress should do as much as possible to \nhelp reduce the high cost of these prescription drugs, particularly for \nthe elderly and disabled.\n  One of the things we are doing with this bipartisan amendment is \nproviding more money to the Food and Drug Administration for generic \ndrug approvals. The high prices of drugs can be significantly reduced \nby putting more generic drugs on the market. Generic drugs typically \nenter the market 25 to 30 percent below the cost of brand name drugs \nand within 2 years are 60 to 70 percent cheaper than brand name drugs. \nIncreasing the development of safe and effective generic drugs, is good \nfor American consumers.\n  Key to increasing access to such drugs, is making sure that the \napproval process is as efficient as possible. This chart illustrates \nthe number of applications pending more than 180 days before the Food \nand Drug Administration for generic drugs. As we can see, the numbers \nhave continued to increase. This is because the numbers that the Food \nand Drug Administration is being asked to approve has increased over \nthe past few years.\n  In fact, the median approval time for generics has steadily decreased \nfrom 19.6 months in 1997 to a little over 18 months in 1998 and 17.3 \nmonths in 1999. But under the present budget, according to the Food and \nDrug Administration, they are estimated to go up again in 2000 and \n2001, and we are going to see a slowdown in the approval of generics.\n  Senator Hatch and I have offered this amendment to provide $2 million \nto the Office of Generic Drugs. It is on top of the increase which the \nbill already puts in place of $1.2 million. This money will allow them \nto hire the professional people to approve the drugs, to put the \ncomputers and technology in place so that they can move forward with \nnew ways to assess the drugs on a more timely basis, and to make \ncertain that these drugs are available for American consumers as \nquickly as possible.\n  Very soon some of the blockbuster patent drugs are going to come off \npatent. Let me give some examples: Mevacor for high cholesterol, \nVasotec and Zestril for high blood pressure, Glucophage for diabetics, \nAccutane for cystic acne, Lovenox to prevent blood clotting and \nPrilosec for those with stomach acid, heartburn or ulcers. These brand \nname drugs have sales of billions of dollars. Prilosec alone has sales \nof over $2.8 billion annually. Together, these drugs represented over \n$8 billion in sales in 1997. This year, their sales are certainly far \nmore than this.\n  If we want to make certain these drugs move from brand name to \ngeneric so consumers across America can afford them, then the \ninvestment in the Food and Drug Administration which Senator Hatch and \nI propose is money well spent. I am happy to join Senator Hatch in this \neffort. I hope the Senate will approve this amendment and make it part \nof this appropriation bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, may I ask exactly how we are proceeding \nhere?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think what the manager of the bill wanted \nto do was to have the Harkin amendment disposed of at this stage.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, the pending \nbusiness is the Cochran amendment to the Harkin amendment. It would be \nhelpful, just as a coherent way of proceeding with the bill, if we \nwould proceed in regular order.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Harkin is here.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. It is my hope we could proceed to dispose of that \namendment.\n  Mr. REID. Momentarily, we should.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. As I suggested earlier, if the Senator will yield \nfurther, it would suit me if we adopted both the Cochran amendment and \nthe Harkin amendment on a voice vote to try to resolve the issue in \nconference with the House. I made that suggestion earlier.\n  Mr. REID. I suggested that to Senator Harkin and when I spoke to him \nearlier today, he was not willing to do that.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask both Senators, the Senator from \nMississippi or the Senator from Nevada, after we make a decision as to \nhow we will proceed with the Harkin amendment and the Cochran \namendment, am I in order next or do we go to an amendment on the other \nside? Just so I know whether I should need to be here. I am trying to \nmove things forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. L. Chafee). The Senator from Mississippi \nis recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I appreciate that spirit of cooperation \nvery much. I hope we can move on and complete action on the bill \nsometime this afternoon. To do that, we are going to have to act on the \namendments we have that are going to be offered. It doesn't matter, in \nmy view, who goes next. I don't really care. I am anxious that we \nproceed and move along and make good progress on the bill. Some \nSenators have already indicated that the list of amendments we have in \norder to be offered to the bill will not all be offered. That is good \nnews. We have had some Senators suggest that they are willing to forgo \noffering their amendments.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I may reclaim the floor, the two leaders \nhave instructed the managers of the bill, as I understand it, that they \nwant to finish this bill today. Is that the manager's understanding?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. It is.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that as soon as \nwe make a decision on the Harkin amendment, I be allowed to offer an \namendment.\n  Mr. REID. I think there is already a unanimous consent agreement that \nfollowing the amendment by the majority, the Senator from Minnesota \nwill be next in line.\n\n[[Page S7331]]\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3938\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. What is the regular \norder right now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is on the Cochran \namendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, let's go back to where we were a few hours ago when I \nfirst offered an amendment this morning. That amendment would state \nclearly that the Department of Agriculture--the Secretary of \nAgriculture--had the authority to set standards for pathogen reduction \nin meat and poultry inspection. Again, the amendment was carefully \ndrafted not to set the standard. That should not be our business.\n  The reason for the amendment was precipitated by a court case in \nTexas in May in which a Federal district court judge found that the \nDepartment of Agriculture--the Secretary of Agriculture--lacked the \nstatutory authority to set and enforce pathogen reductions in meat and \npoultry inspection.\n  When the Department established its new inspection rules in 1996, the \nUSDA adopted a new food safety system based on hazard analysis, \ncritical control points, and pathogen reduction standards, otherwise \nknown now as HACCP. The system was designed to protect human health by \nreducing the levels of bacteria contamination in meat and poultry \nproducts. It has been in existence now for 4 years.\n  What then happened was we had this plant in Texas, Supreme Beef. \nThree times they were warned by the inspectors that they were not \nmeeting the salmonella reduction standards. Three times they failed. It \nis not that they weren't warned adequately; they were. On the third \ntime when they failed it, the USDA did the only thing they could do \nunder the authority they have, and that was to withdraw inspection from \nthe plant, and, in effect, by withdrawing inspection from the plant, \nthe plant had to shut down.\n  The plant hired attorneys and took the case to district court and got \nan injunction. They got an injunction against the USDA so that they \ncould keep operating, and they did. Then the judge decided, after a \nhearing, that the USDA lacked the legislative and statutory authority \nto both implement the rule and to enforce it. That is why we are here \ntoday with this amendment.\n  We have worked long and hard on this. This is not something new. \nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, both the House and the Senate Agriculture \nCommittees had numerous hearings. The Department of Agriculture, under \nboth Republican and Democratic Presidents, had numerous field hearings \nand rulemaking procedures. They eventually came up with this new \nprogram that blended the old inspection program with new flexibility \nfor industry and new standards for pathogen reduction.\n  Why was this necessary? Because we have bigger plants now, faster \nassembly lines, meat and poultry go through the system faster; and we \nalso found increases, according to the Centers for Disease Control, in \na number of foodborne illnesses that we had not seen before in our \ncountry. So we wanted to have a system whereby we could assure \nconsumers of the highest level of confidence that once that meat left \nthe slaughterhouse, once it left the processor, it would be as safe as \npossible.\n  Here again are CDC's statistics on foodborne illness. I had this \nchart this morning. It indicates that there are 76 million illnesses \nevery year because of foodborne pathogens, 325,000 hospitalizations, \nand 5,000 deaths.\n  Now, since we established the rule in 1996, salmonella rates in \nground beef have dropped 43 percent for small plants and 23 percent for \nlarge plants.\n  Since these performance standards were issued in 1996, we have had \nthis big drop in salmonella in ground beef. The standard is working. \nBut now a district court has said USDA lacks the statutory authority to \nenforce that standard. That was why I offered my amendment this \nmorning. Not to set a standard but only to say USDA has the statutory \nauthority to enforce a standard once it has been set. Adoption of my \namendment doesn't mean that a packing plant or a processing plant \ncouldn't still go to court and say: Your rule is arbitrary or it is \nonerous or it is inapplicable. But we never got to that in the Supreme \nBeef case. The Court just said they lacked the authority to set the \nrule.\n  So they have thrown overboard years and years of work by the Senate \nCommittee on Agriculture, the House Committee on Agriculture, and the \nDepartment of Agriculture under both Republicans and Democrats, and \nRepublican and Democratic Secretaries of Agriculture to make progress \nin improving food safety.\n  This morning, I tried to give statutory authority to the Secretary of \nAgriculture because without authority to enforce food safety standards, \nconsumers are left exposed in this country. All we are trying to do is \ngive them that authority.\n  There was a motion to table the amendment made by the Senator from \nMississippi. The motion to table lost on a tie vote. The Senator from \nMississippi then put a second-degree amendment on my amendment. We were \ntaking a look at it trying to figure out exactly what it did. It only \nchanges a few words in my amendment. My amendment says at the end, \nstandards ``established by the Secretary''--not our standard but \nstandards set by the Secretary. The amendment by the Senator from \nMississippi strikes that ``established by the Secretary'' and says \n``promulgated with the advice of the National Advisory Committee on \nMicrobiological Criteria for Foods.'' The key part of his amendment is \n``and that are shown to be adulterated.''\n  What do those words mean?\n  First of all, when they say ``promulgated with the advice of the \nNational Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods,'' \nthe committee was were there when they first came up with the \nstandards. They had input on the standards when they were established \nin 1996. There may be debate about the extent of consultation, but they \nwere consulted. But the key words of the amendment by the Senator from \nMississippi are these: ``that are shown to be adulterated.''\n  What does that mean? If the amendment of the Senator from Mississippi \nis adopted, it will mean that the Department of Agriculture will have \nto go all the way back and again go through rulemaking to develop new \nperformance standards. We, under the amendment of the Senator from \nMississippi, are codifying a standard.\n  The Senator from Mississippi, this morning, was saying the amendment \nthat I offered was codifying the standard. I challenged him to show \nwhere that was so. It is not so. We do not codify a standard. Yet the \namendment of the Senator from Mississippi codifies a standard. What is \nthat standard shown to be? Adulteration; that is the standard.\n  What does that mean? It means that USDA now can't just go into a \nplant and test for pathogen reduction and for salmonella and say they \nare not meeting the standard on salmonella--that they are failing to \nreduce pathogens. They now have to show that the meat is adulterated. \nThat is what we have been doing for 70 years. A USDA inspector in a \nplant has had that authority for all of my lifetime, and for all of the \nlifetime of the Presiding Officer. They have the authority to go into a \nplant and withdraw inspection on the basis of adulteration. That is the \nold standard.\n  The Senator from Mississippi would turn the clock back to where we \nwere before 1996. No longer will we be able to say to parents: Your \nkids can have school lunches and not worry about pathogens because we \nhave a pathogen reduction standard that is being enforced. No, we will \nhave a gaping hole there because USDA will now have to show that the \nfood is adulterated. It will have to show that the plant is unsanitary. \nThat is what we tried to get beyond in 1996.\n\n  The key part of the amendment by the Senator from Mississippi is that \nit codifies the adulteration standard as the essential element of \npathogen reduction standards. Yet the Senator\n\n[[Page S7332]]\n\nfrom Mississippi went after this Senator, just this morning, claiming \nthat I was trying to codify a standard, which I wasn't. The judge in \nthe Supreme Beef case said that for the USDA to take action, it had to \nshow adulteration. That was the key part of the case. The judge said \nunder the statutory law that exists, the only way the USDA can shut \ndown an inspection line is if they show that it is adulterated--not \nthat they didn't meet a salmonella reduction standard, not that they \nhad pathogens in their food. They have to show that it is adulterated, \nthat there are unsanitary conditions in the plant.\n  Based on that holding, the judge said the USDA lacked the authority \nto enforce the existing salmonella standards. This amendment takes the \nholding in the Supreme Beef case, and makes it the law of the land. It \nmakes the standard ``adulteration''. This amendment would make it the \nlaw of the land--not just in Texas but all over the country. Why would \nwe want to do that? If we have to go back to ``promulgate with the \nadvice,'' we will be another 2, 3, or 4 years waiting for pathogen \nreduction standards.\n  What do we tell our consumers in the meantime? There is no standard. \nWe go right back to where we were before. What do we tell the 325,000 \nAmericans hospitalized every year because of foodborne illnesses? What \ndo we tell the parents of kids eating school lunches? This amendment by \nthe Senator from Mississippi would throw all of our meat inspection \ninto a huge morass. It would basically say we are back now where we \nwere 30 years--poke and sniff and have to prove that it is adulterated, \nor have to prove it is unsanitary.\n  What does that mean? Salmonella can enter meat, for example, \nanywhere. It can enter it in the livestock yards, slaughterhouses, \ntransportation, processing facilities. The point is not to lay blame on \nanyone. It is not to have the processor say: Our plant is clean, it is \nsanitary, and if there is salmonella there, we are not to blame, go \nblame somebody else.\n  I don't care who is to blame. I want to stop it. We want to stop it. \nWe want to make sure that there is a system in place so that if there \nare pathogens in meat and poultry, we find out where they are coming \nfrom and stop them. That is what HACCP is all about. But under the \namendment by the Senator from Mississippi, USDA could go right back to \nSupreme Beef, and they could say: Guess what. You are not meeting the \nsalmonella pathogen reduction standard we set, you have failed too many \ntests. Supreme Beef could say: We don't care what you think because you \ndon't have the authority to do anything about it. Is that the kind of \nmessage we want to send to our consumers?\n\n  I don't have any letters in my office, but someone told me there are \nsome papers circulating that the American Meat Institute is opposed to \nmy amendment and supporting the amendment by the Senator from \nMississippi. I have worked many years for the American Meat Institute. \nI have a high regard for them. I have a lot of livestock production in \nmy home State. I have slaughtering facilities and processing facilities \nin my home State. If it is true the American Meat Institute is taking \nthe position that the USDA can only have a pathogen reduction standard \nbased on adulteration, they are doing a disservice to my livestock \nproviders, they are doing a disservice to my packers, and they are \ndoing a disservice to my processors.\n  Why? Because the word will be out on the street, and it will be in \nevery consumer report. It will be in every newsletter that goes out \nthat you can't trust the meat and poultry products that are coming from \nour processors and our packers because we no longer have a pathogen \nreduction standard.\n  Let me be very clear. If the Cochran amendment is adopted, new \nrulemaking will be mandatory. It will take at least 2 or 3 years to set \nthe rules because they will have to have hearings and public comment. \nThey went through all that less than 6 years ago. The Cochran amendment \nmeans they have to go through it again.\n  What happens during the next 2 to 3 years while the rulemaking is in \neffect? There will be no standards in effect, no pathogen reduction \nstandards in effect. I hope Senators who are here, who are listening in \ntheir offices, and staffs who are listening, understand this. The \nCochran amendment will necessitate new rulemaking. It will take a long \ntime, and during that period of time, there will be no pathogen \nreduction standards enforceable by the USDA.\n  If the Senator wanted to amend his amendment and just say that would \nbe issued ``with the advice of the National Advisory Committee on \nMicrobiological Criteria for Foods, period,'' that would be acceptable.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3955, as modified\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I ask unanimous consent that my amendment to the Harkin \namendment be modified as suggested by the Senator; that the last phrase \nbe stricken--``and that are shown to be a adulterated''--so the \namendment to the amendment reads:\n\n       Strike ``established by the Secretary'' and insert in lieu \n     thereof: ``promulgated with the advice of the National \n     Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the right to modify his \namendment.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n       On page 2 of the amendment: Strike ``established by the \n     Secretary'' and insert in lieu thereof: ``promulgated with \n     the advice of the National Advisory Committee on \n     Microbiological Criteria for Foods.''\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Mississippi if I \ncan engage in a colloquy.\n  The Senator's amendment now reads ``promulgated with the advice of \nthe National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for \nFoods.''\n  Mr. COCHRAN. That is correct. I have modified my amendment according \nto what the Senator has just said would be accepted. I assume the \nSenator will accept the amendment and we can adopt it.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I think we may have an agreement.\n  If I could ask the Senator from Mississippi, is it the Senator's \nintention to leave the existing standards in effect during the period \nof time that the committee would make recommendations?\n  My problem is ``promulgated.'' I had two issues with the Senator's \nlanguage. One, my problem with ``adulterated'', has been taken care of; \nthe other, what does ``promulgated,'' mean remains. If USDA promulgates \nnew standards and in the meantime can't enforce the existing standards, \nwe are going to have a 2- or 3-year period of time where we have no \nenforceable pathogen reduction standards.\n  I ask the Senator, Is it your intention that during this period of \ntime we would leave the existing standards in effect?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if my amendment is accepted by the \nSenator, my amendment would amend your amendment only in one respect; \nthat is, on page 2 of the amendment we would strike the words \n``established by the Secretary'' and insert the language that I quoted: \n``promulgated with the advice of the National Advisory Committee on \nMicrobiological Criteria for Foods.''\n  That is the only respect in which my amendment would modify or change \nthe amendment of the Senator from Iowa. In all other respects, the \nSenator's amendment remains as he offered it.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Again, I understand that. But I am concerned about the \nwords ``promulgated with the advice of the National Advisory Committee \non Microbiological Criteria for Foods.'' I don't mind that. They were \ninvolved with the standards established in 1996.\n  If it is the Senator's intention that the Department of Agriculture \nshould go ahead, go back and take a look at whether or not they should \nrevise those rules and those standards, I don't have any problem with \nthat. That is what rulemaking is all about.\n  I am worried that we will have a gap of time where we will have no \nenforceable standards. That is why I want to make sure that at least \nduring the period of time when they may be revising those standards the \nexisting standards remain enforceable.\n  My concern, again, is if someone were to raise a question about the \nextent at which the existing standard was set with the advice of the \ncommittee, I want to make sure that would\n\n[[Page S7333]]\n\nnot bar enforcement. If we had a colloquy to clear that up, that \nstandards would stay in place pending any changes in rulemaking, that \nwould be fine.\n  I ask if that is the Senator's intention.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield again, I think \nmy amendment speaks for itself. If it is unclear, then the legislative \nhistory and trying to determine the intent of Congress in the use of \nthe words is relevant. If the language is clear on its face and the \nmeaning is clear on its face, then legislative history and intent and \nour conversation is never considered by a court.\n  My view is that this is about as clear as we can say anything. That \nis, that any regulations promulgated under the authority of this act to \nwhich the Senator's amendment applies must be done with the advice of \nthe National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods. \nThat is all my amendment seeks to do. That is all that is intended by \nmy amendment. There is no intent to speak on any other subject, to \naffect the decisions of the Department of Agriculture in promulgating \nstandards, promulgating regulations. My amendment is limited strictly \nto seeking the advice in the process of promulgating standards of the \nNational Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods. I \ndon't know how I can say it, how it can be said any clearer than the \nlanguage of the amendment says it. So the Senator can ask me whether I \nintend anything else and I can assure him I don't intend anything else, \nother than the clear and precise meaning of the words that are used in \nthe amendment.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. As the Senator and I were talking earlier, lawyers can \nargue about words and what they mean. Still, the words that are used in \nthe Senator's amendment seem to indicate to me we have to go through \nrulemaking. Again, I am concerned, if that is how it is interpreted, \nthen we are going to have a period of time that we may not have any \nenforceable standards. That is what I want to clarify.\n  That is why I wanted to engage in the colloquy. I do not believe it \nis clear, on its face, exactly what it means.\n  If it means that the standards we have now were promulgated with \nsufficient advice that we would not need new rulemaking, then that is \nokay. That is why we need some legislative history on this. That is why \nI was trying to engage in a colloquy.\n  I ask the Senator from Mississippi: Does his language mean USDA will \nhave to go through rulemaking again? Does this leave a gap in the \nstandards? That is all I am trying to get to. Maybe if we can talk \nabout it a little more, we will get to this thing. I don't know. \nSometimes it is hard.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. If the Senator will yield, I will be happy to assure him \nthat my intent in offering the amendment is to involve the National \nAdvisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods in the process \nby which the Secretary promulgates regulations or standards with \nrespect to this act to which his amendment relates.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I have no problem with that. If that is the intent, to \nsay--I will repeat to make sure I do not misunderstand--that the \nSenator's intent by using the word ``promulgate'' is to say that any \nfuture rulemaking--I want to make sure the Senator hears my words, to \nmake sure I am OK on this--that any future rulemaking done by the \nSecretary of Agriculture has to be done with the advice of the National \nAdvisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods, and that \nduring any rulemaking when they are seeking that advice, the present \nstandards will stay in place and be enforceable, that is fine.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, my amendment \ndoes not address the present standards and the effect of the decision \nof the court in Texas. The amendment of the Senator deals with that. I \nam only trying to address one small aspect of this, and that is the \ninvolvement of this national advisory committee so the Secretary would \nhave the benefit of scientific advice and evidence and information.\n  Mr. HARKIN. As I said, I----\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I don't think I can satisfy the Senator's curiosity \nabout the legal effect of his amendment as amended by my amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. All I want to be satisfied about is that there will be \nenforceable standards in effect.\n  From what I hear, I like it. I want the committee to be involved in \nadvising the Secretary. If the Senator tells me that the present rules \nthat have been promulgated are still enforceable during the pendency of \nthat consultation, then I have no problem. But the language says USDA \ncan only enforce a standard if it is ``promulgated with advice''. I am \nwondering what this means for the standards we have right now. I want \nto clear this up.\n  Can the rules we have now be enforced? Or can only rules that are \npromulgated in the future be enforced with the advice of the committee? \nThat is where we are hung up over these words. Words do have meaning.\n  I will say again, if the interpretation is that the standards that \nare now in effect remain enforceable, and that any future rules adopted \nby the Secretary have to be done with the advice and consultation of \nthe committee, I have no problem with that. Then we don't have a gap. \nAnd I hope that is the meaning.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for an \nobservation, I accommodated the Senator's interest--I tried to--by \nmodifying my amendment in a way that he said would make it acceptable.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I struck the language that he suggested bothered him. He \nread that language to be ``that is shown to be adulterated.''\n  He was worried about connecting proof of contaminated food with the \nability of the Department of Agriculture to shut down a plant. And he \nthought with the addition of those words I was adding something new, a \nnew hurdle that had to be crossed by the Department of Agriculture in \nimplementing the standards. So I modified the amendment to remove the \ntroublesome words, to assure him the crux of the amendment was to get \nthe advice and the input of the experts, the scientific experts. And I \nmodified it. And that is not enough. Now the Senator wants me to \ninterpret the legal status of these regulations as they are affected by \nthis district court decision in Texas.\n  This morning I tried to put that all in context. I know I am taking \nmuch too much time. I discussed the reasons for my motion to table the \nHarkin amendment. I have just about gotten worn out with explaining why \nI wanted to table the Harkin amendment, why I thought it was an \namendment that ought not be put on this Agriculture appropriations \nbill. I have said it over and over again. The Senate voted on that, and \nthe motion to table was not agreed to. The vote was tied, 49-49.\n  I could have let the amendment then be voted on by the Senate without \nany further amendment but, frankly, I thought it would be helpful to \nthe Senate to clarify the rule problem I had with the amendment, and \nthat was why we added the language as an amendment. I proposed at that \ntime that amendment, the Cochran amendment to the Harkin amendment, be \nadopted by a voice vote and then the Harkin amendment be adopted by a \nvoice vote.\n  Think about that. We had just had a tie vote on the whole issue. Yet \nwe offered to let the amendment of the Senator that almost was tabled, \nlacking one vote to be tabled, be agreed to and go on to considering \nother issues. That was not good enough either.\n  We took up other business because the Senator was not prepared to \nproceed to consider the bill further. He wanted to do something else. \nWe finally, now after having taken up several other amendments, get \nback to the Harkin amendment.\n  He complained and pointed out what was troubling him. We tried to \nmodify it. I have done everything I can think up to satisfy the Senator \nand to give him the right to have his arguments on the floor of the \nSenate, to have this issue fully considered, and to have the Senate act \non it.\n  I have gone about as far as one can go. I am hopeful the Senator will \nagree that the Cochran amendment can be adopted on a voice vote--if he \nwants to have a record vote, be my guest--and adopt the Harkin \namendment on a voice vote, as amended by the Cochran amendment.\n\n[[Page S7334]]\n\n  Otherwise, maybe I will try to renew the motion to table. Maybe \nSenators have heard enough now so they know what the facts are about \nthis amendment and that it is an attempt to reverse a decision of a \ndistrict court in Texas that can be appealed to the court of appeals if \nthe Department of Agriculture wants to appeal it and if the Department \nof Justice wants to prosecute the appeal for them. That is up to the \nDepartment and the lawyers at the Department of Justice. I am being \nasked to interpret and sort through this and give a definitive answer \nabout the effects when lawyers argued their case in Texas probably for \na long and full time before a court there. They made a decision.\n  What I am saying is, I would like to satisfy the Senator, but I do \nnot think there is any way to do it. We should just move on, and let's \nvote and see how the votes turn out.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I reclaim the floor. I was hoping there \nmight be a reasonable outcome. As I said, the Record will show earlier \nI said there were two problems with the amendment. One was with \nadulteration, which the Senator took care of. The other was the word \n``promulgated.''\n  If the Senator will further modify his amendment to say that future \nrules must be promulgated with the advice of the National Advisory \nCommittee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods, that would settle the \nissue once and for all.\n  That means any future rulemaking done by USDA would have to be done \nwith the advice of this committee, but that the existing rules \nmeanwhile will stay in effect and be enforceable. If the Senator will \ndo that, we are done.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 3955, As Modified, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I withdraw my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 3938\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n3938.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3919.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To require the use of certain funds transferred to the \nEconomic Research Service to conduct a study of reasons for the decline \n   in participation in the food stamp program and any problems that \n households with eligible children have experienced in obtaining food \n                                stamps)\n\n       On page 48, strike lines 12 through 16 and insert the \n     following:\n\n     ``(7 U.S.C. 612c): Provided, That, of the funds made \n     available under this heading, $1,500,000 shall be transferred \n     to and merged with the appropriation for ``Food and Nutrition \n     Service, Food Program Administration'' for studies and \n     evaluations: Provided further, That not more than $500,000 of \n     the amount transferred under the preceding proviso shall be \n     available to conduct, not later than 180 days after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, a study, based on all available \n     administrative data and onsite inspections conducted by the \n     Secretary of Agriculture of local food stamp offices in each \n     State, of (1) any problems that households with eligible \n     children have experienced in obtaining food stamps, and (2) \n     reasons for the decline in participation in the food stamp \n     program, and to report the results of the study to the \n     Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and \n     the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the \n     Senate: Provided further, That of the funds made available \n     under this heading, up to $6,000,000 shall be for''.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want to say to Senators at the \nbeginning of my remarks, and I say to my colleague from Mississippi, I \nam going to try to be brief; I don't intend to speak for a long period \nof time. I want to summarize this amendment for Members of the Senate, \nand I want to talk about why I think this is one of the most important \namendments I have ever brought up and why I would like to have a vote \non it or a commitment that this stays in conference committee.\n  This amendment would provide a little additional funding, $500,000, \nto the Food and Nutrition Service. This is all from within ERS. These \nare some good people. I am calling for the Food and Nutrition Service \nto be out in the field and to do some important policy evaluation for \nus about why it is that in the last half decade or so we have seen \nabout a 30-percent decline in food stamp participation. There is not a \n30-percent decline in poverty.\n  As a matter of fact, I am sad to say on the floor of the Senate that \nthere has actually been an increase in the poverty of the poorest \nchildren in homes which have poverty-level income. They can evaluate \nwhy it is that one out of every ten households is ``food insecure,'' \nsome 36 million, 37 million, and 40 percent of them children. And with \na major safety net program for children, we can make sure that children \nare not malnourished and don't go hungry. We have seen a dramatic \ndecline in participation.\n  What is going on? We are the decisionmakers. We are the policymakers. \nLet's have an honest evaluation because the background to this program \ngoes something like this: In the mid and late sixties--I remember I was \na student at the University of North Carolina when these studies first \ncame out. There were a series of studies and exposes. There was a CBS \ndocumentary--Hunger U.S.A., I think--in 1968. We saw children with \ndistended bellies. We read about and heard about children who were \nsuffering with scurvy and rickets. We could not believe that in America \nwe had widespread malnutrition and hunger. We don't talk about this \nenough on the floor of the Senate.\n\n  Senator Cochran from Mississippi--I am not trying to ingratiate \nmyself to him--actually is one of the Members in\n\n[[Page S7335]]\n\nthe Senate who has been most focused on food and nutrition programs. It \nwas Richard Nixon, a Republican President, who said we have to make \nsome changes on this issue, and whether or not we are going to have \nsome kind of safety net. It won't be Heaven on Earth. It won't be \nperfect. But we will at least make sure that we try to get some help to \nthese families. We are going to make sure this is a Federal program. Do \nyou want to know something, colleagues? This is public policy that has \nworked because we dramatically reduced, up until recently, the extent \nof malnutrition and hunger in the country.\n  What is happening now with this program? The Food and Nutrition \nService would go out in the field. They would study the barriers faced \nby families with limited access to the Food Stamp Program. What are the \nreasons for the dramatic decline in participation in the Food Stamp \nProgram? On-site review out in the field completed within 180 days a \nreport and sent it to us.\n  The food stamp rolls have plummeted over the last several years. \nSince April of 1996, nearly 8.6 million people have dropped off the \nfood stamp rolls and more than 1 million last year alone.\n  If this was because of a reduction in poverty, I wouldn't worry about \nit. But that is not what it is.\n  Of the 36 million people living in food-insecure households --I hate \nthat language. They live in homes where they are either going hungry or \nthey are malnourished. Of 14.5 million Americans, 40 percent are \nchildren.\n  A study by Second Harvest, the Nation's largest domestic hunger \nrelief organization, found that more than one out of every three \npersons served by food banks are children.\n  By the way, in almost 40 percent of the households that rely on \nemergency food assistance, there was at least one adult who was \nemployed.\n  You have a lot of people in our country who are working poor people. \nThey are eligible for this assistance. It makes a real difference to \nthem and their children. But we have seen this dramatic decline in \nparticipation. I think we need to know why.\n  A report by the U.S. Conference of Mayors shows similar results. It \nshows there has been a dramatic increase--can you believe it--in the \ndemand for emergency food assistance in major cities across the United \nStates in the last 15 years.\n  Can I make that clear? We have a booming economy. We are talking \nabout all of this affluence. There are people who spend $10,000 or \n$15,000 on one vacation, and the Conference of Mayors says we are \nseeing a dramatic demand in the need for emergency food assistance.\n  Catholic Charities, the Nation's largest private human service, \nreported providing emergency food services to more than 5.6 million, \nmore than 1 million of whom were children.\n  When we are talking about food pantries, when we are talking about \nCatholic Charities, when we are talking about Second Harvest, when we \nare talking about all of these relief organizations saying there has \nbeen this increase in demand and saying that many of the citizens they \nhelp are children, something is wrong. Something is wrong with our \npriorities. No citizen in America should be hungry today. No child \nshould be hungry.\n\n  I don't have the statistics. But I am guessing. It is just intuition. \nIt is what I have seen with my own eyes. There are also significant \nnumbers of elderly people who are malnourished.\n  The Food Research and Action Center, which I believe has done the \nvery best work in this area, reports that more than 1.2 million people \nleft the food stamp rolls between October 1998 and October 1999. Again, \n8.6 million people have left the Food Stamp Program since April of \n1996.\n  Senators, here is the statistic that is jarring. According to the \nUSDA, more than one-third of those who are eligible for the Food Stamp \nProgram are not receiving benefits. We had a dramatic decline of about \na 30-percent drop over the last 4 years, and USDA itself comes out and \nsays that one-third of those who are eligible are not receiving any \nbenefits at all.\n  A report released by the National Campaign for Jobs and Income \nSupports, another really good organization and good coalition, found \nthat the number of poor people receiving food stamps has declined by 37 \npercent--more than 10 million people since 1994--although the number of \npeople living in poverty has not declined anywhere close to the same \nrate.\n  In 1995, for every 100 poor people in the country, 71 were using food \nstamps. In 1998, for every 100 poor people, only 54 were using food \nstamps.\n  A General Accounting Office report recently released found that \n``food stamp participation has dropped faster than related economic \nindicators would predict.'' An Urban Institute report found that \n``about two-thirds of the families who left the Food Stamp Program were \nstill eligible for food stamps.''\n  A July 1999 report prepared for the U.S. Department of Agriculture by \nMathematica Policy Research, Incorporated, identified lack of client \ninformation as a barrier to participation.\n  In other words, people are not being told that they are eligible. \nThey are not being told that they can help their children by \nparticipating in this food nutrition program.\n  Food stamps can mean the difference between whether or not the child \nhas an adequate diet. Food stamps can make a difference between whether \nor not a child goes hungry. Food stamps can make a difference as to \nwhether or not little children ages 1, 2 and 3 get adequate nutrition \nfor the development of their brain. Food stamps can make a difference \nin terms of whether or not a child goes to school with an empty stomach \nand not able to learn. Food stamps can make a difference as to whether \nor not a child can do well in school and, therefore, well in life.\n  I am speaking with some indignation. I know that we don't have a lot \nof debate on these issues. But this amendment is relevant to this bill. \nFood stamps can determine whether or not a child is able to concentrate \nand able to bond with other children, and whether a child can do well \non these standardized tests that we are giving.\n  We are given all these standardized tests the kids have to pass--if \nthey fail, they are held back as young as age 8--but we have not made \nsure that children who could benefit from food nutrition programs so \nthey do not go hungry, so they are not malnourished, are able to \nbenefit.\n  I just can't believe that during a thriving stock market, with record \neconomic performance, with record affluence, with record wealth, with \nrecord surpluses, we have seen over the last half a decade a 33-percent \nor more decline in food stamp participation, and we have today in the \nUnited States of America 37 million Americans who are ``food \ninsecure,'' 40 percent of them children.\n  I told my friend, Senator Cochran, I would be relatively brief. I \ncould go on and on. About a year ago, I brought this amendment to the \nfloor. The Senator from Mississippi, who cares about these issues, \naccepted the amendment. It was knocked out in conference committee. It \nmakes me furious. What in the world is the matter with the Congress \nthat we are not even willing to let the Food and Nutrition Service make \na policy evaluation? Why it is, with the most important safety net \nprogram for children in America to make sure they are not malnourished \nand make sure they do not go hungry, we are not even willing to support \nthat?\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I hope there will be a strong vote for this amendment. \nI hope and I pray that we can keep this in conference because we should \ndo this evaluation; we should get a report; we should know what is \ngoing on. This is important. This is all about whether our citizens, \npeople in the country, are malnourished or not, whether they go hungry \nor not, whether children have a chance or not, whether we provide the \nhelp that elderly people need. We are not doing a good job. Something \nis wrong.\n  I think if we get the study done--I don't know why we can't--then we \nwill no longer be in a position of not knowing or not wanting to know \nand we will take some action.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the remarks of the\n\n[[Page S7336]]\n\nSenator from Minnesota and bringing this issue to the attention of the \nSenate, frankly. More and more in the last few years, unemployment \nrates have been coming down. The economy is strong. Everybody knows \nthat.\n  And I kept asking, why aren't the participation rates in food stamps \nand other nutrition programs coming down? For a little while, they were \ngoing up, too. We had the number of people wanting work, finding work, \ngoing up. Incomes were going up. In my State of Mississippi, we saw \nincome levels reaching new highs, but the food stamp participation was \nstill going up.\n  Pretty soon, though, that began to change and the food stamp \nparticipation rates began coming down. I thought this was an indication \nthat people did not need as much nutrition assistance from these \nFederal programs as they did in the past. We hadn't changed in the last \nfew years any of the eligibility or participation in the program. We \ndid so back in the welfare reform days, and we all remember that \nprocess. There was a big push to do away with the Food Stamp Program. \nSome in the Senate pushed very hard to turn the program over to the \nStates. Others resisted it. As it came out, it was preserved as a \nFederal program. It would be administered by the States, as in the \npast. By and large, it continued to exist without too many changes.\n  The Senator is suggesting that because there continue to be dropoffs, \nreductions in the participation, something is wrong and we need to find \nout what it is. If there is something wrong, we need to be aware of it. \nI agree with the Senator. If the program is being administered in a way \nthat denies those who are eligible under the law for benefits, we need \nto know about it. We need to try to make sure that those who need \nassistance and who are eligible for assistance get the assistance to \nwhich they are entitled and that there are funds here that will make \nthose program benefits available to every eligible person in our \ncountry. That is our goal. That is my goal. That is my attitude. That \nis my view about this subject.\n  I support the Senator's effort to have a study, and I will work in \nconference to see that funds are made available to do that study. I \nknow the Food and Nutrition Service has been working on that issue. He \nis suggesting, as I understand the amendment, the Economic Research \nService use some of the funds available to it to conduct a study, as \nwell.\n  I am prepared to take the matter to conference and to do as well as \nwe can in conference with the House on this issue and the language the \nSenator has. I am told by my staff there are some suggested \nimprovements--and I hope the Senator will agree they are improvements \nin the language of the amendment--that will strengthen the amendment in \nconference, and, if so, that the Senator will understand and be \nsupportive of our efforts to see that the study achieves the goals the \nSenator intends.\n  One aside: When the Senator made the point about amendments adopted \nhere that are not accepted in conference, and it makes him furious, I \nwas reminded of a story.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Before my colleague goes further, I was referring to \nthis specific topic.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I see.\n  I am reminded of a story my colleague from Mississippi, with whom I \nserved in the body for 10 years before he retired--Senator John \nStennis--told about a conference; I have forgotten which committee, but \nit was appropriations. He was chairman of the full Committee on \nAppropriations at the time he retired from the Senate.\n  An amendment had been adopted in the Senate, and it was dropped in \nconference. The Senator who was managing the conference was explaining \nthe provisions of the bill and what had been agreed to by the House and \nwhat had been rejected by the House. The author of an amendment got up \nand asked: Why wasn't my amendment accepted by the House? The manager \nsaid: We discussed it fully, and there was a lot of discussion, but it \nwas not accepted by the House. He said: I want to know why; what did \nthey say? The manager said: They didn't say.\n  It is an indication that sometimes the House rejects an amendment. \nThey don't feel obliged to tell you why they rejected it. They just \nsay: We are not going to accept it. I have seen that happen. I have \nseen the chairman of the full committee on the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee have to personally go to a conference and almost beg the \nconferees on the part of the House to accommodate an interest in his \nState that he thought deserved the support of the conference.\n  It was almost a humiliating experience. I will never forget it. But \nit was an illustration of the fact that the other body takes their \nprerogatives very seriously, particularly on appropriations. I am \nreminded every year how difficult it is to get our way in conference in \nnegotiations with the House. It is a tough challenge. Ultimately it \ngets the work out, but in the process there are Senate provisions that \nare dropped in conference, that are not agreed to by the House, in \nspite of the very best efforts that are made by the Senate to have \ntheir way in those negotiations.\n  All I can say in respect to the Senator's insistence that this \namendment be kept in conference is, we will do our best.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support Senator Wellstone's \namendment. We need to do all we can to understand why food stamp \nparticipation has declined so sharply. We know that poverty among \nworking families is growing, not declining, even in this time of \nprosperity, and we need to find better answers to this problem.\n  The Conference Board is a global business membership organization \nthat has enabled senior executives to exchange ideas on business policy \nand practices for nearly a century. The most recent Conference Board \nstudy is entitled ``Does a Rising Tide Lift All Boats? America's Full-\nTime Working Poor Reap Limited Gains in the New Economy.'' The \nconclusions of this pro-business group are surprising. The Conference \nBoard found that the number of full-time workers classified as poor \nincreased between 1997 and 1998, the last year for which data is \navailable. And despite the strongest economic growth in three decades, \nthe poverty rate among full-time workers is higher now than it was \nduring the last recession.\n  The Congressional General Accounting Office also studied this issue \nof declining food stamp participation, and it found that food stamp \nparticipation is declining much more rapidly than poverty.\n  The obvious result is that millions more Americans, including \nchildren and working families, are going without adequate nutrition \ntoday than before the welfare reform law was enacted.\n  In Massachusetts, Project Bread operates a statewide hunger hotline, \nwhere operators respond to 2,300 requests for referrals each month. \nLast month, a mother from Worcester called. She had just been released \nfrom the hospital after the birth of her fifth baby. Doctors had \nordered her to stop working 3 months ago, due to complications with her \npregnancy. Her husband drives a bus, and their single salary was barely \nenough for the family to get by. When she called the hotline, there was \nno money and no food in the house, and hotline workers characterized \nher situation as desperate.\n  In many other communities, the nation's mayors have been distressed \nby the sudden sharp increases in requests for emergency food from \nworking families. Too many of those in need are being turned away, \nbecause the resources are so inadequate. We clearly need a better \nunderstanding of why this alarming level of hunger persists in our \nrecord-breaking economy.\n  We need this additional information as soon as possible. We must \naccurately determine why food stamp participation has declined. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues to deal more effectively with \nthis tragic problem of hunger.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3919, As Modified\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, I ask unanimous consent I \nmay send a technical correction to the desk. A sentence was written on \nthe wrong line. I ask unanimous consent I modify the amendment. This is \ntechnical.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S7337]]\n\n\n       On page 9, line 7, strike ``$1,000,000'' and insert \n     $1,500,000''.\n       On line 10 after ``tions'' insert: ``Provided further, That \n     not more than $500,000 of the amount transferred under the \n     preceding proviso shall be available to conduct, not later \n     than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, a \n     study, based on all available administrative data and onsite \n     inspections conducted by the Secretary of Agriculture of \n     local food stamp offices in each State, of (1) any problems \n     that households with eligible children have experienced in \n     obtaining food stamps, and (2) reasons for the decline in \n     participation in the food stamp program, and to report the \n     results of the study to the Committee on Agriculture of the \n     House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, \n     Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate''.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Mississippi \nthat I accept what he said in very good faith about the conference \ncommittee, and if he can, in his wisdom and experience, strengthen this \namendment, I am all for that. When he tells me he will do everything he \ncan to advocate for this amendment, I accept his word. There is no \nquestion about it.\n  The second point I wish to make is just to clarify, or make the \nRecord clear, that my indignation is not so much that ``my'' amendment \nwas taken out in conference committee. I don't really care about it \nbeing my amendment. What bothers me, what troubles me, I say to Senator \nCochran, is that--and I cited about seven or eight different studies, \ngood studies done by good people--we do have before us a very important \nchallenge.\n  We have seen this dramatic decline. We know how important this \nprogram can be. We are getting reports that there are a lot of families \neligible who are not participating. We are getting the reports from all \nthe religious communities that the use of the food shelves are going \nup. We are getting reports from teachers in schools telling us kids are \ncoming to school malnourished.\n  So I am saying I find it a little hard to understand how in \nconference last year certain folks, whoever they were, just took this \nout. They were not interested in knowing. I think we ought to care \nabout this. I insist we do. I know the Senator from Mississippi does.\n  I think we will get a strong vote in the Senate and that will be \ngood. The Senate will be strongly on record and I hope we can carry \nthis in conference. I thank the Senator for his support. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Is the status of \nthe Record appropriate for the calling of another amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is appropriate.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3958\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3958 on behalf of \nSenator Kohl, Senator Santorum, Senator Moynihan, Senator Kerry of \nMassachusetts, Senator Biden, Senator Hutchison of Texas, Senator \nLautenberg, Senator Schumer, Senator Warner, and myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows.\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter], for himself, \n     Mr. Kohl, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Biden, \n     Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Warner, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3958.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To correct an unintended termination of the authority of \nAmtrak to lease motor vehicles from the General Services Administration \n           that results from previously enacted legislation)\n\n       At the end of chapter 6 of title II of division B, add the \n     following:\n       Sec. 2607. Amtrak is authorized to obtain services from the \n     Administrator of General Services, and the Administrator is \n     authorized to provide services to Amtrak, under sections \n     201(b) and 211(b) of the Federal Property and Administrative \n     Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 481(b) and 491(b)) for fiscal \n     year 2001 and each fiscal year thereafter until the fiscal \n     year that Amtrak operates without Federal operating grant \n     funds appropriated for its benefit, as required by sections \n     24101(d) and 24104(a) of title 49, United States Code.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this amendment would restore Amtrak's \neligibility to continue leasing vehicles from the General Services \nAdministration's Interagency Fleet Management System.\n  The Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997 inadvertently \nremoved this eligibility. By way of further explanation, in the Amtrak \nReform and Accountability Act of 1997, Amtrak was removed from the list \nof ``mixed ownership and government corporations.''\n  An inadvertent and unintended consequence of this change was brought \nto Amtrak's attention earlier this spring. The Federal Railroad \nAdministration questioned Amtrak's eligibility to continue leasing \nautomobiles from the General Services Administration's Interagency \nFleet Management System. The Federal Railroad Administration and \nGeneral Services Administration agreed that Amtrak was no longer \neligible.\n  As a result of this inadvertent change, there is a fleet of some \n1,650 vehicles for which Amtrak currently pays $10 million to lease \nthrough the General Services Administration. If Amtrak is forced to \nlease its vehicles privately, it will cost a total of $25 million \nannually.\n  The Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act was intended to allow Amtrak \nto transition to operating self-sufficiency.\n  This legislation was not intended to put new financial burdens on the \ncorporation, which is in a transition to operating self-sufficiency. \nThis problem was called to my attention yesterday by Governor Tommy \nThompson, who is Chairman of the Amtrak Board of Directors. The \noperation for Amtrak has been in high gear to operate like a business \nin its goal to achieve operational self-sufficiency by fiscal year \n2003. The strategy that Governor Thompson and others have articulated, \nas provided to me, involves, one, developing high-speed rail corridors; \ntwo, building a market-based rail network; three, forging partnerships \nwith State and local authorities and large commercial clients; and \nfour, offering a new service guarantee, which is unparalleled in the \ntransportation industry.\n\n[[Page S7338]]\n\n  These strategies are already producing very considerable results. \nAmtrak's annual revenues reached a record of $1.84 billion in fiscal \nyear 1999. Just over 21 million passengers traveled on Amtrak last \nyear, for a third consecutive year of ridership growth. Overall \nridership in the last 5 months is up 8 percent over the same period of \nlast year. Ridership on the high-speed regional service corridor is up \nnearly 40 percent over the trains that were replaced.\n  Further information provided to me is that the development of more \ncommercial partnerships has boosted mail and express revenue by 35 \npercent in this calendar year. Amtrak's net worth growth strategy, \nintroduced in February, will expand passenger rail service to 21 \nStates, based on a comprehensive economic analysis of the national rail \nsystem and potential market opportunities. The national growth strategy \nis expected to add as much as $229 million of revenue by the year 2003. \nNew partnerships have been forged with Motorola, Dobbs, and Hertz \nCorporation, among others. Amtrak's new web site for ticketing has been \nnamed one of the 100 most popular bookmark sites on the Internet. For \nfiscal year 2000, sales are up 113 percent over the same period last \nyear.\n  Since Amtrak's announcement of its service guarantee, it has recorded \na satisfactory rate of 99.97 percent. These results point to the \nsuccessful turnabout Amtrak is making in its efforts to achieve \noperational self-sufficiency. A goal has been set for Amtrak, and \nAmtrak is taking the proper steps to achieve that self-sufficiency. My \nsuggestion to the Senate is that we not undermine the corporation by \nforcing it to swallow some $15 million in unintended costs, while \nlosing its GSA eligibility for the remainder of the glidepath.\n  The General Services Administration, Federal Railroad Administration, \nand Amtrak agreed that the legislation referred to contained an \nunintended consequence and should be rectified. Amtrak must return all \n1,650 vehicles by October 1 of this year, under the existing law. This \nprovision puts an undue and unwarranted burden upon the General \nServices Administration, which does not want many of these specialized \nvehicles back in their inventory because they have nobody else who \nwould lease them, so it would be a loss to GSA, as well.\n  This amendment would restore Amtrak's eligibility to continue leasing \nvehicles from the General Services Administration's Interagency \nManagement Fleet. I am advised by staff, who have consulted with the \nstaff of the General Services Administration, that both GSA and the \nFederal Railroad Administration, as well as Amtrak, support this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, it would be preferable, candidly, not to put this \namendment on the Agriculture appropriations bill. I have consulted with \nthe Parliamentarian, and there is a defense of germaneness, which is an \nanswer to a challenge on grounds that this is legislation on an \nappropriations bill. The provisions of H.R. 4461 that we are currently \nconsidering, on page 5, line 9, provides the following under \n``Payments, Including Transfers of Funds'':\n\n       For payment of space rental and related costs pursuant to \n     Public law 92-313, including authorities pursuant to the \n     1984 delegation of authority from the Administrator of the \n     General Services to the Department of Agriculture under 40 \n     U.S.C. 486, for programs and activities of the Department \n     which are included in this Act, and for the operation, \n     maintenance, improvement, and repair of Agriculture \n     buildings, $150,343,000, to remain available until \n     expended.\n\n  As I say, I am advised by the Parliamentarian that this language is \nsufficient to establish germaneness, and germaneness is a defense for \nchallenging this amendment as legislation on an appropriations bill.\n  There is an obvious concern raised here about whether Amtrak should \nbe able to have the benefit of this leasing arrangement because Amtrak \nis supposed to be self-sufficient, some might say. The reality is that \nAmtrak is under a transition period to attain self-sufficiency. We are \nlooking at an additional 2-year window here. I suggest that the savings \nof $15 million to Amtrak really would not be at the expense of the \nFederal Government. These are savings which, if the leasing were not \npossible, and the GSA has nobody to lease it to, is actually a net gain \nfor the Federal Government. While Amtrak would have to pay $25 million \nannually instead of $10 million to GSA, if GSA doesn't have anybody to \nlease these vehicles to, which is what has been represented to me, it \nends up that the Federal Government loses $10 million, which it would \nget from these leases. So it is a win-win situation for the Federal \nGovernment to have the $10 million in lease payments, and it saves \nAmtrak some $15 million.\n  What we really need to do is, obviously, put Amtrak back on its feet. \nIn the course of just a few minutes today, I was able to find 10 \ncosponsors of this legislation. If we had more time to survey the \nSenate, I think we would find many more Senators. I don't think this is \nnecessary as a disclosure of interest, but I have an interest in \nAmtrak, besides being a Senator, in wanting Amtrak to succeed. I ride \nAmtrak every day. It is really an enviable position to be in, whereas \nsome of my colleagues have to fight airplane schedules. Some of us can \nride the metroliner, which leaves on the hour. I can tell you that the \nmetroliner is good service, and the other service is excellent as well. \nThose trains are filled and they are money-makers. The new Acela train \nis about to be established, which will get from Washington to \nPhiladelphia even faster.\n  Amtrak has come out with a new guarantee and it is moving ahead. \nThere is no reason, it seems to me, to let this technicality stand, \nwhich would cost Amtrak $15 million and probably cost GSA $10 million \nif, as expected, it is unable to lease out all of these vehicles, which \nwould be returned on October 1 of this year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in objection to the amendment. \nBismarck said there are two things you never want to see made, and that \nis laws and sausages. This really is another one of these wonderful \nsausages.\n  If a government student from a college or high school or university \nfrom around the country came here and was sitting in the galleries \nobserving this, and someone told them we are now addressing the \nagricultural appropriations bill, one would then assume that it has to \ndo with agriculture and farmers, the agricultural section of this \ncountry, and that it would probably have some very worthy aspects of \nit.\n  Then this student observes the Senator from Pennsylvania stand up and \nsay: We are going to get the GSA to lease automobiles for Amtrak. \nExcuse me? That is a railroad.\n  For the benefit of those students who observe these things, I would \nlike to tell you how we got here.\n  Amtrak first came to my committee--which happens to be, although it \nis routinely ignored lately, the authorizing committee particularly as \nwe go through the appropriations process. They came to the Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation Committee and said: We would like to have \nthis done--although interestingly stated by the Senator from \nPennsylvania--because basically they do not want to have to pay to \nlease automobiles to have their operations go forward. They wanted us \nto put it in as part of the National Transportation Safety Board \nreauthorization.\n  After examining their proposal, and knowing that the whole object of \nthe reform of Amtrak was to make them independent of the Federal \nGovernment, and now they want to take advantage of a situation that \nonly governmental organizations can take care of --that is, General \nServices Administration leasing--we said no.\n  They have some pretty highly paid lobbyists around town. They are \npretty influential. They went to the government oversight committee, to \nSenator Thompson, and to his staff. They tried to float it by them \nbecause Senator Thompson's Committee on Governmental Affairs has \noversight of the General Services Administration.\n  Senator Thompson, his staff, and his committee rejected it out of \nhand--again because a nongovernment organization should not have access \nto the facilities and capabilities that a governmental organization \ndoes. That was rejected.\n  The Amtrak lobbyists were flailing around town. Senator Thompson \nhonored me with a phone call. He said: How do you explain the fact that \nthe\n\n[[Page S7339]]\n\nwhole effort of the Amtrak Reform Accountability Act, Public Law 104-\n34, was intended to make Amtrak independent of the Federal Government--\nwhich, by the way, is not too important, to revisit history.\n  In 1971, Amtrak was formed for only 2 years, I say to my colleagues, \nand then to be completely independent. Of course, after being at the \nGovernment trough since 1971, we finally decided that they had just \nabout enough when we enacted the Amtrak Reform Accountability Act.\n  They finally found a willing servant and messenger in the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania, and I congratulate him. So here we are with an \namendment on the Agriculture appropriations bill that has to do with \nAmtrak, which, as the Senator from Pennsylvania alluded to, he rides \nregularly. I am sure he is an avid supporter of it. But this is $15 \nmillion. Actually, they came to us the first time and said it was a $4 \nmillion deal. It has increased somehow magically in the last 6 weeks or \nso to $15 million. I guess that dramatized the gravity of their \nsituation.\n  I say to my government student who is observing this, I can tell you \nthat the way we ended up with this particular sausage is that the \nAmtrak lobbyists with all of their influence could not get what they \nwanted through the committee of oversight. They couldn't get what we \nwanted through another committee of oversight; staff and those who had \njurisdiction rejected this idiotic proposal out of hand. So now we have \nan amendment on the Agriculture appropriations bill.\n  The supporters of this amendment allege its purpose is to correct an \nunintended--in the words of the Senator from Pennsylvania, unintended \nand unintentional--consequence of legislation enacted in 1997, the \nAmtrak Reform Accountability Act. Not so. Not so. The whole purpose of \nthe Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997, of which I was a \npart, was to divorce Amtrak from the Federal Government and the largess \nand the perks and other good deals that can be had being a part of the \nFederal Government.\n  Have no doubt, my friends, coming from a Senator who was intimately \ninvolved in the act, there was no unintended consequence. There was no \ninadvertency associated with it. This is simply an attempt on the part \nof Amtrak to save themselves $4 million, or $15 million, whatever it \nis.\n  One of the main purposes of the act is to direct Amtrak to run more \nas a real for-profit business. There are other organizations, such as \nFannie Mae, that are in exactly the same status as Amtrak. Fannie Mae \ndoesn't get GSA leasing of their cars. Freddie Mac doesn't get GSA \nleasing of their cars. But we are going to do it for Amtrak.\n  I guarantee you, my friends, we are going to have a hearing in \nSeptember, I say to my colleagues, on this great reform, and all of \nthis success which the Senator from Pennsylvania just trumpeted, you \nare going to find out it is not true. As far as I know, Amtrak is going \nto be feeding from the public trough for as long as any Member of this \nbody is alive.\n  We just had a Member of the advisory committee resign in disgust and \nanger over what has transpired since this act was passed in 1997.\n  I don't expect to win. I don't expect to win this amendment. But I am \ngoing to make the American people aware of this bizarre situation where \nwe have a railroad formed in 1971, and the commitment at that time was \nthat railroad would be Government supported for 2 years. Count them: \nOne, two. Since 1971, in the intervening 29 years, the billions and \nbillions and billions of taxpayer dollars that have been expended on \nAmtrak stagger the imagination. Someday, somebody will write a very \ninteresting treatise. In fact, several have already been written.\n  In regard to the arguments of ``unintended consequences,'' let me \nassure my colleagues we have experienced a slew of unintended \nconsequences since the reform law was enacted--a slew of unintended \nconsequences. Let me mention a couple.\n  When we all agreed to remove the former board of directors so Amtrak \nwould have a clean slate with new leadership and fresh ideas, we never \nthought the board members serving at the time of enactment would then \nbe appointed to the new reform board. But that is what happened.\n  When we called for the creation of an 11-member Amtrak reform council \nand were specific about membership criteria and eligibility, we never \nexpected the one representative of the rail industry to be a sitting \nmayor not affiliated with the industry at all. But that is what \noccurred, my friends--laws and sausages.\n  When we authorized substantial capital and operating funds for the \nduration of the 5-year bill, we never expected the administration to \nrequest only about half of the authorized funding. But that is what \noccurred, despite the nonstop rhetoric about the administration's \nsupport for Amtrak.\n  When we were all convinced that Amtrak would utilize the $2.2 billion \n``tax refund''--one of the more interesting sausages that were \nfashioned here in the Senate; there was a $2.2 billion tax refund on \ntaxes that was never paid, one of the more interesting ones I have seen \nhere--we were all convinced that Amtrak would utilize the $2.2 billion \n``tax refund'' released by enactment of the reform legislation for high \nreturn capital investments--the commitment of the $2.2 billion for high \nreturn capital investments. We didn't expect Amtrak to use that money \nto pay for gym membership, movie tickets, and for some of its labor \nforce. But that is what occurred.\n  I can understand Amtrak's desire to undo parts of the 1997 law it no \nlonger likes. I am certain a number of Members would like to change \ncertain things about the law here and there, particularly as we are \ngetting closer to the operational self-sufficiency deadline in 2 years.\n  By the way, there is no outside expert who believes we will reach \nthat operational self-sufficiency deadline, which we will carefully \nexamine as the committee of oversight, as the committee that is \nresponsible for the authorizing--not the Agriculture Appropriations \nSubcommittee. We will examine it. But I believe an agreement is an \nagreement. And this bill was adopted unanimously.\n\n  I think Amtrak should be relieved we are not instead requiring it to \nrepay the Treasury for the money it saved by participating illegally in \nthe program for nearly 3 years. Amtrak has been participating in this \nprogram, as judged by outside observers, illegally. It should have been \nhalted.\n  It is true not all Members share the same perspective concerning the \nobligation imposed upon the American taxpayers to fund Amtrak for its \n29 years of subsidization, even though Amtrak was to have been free of \nall Federal assistance 2 years after it was established in 1971. \nHowever, we did work together and support enactment of reform \nlegislation with the intent to give Amtrak the tools it said it needed \nto become operationally self-sufficient.\n  I have not acted to alter the agreement reached as part of the reform \nlegislation, and I find it a breech of that agreement that Amtrak and \nothers are routinely seeking changes through the appropriations process \nto allow it to do things not approved by the authorizing committee of \njurisdiction. Be assured, I say to my colleagues now, we have a little \ndust up here. But when Amtrak tries to obtain a $10 billion funding \nscheme, there is going to be a big fight about that one, my friends. I \nknow it is coming. It hasn't fulfilled the first and quite substantial \nstatutory obligation to operate free of taxpayer expense.\n  Amtrak asked for legislation that allowed it to operate more as a \nprivate business, and we enacted such legislation. As other former \nGovernment-controlled agencies have moved toward privatization, they \ndidn't enjoy the freedom to pick and choose what governmental support \nprograms they could use to their advantage. When Congress set up other \ncorporations such as Freddie Mac, COMSAT, and Fannie Mae, they did not \nand do not participate in GSA leasing. The fact is, nongovernmental \nentities do not participate in the GSA vehicle leasing program. Amtrak \ncan't have it both ways, although they probably will.\n  Finally, I find it very strange that since this issue was brought to \nmy attention in March, Amtrak has said the GSA leasing eligibility \nsaves $4 million annually--probably a lot of money to a company that \nlost more than $900 million last year; $900 million was all they lost \nlast year. Yet now that an amendment is being offered on the floor, \nAmtrak has raised the bar and this week\n\n[[Page S7340]]\n\nAmtrak is telling me the provision would save some $15 million \nannually. Which of Amtrak's numbers should we believe? At a minimum, \nthe authorizing committee should have an opportunity to explore this \nnew figure before we are asked to adopt any changes in existing law.\n  As I said, we will be having a hearing on Amtrak, as is our \nresponsibility as the authorizing committee, in early September to \ncarefully explore this and many other critical issues. Until this issue \nhas been looked at by the committee of jurisdiction, I urge my \ncolleagues to defeat the amendment.\n  We find ourselves, a week before leaving, with an amendment that was \nfirst sought to be addressed by the committee of authorization, the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. We refused to do so \nbecause it was clearly not in keeping with the law. Then they went to \nanother committee of authorization. They wouldn't do it. So now what \ndoes the Senator from Pennsylvania do? Something to do with Amtrak, a \ntrain, is on the Agriculture appropriations bill.\n  Another example of laws and sausages. To all those students of \ngovernment who may be watching and observing this bizarre process, my \nfriends, it is an argument for reform of the way we do business in this \nbody. The authorizing committees are becoming more and more irrelevant \nas each legislative day goes by. I am close to the point where we \neither do away with the Appropriations Committee or we do away with the \nauthorizing committees. To come on this floor and have a clear \nlegislative change, even though it may not meet the exact parameters of \ngermaneness in rule XVI, and make a clear elective change on a bill \nthat has nothing to do, first of all as an appropriations bill, and \nsecond of all has no relation to Amtrak, I find offensive.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to support the Specter \namendment. I hope it will prevail for reasons that I don't think have \nbeen discussed thus far.\n  One thing that we are not talking about is whether or not, since \nlegislation was passed some time ago that might be more restrictive to \nAmtrak, the conditions have changed. One need not be a transportation \nengineer to know you can't get off the ground at airports. I waited the \nother day 5 hours for a flight to go to New Jersey from here. We were \non the ground 5 hours.\n  There are almost no airports of any size that aren't constantly late. \nThere aren't places that one can travel by car or by bus that you can \nget where you want to be in a reliable period of time. We saw the front \npage news on the Washington Post 2 days ago about the disappearance of \nmountaintops, surrounded by smog, because the country is being \noverwhelmed by transportation and environmental problems. Conditions \nhave changed.\n  When we want to make comparisons between Amtrak and private \nbusinesses, we have to recognize there is no place in this world, no \nplace, where there isn't a subsidy provided for rail service so people \ncan travel from place to place--such as the subsidy we offer when we \nbuild airports and we provide and charge the passengers a tax to ride \nin an airplane. We have a passenger facility charge. Or that if one \nwants to buy gas at a gas station, we have a Federal tax; we have State \ntaxes. Amtrak doesn't have that ability. Amtrak is the poor stepchild. \nIt offers a service to lots and lots of people who can't find any \nalternative that is satisfactory or available to them.\n  I don't like spending money. I happen to come from a strong business \nbackground. I know the difference between business and government. \nAmtrak is not a business like other businesses. It requires help. What \nwe said in the commitment that was made for Amtrak was that we would \nnot require that they meet operating needs out of the fare box. That is \nwhat we said would happen. Capital costs--and those are the things we \nare talking about--are part of the operating budget. We are forced at \ntimes to use operating funds for capital costs. The thing is all \nbackwards. We are similiar to a Third World country in a process that \nhas us asking passenger railroads to do things that no other country \ndoes.\n  Germany has advanced their transportation systems, investing $10 \nbillion a year in developing rapid rail transportation. In France, you \ncan travel from Brussels to Paris in an hour and 25 minutes; the \ndistance is 200 miles. That is what we ought to be talking about.\n  Take the pressure out of the skies. There is no more room for \nairplanes in the skies. There is no latitude. We can build more \nairplanes but you still won't be able to fly the planes. We have broken \nthe rules. We expanded the number of slots at Reagan National because \nof requests from some of the people here, Senators who wanted to have \nparticular access. Break the rules. Give us access. What do we care \nabout the rules, about the number of flights that can come in and go, \nfrom whatever distances. Break the rules.\n  We are not talking about breaking the rules. We are talking about \nextending an opportunity for many in the American public to be able to \ntravel and get to their destinations on time with a degree of comfort \nthat permits them to arrive at their destination and be able to conduct \ntheir business or see their families or get to school or whatever else \nthey have to do.\n  It is a fairly simple equation. I hope we will support the Specter \namendment.\n  I think what it does do is it says to people who need passageway, who \nneed an opportunity to get from place to place that is not otherwise \nordinarily available, and that is to permit these leases to be \nsupported by GSA. To save Amtrak? No, not to save Amtrak; to save the \npassengers, to save the rail riders $15 million a year. That is what we \nare talking about saving.\n  Amtrak is not the issue. The issue is whether or not we can transport \nthe people who inhabit this country in a way that is reasonable without \ncontinuing to foul the air or delay them interminably.\n  I hope we can conclude this vote and get the issue resolved. I do not \nlike disagreeing with the chairman of the Commerce Committee. They have \njurisdiction. But in this case I happen to think the perspective is \nwrong; that there is not recognition of what our country's needs are. \nThey have changed so radically in the past few years. Look at airline \npassenger traffic. See how much it has grown. See how much more the \nhighways are used now than only a few short years ago. The situation \nhas changed. Are we going to continue to take an attitude that it \ndoesn't matter what we are doing to the environment; it doesn't matter \nhow late the airplanes are; it doesn't matter how costly rides are; \nregardless of that, we are not going to permit it to happen?\n  I hope we will extend this extra opportunity for Amtrak and for its \npassengers to continue to operate and get us to the point, when we get \nhigh-speed rail in there, we can meet our operating costs and we can \nprovide the kinds of service one would expect in a country such as \nours.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the amendment \nwhich I am cosponsoring with my colleague from Pennsylvania. As you \nknow, this amendment will allow Amtrak to continue leasing vehicles \nfrom GSA through 2003. We are all eager to see Amtrak continue \nprogressing toward self-sufficiency. Without this amendment, we will be \njeopardizing their ability to achieve that goal.\n  In my own State, half a million people from Wisconsin ride Amtrak \nevery year. It is very important not only to Wisconsin but to every \nState that Amtrak continue its progress toward viability. We must \ncontinue to allow Amtrak to transition to self-sufficiency by 2003.\n  This amendment is very crucial to that effort. I urge my colleagues \nto support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I welcome an opportunity to present these \nissues to students. Anyone in the balcony observing this debate, \nstudents, and as the Senator from Arizona alludes to students, perhaps \na more elite audience, wanting to know the theory, the philosophy, the \napproach, the ethics of the proposition, I welcome addressing students \non this subject as I\n\n[[Page S7341]]\n\nspend a good bit of my time addressing high schools, colleges, junior \nhigh schools, and even grade schools taking the message to the students \nabout what government ought to be doing.\n  It is a fairly common reference--not too humorous anymore--to \nanalogize making sausage to the making of legislation. But the making \nof legislation is a very complicated matter. It has to take into \naccount the accommodation of 260 million Americans and many contrary \nissues and many contrary differences.\n  When the argument is raised about this is a matter turned down by the \nauthorizing committee, the Commerce Committee, and turned down by the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee--they are not the last word. The \nchairman of the Commerce Committee does not have the last word. He may \nhave it as the Commerce Committee is organized, directed, and run. And \nthe chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee may have the last \nword as to how that committee is run. But the Senate has the last word.\n  There are 100 of us and each Senator has rights under the rules of \nthe Senate. When this Senator offers an amendment, this Senator is \noffering an amendment within his rights. Even if the full Commerce \nCommittee backs the chairman, or even if the full Governmental Affairs \nCommittee backs the chairman, those committees are not the last word. \nThe last word is the Senate, the 100 Members who constitute the Senate.\n  In offering this amendment, this Senator is functioning within the \nrules. When the Senator from Arizona says that this amendment has \nnothing to do with agriculture and he finds the amendment offensive, I \ntake a little offense at that. I set forth the germaneness, which \nentitles this amendment to be offered on this bill.\n  It is not an unusual occurrence in the Senate to offer legislation on \nan appropriations bill. That rule has been breached so often that it is \nhardly referenced anymore. We are trying to come back to a standard of \nnot legislating on an appropriations bill, but the rules of the Senate \ngovern that, and I cited the provisions of the bill we are considering \nfrom the House of Representatives which makes this germane.\n  That is the advice I received from the Parliamentarian. That is not \nmy own peculiar, personal opinion. If someone wants to challenge the \namendment, there are ways to do so if someone says this violates the \nrules. But I do not think it does, and the Parliamentarian does not \nthink it does.\n  When there are references to illegal activities by Amtrak, if there \nare illegal activities, let's refer it to the Department of Justice. \nSome might say a reference to the Department of Justice doesn't do much \ngood in the United States of America today, and I would not want to \nargue that point too vociferously, but let's give them a chance. Has it \nbeen referred to the Department of Justice?\n\n  I attended a hearing of the Appropriations Subcommittee on \nTransportation where Governor Thompson appeared last year. But we met \nyesterday on another matter. He called this issue to my attention.\n  This is not exactly my purview, to take up this issue. It doesn't \ncome within any of my committee responsibilities. But no high-priced \nlobbyist came to me to talk about this issue, a high-priced lobbyist \nwho might be fundraising for me. Nobody came to talk to me about it. In \nfact, not even a low-priced lobbyist came to me to talk about it. But \nGovernor Thompson, a very distinguished American and very distinguished \npublic servant, did. I told him I was concerned about it. Before the \nafternoon, I had a flood of telephone calls from Amtrak, asking me to \nlook into it, to check it out.\n  This morning I called Senator Kohl who had been working on the \nmatter. Then I started to canvas a few Senators and got 10 cosponsors \nvery promptly. Senator Jeffords--I ask unanimous consent he be added as \na cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. There is a reference here to ``idiotic.'' I take more \nthan umbrage at that, and would cite rule XIX which says:\n\n       No Senator in debate shall, directly or indirectly, by any \n     form of words impute to another Senator or to other Senators \n     any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a Senator.\n\n  I can't represent whether I was called an idiot, or whether I was \nsaid to have offered an idiotic amendment. But either way, offering an \nidiotic amendment is not becoming conduct for a Senator. And I \nconsulted with the Parliamentarian. The rule is that a Senator may \nchallenge another Senator who violates rule XIX by standing and saying: \nI call the Senator to order.\n  I choose not to do that. I don't want to make a Federal case of it. \nBut, also, I choose not to ignore it, and I think it is unbecoming \nconduct for a Senator to offer an idiotic amendment. But I don't think \nthis amendment is idiotic. But I will let the body decide that on a \nvote, either on a challenge on procedural grounds or on a vote on the \nmerits.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, if there has been any offense taken by the \nSenator from Pennsylvania, it was not intended, and I would hope he \nwould accept my apologies if he took offense. I think this amendment is \nwrong.\n  It is inappropriate, and it is dead wrong, and the facts, as I stated \nas to how this amendment got on an Agriculture appropriations bill, are \naccurate. It first went to the Commerce Committee where they tried to \nget us to do it, and we would not because we do not believe it is in \nkeeping with the law.\n  Then they went to the Governmental Affairs Committee and now it has \nended up being put as an amendment on the Agriculture appropriations \nbill. That is wrong. I did not challenge the parliamentary right of the \nSenator from Pennsylvania to do so. We had the same parliamentary \nreading that the Senator from Pennsylvania did.\n  I think this amendment is a violation of the agreement that was made \nin 1997 in the form of the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act, P.L. \n105-134.\n  Again, if the Senator from Pennsylvania took offense at something I \nsaid personally, then he has my apologies. That does not change the \nfact that this amendment is the wrong thing to do. I strongly oppose \nit, and I believe if we continue, as I said in the conclusion of my \nremarks previously, if we continue to authorize and legislate on \nappropriations bills, this practice will continue the breakdown of the \nprocedures that are intended and established by the Senate.\n  I stand by those words, and I again say, even though it may not be in \nviolation of the strict parliamentary rules, it is wrong to put an \namendment concerning Amtrak on Agriculture appropriations bills. I \nbelieve I have that right to believe that is an inappropriate way, and \nthe Commerce Committee or the Governmental Affairs Committee should \nhave reviewed this and did review it and should be allowed the \njurisdiction.\n  Nor did I at any time tell the Senator, or in my remarks to the body, \nthat every Senator does not have their right to a proposed amendment on \nwhatever issue they wish. That is why we have a Parliamentarian. Never \nat any time--certainly not this Senator--would I say that an individual \nSenator should be deprived of his or her rights since I exercise those \nwith some frequency.\n  I hope that clarifies the intent of my remarks which are that this \namendment is not in keeping with the Amtrak Reform and Accountability \nAct, and I do not believe--and as a Senator I have the right to the \nview--that it is not appropriate to be placed on an Agriculture \nappropriations bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I also rise in opposition to this \namendment and join my colleague from Arizona in his opposition. We just \nheld a number of hearings in the Housing and Transportation \nSubcommittee of the Banking Committee. I chair this subcommittee. We \nfound that we even have the Federal Transit Administration subsidizing \nAmtrak. Clearly, in my mind, when I look at the 1997 accountability \nact, Congress intended to move Amtrak to self-sufficiency.\n  Amtrak claims to be a private corporation, and, plainly and simply, \nprivate corporations are not eligible to lease Government vehicles.\n  I have grown increasingly skeptical about what is going on with \nAmtrak. It\n\n[[Page S7342]]\n\nseems they found a way of picking up Government subsidies all over the \nplace.\n  Several years ago, the FTA required--I want to get back to some other \nissues that may either be directly or indirectly related to this \namendment, but several years ago, The Federal Transit Authority \nrequired the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority to bid out \ncontracts for their commuter rail services. Four companies bid. Amtrak \nhad the highest cost bid and lowest quality.\n  This will cost taxpayers $75 million above the low bid. This is a $75 \nmillion, 3-year subsidy on top of the nearly $600 million annual \nsubsidy Congress grants Amtrak. Now they want the subsidy of leasing \nGovernment vehicles. I ask my colleagues: When are we really going to \nrequire Amtrak to be self-sufficient?\n  For that reason, I oppose this amendment with my colleague from \nArizona and urge a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, by way of brief response to the argument \nby the Senator from Colorado, I agree with him that Amtrak needs to be \nself-sufficient, and that is the purpose of the legislation. The \nquestion is, How fast is that going to occur? They are looking for \nself-sufficiency under the existing legislation by the year 2003. What \nthey are asking for here is an extension from October 1, 2000, to \nOctober 1, 2002. I went into some detail on the information provided by \nGovernor Thompson, who is chairman of the Board of Amtrak, as to the \nprogress which they are making.\n  When the Senator from Arizona says there is no mistake here, he may \nbe right about that. Maybe this is not an unintended consequence, but \nwhere you have a provision which reaches the extent of leasing under \nthese circumstances, I doubt that anybody thought about that when the \nlegislation was drafted. Maybe it is not an unintended consequence, but \nI doubt very much that it is an intended consequence. It is something \nthat happened that nobody had thought about. Perhaps if nobody had \nthought about it, it is genuinely an unintended consequence.\n  Considering the issues we face in this body, when you are talking \nabout $15 million, although not unsubstantial, we seldom take a \nprotracted period of time as we wrestle with the budget of $1.850 \ntrillion. I have not calculated the percent, but it is a mighty tiny \nfraction. This is symbolic as to what we are trying to do to get Amtrak \non its feet.\n  When the Senator from Arizona says it is wrong to put this amendment \non this bill, I have to categorically disagree with that as a matter of \nfact because if the rules allow this amendment to go on this bill, it \nis not wrong to put this amendment on this bill. It may be an unwise \namendment, it may be against public policy, but it is not a wrongful \nact to put this amendment on this bill when the advice that the Senator \nfrom Arizona got was the same as the advice this Senator got: that as a \nmatter of parliamentary procedure, it is an appropriate matter.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Crop Loss Assistance.--(a) In General.--The \n     Secretary of Agriculture shall use such sums as are necessary \n     of funds of the Commodity Credit Corporation (not to exceed \n     $900,000,000) to make emergency financial assistance \n     available to producers on a farm that have incurred losses in \n     a 2000 crop due to a disaster, as determined by the \n     Secretary.\n       (b) Administration.--The Secretary shall make assistance \n     available under this section in the same manner as provided \n     under section 1102 of the Agriculture, Rural Development, \n     Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies \n     Appropriations Act, 1999 (7 U.S.C. 1421 note; Public Law 105-\n     277), including using the same loss thresholds as were used \n     in administering that section.\n       (c) Qualifying Losses.--Assistance under this section may \n     be made available for losses due to damaging weather or \n     related condition (including losses due to scab, sclerotinia, \n     aflotoxin, and other crop diseases) associated with crops \n     that are, as determined by the Secretary--\n       (1) quantity losses (including quantity losses as a result \n     of quality losses);\n       (2) quality losses; or\n       (3) severe economic losses.\n       (d) Crops Covered.--Assistance under this section shall be \n     applicable to losses for all crops, as determined by the \n     Secretary, due to disasters.\n       (e) Crop Insurance.--In carrying out this section, the \n     Secretary shall not discriminate against or penalize \n     producers on a farm that have purchased crop insurance under \n     the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.).\n       (f) Livestock Indemnity Payments.--The Secretary may use \n     such sums as are necessary of funds made available under this \n     section to make livestock indemnity payments to producers on \n     a farm that have incurred losses during calendar year 2000 \n     for livestock losses due to a disaster, as determined by the \n     Secretary.\n       (g) Hay Losses.--The Secretary may use such sums as are \n     necessary of funds made available under this section to make \n     payments to producers on a farm that have incurred losses of \n     hay stock during calendar\n\n[[Page S7343]]\n\n     year 2000 due to a disaster, as determined by the Secretary.\n       (h) Emergency Requirement.--\n       (1) In general.--The entire amount necessary to carry out \n     this section shall be available only to the extent that an \n     official budget request for the entire amount, that includes \n     designation of the entire amount of the request as an \n     emergency requirement under the Balanced Budget and Emergency \n     Deficit Control Act of 1985 (2 U.S.C. 900 et seq.), is \n     transmitted by the President to Congress.\n       (2) Designation.--The entire amount necessary to carry out \n     this section is designated by Congress as an emergency \n     requirement pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) of that Act (2 \n     U.S.C. 901(b)(2)(A)).\n       Sec. 1109.

The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am reluctant to say this, but I have \nto sooner or later. How many items are we going to keep adding and \ncalling them ``emergencies''? We have already passed a lot of \nemergencies for agriculture. I believe there are emergencies in this \nbill. I just wonder how many more we can come to the floor with. \nEverybody should know that when you come here and designate it as an \nemergency under the Budget Act resolution, it means it doesn't count \nagainst anything. If we want to, we can be down here the rest of this \nevening adding additional items and saying they are emergencies.\n  I don't know enough about this amendment. It is difficult to \nunderstand, even though it has been read. But we do know one thing: It \ncosts $900 million.\n  Obviously, there are some who do not want anybody interfering with \npeople's ability to come down here and add money. But I frankly think \nwhat we ought to do is test this one out. I don't believe it is the \nright amendment to adopt as an emergency. I think maybe we will discuss \nit. Some will decide what it looks like and understand it. I don't \nknow. But I am going to make a point of order that this amendment \ncontains an emergency designation in violation of section 205 of H. \nCon. Res. 290, the fiscal year 2001 budget resolution.\n  I am perfectly willing to have a debate. We have the statute in front \nof us. If the Senator wants to make a case for the Senate that in fact \nhe has a brand new emergency, it wasn't available to the committee. It \nwasn't available the last two times we had an agriculture \nsupplemental--a number of which were emergencies for which we paid \nbillions of dollars. I can recall a couple that were $7 billion. One \nwas $6 billion. Then there are lesser ones now that are all \nsupplementals for emergencies for agriculture. I have been told there \nis no limit so don't bother. There is no limit to those things that \nwill pass as emergencies in the agricultural area.\n  It is kind of difficult when it is an agricultural issue to get up \nhere and say this because there are some in my State; there are some in \nother States. I am sure when we are through understanding this \namendment, they will try to convince us that everybody should vote for \nit because it affects them. Frankly, even if it does affect them, it \ndoesn't mean we have to determine that it doesn't count. It should \ncount.\n  I have a statute in front of me. I will yield the floor for a moment. \nPerhaps the Senator from Texas would like to read the statute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from New Mexico and \nalso to the Senators from Texas and Arizona that it is my intention, \nhaving offered this amendment, to ask unanimous consent to withdraw the \namendment after I have had a chance to discuss exactly what the Senator \nfrom New Mexico just described--new events that have occurred that have \nbeen quite disastrous in my State and some others that are now \noccurring in a significant region of the country dealing with drought.\n  My point is to say this about this amendment--and some of my \ncolleagues will want to reinforce it. We have an agricultural disaster, \nnot with respect to the collapse of commodity prices but with respect \nto floods and drought that have destroyed a significant number of crops \nin various parts of our country.\n  If I might, with my colleagues' consent, show a picture of a fellow \nstanding in front of about 300 acres of soybeans. As you can see, it is \nof course nothing but water. These soybeans are gone. It is the result \nof a June 12 and June 13 deluge of rain that fell in the Red River \nValley, somewhere in the neighborhood of 16 to 19 inches of rain in a \nperiod of about 36 hours.\n  Let me say that again.\n  In the Red River Valley, on dead flat land, 16 to 19 inches of rain \nfell in some areas in about 36 hours. Then on June 19, in Cass County, \nand in Richland County, and several other areas of the State, in a 6-\nhour period a group of thunderstorms came together and dumped 8 to 9 \ninches of rain in a very short period of time. The result was fields as \nfar as the eye could see that looked exactly like this, with crops \nplanted that are devastated and destroyed. In fact, in the Red River \nValley area, both in the northern and the southern part of the valley, \nabout 1.7 million acres of crops were lost or significantly damaged as \na result of those two devastating events.\n  We also have a significant drought that is occurring right now in the \nsouthern part of our country. As you know, crops are burning up at an \naccelerated pace. We have a disaster occurring for farmers in other \nparts of the country.\n  Let me again say it is my intention to seek consent to withdraw the \namendment. I offered the amendment for the purpose of saying to the \nCongress that, yes, in fact, new events have occurred beginning on June \n12 and 13 in our State when 18 to 19 inches of rain fell in about 36 \nhours, devastating a million and three-quarters acres of crop land. New \nevents are occurring this week, and occurred last week, and I assume in \nthe weeks ahead, with respect to the crops in the southern region of \nthe United States.\n  I think we will have to address this issue. I think somehow we have \nto find a way to provide some assistance to those family farmers whose \ncrops have been destroyed by a natural disaster.\n  Some will say perhaps there was some money provided earlier in the \nyear in an agriculture bill for family farmers. That of course is true, \nand it dealt with the issue of collapsed grain prices. That \nreimbursement had to do with the collapse of market prices for \ncommodities. There is, however, a circumstance in our country today, \ngiven the new laws in recent years, in which we don't have a disaster \nprogram available to try to provide some assistance when these \ndisasters occur.\n  I offered the amendment for the purpose of discussing it, as will my \ncolleague.\n  At this point, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3963) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, on behalf of the managers of the bill, I \nsend a package of amendments to the desk, the agriculture emergency \nassistance package, and ask that they be reported.\n\n[[Page S7344]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran], for himself and \n     Mr. Kohl, on behalf of other Senators, proposes en bloc \n     amendments beginning with No. 3964.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendments be dispensed with.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Is the amendment divisible?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator sent up a group of amendments that \nrequire consent to be considered en bloc.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I object to them being considered en bloc.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3964\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the first amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran], for Mr. Harkin, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3964.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, let me make a point of order and say that \nit is the intention of the manager to read a description of each of the \namendments in the order in which they have been submitted to the Chair \nso that all Senators will be advised of the nature of the amendment.\n  I renew my request to ask that the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To provide the use of funds for the Emergency Watershed \nProgram for emergency expenses for floodplain operations identified as \n                           of July 18, 2000)\n\n       On page 76, after line 18, of Division B, as modified, \n     insert:\n\n\n                 natural resources conservation service\n\n               watershed and flood prevention operations\n\n       ``For an additional amount for `Watershed and Flood \n     Prevention Operations,' to repair damages to the waterways \n     and watersheds, including the purchase of floodplain \n     easements, resulting from natural disasters, $70,000,000, to \n     remain available until expended: Provided, That funds shall \n     be used for activities identified by July 18, 2000: Provided \n     further, That the entire amount shall be available only to \n     the extent an official budget request for $70,000,000, that \n     includes designation of the entire amount of the request as \n     an emergency requirement as defined in the Balanced Budget \n     and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended is \n     transmitted by the President to the Congress: Provided \n     further, That the entire amount is designated by the Congress \n     as an emergency requirement pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) \n     of such Act.''\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. For the information of Senators and the edification of \nall Senators who have asked that amendments be put before the Senate, \nunder a section of the bill entitled ``Agriculture Emergency Assistance \nPackage,'' I will read the list that the managers recommend be \nconsidered now by the Senate:\n  Amendment No. 1, for Senator Harkin, to provide additional funding \nfor emergency watershed and flood prevention operations;\n  No. 2, an amendment for Senators Levin and Collins to provide \nemergency assistance to apple and potato producers;\n  No. 3, an amendment on behalf of Senators Graham and Mack----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Could the Senator state the dollar number when he reads \nit? You gave us a description. Can you tell us how much?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I was going to give you a total dollar number.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Do you know each amount? It is your bill.\n  Mr. GRAMM. We have one amendment before the Senate, the Harkin \namendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The Harkin amendment is $70 million. The Levin-Collins \namendment is $115 million; the Graham-Mack amendment to compensate for \nnursery stock losses does not score.\n  No. 4, an amendment on behalf of Senators Lott, Cochran, and Kohl to \nextend the wetlands reserve program; it is estimated to cost $117 \nmillion;\n  No. 5, an amendment on behalf of Senators Leahy and Jeffords, \ncompensation for livestock losses, is estimated to cost $4 million;\n  No. 6, an amendment on behalf of Senators Harkin and Bond, for green \nbiotechnology evaluation, estimated to cost $600,000;\n  No. 7, an amendment on behalf of Senators Abraham, Schumer, and \nLevin, for potatoes and apples quality losses, estimated to cost $45 \nmillion;\n  No. 8, on behalf of Senators Graham and Mack on compensation for \ncitrus canker losses, estimated to cost $40 million;\n  No. 9, on behalf of Senator Cochran, on emergency APHIS funding, \nestimated to cost $59.4 million;\n  An amendment on behalf of Senators Thurmond and Hollings on grain \nindemnity assistance, estimated to cost $2.5 million;\n  An amendment on behalf of Senator Cochran on conservation assistance, \nno score on budget authority, $6 million in budget outlays;\n  No. 12, on behalf of Senator Sessions on livestock assistance, no \nscore is available, and is estimated to have no cost;\n  No. 13, on behalf of Senator Edwards on community facilities, \nestimated to cost $50 million;\n  No. 14, on behalf of Senator Dorgan, natural disaster assistance, the \namendment described, $450 million;\n  No. 15, Senators Inouye and Akaka, an amendment on commodity \ntransportation assistance, estimated to cost $7.2 million.\n  That is the entire list, for the information of Senators. It has been \nreviewed by the managers and recommended to the Senate by the offering \nof the amendment as eligible for agriculture emergency assistance in \nthe amounts identified as stated.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. What was the total?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The total amount of all of these amendments amounts to \nabout $900 million. The bill contained $1.116 billion in emergency-\ndesignated programs and activities as reported by the committee. So the \ntotal emergency designated items and programs included in the bill, if \nthis package is agreed to, would amount to $2.1 billion based on \npreliminary scoring made available to the committee by the \nCongressional Budget Office.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, might I first clarify that the $450 \nmillion that the Senator from Mississippi referenced is not for North \nDakota. It is a national program to deal with disasters that have \noccurred in this most recent period of time. Some States have been hit \nby drought. Some States have been hit by flooding.\n  In reference to the question of the Senator from New Mexico, whether \nthese are emergencies that could not have been dealt with in the normal \nprocess of the committee's work, the answer is affirmatively yes, they \ncould not have been dealt with in the normal work of the committee. \nThey could not have been dealt with in the previous supplemental \nbecause the disaster had not yet occurred--at least with respect to \nNorth Dakota.\n  Senator Dorgan indicated we had the most remarkable weather event \nsince we saw the 500-year flood in 1997. In mid-June, our State got 20 \ninches of rain in 36 hours. This is the headline from the biggest paper \nin the State: ``Swamped.'' This was a week after the rain that I just \nreferenced.\n  The rain that I just referenced occurred a week before this one. We \nhave been hit by the most remarkable series of floods since the 1997 \nflood, which was a 500-year event.\n  On June 12, in North Dakota, we had rains that were up to 20 inches \nin a wide band in northeastern North Dakota. Seven days later we got \nhit with this rainstorm--8 inches in 6 hours. The devastation is \nstunning.\n  On the State university, this is the reference, NDSU, $50 million at \nthe State university.\n  At the dome that is the large center, the activity center for the \ncity: $10 million of damage. In surrounding farm areas as a result of \nthese two floods: 1.7 million acres devastated.\n  The catastrophe in our State cannot be overstated: 1.7 million acres \nof land devastated, hundreds of millions of dollars of damage in the \nlargest city in our State. This is an emergency by any definition. \nUnfortunately, it had not occurred when we dealt with the \nsupplementals. It had not occurred\n\n[[Page S7345]]\n\nwhen the committee did its work. It is only now that we know the full \nextent of the damage. That is why we are here asking our colleagues not \nfor a new program but to reinstate the program we had last year to deal \nwith crop loss disasters.\n  Last year, we put in place a program that cost about $2 billion to \ndeal with natural disasters. This year we are asking for $900 million \nnot just for North Dakota but for the other States that have been hit \nas well. We know the devastation in North Dakota is stunning, but we \nare not alone. In other areas of the country disasters have ruined \ncrops as well: 216 counties in Georgia, South Carolina, and Florida \nwere declared disaster areas on July 14.\n  I might say to my colleagues, I spoke on this matter last Friday with \nSenator Coverdell, Senator Coverdell who was tragically lost to us \nearlier this week. Senator Coverdell had indicated that he would join \nin an amendment because Georgia has been devastated. South Carolina and \nFlorida were declared agricultural disaster areas as well on that same \nday, July 14.\n  USDA has also declared agricultural disasters in parts of Alabama, \nNebraska, New Mexico, Arizona, Mississippi, New York, Texas, \nWashington, and perhaps other States. These are the States that I know \nof that have had disasters declared.\n  The hard reality is these things have happened. The earlier package \nwe dealt with was designed for economic disasters. That has been \npassed. That has been signed into law. This is to give back the program \nthat was available last year for areas hit by drought or severe \nflooding. We are asking for $900 million. I can tell you, it is \ndesperately needed, desperately needed. It is without question an \nemergency.\n  This series of events, at least in our State, had not occurred at the \ntime of the supplemental appropriations bills, nor had it occurred so \nthe full extent of the damage was known for the committee \ndeliberations. That is the reality.\n  This responds also to the needs of producers in the Northeastern \nUnited States who have been hit, and the needs of producers hit by \ndisasters in the South.\n  I ask my colleagues to very carefully consider their response to this \nrequest. We have always tried to be a United States of America in \nresponse to disasters, listening to the needs of every State in every \ncondition. I regret very much that I am here asking again. We have had \nnine Presidential disaster declarations in the last 8 years in my \nState. I never remember something like this in my life. There is \nsome extraordinary weather pattern affecting my State.\n\n  As many of you know, we have a lake that has risen 25 vertical feet \nin the last 6 years, a lake that is the size of the District of \nColumbia, a lake that is devouring surrounding communities, roads, \nfarms--that is another disaster. That lake missed having this \nextraordinary rainfall by 70 miles. If that lake would have been hit by \nthis 20 inches of rain in 2 days, we would have been here dealing with \na calamity of stunning proportion.\n  So I say to my colleagues, I know none of us like these surprise \nrequests, but we could not have made the request until the disaster \noccurred. We could not have quantified the need, unfortunately, until \nFEMA and USDA had a chance to go in and do a review of the level of \ndisaster. Again, the $450 million requested is not for North Dakota. It \nis a national response to all the States that have been affected to \nrepeat the program we passed and put in place last year. I hope my \ncolleagues' hearts will not turn cold simply because we have had to \nface disasters year after year. I can tell you, the people of my State \nneed help. Mr. President, 1.7 million acres devastated, that is one-\nfifth, 20 percent of the crop base of my State, and the biggest city of \nmy State, as the headline in the biggest newspaper in my State says: \n``Swamped.''\n  This is from the Grand Forks Herald, one of the four largest cities \nin the State, 80 miles to the north of Fargo: ``Area Flooding \nContinues.'' Here are additional reports, ``Weather Service Official \nSays Storm Worst He's Ever Seen.''\n  It is hard to describe an event of this proportion--20 inches of rain \nin 36 hours. It is Biblical. I don't know any other way to say it to my \ncolleagues.\n  This is from the Fargo Forum, again the biggest newspaper in our \nState, with officials there saying: ``It's the worst rain flood we've \never had''--in the history of our State.\n  Finally, this story kind of tells it all, again from the biggest \nnewspaper in our State: ``Floods Finish Off Crops Hurt By Drought.''\n  I just conclude by saying to my colleagues: It is perverse but it has \nhappened. Hundreds of millions of dollars of damage in my State alone, \nwith other States similarly affected. We ought to put in place the \nprogram we had last year to help those who deserve assistance. That is \nmy plea to my colleagues tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I think I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has been \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Texas, I \nthink I will take about 3 or 4 minutes; that's all. I want to associate \nmyself with the remarks of my colleagues from North Dakota.\n  I simply want to put it in personal terms because I think that is the \nway most Senators understand things. About 2 weeks ago, I was visiting \nwith friends. When I drove up, there were pickup trucks as far as you \ncould see. The farmers were there because of flooding, again, for the \nseventh year in a row. In my State, 350,000 acres of farmland have been \ndestroyed. You could just look at the faces of people and see the pain. \nThis happened in June when we were dealing with the MILCON bill. We \nwere not able to assess the damage yet.\n  Look, whatever the vehicle is and however we do this, I thank Senator \nCochran for understanding what we are trying to do, and I hope--this \namendment has been withdrawn, but I hope we do come together as \nSenators to support this. This is not just about North Dakota or \nMinnesota; it also is about a lot of States in the South. There, it is \nthe opposite problem; it is drought.\n  I have only been here--I guess it is a long time--9 years. That is \nnot as long as some of my colleagues. The way I feel about the Senate \nis we do become a community. Maybe we will do it a different way, but \nwe are a community in the sense that it is, there but for the grace of \nGod go I. Whenever Senators come to the floor and say: My God, it's \nbeen tornadoes, it's been hurricanes, its floods, its droughts and \npeople are hurting and people need help, I do not hesitate to vote for \nother Senators and other people in other States. That is what this is \nabout.\n  This amendment has been withdrawn, but the question before us will \ncontinue to be a question before us. I certainly hope that, working \nwith Senators, Democrats and Republicans alike, we will be able to get \nthe support.\n  I will finish this way: This is not like how do you come to the floor \nof the Senate and sneak something through or there is something that \nyou are doing that is some flagrant special interest favor. The only \nspecial interests here are a whole bunch of good people, who are going \nthrough a living hell, who need some help. What we are trying to do is \nget that help for those people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, if we were beginning to write a farm budget \nthis year, these arguments might resonate. The problem is we have \nalready spent $9.6 billion that required budget waivers so far this \nyear: Spending some of it in the year 2000, and spending some of it in \nthe year 2001, but all of it where we made a commitment to spend this \nyear.\n  What is really happening is we are in the process of simply throwing \nthe budget out the window. We are in the process of letting this budget \nsurplus literally burn a hole in our pockets. The level of scratching \nand clawing to get into the pockets of the Federal Government is at a \nlevel I have never experienced in the 22 years I have served in \nCongress.\n  It seems to me if this provision were meritorious in a bill that is \nproviding\n\n[[Page S7346]]\n\n$14.85 billion of discretionary assistance to farmers and ranchers, it \nwould have found a place. In fact, this bill, in addition to the $1.4 \nbillion of crop insurance, $1.6 billion in emergency assistance, the \n$5.5 billion of loss assistance, the $1.1 billion this bill has for \nemergencies--if we adopt this amendment, we are saying that a full \n$10.5 billion of emergency spending in agriculture will be expended \nthis year when the entire nonemergency part of the bill is $14.85 \nbillion. In other words, we have about a 66-percent increase in \nspending, all in the name of emergency.\n  I have to say I believe this has gone too far. We are all interested \nin helping farmers and ranchers. We all know there are problems, but \nevery year the President proposes a level of assistance, Republicans \nraise it, Democrats raise it more, and then our Democrat colleagues \nraise it again. Is there no limit to the amount of money we are willing \nto spend because we have this surplus?\n  Obviously, I cannot address every issue raised by every Senator, but \none has to ask the question: When 50 cents out of every dollar going to \nfarmers in America is coming from the Government, what is going on in \nAmerica today?\n  It is very interesting to me, and I just put these figures out here \nand pose a question: If we are having a complete agricultural disaster, \nif farmers are going broke left and right, if we should be spending \nalmost 70 percent of our ag budget in emergency add-on spending, what \nwould you expect to be happening to farm debt? Given that we have a 70-\npercent cost over-run to ``help the farmer,'' what would you think is \nhappening to farm debt? What would you think is happening to the level \nof farm assets? What would you think is happening to the debt-to-asset \nratio?--in other words, the amount of debt farmers have relative to \ntheir assets.\n  When we have allowed emergency spending to reach levels unprecedented \nin the history of this country, when we have made emergency \nappropriations in agriculture the norm, when we have had a bidding war \nto buy votes in rural America such as this country has never seen in \nits history because of all of these losses, what would you think is \nhappening to farm debt?\n  Let me just give you the figures: Farm debt in 1998 was $172.9 \nbillion. In 1999, it was $172.8 billion. This year, it is projected to \nbe $172.5 billion.\n  With all of this economic disaster, with this destruction such as we \nhave not seen since Steinbeck novels, somehow, remarkably, farm debt is \ngoing down and not up. Yet we cannot spend money fast enough. There is \njust not enough money in the world to meet the demand we have for it.\n  What would you think is happening to farm assets? Farmers going broke \nleft and right, leaving the farm, disaster, the trails, the trucks \ngoing to California, the desertion, the disaster in rural America--what \ndo you think is happening to farm assets? They must be plummeting. They \nmust be in a complete free-fall. Oddly enough, not only are they not \nplummeting, they are going up. They were $1.0643 trillion in 1998, \n$1.0672 trillion in 1999, and they are projected to be $1.0728 trillion \nthis year.\n\n  If there is such absolute calamity in agriculture in America today, \nwhy are assets going up, and not down?\n  Finally, with all of this burgeoning debt--farmers drowning in debt; \nthe mortgage collector at the door; the mean, cold-hearted banker \nbeating on the farm door, foreclosing mortgages; widows being put out \non the lawn on our farms--what do you think has happened to the debt-\nto-asset ratio in agriculture? It was $16.2 billion in 1998, $16.2 \nbillion in 1999, and $16.1 billion today.\n  What is wrong with this picture? We are saying that the world is \ncollapsing in rural America, and we are spending at rates unprecedented \nin the history of this country to deal with a calamity; and yet farm \ndebt is going down, farm assets are going up, and the debt-to-asset \nratio in agricultural America is actually going down.\n  Now look, something is wrong here.\n  What is wrong with this picture? I will tell you what is wrong with \nthis picture. The obscene actions that have been taken in this \nCongress. There seems to be no limit to what we are willing to spend in \nthe name of agriculture. I think it has to stop. I can't judge the \nmerits of this case, this $70 million, that $115 million, the next $117 \nmillion, $4 million, $600,000----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator suspend.\n  The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. GRAMM. The $45 million, $40 million, $59.4 million, $2.5 million, \n$6 million, $50 million, $450 million, $7.2 million--these are all \nemergencies that, when we funded the three previous emergencies, did \nnot make it into the stack. When this bill was written, in a committee \nthat is not known for turning a cold, dead eye to suffering farmers and \nranchers, this $900 million never made it into the stack.\n  But here we are, on a Thursday afternoon, at 7:20 p.m., and we are \ntalking about $900 million--$900 million of spending that was not in \nthe budget, that was not in the appropriations bill, that requires a \nwaiver of the Budget Act, and that requires the designation of an \nemergency.\n  I am saying, in $10 billion of emergency spending and $14.85 billion \nof ordinary spending--out of $25 billion that we are spending--how come \nthere was not room for this $900 million? How come we are suddenly \ndealing with it at 7:25 p.m. tonight?\n  I think the answer is as clear as the answer can be. The answer is, \nwe are determined we are going to spend every penny we can spend. We \nare turning our budget process into an absolute laughing stock. We are \nproving that all somebody has to do is walk down to the floor on \nThursday evening and offer an amendment, spending millions of dollars, \nand it is great.\n  We are asked: Have you lost compassion? Look, I have plenty of \ncompassion. But how much compassion is enough? How much do we have to \nspend on these programs? This year, we have already spent almost $10 \nbillion in agricultural programs that required a budget waiver. We are \nalready to the point where half of all net farm income is coming from a \ncheck from Washington, DC. Where does it end?\n  Final point--I have talked too long--but today, when we had Alan \nGreenspan before the Banking Committee, he was asked whether or not he \nwas concerned about the fact that if you take the appropriation growth \nwe had this year and project it for 10 years, it is over $1 trillion in \nnew spending. We are realistically debating a new entitlement that, \nwhen fully implemented for 10 years, would cost about $750 billion. He \nsaid he was very concerned about it, that he thought it represented a \npotential threat to the economy.\n  So I am not saying that all of these things are without merit. I am \njust saying: When does it end? When does it stop? How much is enough? \nIs $10 billion of emergency spending--almost 70 percent above the \nnormal level of spending--is that not enough?\n  I think these are real questions that need to be answered. I think it \nis important that we stop these amendments. And they may be adopted. \nLook, I understand the votes may be here to adopt them. But they are \ngoing to be adopted individually. And they are going to be subject to a \npoint of order. We are going to begin to resist. This has to end \nsomewhere. It seems to me that this is the place where we need to begin \nto talk about it ending.\n  I, quite frankly, was willing to accept all of these so-called \nemergencies already in the bill, but this just goes beyond the limits \nof endurance, in my opinion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will be brief.\n  I am very pleased that the distinguished chairman of the Budget \nCommittee is going to raise a point of order, very shortly, on the \nfirst amendment, the Harkin amendment. I do not pretend to have the \nbudget knowledge and expertise of the distinguished chairman of the \nBudget Committee, but I do know that when he becomes exercised about \nwhat is taking place, at an ever-increasing crescendo of additional \nspending, about which Members really have no information or knowledge, \nwe have to bring this to a halt at some point.\n  I say to my colleagues now, I will make every effort to prevent us \nfrom going out of session without the appropriations process being \nresolved. No\n\n[[Page S7347]]\n\nmore should we all go home while four or five Members of Congress \ndecide on omnibus appropriations bills and then we are called back to \nvote ``yea'' or ``nay'' on a bill that none of us has had a chance to \nknow or read.\n  Every year, for the last 3 years, we have been assured that this will \nnot happen again. Well, my friends, I will do everything in my power \nnot to have it happen again.\n  But let me point out, the Harkin amendment, which we just saw--this \namendment which was about to be adopted by voice vote in the package of \namendments totaling $960 million, which none of us had seen--let me \njust describe it to you.\n  It says:\n\n       For an additional amount for ``Watershed and Flood \n     Prevention Operations,'' to repair damages to the waterways \n     and watersheds, including the purchase of floodplain \n     easements, resulting from natural disasters, $70,000,000, to \n     remain available until expended: Provided, That funds shall \n     be used for activities identified by July 18, 2000 . . . .\n\n  Let me repeat that:\n\n       . . . That funds shall be used for activities identified by \n     July 18, 2000. . . .\n\n  That was 2 days ago. What activities? Identified by whom? The \nDepartment of Reclamation? The Department of Agriculture? Senator \nGramm? Senator Harkin? What activities that were identified by July 18? \nAnd where is the record of July 18 of these activities that were \nidentified to spend $70 million on?\n  What is going on? We are going to spend $70 million for ``Watershed \nand Flood Prevention Operations,'' for ``activities identified by July \n18, 2000'? Is there any Member of this body, including the sponsor of \nthe bill, who knows what activities have been identified?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. If the Senator will yield, I will be happy to give him \nthe answer.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will be happy to hear the answer.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The date of July 18 was chosen because it was on that \ndate that the National Resources Conservation Service provided a list \nto the committee, at our request, of unfunded needs that were \nconsidered emergency watershed projects throughout the United States.\n  It was this list from which we chose to estimate the funding needs \nthat ought to be included in this bill as true emergencies. The total \namount of the unfunded projected needs is $157,111,000. We have \nsuggested the $70 million figure for emergencies. Of those projected \nneeds, spring floods accounted for $30 million, hurricanes and \ntornadoes for $50 million, and fires for $10 million. These are either \nerosions or destruction of watershed protection facilities or the \nrequirement for obtaining floodplain easements in those areas. That is \ngenerally across the United States. It is not State specific.\n  Then there are 23 States where the amounts are specifically \nidentified as totaling $67,111,000. These are the States: Alaska, \nArizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Georgia, Indiana, Illinois, \nIowa, Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, \nNew Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, \nUtah, and Wisconsin. They vary in each State from, for example, Alaska, \nwhich is a small number, $237,000, to a large number, California, $12 \nmillion; another large number, Illinois, $7.5 million; and Iowa, which \nwas the subject of Senator Harkin's request, $7.5 million, to which the \nmanagers added all the other States so it wouldn't be just relief for \none State but all States that were similarly situated would be included \nin this amendment because they all had similar needs.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Mississippi. That is very \nilluminating. I guess my next question to the distinguished manager is, \nwe already have $1.1 billion worth of spending designated ``emergency'' \nin the bill. What occurred in the intervening time that necessitated an \nadditional nearly billion dollars and next week will there be another \nbillion dollars? I believe only a week has elapsed since the bill was \nbrought to the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, these are \nfigures that were provided to the committee by the Natural Resources \nConservation Service. That service administers the Emergency Watershed \nProtection Program. These are the projected needs through fiscal year \n2000. They were provided to the committee on July 18 at our request.\n  This program was out of money as of sometime last fall because of the \ncutbacks in funding that we have been seeing in this bill, along with \nothers as well. To try to achieve consistency with the budget \nresolution targets and our allocation under section 302(b), we were not \nable to fund programs to the full amount of the request from the \nadministration for projected needs.\n  These are given to us as certified emergency needs from this agency \nthat has the responsibility of administering the program.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for that information.\n  The Senator from Mississippi has added a great deal to the store of \nknowledge of this body. I think it is very helpful. I still don't quite \nunderstand why at the end of an appropriations bill there should be, en \nbloc, 15 or whatever it is amendments worth over $900 million, which we \ndidn't even get a copy of until we demanded it at the time, after the \namendments were proposed. I don't think that is the way we should do \nbusiness around here, particularly when we are talking about hundreds \nand millions and billions of dollars. I think it would have been \nappropriate--although I won't continue with the floor--as to what \nhappened to the $8 billion or so that we already spent. What about \nthose emergencies and what happened to that money?\n  I thank the Senator from Mississippi for his information and yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will try to be very brief.\n  I want to make an observation. I honestly believe that we would be \nbetter off if instead of continually adding emergencies for agriculture \nor anything else, if we were to add more money straight up to the \nappropriations process. I believe we ought to just ask the chairman and \nranking member at the end of this year to add more money. But we ought \nnot to, by the week, add emergencies.\n  I know there are a number of bills--who knows where we will come out \non them--that are taking care of problems by adding emergency \nprovisions. I believe the chairman understands, the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee understands our problem. I believe Senator \nByrd understands our problem. The solution is not to add an emergency \nby the week, have a bill and then everybody comes running and we say: \nThere is no room for it. Well, call it an emergency and then there will \nbe room because it doesn't count against anything.\n  I want to make another observation about the agricultural community. \nI probably have the best support or at least as good support as any \nSenator here from the agricultural community of my State. But I am not \nimpressed with the year-in-year-out emergency requests of the \nagricultural community of this country. It is approaching the \nridiculous. They ask the Budget Committee, put more money in for \nagriculture.\n  We were pretty skimpy on other things, but we were not very skimpy on \nagriculture. We provided, and the committee held on to this in the \nappropriations, a $5.5 billion reserve fund for market losses. As soon \nas they funded it, the reserve fund was released, and they had $5.5 \nbillion. Market losses are emergencies in the broad sense for \nagriculture, I guess. I understand that to be the case. People are \ngetting checks because the market didn't work. They didn't get money.\n  We put in a new crop insurance allowance for which everybody thanked \nus. It was passed, but it was passed even bigger than we thought. And \nthat was all right. That amounted to $3 billion. It is heralded as a \nfantastic success by people such as Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas. We \nfinally did it. Now crop insurance is emergency money. It is a rational \nway to take care of annual losses by crop insurance, a sharing of the \nburden by a lot of people. When a crop fails, you have something to \nhelp them with.\n  Well, that wasn't quite enough and we knew it. And we heard: Don't \nhold your breath; there will be more agricultural emergencies.\n  I hope and pray the bill finishes tonight. I wish it would have \nfinished a week ago. Sooner or later, we have to\n\n[[Page S7348]]\n\nstop adding emergencies to a bill in the agricultural area. I am not \nsure that every one of these are agricultural subsidy enhancers. The \nbill has a lot of jurisdiction. It could be other things. The \ndistinguished senior Senator from Mississippi manages the bill \nbeautifully. He knows what he is doing.\n  I noted also, when he sent these amendments to the desk, he said: I \nsend them on behalf of the Senators that have asked for them. He did \nnot say the chairman of the Agriculture Committee submits these and \nasks for all of them. I believe he really thought somebody would \nchallenge some of them but he would offer them because he had worked on \nthem to narrow down a request that was even bigger than this.\n  I suggest that we try this on tonight, that we decide that if we need \nmore money and we are going to put it in bills, that we ask the \nchairman to spend more money. I will not agree with my friend from \nTexas. It is not the appropriations bills that are going to break this \nbudget. It is not the appropriations bills that are going to cause us \nto run out of the surplus that is being generated. You can count on \nthat. The increases in appropriations will be wiped out by one \nentitlement bill. Whatever you expect to be added to appropriations the \nnext decade will be wiped out by the first major entitlement bill that \ncomes along. It will take from the same pot of surplus as \nappropriations. It is not appropriations that is breaking the bank.\n  I compliment Senator Gramm for trying to keep us from going wild, but \nthe truth is, it is not appropriations. We don't have any control over \nit, if in fact instead of asking for the money to be added to the \nbudget and vote on that as grown-up Senators, we added money, and do \nyou want it or not. You will have a shot at that when we add it because \nwe are going to add money. The chairman is going to have to ask us for \nmore money to get the appropriations bill, substantially more. But it \nwill be a heads up add-on. It won't be coming along the way we are \nhere. So when it is appropriate, after asking a parliamentary inquiry, \nI will make a point of order. What is pending before the Senate right \nnow?\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is the amendment No. 3964 \noffered by Senator Cochran for Senator Harkin.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is it appropriate to make a point of order under the \nBudget Act regarding the emergency quality of that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That would be appropriate.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I make a point of order that the \namendment contains an emergency designation in violation of section 205 \nof H. Con. Res 290, and the fiscal year 2001 budget resolution.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to waive the point of order \npursuant to section 205(c) of H. Con. Res 290 with respect to all \nemergency designations in this bill and to all the amendments to this \nbill filed at this time, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The first issue is to determine if there is a \nsufficient second. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 3977--Motion to Waive\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3977:\n       Strike all after the first word, and insert the following:\n       ``I move to waive section 205 of the budget resolution for \n     consideration of the Harkin amendment.''\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3978 to Amendment No. 3977\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to strike the word ``waive'' in \nthe pending amendment and insert the following: ``Section 205(c) of H. \nCon. Res. 290 with respect to all emergency designations in this bill \nand all amendments filed at the desk at this time to this bill other \nthan amendment No. 3918.''\n  I send the motion to the desk. I ask it be reported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3978 to amendment No. 3977.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Parliamentary inquiry. Is this a strike-and-insert \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is for the clerk to finish \nreporting the amendment.\n  For the information of the Senator, the amendment does strike a word \nand add other language.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Under the regular order, the amendment should be read or its reading \nterminated by regular order.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       Strike the word waive in the pending amendment and insert \n     the following:\n       ``Section 205(c) of H. Con. Res. 290 with respect to all \n     emergency designations in this bill and all amendments filed \n     at the desk at this time to this bill other than amendment \n     No. 3918.''\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I ask for the yeas and nays on the motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n          Amendment No. 3978 to Amendment No. 3977, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, on behalf of the leader and at his \nrequest, I ask consent that the pending motion to waive and any \namendments thereto be withdrawn, and that the point of order be \nwithdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n[[Page S7349]]\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

Mr. President, I have an amendment which would assist \napple growers who suffered losses from fire blight and other weather \nrelated and economic damage. The amendment is cosponsored by Senators \nCollins, Schumer, Gorton, Murray, Snowe, Leahy, Jeffords, Moynihan, \nDurbin, Rockefeller, Robb, Abraham, and Lieberman. This spring, apple \ngrowers in Michigan suffered huge crop losses and damage due to several \nhail storms which caused thousands of acres of apple trees to be \ninfected with fire blight. Fire blight is a bacterium that has \ndestroyed thousands of acres of fruit trees in Michigan. Experts at \nMichigan State University anticipate that \\1/4\\ of all MI apple farmers \nhave trees that are afflicted by fire blight. As a result of this \nweather related disaster, many of Michigan's best apple producers face \ndiminished production this fall, and decreased revenues for many years \nto come. My amendment provides essential assistance for apple and \npotato producers that have suffered quantity losses due to fire blight \nor other weather related disasters. These hardships could not come at a \nworse time for our nation's apple farmers who, according to USDA, have \nlost nearly $1 billion over the past three years due to a variety of \nfactors including diseases, such as fire blight. This legislation also \nincludes assistance for apple and potato farmers who have incurred \nquality losses due to weather-related disasters.\n  The Agricultural Risk Protection Act, which President Clinton signed \ninto law, included some emergency assistance for our nation's farmers. \nHowever, much remains to be done to address the myriad of problems \nfacing out nation's apple farmers. That is why with 13 cosponsors I \nhave introduced amendment No. 3457 that would provide $100 million in \nassistance this year for quantitative losses of our nation's apple \nfarmers. A second degree amendment that would provide $60 million for \nqualitative losses, suffered by apple and potato farmers, was attached \nto my amendment by Senators Abraham and Schumer. Articles from a number \nof Michigan papers show the plight of apple farmers, and mentions the \nneed for direct assistance, in the form of this amendment, to our apple \nfarmers. I ask unanimous consent that these articles be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Herald-Palladium, June 22, 2000]\n\n        Bad Apples: Fire Blight Is Taking Bite Out of Area Crops\n\n\n   Farmers seek federal financial assistance for acres of dying trees\n\n                         (By Michael Eliasohn)\n\n       Watervliet--The name of Rodney Winkel's farm is Grandview \n     Orchards, but the view these days is far from grand.\n       A building on Winkel's Bainbridge Township farm Wednesday \n     morning was the location for a meeting of about 80 Southwest \n     Michigan farmers who have the same view--brown dead leaves on \n     dying apple trees.\n\n[[Page S7352]]\n\n       The cause is fire blight, a bacterial infection that \n     shrivels the apples and can kill the trees. Alan Jones, \n     Michigan State University's fire blight expert, said it's the \n     worst outbreak ever in Michigan.\n       John Sarno, U.S. Farm Service Agency Southwest Michigan \n     regional director, said his office has received preliminary \n     reports of fire blight damage in Berrien, Van Buren, Cass and \n     Kalamazoo counties. He expects to receive a similar report \n     soon from Allegan County and believes there may be damage in \n     Ottawa and Kent counties.\n       Prior to the meeting, Michigan Farm Bureau (MFB) conducted \n     a tour of four fire blighted orchards in Van Buren County for \n     aides to several Michigan members of Congress, plus staff \n     from the MSU College of Agriculture, the Farm Service Agency, \n     Michigan Department of Agriculture and others.\n       Winkel described the problem facing the farmers. He and his \n     son-in-law Mark Epple grow about 300 acres of apples. ``I \n     conservatively estimate we'll take out 60 to 70 acres of \n     trees,'' he said. ``These are huge dollars we're talking \n     about and the cookie jar is dry.''\n       ``A number of years ago, agriculture could handle a \n     disaster like this,'' but not any more, said MFB President \n     Jack Laurie, who chaired the meeting. ``The (profit) margin \n     has been reduced, so farmers can't stand a big loss.''\n       Unlike a spring freeze that wipes out that year's crop, the \n     fire blight damage goes far beyond one year.\n       Coloma area grower Jerry Jollay said during the meeting he \n     and his son, Jay, expect to lose about half of their 55 acres \n     of apple trees.\n       He later told The Herald-Palladium if trees are removed and \n     new trees planted, it takes 5-6 years until they start \n     producing a good crop and it isn't until the eighth year they \n     get a full crop.\n       He estimated it costs from $4,000 to $10,000 per acre to \n     replant trees and to maintain them until they start \n     producing, depending on the number planted per acre. The \n     figure does not include the value of lost production.\n       Growers may be able to remove diseased limbs and save some \n     trees, according to Jones of MSU, but that could mean 2-3 \n     years of reduced crops until it gets back to full production.\n       ``But if you don't get it all,'' said Mike Hildebrand, ``it \n     will flare up next year or the year after.'' Hildebrand and \n     his father, Ernie, grow about 70 acres of apples near Berrien \n     Springs.\n       Jones said if an infected limb is missed, the fire blight \n     will spread to the roots and kill the tree.\n       And if one tree is infected, the fire blight can spread to \n     the rest of the trees in the orchard.\n       Sarno told the growers there is no existing program to \n     compensate them for fire blight damages, that Congress has to \n     approve one and the funds for it. ``We have to start over,'' \n     he said. ``We have to look at what we have today (in damage) \n     and that's what we're doing today.''\n       Sarno later told The Herald-Palladium there are three \n     potential programs Congress could approve, one involving low-\n     interest loans to partially compensate them for their \n     production losses and tree losses.\n       The other two programs would give them grants, either to \n     help cover production losses or pay for removing \n     diseased trees and planting new ones.\n       Farmers with crop insurance may be covered for lost crops \n     this year.\n       Sarno said county agricultural emergency boards must first \n     compile loss data, which they forward to the state emergency \n     board.\n       If the state board decided the loss is significant enough, \n     it asks Gov. John Engler to ask U.S. Secretary of Agriculture \n     Dan Glickman to declare the affected counties agricultural \n     disaster areas, thus qualifying growers for aid, if Congress \n     OKs it.\n       Sarno said the last time there was such an emergency, in \n     Kent County in 1998 when winds blew down trees and spread \n     fire blight, ti took about a year before growers received \n     their government checks. ``We hope to expedite this (for fire \n     blight damage),'' he said.\n       Winkel said he could lose 30,000-35,000 bushels of apples \n     this year, and for the next several years, until replacement \n     trees start producing apples, his loss could be 50,000 \n     bushels a year.\n       The value of apples varies widely, depending on the \n     variety, when they are sold and their use, but at $6 per \n     bushel--the 1999 average from two area packing houses for \n     Jonathans--Winkel's annual loss would be $300,000 a year.\n       He said Idared, Jonathon, Rome, Gala, Paulared and Golden \n     Delicious are the varieties being affected most by fire \n     flight.\n       For some growers, fire blight isn't their only problem. \n     Jollay said spring frosts and freezes reduced his tart cherry \n     crop by probably half, apples by 20 percent and peaches by 50 \n     percent.\n       Then hail on May 18 caused more damage, followed by the \n     fire blight. He guessed he will have only about a fourth of \n     his normal crop of apples.\n       In his 35 years in agriculture, Jollay said, he has \n     suffered losses from freezes, hail and fire blight, but not \n     all in one year. ``This is absolutely the worst I've ever \n     seen.'' He said he and his son hope to get through this year \n     with income from pumpkins, their other significant crop, and \n     their pick-your-own ``family fun'' operations in the fall.\n       As for possible federal aid, he said: ``Hopefully this will \n     help alleviate part of the problem.''\n       Coloma area grower Paul Friday, whose 140 acres of peaches \n     suffered major hail damage on May 18, asked that hail-caused \n     damage to fruit and young trees not yet bearing fruit be \n     included in any assistance program.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Kalamazoo Gazette, June 22, 2000]\n\nApple Growers Getting Burned--Epidemic of Fire Blight Devastates Local \n                                  Crop\n\n                            (By Ed Finnerty)\n\n       HARTFORD--The Golden Delicious apple trees on Kevin \n     Winkel's family farm are anything but golden or delicious.\n       Their leaves are more brown than green. Their fruit \n     resembles rotting grapes more than edible apples.\n       To Winkel and scores of besieged farmers in the apple \n     country of Van Buren and Berrien counties, a killer epidemic \n     of fire blight that has overtaken their orchards and \n     threatens their livelihoods is a disaster by any reasonable \n     standard.\n       ``It got my entire crop,'' lamented Winkel, a second-\n     generation grower working the land he took over from his \n     father 16 years ago.\n       ``There will be zero income from this year's crop and at \n     least half of the expenses are already in it,'' said Winkel, \n     a married father of two who isn't sure the business will \n     survive the loss.\n       Apple farmers in Van Buren and Berrien counties in \n     southwestern Michigan are hoping to persuade the Federal \n     Government to declare their farms disaster areas, entitling \n     them to aid farm officials say may be a last lifeline for \n     some growers.\n       ``The problem here is devastating,'' said Al Almy, Michigan \n     Farm Bureau's director of public policy and commodities. ``It \n     could put some of the very best growers right out of \n     business.''\n       Fire blight is a bacterial disease affecting primarily \n     apple and pear trees that is spread by insects and often \n     enters blooms or leaves damaged by wind or hail. It destroys \n     tissue it infects, killing blossoms and shoots, sometimes \n     progressing into the tree and its roots. Badly infected trees \n     look like they have been burned.\n       Strains of fire blight that have become resistant to \n     antibiotic sprays have slowly spread in area orchards, but a \n     May 18 storm that produced hail and high winds is blamed with \n     sparking the huge outbreak.\n       Mark Longstroth, district horticulture and marketing agent \n     with the MSU Extension, estimates some 300 to 400 growers and \n     27,000 acres of apples will be affected by the blight. The \n     major damage is in Van Buren and Berrien counties, but fire \n     blight has appeared in Allegan, Cass and Kalamazoo counties \n     too, officials say.\n       Officials are still evaluating losses but say they may \n     reach about $10 million in the two counties. This year's \n     losses will be multiplied in future years with the loss of \n     production from trees that are killed.\n       ``This is one of the worst epidemics we have ever seen,'' \n     said Alan Jones, a professor of plant pathology at Michigan \n     State University. Jones, a fire blight expert with MSU for 30 \n     years, said this outbreak dwarfs the worst epidemic he had \n     seen previously, in 1991.\n       The Michigan Farm Bureau on Wednesday invited media and \n     representatives from the area's congressional delegation to \n     tour orchards from Lawrence in Van Buren County to Watervliet \n     in Berrien County. The caravan stopped at some orchards to \n     inspect the damages, but in most cases a drive by acre after \n     acre of brown orchards was all that was needed to see the \n     devastation.\n       At an orchard near Watervliet, dozens of apple growers \n     waited to meet with representatives from the Farm Bureau, \n     USDA, Michigan Department of Agriculture, MSU Extension and \n     other agencies. It was partly a show for the invited media, \n     including crews from several newspapers and \n     television stations, and a show of force to \n     representatives of the Congressional delegations.\n       Staffers for U.S. Sen. Carl Levin and Reps. Fred Upton, \n     Nick Smith, Vernon Ehlers, and Peter Hoekstra were on hand \n     Wednesday, and Michigan Farm Bureau President Jack Laurie \n     urged growers to push them for disaster assistance.\n       ``Levin's office is the one we've got to lean on, this guy \n     here,'' one grower said to others, as they waited for another \n     farmer to finish bending the ear of Levin's staffer.\n       If a disaster is declared, farmers will be eligible for \n     low-interest loans to cover losses and replace trees. Federal \n     assistance to replace weather-damaged trees doesn't cover \n     fire blight, but officials from the Farm Bureau and other \n     assembled agencies said political pressure should be applied \n     to get that coverage.\n       A state emergency board will be convened to evaluate losses \n     in the affected counties, then ask Gov. John Engler to \n     request federal disaster relief from the U.S. Department of \n     Agriculture.\n       ``I think we have seen enough to know this is very \n     widespread, this is very dramatic,'' said John Sarno, \n     district director for USDA Farm Services Agency, who took his \n     camera along on Wednesday's tour. ``There are going to be \n     great losses.''\n       Any help would be welcomed by Winkel, who says he may have \n     to find a second job and whose wife may have to go from \n     working as a part-time nurse to working full time. His 100 \n     acres of trees, which last year produced about 73,000 bushels \n     of apples and $300,000 in revenue, will yield nothing this \n     year.\n       ``The whole future of the southwest Michigan fruit industry \n     is at stake here,'' said Tom Butler, head of the Michigan \n     Processing\n\n[[Page S7353]]\n\n     Apple Growers. ``A lot of growers are not going to be able to \n     stay in business until some serious help comes along.''\n       The fire blight will have no discernible impact on \n     consumers because of a strong supply of apples nationwide, \n     Butler said\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am particularly grateful to Senator Susan Collins whose \nsupport has been essential. I am also pleased with the many bipartisan \ncosponsors who have supported this legislation.\n  This amendment is similar to legislation which recently passed the \nother body as part of the FY2001 Agriculture Appropriations bill.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my good friend \nSenator Levin in offering an amendment to provide much needed relief \nfor apple and potato producers across America. Senator Levin and I \nshare a deep concern for these farmers, who have endured such \nunexpected hardship over the past year. I am grateful for having the \nopportunity to work with my friend from Michigan on this critical \nmatter.\n  Over the past three years, America's apple growers have lost more \nthan $760 million according to U.S. Department of Agriculture \nstatistics. Market conditions, beyond the control of our farmers, and \nunfair trade practices have contributed significantly to these loses. \nThere has been a reduction in demand for U.S. apples in much of the \nworld because of poor economic conditions in foreign markets. The \ndomestic demand for apples has been affected by conditions abroad as \nwell. With dimished demand oversees, we have seen an increase in the \nforeign supply of apples in our domestic markets. The U.S. Department \nof Commerce and the International Trade Commission recently found that \nour producers have been victimized by unfairly priced imports of \nChinese apple juice concentrate.\n  Unusual weather also has hurt our potato and apple producers. The \nMaine Pomological Society, a group that primarily represents apple \nproducers in my State, reports that a summer-long drought, coupled with \nthe heavy winds and rains of Hurricane Floyd in the fall, had a \ndisastrous impact on the quality of apples produced in Maine last year. \nOn average, only 49% of Maine's 1999 apple crop could be sold at the \n``fancy grade'' quality. To provide my colleagues with a sense of what \nthis means, I would note that in 1998, 78% of the apples produced in \nMaine were labeled as fancy grade.\n  Maine potato farmers also found themselves victims of weather-related \ndisasters in 1999. In Maine, some potato farmers found their fields \ncovered in as much as 15 inches of water following the drenching that \naccompanied Hurricane Floyd last fall. Because many of Maine's farmers \nleave their crop in storage over the winter, we did not realize the \nfull extent of the damage caused by Floyd's rains until this spring. \nMr. President, potato farmers pour their hearts and souls into their \nfields. It is profoundly disheartening to hear from a farmer who has \nlost an entire crop that took many months of hard work to cultivate.\n\n  The amendment Senator Levin and I offer today provides much-needed \nassistance to both potato and apple producers. Under our proposal, the \nSecretary of Agriculture would allocate $100 million in market loss \nassistance payments to our nation's apple producers. The market loss \npayments authorized by our amendment will help thousands of apple \ngrowers from Washington State to Michigan to Maine survive the losses \nthey have endured due to conditions beyond their control. This \namendment directs a modest amount of funds to producers who have \nreceived very little of the nearly $15 billion in emergency agriculture \nspending that we have passed this fiscal year.\n  Our amendment also directs the Secretary of Agriculture to provide \n$15 million in quality loss payments to apple and potato producers who \nsuffered losses as a result of a hurricane or other weather-related \ndisaster. This assistance will be important to those farmers who were \nunable to produce their finest product because of adverse weather \nconditions.\n  Mr. President, the provisions of our amendment are similar to \nlanguage in the House-passed version of the FY 2001 Agriculture \nAppropriations bill. The provisions recognize that potato and apple \nproducers, like other farmers across the country, are subject to the \nvagaries of international markets and the weather. I ask my colleagues \nto join us in providing assistance to our apple and potato producers in \ntheir time of need.\n  If anyone questions the emergency nature of this request, I would \nrefer them to a news story that ran on the evening news in Maine this \npast Tuesday. The segment focused on a long-time apple grower from \nAlfred, Maine. The grower, with much regret, has come to the conclusion \nthat after thirty-five years this will have to be his family's last \ncrop. The dwindling profits are not enough incentive for the next \ngeneration of the family to contend with the government regulations and \nuncertainty that comes with running an apple orchard. I encourage my \ncolleagues who missed this broadcast from Maine to read the story in \nTuesday's New York Times about the hardships being endured by apple \ngrowers in New York who watched hail storms this spring wipe out much \nof their crops. This amendment and the aid it represents is certainly \nan emergency to these producers.\n  Mr. President, the federal government must be a partner in our \nfarmer's efforts to feed America and much of the world. The Levin-\nCollins amendment ensures that our apple and potato producers get the \nhelp they need to overcome the difficulties of the past year and \ncontinue to produce a quality product. I urge my colleagues to support \nour amendment, and I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3933\n\n(Purpose: To provide relief for apple growers whose crops have suffered \n            extensive crop damage as a result of fireblight)\n\n       On page 2, lines 16 through 23, strike all after ``(b)'' \n     and insert,\n       ``Quality Loss Payments for Apples and Potatoes.--In \n     addition to the assistance provided under subsection (a), the \n     Secretary shall use $60,000,000 of funds of the Commodity \n     Credit Corporation to make payments to apple producers, and \n     potato producers, that suffered quality losses to the 1999 \n     and 2000 crop of potatoes and apples, respectively, due to, \n     or related to, a 1999 or 2000 hurricane, fireblight or other \n     weather related disaster.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3965\n\n  (Purpose: To ensure that nursery stock producers receive emergency \n   financial assistance for nursery stock losses caused by Hurricane \n                                 Irene)\n\n       At the apropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. ____.--In using amounts made available under section \n     801(a) of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug \n     Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2000 \n     (7 U.S.C. 1421 note; Public Law 106-78), or under the matter \n     under the heading ``crop loss assistance'' under the heading \n     ``Commodity Credit Corporation Fund'' of H.R. 3425 of the \n     106th Congress, as enacted by section 1001(a)(5) of Public \n     Law 106-113 (113 Stat. 1536, 1501A-289), to provide emergency \n     financial assistance to producers on a farm that have \n     incurred losses in a 1999 crop due to a disaster, the \n     Secretary of Agriculture shall consider nursery stock losses \n     caused by Hurricane Irene on October 16 and 17, 1999, to be \n     losses to the 1999 crop of nursery stock: Provided, That the \n     entire amount necessary to carry out this section shall be \n     available only to the extent that an official budget request \n     for the entire amount, that includes designation of the \n     entire amount of the request as an emergency requirement \n     under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act \n     of 1985 (2 U.S.C. 900 et seq.), is transmitted by the \n     President to Congress: Provided further, That the entire \n     amount necessary to carry out this section is designated by \n     Congress as an emergency requirement pursuant to section \n     251(b)(2)(A) of that Act (2 U.S.C. 901(b)(2)(A)).\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, Senator Mack and I offer this amendment \nthat will correct an injustice being done to nursery growers in south \nFlorida impacted by Hurricane Irene in October of 1999.\n  On October 15, Florida was hit with Hurricane Irene.\n  Following closely on the heels of Hurricane Floyd, a storm that \ncaused a disaster declaration in 13 states, Hurricane Irene dropped \nover nine inches of rainfall on average across Palm Beach, Broward, and \nMiami-Dade Counties.\n  Three-day rainfall totals at specific measuring sites throughout this \narea ranged between 10.88 and 17.47 inches.\n  Nineteen Florida counties received a major disaster declaration.\n  At the height of the storm, more than 1 million people lost power.\n  Agriculture losses from Hurricane Irene totaled over $438 million.\n  In total, seven deaths were attributed to Irene's visit to the \nFlorida coastline.\n\n[[Page S7354]]\n\n  Last year, Congress specifically provided $186 million in \n``additional resources for damage caused by hurricanes and other \nnatural disasters in Florida and other states'' under Title I--\nEmergency Supplemental Appropriations of the FY 2000 Omnibus \nAppropriations Act.\n  This crop loss assistance was provided in addition to the $1.2 \nbillion previously allocated under the Crop Disaster Program to respond \nto farmers who suffered losses due to ``adverse weather and related \nconditions.''\n  In executing this program, the Farm Service Agency (FSA) has made the \ndetermination that nursery, unlike other Florida crops damaged by \nHurricane Irene, will not be eligible for Crop Disaster Program \nassistance.\n  FSA indicates that nursery is ineligible because the program is \nlimited to losses in the 1999 crop year, and the hurricane damage \noccurred after the FSA-set 2000 crop year had begun.\n  The hurricane damage occurred on October 16-17, 1999, and the 2000 \nnursery crop year, according to FSA, began on October 1, 1999.\n  By all accounts, the FSA's crop year determination was made on an \narbitrary basis as nursery does not have a traditional crop year and \ncrops are grown on a year-round basis.\n  By contrast, the Risk Management Agency had a similar problem and \nmade a special dispensation for the nursery crop year to provide \neligibility for hurricane losses under the federal crop insurance \nprogram.\n  The Florida delegation has made a concerted attempt to work closely \nwith the Department since the hurricane damage occurred.\n  On December 9, 1999 FSA representatives briefed the Florida \ndelegation on disaster assistance available to Florida farmers, and we \nwere informed that Crop Disaster Program assistance would be available \nto respond to hurricane-related farm losses in Florida.\n  Today, it is still not available.\n  The amendment we offer today will ensure that nursery stock losses \ndue to Hurricane Irene will be eligible for relief under the Crop \nDisaster Program.\n  Mr. President, the intent of Congress was clear--that losses in \nFlorida due to natural disasters should be covered by the Crop Disaster \nProgram.\n  I hope that my colleagues will support our amendment that will \nprovide clear direction to the U.S. Department of Agriculture and \nensure that its actions meet the intent of Congress.\n  I urge its adoption.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3966\n\n (Purpose: To permit the enrollment of an additional 100,000 acres in \n                     the wetlands reserve program)\n\n       On page 85, after line 8, of Division B, as modified, add \n     the following:\n       Sec.   .

Mr. President, members of the Senate, I rise before you \ntoday with my colleague, Senator Mack, to offer an amendment to the \nAgriculture Appropriations bill on behalf of the Florida citrus \nindustry.\n  Mr. President, if ever there was an industry in crisis, this is it.\n  Since last year, the Florida citrus industry has been besieged by the \nravages of citrus canker.\n  Citrus canker is a disease that spreads rapidly through the air to \ninfect grove after grove after grove.\n  There is no cure.\n  Once a tree becomes infected, it must be burned to the ground to \nprevent further spreading.\n  As part of an ongoing effort to eradicate citrus canker, the Animal \nPlant and Health Inspection Service (APHIS) issued a regulation \nrequiring the destruction of all trees within a 1,900 foot radius of an \ninfected tree.\n  The result is that hundreds of healthy trees are burned to the \nground.\n  This government regulation is critical to eradication of citrus \ncanker, but it increases the number of trees that are destroyed.\n  To date, over 1,500 acres of limes and oranges, have been burned.\n  In response, both the Governor and the Secretary of Agriculture \ndeclared a state of emergency in Florida due to the citrus canker \noutbreak.\n  Once destroyed, it takes between three and four years for a citrus \ntree to reach maturity and produce its maximum capacity of fruit.\n  The growers whose healthy trees are destroyed by the federal \ngovernment are robbed of income today and income for the next three to \nfour years.\n  I believe that the destruction of the healthy trees in accordance \nwith federal regulation is in effect, a ``federal taking'' of private \nproperty for which Florida citrus producers should be compensated.\n  The Appropriations bill we are considering today provides the \nSecretary with authority to spend funds on compensation for growers who \nexperience losses due to citrus canker.\n  Our amendment would modify this language to mirror language in the \nHouse-passed Agriculture Appropriations bill which provides up to $40 \nmillion for compensation of growers for citrus canker losses.\n\n[[Page S7355]]\n\n  Our amendment ensures that Florida citrus growers whose trees are \ndestroyed as a result of federal regulation are able to receive \nappropriate compensation.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me in providing much needed \nassistance to an industry besieged by disease and severely impacted by \na federal regulation which, while well-intentioned and important to the \neradication of this disease, robs citrus growers of income from healthy \ntrees for a three to four year period.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3970\n\n       On page 76, strike lines 6 through 18 and insert in lieu \n     thereof:\n       ``For an additional amount for ``Salaries and Expenses'', \n     $59,400,000 to be available until September 30, 2001: \n     Provided, That this amount shall be used for the Boll weevil \n     eradication program for cost share purposes or for debt \n     retirement for active eradication zones: Provided, That the \n     entire amount shall be available only to the extent on \n     official budget request for $59,400,000, that includes \n     designation of the entire amount of the request as an \n     emergency requirement as defined in the Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended, is \n     transmitted by the President to the Congress: Provided \n     further, That the entire amount is designated by Congress as \n     an emergency requirement pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) of \n     such Act.''\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, during year 2000, the National Boll \nWeevil Eradication Program (BWEP) will have approximately 6.8 million \nacres under active eradication and treatments will be initiated on an \nadditional 832,000 acres, bringing the total acreage in active \neradication to 7.65 million acres. The states participating in \ntreatments currently are: Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, \nNew Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas.\n  By 2001 another 2 million acres will begin eradication, and at the \nsame time, eradication will be completed on about 1 million acres. Thus \nthe total acreage in active eradication in 2001 will increase to 8.8 \nmillion acres. The peak year for the high costs to the participants of \nthe eradication program will be in 2001.\n  Initially the BWEP operated on a 70/30 cost-share basis with the \ngrowers providing 70 percent through a pre-acre self-assessment \napproved by referendum and 30 percent provided through annual federal \nappropriations. Programs in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, \nGeorgia, Arizona and portions of Alabama and Florida were completed \nwith a 70/30 cost-share. As participating acreage rapidly expanded \nacross the cotton belt, the federal cost-share declined from 30 percent \nto about 4 percent in fiscal year 2000.\n  With the problems American agriculture is still facing with low \ncommodity prices, droughts, and flooding, the burden of this program at \na cost-share rate of 96/4 is jeopardizing the participation in the Boll \nWeevil Eradication Program nationwide.\n  This amendment, which I am offering today to the Fiscal Year 2001 \nAgricultural Appropriations bill, increases the Animal, Plant and \nHealth Inspection Service's salaries and expenses by $59,400,000. This \namendment includes an emergency declaration which requires the \nPresident to request the full amount before the monies are \nappropriated.\n  This additional appropriation will enable APHIS to increase federal \nfunding for is to increase the Boll Weevil Eradication Program by \n$59,400,000 for 2000. This amount is needed to provide a thirty percent \ncost-share to farmers participating in the program.

The question is on agreeing to the amendments \nen bloc.\n  The amendments, (Nos. 3457, 3933, 3965, 3966, 3967, 3968, 3969, 3970, \n3971, 3972, 3973, 3974, 3975, and 3976), en bloc, were agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I further ask consent that it not be in order in the \nSenate, for the remainder of the 106th Congress, to consider any bill \nor amendment that raises the level of emergency spending for \nagriculture above the level contained in this Agriculture \nappropriations bill as of the adoption of the above described \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank Senator Stevens for agreeing to \nthis amendment. I realize that there are legitimate emergencies, but I \nremind my colleagues that in the last 2 years we have had $16.6 billion \nof agricultural emergencies. This amendment does not guarantee that we \nare not going to have more. But it certainly strengthens the ability of \nthose who want to draw the line and say that enough is enough.\n  So I support this agreement. I thank Senator Stevens and Senator \nCochran.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank Senator Stevens as well. I thank \nSenator Cochran and others who helped craft this agreement--Senator \nKohl. Because the fact is, there are real disasters and real \nemergencies. In my State where, on June 12, 20 inches of rain fell in \n36 hours, 1 week later 8 inches of rain fell in 6 hours. It gave us \nthis headline in the biggest paper in our State: ``Swamped.'' It says \nit all. A disaster of stunning proportions costing hundreds of millions \nof dollars in the major city of our State--1.7 million acres of land, \nof cropland, devastated. This is an emergency. It is a disaster. It \nmust be addressed.\n  Through this amendment we will begin the process of healing. I thank \nall those who participated in this agreement.\n  I do want to answer the Senator from Texas when he says we have had \n$14 billion of emergencies in the last 2 years. The underlying reason \nis a failure----\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may we have order in the Chamber?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair, and I thank very much my colleague \nfrom West Virginia.\n  The reason we have had to have substantial emergency spending is \nbecause of the failure of the last farm bill. The last farm bill \nrepresents unilateral disarmament. While our major competitors, the \nEuropeans, are spending $50 billion a year to support their producers, \nwe, on average, were spending $10 billion under the previous farm bill. \nWe cut it in half on the notion that the Europeans would follow our \ngood example.\n  What a foolish tactic. We would never do that in a military \nconfrontation, engage in unilateral disarmament. But it is precisely \nwhat we did with respect to a trade confrontation.\n  Agriculture has been in deep trouble and we have responded. Congress, \nthe administration, and we thank our colleagues, for that response. But \nnow we have been hit by unprecedented natural disasters.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend. I want to get the \nSenate back to order.\n  I ask colleagues take conversations off the floor and take them to \nthe Cloakroom. Please take your conversations to the Cloakroom.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Again, I thank the courtesy of the Chair.\n  We have been hit by unprecedented natural disasters. This body has \nbeen generous in responding, whether it was in North Dakota or New \nMexico. I just hope we do not ever lose that generosity of spirit in \nthis country because none of us can predict who might be hit next.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank Senator Gramm for working on \nthis with me and the distinguished chairman of the Agriculture \nCommittee and all those who helped put an agreement together, including \nTed Stevens, Senator Stevens, and those who helped him. I really \nbelieve the discussion tonight was a very good one. Whether or not it \nmeans anything in the weeks and months to come, who knows? But, \nfrankly, I am fully aware in that list there are some items that are \nreally natural disasters, or disasters of one sort or another that we \nwould compensate for. I just believe that at some point or another in \nthe field of agriculture, and on the agricultural bill, at some point \nin time adding\n\n[[Page S7357]]\n\nemergencies has to kind of end. I submit there would be more than this \nif it would be 2 weeks from now when the agricultural bill came up.\n\n  That is my point. I really have a lot of faith and confidence in Thad \nCochran and his minority ranking member. But I frankly believe sooner \nor later we ought to just face up and add to the budget and not \ncontinue to add emergencies when they are not emergencies. And \ncertainly many of them were. I did not have a chance to look at it \nthoroughly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I regret to tell my friend from Texas--I have told him \ninformally, but I will tell him formally now--we have a staggering \ndisaster going on in Alaska right now. It is the total collapse of the \nfish runs in the Yukon and Kuskokwim Rivers that sustain a substantial \nnumber of our native villages. If this is not in this bill now, it \nmight come in in conference, but it is going to come up sometime before \nthis year is out. I just want to put the Senate on notice. I was \ntalking here about the agriculture items that are in this bill now. But \nI do not feel bound not to represent my State later, in terms of trying \nto protect these people who live in rural Alaska.\n  I talked today to James Lee Witt who is the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency Director. He told me the President had asked him to \nwork with all existing agencies to try to find out what could be done \nunder existing law and with existing funds to deal with a disaster that \nis taking place as we speak. We will not know, probably, until we come \nback in September, what will be required. But we do expect to have some \nsubstantial problems with this disaster within the coming 5 or 6 weeks.\n  I hope my friend understands what I am saying to him. In this \nagreement we just made, that, to me, does not include the fisheries \ndisaster that is going on now in Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I want to thank Senators Cochran and Kohl for staying with \nthis issue for those of us who represent States with true disasters, \ntrue emergencies, that were not represented in the bill as it came to \nthe Senate. We have had the worst outbreak of fire blight in our apple \nindustry in the history of the State of Michigan. Our Governor has \nrequested that Secretary of Agriculture Glickman grant a disaster \ndesignation for seven counties in Michigan that have been afflicted by \nfire blight.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this request be printed in the Record \nalong with two newspaper articles.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                State of Michigan,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                       Lansing, MI, June 30, 2000.\n\n Governor Requests Disaster Designation for Fruit Growers in South and \n                           Southwest Michigan\n\n       Governor John Engler announced today that he has requested \n     a United States Department of Agriculture Disaster \n     Designation for fruit growers in South and Southeast \n     Michigan.\n       Fruit trees in that region suffered from a very severe \n     storm that brought hail, high winds and heavy rain on May 18.\n       That severe weather caused small wounds and scars on the \n     leaves, limbs, and fruit of apple, cherry, apricot, plum, \n     pear and peach trees. In the case of apples and pears, these \n     wounds allowed the bacteria known as fire blight to enter the \n     tree. This bacteria quickly infects the limbs, killing the \n     leaves and fruit, eventually making its way into the roots, \n     killing the entire tree.\n       It is estimated that over 2,000 acres of apple trees in the \n     counties of Allegan, Berrien, Branch, Cass, Hillsdale, \n     Kalamazoo and Van Buren are dead or dying, with another 5,400 \n     acres showing severe symptoms of this insidious disease. This \n     is the area to be covered by Governor Engler's disaster \n     designation request.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                State of Michigan,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                       Lansing, MI, June 29, 2000.\n     Hon. Dan Glickman,\n     Secretary of Agriculture, Administration Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Glickman: A natural disaster has occurred in \n     Michigan that will result in production and physical losses \n     in fruit crops and fruit trees for the year 2000. Consistent \n     with USDA policy, I am hereby alerting you within the \n     required 90 day time period that such a condition exists.\n       The month of May was wet and humid throughout Southwest \n     Michigan. More than five inches of rain fell in May alone and \n     15 days in May saw relative humidity above 80%. On top of \n     this weather, a severe thunderstorm hit the area on May 18, \n     2000, bringing high winds very heavy rain, and hail. This \n     storm caused severe damage to fruit trees and the fruit crop \n     in the region. This damage was exacerbated when a bacterium, \n     fire blight, took hold in apple and pear trees. This fire \n     blight infection was directly related to the May 18, 2000, \n     storm inasmuch as the hard rain and hail scarred and wounded \n     the leaves, limbs and fruit of apple and pear trees, creating \n     an avenue for the fire blight disease to enter the trees.\n       The following counties were affected: Allegan, Berrien, \n     Branch, Cass, Hillsdale, Kalamzaoo, Van Buren.\n       This disaster affected apples, sweet and tart cherries, \n     apricots, plums, pears and peaches. Only apples and pears \n     were affected by the resulting fire blight.\n       Damage assessment information will be forwarded to your \n     office by the Michigan Farm Service Agency as soon as it \n     available. Thank you for your attention to this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      John Engler,\n                                                         Governor.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. We are always the No. 2 or No. 3 state in terms of apple \nproduction. Every year we vie with New York for who comes in second \nafter the State of Washington. But our apple industry has suffered \nmajor devastation in southwestern Michigan. We have had the largest \nproblem with fire blight in the history of our State. It is a true \ndisaster. It seems to me some people just look at the whole and ignore \nthe parts. They also have a responsibility of looking at the parts. Our \npart was a disaster which we addressed in the form of an amendment \nproviding relief on June 19. Senator Collins and 12 bipartisan \ncosponsors joined this amendment. I thank them very much for their \nassistance. We cover potatoes as well as apples because there has been \nan honest to goodness disaster emergency amongst potato growers as \nwell.\n  I once again, thank the managers of this bill. I know how difficult \nthis is. Those of us who represent States that had emergencies that \nwere not reflected in the bill, as it came to the Senate, counted on \nthe managers and our colleagues to do justice for our emergencies in \nthe same way this bill, as it came to the Senate, addressed emergencies \nin other States.\n  We are deeply grateful to the managers. We thank Senator Stevens and \nothers who were able to work out this agreement so our true disaster \ncould be taken care of.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Mississippi and \nthe Senator from Wisconsin, and others, including the Senator from \nAlaska and my colleagues who have agreed to a compromise.\n  The history of disaster aid in this Congress is well over a century \nold. This is not a new issue. For well over a century, Congress has \ndealt with the issue of disasters that have occurred in some parts of \nthis country.\n  I am proud of supporting disaster aid for areas of this country that \nsuffer earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods, and tornadoes. In the \ncase of the fires that recently ravaged and injured so many people and \ntheir property in New Mexico, I am proud to say that I wanted us to \nhelp them, and we did. I am proud to say I helped the folks in Los \nAngeles who were flattened by earthquakes, and the folks in Texas who \nhave been injured by drought.\n  It is one of those areas of public spending where I say it is the \nbest this country has to offer. When a region of this country, when its \npeople are flat on their backs from causes that they could not control, \nthis Congress extends its hand and says to them: You are not alone. We \nwant to help you. We have a long tradition of doing that, and I am \nproud of that tradition.\n  In North Dakota, as my colleague indicated, late one night in June, \nseveral thunderstorms converged together and then did not move. In a \nState that gets 17 inches of rainfall in a year, in one spot they \nreceived 18 to 20 inches in 36 hours. Think of that. About a week and a \nhalf later, the Red River Valley, land that is dead flat, flat as a \ntable top, received 8 inches of rain in 6 hours. They were flooded. Up \nto 1.7 million acres of farmland that people planted in the spring with \nthe sweat of their brow and risked their money to plant were either \ndestroyed or severely damaged.\n\n[[Page S7358]]\n\n  We ask Congress to recognize that this, too, is a natural disaster \nfor those producers and people who live in those areas. That is what \nthis is about. None of us in this Chamber should ever be bashful about \nsaying there are people in need in this country, and when that need \nexists because of causes they did not control or could not control--\nfires, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods--then we should respond.\n  It represents the very best impulse, in my judgment, of this body. \nThat is what this debate is about. From our standpoint, it is \nespecially about family farmers. As I said earlier today, they are some \nof the best in this country. They risk their money. They hope for a \ngood crop. So many things are beyond their control. Then they discover \nthat late one night a hailstorm comes through, and the crops are \ndevastated; or a flood inundates their crops; or a drought dries them \nup; or the insects come and eat them out; or disease comes and their \ncrop is gone. That is what this is about.\n  Mr. President, those tonight who worked for a solution to add some \nemergency funding to this piece of legislation have done those in need \nin this country a service. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are getting to a point where we are \nwinding down on this bill. We have several more amendments, probably \nless than five. Some of those will be disposed of with the managers' \ngood work. I think we should take a few minutes to see where we are. \nTherefore, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3980\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin], for himself, Mrs. \n     Boxer, and Mr. Harkin, proposes an amendment numbered 3980.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the consideration of \nthis amendment, which is not on the unanimous consent----\n  Mr. LOTT. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, I \nknow a lot of Senators on both sides are wondering about the \nproceedings at this time. I understand there are at least a couple of \namendments that may take a few minutes. And then, of course, we are not \nsure at this point whether they would require a recorded vote or not, \nand then final passage.\n  We still hope to get an agreement that would allow us to go to the \nmarriage penalty tonight, and have an hour of debate on that, and then \ncontinue on that tomorrow. And beyond that, we will have to get an \nagreement worked out.\n  I urge my colleagues to, if they will, agree to time limits and \ncooperate with the managers as much as they can. We need to finish this \nbill in the next 30 minutes, if we can, and get an agreement on how we \nproceed for the rest of tonight, tomorrow, and Monday.\n  So I withdraw my reservation. And I thank Senator Durbin for allowing \nme to do that at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is in order.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To clarify the effect of the provision prohibiting amendment \n         of part 3809 of title 43, Code of Federal Regulations)\n\n       In section 3102, after the first sentence insert the \n     following: ``This section does not limit the authority of the \n     Secretary to promulgate final rules, or to revise or amend \n     subpart 3809 of title 43, Code of Federal Regulations, so as \n     to require full financial assurance of reclamation of mining \n     sites to protect the taxpayers from the actions of hardrock \n     mining operations that cause damage to or destruction of \n     public land; to prevent environmental destruction that unduly \n     threatens fish or wildlife habitat; and to prevent pollution \n     that threatens public health or the environment.''.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, section 3102 of the Agriculture \nappropriations bill does not address the production of food and fiber \nin America. It does not address any jurisdiction of the Department of \nAgriculture. It is a provision which has been added to this bill which \nrelates directly to hard rock mining in the United States, which is \nunder the jurisdiction of the Department of the Interior.\n  I might say, parenthetically, I found it very interesting listening \nto this debate on the Ag appropriations bill, and considering some of \nthe comments that have been made on the Senate floor in the past year \nabout limiting the subject matter of amendments and the substance of \nlegislation.\n  If we can consider an Amtrak amendment on the Ag appropriations bill, \nand if we can consider an amendment on hard rock mining on the Ag \nappropriations bill, then those who come before us and say we have to \nhave purity in the amendments we are offering and considering on the \nbill should remember this particular debate.\n  I was surprised to find that a point of order on a motion to strike, \nbased on that point of order, would not stand because of what I \nconsider to be a very thin connection to some language in the House \nappropriations bill. But the Parliamentarian advised me of that. I \nunderstand that is going to be the rule of the day around here. I \nsuppose that is what we will play by. I am sure each side will find an \nadvantage and disadvantage associated with that interpretation.\n  Allow me to address the amendment before us, and to try to do it in a \nvery concise way, knowing that everyone has waited a long time. I have \nwaited for 8\\1/2\\ hours to offer this amendment.\n  Let me say at the outset, we are dealing with the hard rock mining \nindustry. An effort is being made, with the language in this \nAgriculture appropriations bill, to stop the Department of the Interior \nfrom issuing new regulations to make sure that this industry follows \nthe best practices to protect the taxpayers of this country and the \nenvironment.\n  To put it in perspective, just this May the Environmental Protection \nAgency released its Toxics Release Inventory report. It identified the \nhard rock mining industry in the United States as our Nation's largest \ntoxic polluter.\n  The mining industry released 3.5 billion pounds of toxic pollution in \n1998. I will repeat that. The mining industry released 3.5 billion \npounds of toxic pollution in 1998. Almost half of all of the toxic \npollution in America comes from this industry, which is being protected \nby this amendment in the Agriculture appropriations bill.\n  The U.S. Bureau of Mines has identified 12,000 miles of American \nstreams and 180,000 acres of American lakes polluted by mining. The EPA \nhas listed 27 hard rock mines as Superfund sites. It is time for us to \nupdate the 19-year-old regulations that protect public lands managed by \nthe BLM from the environmental impact of hard rock mining.\n  These regulations, commonly referred to as 3809 regulations, help the \nBLM comply with Federal land policy. They direct the Secretary of the \nInterior to ``take any action necessary to prevent unnecessary or undue \ndegradation on the federal lands.''\n\n  Since these regulations were first promulgated in 1981, the whole \nhard rock mining industry has changed in America. New technologies have \nallowed the industry to expand tenfold. New exploration techniques have \nresulted in capabilities unknown 20 years go. Larger excavation \nequipment allows ores to be mined from larger and deeper pits and has \nmade open-pit mining feasible in areas where it would not have been \nfeasible before.\n  Just as the mining industry has modernized, so too should the \nregulations that protect the environment and the taxpayers. Those who \nwould put this amendment in this bill are stopping the modernization of \nthose regulations designed to protect public lands, the environment, \nand the taxpayers.\n  As I explain one aspect of this, you will understand that the \nprovision in this particular section of the Ag bill will result in \nliterally hundreds of millions of dollars, if not billions of dollars, \nof liability to the taxpayers of today and tomorrow.\n  The need to update these regulations has been recognized a long time. \nThe BLM established a task force in 1989 to look them over. President \nBush expected it to be done in short order, and it still has not \nhappened.\n  There has been a steady stream of reports. This is, as best we can \ntell--this\n\n[[Page S7359]]\n\nrider introduced by Senators Murkowski and Craig--the fifth attempt in \n4 years to block the Department of the Interior from implementing \nstronger environmental regulations on hard rock mining.\n  Last year, there was a compromise. The compromise said we are not \njust going to give this assignment to the Department of Interior. We \nare going to give it to a group, the National Research Council, that is \nassociated with the National Academy of Sciences and ask them to come \nup with recommendations for new regulations on this industry to protect \nthe environment. In fact, what this particular rider does, this \nenvironmental rider on this Ag bill, is to stop the implementation of \nmost of the recommendations that came forward from the National \nResearch Council.\n  Let me tell the Senate why we need stronger regulations. First, any \ngroup that starts to mine on these public lands usually has to post a \nbond. It is a financial assurance that their activities on these lands \nwill not in any way destroy the environment, and that ultimately the \nland will be reclaimed and the stabilization and vegetation of the land \nwill be restored. Sadly, in many instances, these hard rock mining \ncompanies will post bonds that are literally worthless, corporate \nbonds, for example, and when the company goes bankrupt, they are of no \nvalue or little value at all. I will give a few examples a little later \non of where these bonds have failed us and we have found the taxpayers \nholding the bag.\n  Reclamation bonds are meant to ensure that companies do not declare \nbankruptcy and leave taxpayers responsible for the cleanup bill. The \ncurrent bonding requirements don't work. In example after example, in \nIdaho, in Montana, in South Dakota, we find that these companies have \ngone bankrupt, the bonds don't cover the expenses, and the taxpayers \nend up holding the bag. The recommendation from the National Research \nCouncil, which I hold here, was that we change that assurance, that \nfinancial assurance to protect the taxpayers. This environmental rider \nstops that reform. It makes certain that the taxpayers don't have that \nprotection.\n  A recent study by the National Wildlife Federation and the Center for \nScience and Public Participation found that American taxpayers are \nfacing as much as $1.1 billion in liability for restoring hard rock \nmines in the Western U.S. because current reclamation bonding \nregulations are inadequate. In Nevada alone, as of 1999, 13 mines have \ngone bankrupt. As of May 2000, at least 29 mines are bankrupt. Most of \nthese mines were bonded by corporate guarantees. Just one single mine, \nthe Yerington mine, could cost American taxpayers up to $40 to $80 \nmillion to clean up. The effort to put real bonding requirements in the \nlaw to protect the taxpayers and the environment will be stopped by \nthis environmental rider.\n  Also, there is a question of environmental performance standards. \nThese standards have to be adjusted to reflect modern mining practices. \nLet me give an example. One technique that is now being used, heap \nleaching, is increasingly common. Millions of tons of ore are extracted \nand piled in heaps on lined pads often hundreds of feet high. This post \nillustrates what I am discussing. To give Senators an idea of what we \nare talking about, this is a hard rock mining site. To put it in \nperspective, we can barely see this tiny dot down here, a large over-\nthe-road truck, to give an idea of the heaps of ore. Under the heap \nleaching process, a cyanide solution for gold or silver or sulfuric \nacid for copper is sprayed in open air over the pile so that ultimately \nit will leach the mineral from the ore. As I said earlier, it is this \nuse of cyanide and sulfuric acid that has led to hard rock mining being \nthe No. 1 toxic polluter in the United States of America.\n\n  The mining industry has released 3.5 billion pounds of toxic \npollution in 1998. In addition, we have to say that many of these \nagencies, like BLM and the Forest Service, need to have the right to \ndeny mining in highly sensitive areas, particularly areas that are \nadjacent to national forests, national parks, and populated areas where \nthey can cause great damage.\n  Let me tell my colleagues about one particular mine as an example, \nthe Zortman-Landusky mine in Montana. The Zortman-Landusky mine is \nlocated in the Little Rocky Mountains of north central Montana. ZL is \nan open-pit mine, one of the world's first large-scale cyanide heap \nleach gold mines and the largest gold mine in Montana when operations \nbegan in 1979. Lack of standards on pad construction allowed the \ncompany to overload its leach pads leading to cyanide releases in the \nnearby streams and potential health problems for the local communities. \nThe Canadian Pacific company, Pegasus Gold, Incorporated, that owned \nthe mine, went bankrupt in 1998. It left a bond to protect the damage \nit had created in the amount of $61.9 million. The actual cleanup cost \nfor this site is estimated at approximately $70 million, leaving nearly \n$8.6 million to be picked up by the taxpayers.\n  I would like to read for you for a moment a comment not from an \nenvironmental group, not from some eastern group of tree huggers, if \nyou will, but from the Daily Missoulian. This is an editorial, Sunday, \nAugust 29, 1999, Missoula, MT. Referring to this particular mine, in \ntheir editorial entitled ``Miners Offer Regulators Some Hard Lessons \nfrom Montana''--my friends, the Western States where these mines are \nlocated:\n\n       Pegasus' bankruptcy has been an eye-opening experience for \n     State regulators. Among the lessons learned:\n       It's a mistake to assume the companies that develop mines \n     will stay around--or even exist--when it comes time to clean \n     the mines up.\n       Reclamation plans that presume miners will reclaim their \n     own mines understate the actual cost when miners go out of \n     business or skip out. Everything becomes more expensive when \n     the state has to hire contractors for the work.\n\n  The third lesson directly impacts the environmental rider which we \nare considering on this bill:\n\n       Reclamation bonds required to insure cleanup may not be \n     worth as much as expected. At least some of the insurance \n     companies that issue reclamation bonds would rather fight \n     than pay, forcing the state to rack up legal expenses or \n     accept lesser settlements.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       Look hard around the state [of Montana], and you won't find \n     a single example of a large-scale hard-rock mine successfully \n     reclaimed.\n       Taxpayers and the environment aren't the only losers when \n     the reclamation plants go awry. Miners haven't done their \n     industry any favors, either. Mining is controversial enough, \n     even when people focus on jobs and profits. Leaving citizens \n     in the State with big messes and big bills to pay after the \n     mines play out is a good way to wear out your welcome.\n\n  Incidentally, in this same Missoula, MT, editorial, they go on to \npraise the coal mining in the State which has modernized its practices \nand is considered more responsible by these editorial writers.\n  Because the hour is late, I will not go through the five or six \nexamples that I have of mines in Idaho, in South Dakota, which have \nliterally been abandoned because of bankruptcy, leaving the taxpayers \nholding the bag for millions, almost $1 billion in liability.\n\n  This environmental rider stops the Department from coming up with \nmeaningful bonds. Quite honestly, it means that those who exploit \npublic lands and leave an environmental mess behind and threats to the \npublic health frankly make a fool out of Uncle Sam and American \ntaxpayers. That is what this environmental rider does.\n  I say to my colleagues in the Senate, as I close, what I am offering \nin this amendment is as follows: We should give the Bureau of Land \nManagement and the Department of the Interior the authority to \npromulgate rules which will require full financial assurance of \nreclamation of mining sites. I state specifically the goals that we are \nseeking: To protect the taxpayers from the actions of hard rock mining \noperations that cause damage to or destruction of public lands, to \nprevent environmental destruction that unduly threatens fish or \nwildlife habitat, and to prevent toxic pollution that threatens public \nhealth or the environment.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Will the Senator respond to a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to respond.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I represent a western gold mining State. I have just \nreturned recently from examining the Brohm site in the beautiful Black \nHills of South Dakota where the Brohm Mining Company has gone bankrupt \nwith approximately a $5 million bond. That site has now been declared a \nSuperfund\n\n[[Page S7360]]\n\nsite. It is now going to cost the Federal taxpayers approximately $27 \nmillion because of the inadequacy of the bond at this site. It is going \nto cost the taxpayers of the State of South Dakota in perpetuity tens \nof millions of dollars to monitor the streams and the environment \naround that bankrupt site.\n  Is the Senator telling us that without the amendment he is offering \nhere, we will continue to see these inadequate bonds and these costs \nbeing shifted to the taxpayers to pick up the cost of mining \ncompanies--oftentimes foreign mining companies--that have spoiled our \nland and then walk on?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from South Dakota is absolutely correct. I \nthink it is important that a Senator from a State where this mining is \ntaking place has come to share this story. This is not just testimony \npresented by environmental groups. These are the real-life \ncircumstances of people in Western States, where the mining is taking \nplace, who are left with a mess when the mines go bankrupt.\n  This environmental rider stops us from revising and reforming the \nfinancial assurance language and requiring bonds of companies that \nliterally will protect the communities and the taxpayers and families \naround these mining sites. That is what it is all about. That is the \nbottom line.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues in the Senate. I have waited for \na long time to offer this. I will not belabor it. I hope they will join \nme in passing this amendment, which will establish standards which I \nthink are reasonable to make sure this industry can continue but only \nin a responsible way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I support the amendment offered by Mr. \nDurbin to amend Section 3102 of the Agriculture Appropriation bill.\n  Section 3102 is the latest edition in a series of riders that have \nprevented the Clinton Administration from reforming hardrock mining on \npublic lands by putting in place sound environmental and fiscal \nprotections. In past debates, proponents of these riders have argued \nthat the hardrock mining industry has reformed its ways. They \nacknowledge that mining companies have made mistakes in the past. How \ncould they not? The facts are overwhelming: More than 300,000 acres of \nfederal lands have not been reclaimed. There are more than 2,000 \nabandoned mines in national parks. There are 59 Superfund sites at \nformer mines across the country. The Mineral Policy Center estimates \nthat the cleanup costs for abandoned mines on public and private lands \nmay reach $72 billion. But after acknowledging this legacy of \nenvironmental damage, the proponents of these riders argue it is the \nresult of decisions made 50 or 60 years ago--before we knew better--\nbefore we understood that there a limits to what the environment can \nwithstand. They tells us that a new environmental consciousness, \nsensitivity and awareness have taken root in the industry, and today's \nmines are safe because they utilize modern technology and practices.\n  This is an important point, Mr. President. It deserves a response. \nI'm not out to punish the mining industry for mistakes of the past. I \nrecognize that the mining industry has made improvements and that not \nall mining operations result in environmental disaster. The March 2000 \nNational Geographic has an excellent article on the hardrock mining \nindustry. It discusses the history of the mining in the West, its \ncultural heritage, its economic contribution, and its unfortunate \nlegacy of environmental ruin. It also talks about some of the new \nefforts underway to lessen mining's impact on the environment. It \ndescribes Homestake Mining Company's McLaughlin gold mine near Lower \nLake, California as a safe mine. The McLaughlin operation recycles and \ncontains all processed water, the 600-acre tailings pond will \neventually be converted into wetlands, and a monitoring system watches \nfor contamination of ground water. Sierra Club and the Mineral Policy \nCenter--two groups sharply and appropriately critical of mining \noperations--have praised this operation. Homestake's environmental \nmanager at the site told National Geographic that, ``When you look at \nthe total environmental cost, it's roughly 2 percent of our capital \ncosts for the whole project. We want to protect the our stockholders' \ninvestment. Creating an environmental liability doesn't serve their \ninterests or ours.''\n  I am confident that McLaughlin is not the only operation that is \nworking and caring for the land, but it's just not true to say that the \nentire industry is reformed. There are bad actors and mistakes happen, \nand that is why we need tougher standards.\n  I urge my colleagues to look at the record of the Hecla Mining \nCompany's Grouse Creek Mine in the Salmon-Challis National Forest in \nIdaho. The Grouse Creek Mine opened in 1994 with great expectations. It \nwas precisely the kind of operation we've heard about on the \nSenate floor: a new mine operated under a new environmental ethic, and \npresumably an example of why we don't need tougher protections. In \nAugust 1995, Mr. Michael White, the Vice President and General Counsel \nof the Hecla Mining Company, testified before the Senate that, ``The \nGrouse Creek Mine is a state-of-the-art facility and has been \nconstructed not only to meet, but to exceed, existing environmental \nrequirements.'' Mr. White continued, ``For example, road improvements \nthat included sediment catch basins actually reduced sediment impact to \nJordan Creek compared to preexisting conditions.'' Let me be clear: Mr. \nWhite promised us a state-of-the-art facility that would exceed \nexisting environmental requirements, and he went even further to \npromise that the Grouse Creek Mine would actually improve the \nenvironment by reducing the sediment runoff into Jordan Creek. Hecla's \nchairman, Arthur Brown, said in 1995 of Grouse Creek that, ``Minimizing \nthe environmental impact is a strong focus of Hecla.'' A Hecla company \nspokeswoman said in 1995, ``We believe that we need to take care of the \nland we are using; it's just good stewardship.'' The former Governor of \nIdaho, Cecil Andrus added his praise, saying ``Hecla has met every \nrequirement we've asked of them. I can show you a thousand sins of the \npast that we need to clean up but modern mining is a plus.'' And the \naccolades continued: The Idaho Department of Lands nominated the mine \nfor an award, and Hecla employees were honored by the US Department of \nAgriculture for their environmental work.\n\n  It is now only 6 years latter, and Grouse Creek is an environmental \ndisaster. In 1996--only two years after the mine opened-- the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency fined Hecla $85,000 for violating its \nwastewater permit. EPA found cyanide and mercury discharges that \nexceeded their limits by more than five times the allowed levels for \nover a year, and the mine was cited for excessive sediment discharge \ninto Jordan Creek. In April 1999, Idaho officials found cyanide leaking \ninto a stream that is habitat for the endangered chinook salmon, \nsteelhead trout and bull trout. The cyanide levels were more than 12 \ntimes the concentrations at which chronic exposure harms fish. The \nenvironmental legacy of the now-closed mine is a tailings impoundment \nholding 450 million gallons of cyanide-laced water and 4.3 million tons \nof heavy metals. Can you imagine? The General Counsel of Hecla, Michael \nSmith, actually testified before the Senate in 1995 that the mine would \nactually improve the environmental quality of Jordan Creek. Within less \nthan five years the operation was cited for loading Jordan Creek with \nexcessive sediments and cyanide. The fiscal legacy is just as bad. A \nMay editorial in the Idaho Falls Post Register reports that Hecla may \nwalk away from the environmental mess it has created if the cost of \ncleanup exceeds $28 million. Before opening the mine, Hecla was only \nrequired to put up a bond of $7 million, and the company reported $120 \nmillion in losses before closing the mine. Maybe Hecla will reclaim the \nland, maybe it won't--it's too early to judge that issue--but clearly a \nsystem that allows part of a national forest to be turned into a toxic \nwaste site, and leaves us negotiating cleanup, is in need of reform. \nAnd, Mr. President, more importantly, this didn't happen 50 years ago \nor 60 years ago. It happen 6 years ago.\n  Grouse Creek isn't the only unfortunate example of the ``modern'' \nmining industry's environmental troubles. The Phelps Dodge Mining \nCorporation's Chino copper mine near Santa Rita, New Mexico has dumped \nmore than 180 million gallons of contaminated wastewater into \nWhitewater Creek since 1987. In 1990, rainwater flushed 324,000\n\n[[Page S7361]]\n\ngallons of wastewater out of the Ray Complex mine site and into the \nGila River in Arizona. Shortly after opening in 1986 the Summitville \ngold mine in southern Colorado began leaking cyanide, acid and heavy \nmetals into 17 miles of the Alamosa River. Its owner is now bankrupt, \nthe mine closed and the land has been declared a Superfund site.\n  We need reform. Today's debate is not about sins of the past or \npunishing the mining industry. It is about ending a system that sells \npublic land for as little as $2.50 per acre. A system that has allowed \nmore than $240 billion worth of minerals to be excavated from public \nlands and does not collect a cent in royalties. A system that, despite \nall the excuses and promises, continues to allow the land to be \ndamaged. We should not have to depend on the goodwill of the mining \nindustry to protect public land--the rules should be clear, they should \nbe strong and they should be enforced. American citizens should not \ncarry the burden of fiscal and environmental irresponsibility.\n  I thank Senator Durbin for moving to amend the hardrock mining rider. \nI urge other my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, under rule XVI of the Senate, this is \nlegislation on an appropriations bill. I raise a point of order against \nit.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I raise the defense of germaneness, and I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The Chair submits to the Senate the question, Is the amendment \ngermane?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have two amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have two amendments, one of which I am \nnot going to offer.\n  I have an amendment which establishes the Trade Injury Compensation \nAct of 2000. This measure is identical to my bill, S. 2709, which \nenjoys wide bipartisan support by my fellow members of Senate Beef \nCaucus and has already been referred to the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee.\n  The Trade Injury Compensation Act establishes a Beef Industry \nCompensation Trust Fund to help the United States cattle industry \nwithstand the European Union's illegal ban on beef treated with \nhormones.\n  Over a year ago, the World Trade Organization endorsed retaliation \nwhen the EU refused to open to American beef. Since that time, the EU \nhas continued to stall in its compliance which is frankly, outrageous. \nFor over a decade we've fought the beef battle. Now its time to try \nsomething new to help producers who continue to be injured by the ban.\n  The Trade Injury Compensation Act establishes a mechanism for using \nthe tariffs imposed on the EU to directly aid U.S. beef producers. \nNormally, the additional tariff revenues received from retaliation go \nto the Treasury. This bill establishes a trust fund so that the \naffected industry will receive those revenues as compensation for its \ninjury.\n  Mr. President, my amendment creates a fund which provides assistance \nto United States beef producers to improve the quality of beef produced \nin the United States; and provides assistance to United States beef \nproducers in market development, consumer education, and promotion of \nthe beef industry in overseas markets.\n  The Secretary of the Treasury shall cease the transfer of funds \nequivalent to the duties on the beef retaliation list only when the \nEuropean Union complies with the World Trade Organization ruling \nallowing United States beef producers access to the European market.\n  In a perfect world we would not need this amendment because the \nEuropean Union would abide by its international trade commitments. And \nit is still my hope that the European Union simply comply with the WTO \nDispute Settlement rulings and allow our beef to enter its borders.\n  Mr. President, the WTO is a critically important institution that \nsets the foundation and framework to make world trade grow.\n  We all recognize that it needs improvement, and I, along with many of \nmy colleagues, are working on ways to fix it. We must bring credibility \nand compliance to the system. The Trade Injury Compensation Act will \ngive some relief to our producers as we strive toward this endeavor.\n  Mr. President, I realize that we still have work to do in perfecting \nthis amendment. That is why I appreciate my colleague Senator Lugar's \ncommitment to allow an Agriculture Subcommittee hearing on this bill in \nSeptember.\n  In light of that impending hearing, I will not offer the amendment at \nthis time.\n  Time is of the essence for our producers who have been injured by the \nEuropean Union. I look forward to this hearing and further expeditious \naction in this matter.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3981\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Baucus] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3981.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To direct the Secretary of the Army to conduct a restudy of \nthe project for navigation, Manteo (Shallowbag) Bay, North Carolina, to \nevaluate alternatives to the authorized inlet stabilization project at \n                             Oregon Inlet)\n\n       Strike section 3104 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 3104. STUDY OF OREGON INLET, NORTH CAROLINA, NAVIGATION \n                   PROJECT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Army, shall have \n     conducted, and submited to Congress, a restudy of the project \n     for navigation, Manteo (Shallowbag)\n\n[[Page S7362]]\n\n     Bay, North Carolina, authorized by section 101 of the River \n     and Harbor Act of 1970 (84 Stat. 1818), to evaluate all \n     reasonable alternatives, including nonstructural \n     alternatives, to the authorized inlet stabilization project \n     at Oregon Inlet.\n       (b) Required Elements.--In carrying out subsection (a), the \n     Secretary of the Army shall--\n       (1) take into account the views of affected interests; and\n       (2)(A) take into account objectives in addition to \n     navigation, including--\n       (i) complying with the policies of the State of North \n     Carolina regarding construction of structural measures along \n     State shores; and\n       (ii) avoiding or minimizing adverse impacts to, or \n     benefiting, the Cape Hatteras National Seashore and the Pea \n     Island National Wildlife Refuge; and\n       (B) develop options that meet those objectives.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this amendment has been agreed to by my \ngood friend, the ever gracious senior Senator from North Carolina.\n  The amendment strikes the provision in the bill that transfers \nportions of the Cape Hatteras National Seashore and the Pea Island \nNational Wildlife Refuge from the Department of the Interior to the \nArmy Corps of Engineers. It also requires the Army Corps to conduct a \nstudy within 180 days of alternatives, including nonstructural \nalternatives, to the currently authorized inlet stabilization project \nat Oregon Inlet. This study would have to take into account objectives \nin addition to navigation, such as the policies of the State of North \nCarolina regarding construction of structural measures along the coast \nand minimizing adverse impacts to the national seashore and the \nwildlife refuge. Most importantly, the study would have to develop \nrecommendations to meet those objectives. I hope this study will \nprovide a sound basis on which Congress can resolve this issue.\n  I believe this amendment will be fair to the people of North Carolina \nand also to the American taxpayers.\n  The senior Senator from North Carolina has been very helpful in \nworking out this amendment. I appreciate his efforts.\n  Mr. President, to reiterate, my amendment would replace section 3104 \nof the bill, which transfers land from the Interior Department of the \nCorps of Engineers in order to circumvent environmental rules and \npromote the construction of a system of jetties at Oregon Inlet in \nNorth Carolina.\n  Some background about the Oregon Inlet project.\n  At the outset, let me acknowledge the obvious. I'm no expert about \nOregon Inlet.\n  Senator Helms is. He has been working on this issue for at least 30 \nyears.\n  I am simply trying to react to an appropriations rider by mustering \nthe facts as well as I can.\n  Oregon Inlet is on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, near Roanoke \nIsland. It is the only inlet between Cape Henry, Virginia, 45 miles to \nthe north and Cape Hatteras, 85 miles to the south.\n  Like much of the Outer Banks, the Inlet is a dynamic ecosystem, with \nhigh waves, swift currents, and a rapidly shifting sandbar at the mouth \nof the Inlet.\n  Make no mistake. It is treacherous water. Between 1965 and 1995, more \nthan 20 ships sank or ran aground, with the loss of 22 lives.\n  I should not, though, that all but one of the deaths occurred before \nthe early 1980s, when the Corps began a dredging program.\n  In 1970, at the urging of Senator Helms, Congress enacted legislation \nauthorizing the Corps of Engineers to construct a jetty system at \nOregon Inlet.\n  Specifically, the Corps was directed to deepen the navigation channel \nthrough the Inlet from 14 feet to 20 feet and to maintain that channel \nwith two jetties.\n  It gets more complicated. And much has changed since 1970.\n  The jetties would prevent the natural flow of sand from north to \nsouth. That flow is what replenishes Pea Island, a national wildlife \nrefuge which otherwise would erode.\n  To counteract this effect, the system includes a system of pipes and \npumps that will transport 2 million cubic feet of sand each year.\n  All told the project will cost American taxpayers $108 million to \nconstruct and about $6 million a year to maintain. We all know it will \ncost more than that.\n  The project would be built on: The northern part, on the Cape \nHatteras National Seashore; and the southern part on the Pea Island \nWildlife Refuge.\n  Therefore, before the Corps can build the project, it must get \npermits from the Interior Department, confirming that the project will \nbe compatible with the Seashore and the Refuge.\n  The provision that has been included in the Agriculture \nappropriations bill, as section 3104, effectively eliminates this \npermit requirement. It transfers the land from the Interior Department \nto the Corps, so that permits no longer are necessary.\n  Those are the basic facts.\n  Now, some of you listening may be scratching your head, wondering \nwhat's going on here. After all, the project was authorized in 1970. \nThirty years later, it still hasn't been built. That, you might be \nthinking, is unacceptable. It's probably because of Government red \ntape.\n  Maybe it's high time we cut through all the red tape and move this \nproject along, as the bill would do.\n  An understandable reaction, if you just look at this on the surface. \nBut, as is often the case, if you dig a little deeper, and get past the \nsurface, it's not that simple.\n  The principal reason that the project has not been built is that the \nproject is very questionable and very controversial. Many have argued \nthat the project will cause great environmental harm and waste more \nthan one hundred million dollars of taxpayers' money.\n  Time after time, Interior Secretaries have refused to grant the \nnecessary permits. Including I should note, President Reagan's Interior \nSecretary, James Watt.\n  The only exception was when Secretary Lujan granted a permit towards \nthe end of the Bush Administration. Soon after taking office, Secretary \nBabbitt reversed the decision.\n  Also time after time, the environmental impact statements developed \nby the Corps have been found to be inadequate, and the Corps has been \nsent back to the drawing board.\n  As we speak, the process continues. The Corps has been asked to \nrevise its latest Environmental Impact Statement, to address what the \nNational Marine Fisheries Service called ``significant errors and \ninadequacies.''\n  As I understand it, the revised EIS will be submitted to Corps \nheadquarters around the end of this month and issued in August.\n  After that, the Corps can move ahead and again seek permits from the \nInterior Department. If there is a dispute, it will be resolved by the \nWhite House.\n  Section 3104 of the bill circumvents this process by transferring the \nland and therefore eliminating the need for any permits.\n  Mr. President, I am sympathetic to the concerns of Senator Helms and \nothers who support this project. I know that they're frustrated that \nthis project has drawn on too long.\n  But I believe that the approach taken in the bill has four main \nfaults.\n  The first goes to process. The provision in the bill is, simply put, \na rider. It is authorizing legislation, properly within the \njurisdiction of the Environment and Public Works Committee.\n  This is a controversial issue; it has been debated, back and forth, \nfor thirty years. It should be resolved on the merits, with input from \nthe committee of jurisdiction. It should not be resolved as a rider on \nan unrelated appropriations bill.\n  The second fault is that the bill may cause serious environmental \nharm.\n  This is, again, a dynamic ecosystem. Always shifting. Always \nchanging.\n  As this chart shows, there have been major changes in the geography \nof Oregon Inlet over the years. The Inlet itself has shifted south by \nabout 80 feet a year, which amounts to more than two miles since the \nInlet opened in 1848.\n  In the middle of this dynamic, shifting system, the project would \nconstruct a pair of rock jetties that are a total of more than 3 miles \nlong.\n  That poses two big risks.\n  In the first place, we'll be altering the natural system by which the \nocean erodes and then replenishes the barrier islands along the coast.\n  As it now stands, each year, tons of sand shift, mostly from north to \nsouth, replenishing Pea Island. The jetties will block most of that \nsand from shifting naturally. To compensate, the Corps plans to pump \nabout 2 million\n\n[[Page S7363]]\n\ncubic feet of sand each year, that will be trapped above the north \njetty, through a large pipeline, and unload it below the south jetty.\n  Maybe it will work. But what if it doesn't?\n  Consider what happened on Assateague Island. 60 years ago, we \nconstructed a jetty. It blocked the sand from replenishing the southern \npart of the island. Since then, the coastline has eroded about one-half \nmile.\n  Another thing. We'll alter the natural flow of water through what is \nnow a broad, relatively shallow inlet leading to Albermarle and Pamlico \nSounds. The Sounds contain important and productive habitats for \nseveral species of fish, including Spanish mackerel, Atlantic croaker, \nand gray trout.\n  These fish spawn at sea. The larval fish then migrate into the calm \nwaters of the sounds where they grow until they're strong enough to \nreturn to the ocean.\n  It is not at all clear that these fish will be able to make it \nthrough the jetties. The fishery biologists just aren't sure.\n  So we are taking major environmental risks.\n  The third major fault is that the economics don't add up.\n  True, the Corps projects an economic benefit, of about $37 million \nover a 50 year period.\n  However, as we all know, the Corps' economic analysis has come under \nheavy criticism lately.\n  In any event, many people have questioned the Corps' estimate of the \ncost and benefits of this project\n  I am not talking about environmental groups, which, it might be \nargued, have their own agenda.\n  I am talking about Taxpayers for Common Sense, and several \ndistinguished economists who have studied the project.\n  For example, Professor Richard Seldon, who I understand is a \ndistinguished professor emiritus at the University of Virginia, said \nthis:\n\n       My extremely conservative analysis of the Corps' data found \n     that rather than the almost $37 million of net benefits \n     claimed for the project by the Corps . . . this project will \n     have negative benefits of [more than $4 million]. In fact, I \n     believe the project is very likely to have a much worse \n     return on investment based on many costs thus far not \n     accounted for by the Corps.\n\n  In a letter sent to Senator Helms a few days ago, Professor Emeritus \nSeldon said.\n\n       I am convinced that these jetties should not be built--not \n     for environmental reasons but simply because the benefits \n     claimed by the Corps are nowhere near as large as the likely \n     cost to taxpayers. This is a bad economic deal, even if we \n     forget about the environment.\n\n  The fourth fault is that I believe there's a better way.\n  Let me say again that I understand the frustration that Senator Helms \nand others in North Carolina feel about this project.\n  They have serious concerns. One is safety. Again, these are \ntreacherous waters.\n  Another is economic development. As I understand it, this is an area \nthat could use the economic boost that increased fish landings might \nprovide.\n  I'm not going to stand here and say that environmental concerns \nshould prevail over safety and economic development. Not a all.\n  I don't buy that, whether we're talking about Montana, North \nCarolina, or anyplace else. We have to strike a balance.\n  But here is the rub. There may be a better way.\n  We may be able to achieve all the benefits that would be achieved by \nconstructing the jetties, and do it much more cheaply and without the \nenvironmental risks.\n  Here is how. By dredging a better channel.\n  We could direct the Corps to dredge the Inlet deeper and more often.\n  But there is a problem. In the most recent EIs the Corps has studied \nonly one non-structural alternative. One that would have more than \ndoubled this width of the channel. It's no surprise that the costs out-\nweighed the benefits. So, for at least 30 years, we haven't fully \nconsidered whether there's a better alternative to the jetty system.\n  In addition there are many more factors to consider--environmental, \nrecreational, and so forth--then there were in 1970.\n  That brings me to my amendment.\n  It deletes the provision in the bill that transfers the land, thereby \ncircumventing the permitting process.\n  Instead, the amendment requires that, within 180 days the Corps, must \nevaluate alternatives to the jetty project, including dredging.\n  In doing so, the Corps must consider the views of affected interests, \nmust consider how various alternatives accord with North Carolina's \nshoreline protection laws, and must minimize adverse environmental \neffects.\n  Mr. President, pulling this all together, we need to do more to \nimprove safety at Oregon Inlet.\n  But the jetty system that we authorized in 1970 is an idea whose time \nhas probably gone.\n  We do not need 3 miles of granite rock jetties. We don't need 2 miles \nof pipeline, to pump 2 million cubic feet of sand every year.\n  We do not need huge environmental risks.\n  We don't need to ask taxpayers to fork over $108 million.\n  Instead, we should step back, take stock, and see whether we can \nsolve the problems at Oregon Inlet in a way that avoids big \nenvironmental risks and saves taxpayers' money.\n  Therefore, I urge colleagues to support my amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent a statement of administration policy by the \nExecutive Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget \nlisting the Administration's strong objection to the underlying \nprovision in the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\ns. 2536--agriculture, rural development, food and drug administration, \n and related agencies appropriations bill, fy 2001--(sponsor: stevens \n                                (r) ak)\n\n       This Statement of Administration Policy provides the \n     Administration's views on the FY 2001 Agriculture, Rural \n     Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related \n     Agencies Appropriations Bill, as reported by the Senate \n     Appropriations Committee. Your consideration of the \n     Administration's views would be appreciated.\n       The President's FY 2001 budget is based on a balanced \n     approach that maintains fiscal discipline, eliminates the \n     national debt, extends the solvency of Social Security and \n     Medicare, provides for an appropriately sized tax cut, \n     establishes a new voluntary Medicare prescription drug \n     benefit in the context of broader reforms, expands health \n     care coverage to more families, and funds critical \n     investments for our future. An essential element of this \n     approach is ensuring adequate funding for discretionary \n     programs. To this end, the President has proposed \n     discretionary spending limits at levels that we believe are \n     necessary to serve the American people.\n       Unfortunately, the FY 2001 congressional budget resolution \n     provides inadequate resources for discretionary investments. \n     We need realistic levels of funding for critical government \n     functions that the American people expect their government to \n     perform well, including education, national security, law \n     enforcement, environmental protection, preservation of our \n     global leadership, air safety, food safety, economic \n     assistance for the less fortunate, research and technology, \n     and the administration of Social Security and Medicare. Based \n     on the inadequate budget resolution, this bill fails to \n     address critical needs of the American people.\n       The bill includes inadequate funding for food safety, \n     conservation and environmental programs, farm loans, \n     bioterrorism, agricultural research through competitive \n     grants and other important programs. In addition, there are a \n     number of objectionable language provisions in the Committee \n     bill.\n       It is our understanding that a substitute will be offered \n     to the supplemental title of the bill that will include a \n     number of highly objectionable environmental and other \n     riders, including a provision to facilitate construction of \n     the Oregon Inlet jetties prior to completion of a pending \n     environmental impact statement, restrictions that would \n     attempt to weaken pending hardrock mining regulations, and \n     other objectionable provisions. The Administration opposes \n     the bill in its current form. If such riders are included in \n     the bill, the President's senior advisers would recommend \n     that he veto the bill.\n\n\n       fy 2000 supplemental appropriations contained in this bill\n\n       Objectionable Legislative Riders--The Administration \n     opposes the environmental and other authorization provisions \n     contained in the bill, which are inappropriate for inclusion \n     in an appropriations act. Such riders rarely receive the \n     level of congressional and public review required of \n     authorization language, and they often override existing \n     environmental protections or impose unjustified micro-\n     management restrictions on agency activities.\n       More detailed views will be provided when the text of the \n     substitute is made available. Therefore, the views expressed \n     here are necessarily preliminary.\n       Oregon Inlet (NC) Jetties.--The Administration strongly \n     opposes the provision to remove lands from the Cape Hatteras \n     National\n\n[[Page S7364]]\n\n     Seashore and the Pea Island National Wildlife Refuge, prior \n     to completion of a pending environmental impact statement \n     (EIS) on proposals to maintain navigation through Oregon \n     Inlet, N.C. This rider would undermine the EIS process by \n     selecting one option--the construction of a dual jetty and \n     sand transfer system--before a decision on alternatives can \n     be made. There remain significant questions about the long-\n     term environmental impacts and the economic justifications of \n     the dual jetty option, and those questions need to be \n     answered before considering any legislation to remove land \n     from a national park and a national wildlife refuge.\n       Restrictions on Hardrock Mining Regulations.--The \n     Administration strongly objects to the bill's attempt to \n     weaken pending final regulations on the management of \n     hardrock mining on public lands. These overdue regulations \n     are needed to address the major changes in technology and \n     mining industry practices since the regulations were last \n     updated in 1980. The proposed rider would also attempt to \n     reopen an agreement reached in negotiations on the FY 2000 \n     Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations bill to allow \n     the final rule to go forward, as long as it was ``not \n     inconsistent'' with the recommendations of a recent National \n     Research Council (NRC) report. The rider would now attempt to \n     limit the rule to only a specific subset of the NRC report's \n     recommendations. By doing so, the rider could hinder the \n     effective regulation of industry practices (such as large-\n     scale cyanide leaching for gold on public lands) that have \n     become increasingly prevalent over the past 20 years.\n       Community Builders, Sec. 2602.--The Administration urges \n     deletion of the highly objectionable, micro-management \n     language in Section 2602, which would prohibit the Department \n     of Housing and Urban Development from hiring replacement \n     staff for 350 community builder positions.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. In addition, I ask that a letter from the organization \nTaxpayers For Common Sense be printed in the Record. It is very much \nopposed to the underlying provision and in favor of this amendment, as \nwell as a statement by Dr. Seldon, a very respected economist who \nstudied this issue extensively.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 20, 2000.\n     Re Baucus substitute amendment on Oregon Inlet\n\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Baucus: Taxpayers for Common Sense Action \n     thank you for your leadership in opposing the anti-taxpayer \n     Oregon Inlet rider that Senator Helms added to the \n     Agriculture Appropriations bill. TCS Action strongly supports \n     your substitute amendment to provide for an expedited Corps \n     of Engineers/Interior Department study of cheaper \n     alternatives. In addition, TCS supports commitment of a few \n     million dollars for improved interim dredging. TCS Action \n     will likely score the vote on this Baucus amendment on TCS \n     Action's annual Common Sense Taxpayer Scorecard.\n       As you know, the Oregon Inlet rider would transfer \n     federally-protected land from the Department of Interior to \n     the Corps of Engineers, thereby removing one of he last \n     remaining obstacles to construction of twin mile-long stone \n     jetties at a cost of $108 million. Anyone who has ever been \n     to the Cape Hatteras National Seashore on North Carolina's \n     famed Outer Banks understands intuitively that the Oregon \n     Inlet project would be a massive waste of taxpayer money. \n     Moreover, six major newspapers in North Carolina have \n     editorialized against the project. Typically, the Raleigh \n     (NC) News and Observer editorialized May 12:\n       ``Decisions on the jetties properly have to be made on the \n     merits of arguments for and against them, not because \n     lawmakers have been intimidated by a tactic such as the one \n     Helms is attempting. And on those merits, despite supporter' \n     good intentions, the jetties shape up as an extraordinary \n     boondoggle.''\n       The anti-taxpayer rider is strongly opposed by a broad \n     coalition. Meanwhile, a 1999 independent review of the Corps' \n     benefit-cost analysis by Dr. Richard Selden of the University \n     of Virginia on behalf of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \n     demonstrated the project's benefits do not outweigh the \n     costs. The project will provide a $500,000 federal subsidy \n     for each of 215 charter or commercial fishing boats that will \n     purportedly benefit. Instead, routine channel dredging has \n     worked for the last 30 years. Surely, it is reasonable to \n     study all alternatives to the Oregon Inlet project before \n     giving the green light to this massive waste of taxpayer \n     money opposed by the last five administrations.\n       Thank you again for your leadership to propose a reasonable \n     compromise solution on this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Ralph DeGennaro,\n     President & CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    July 16, 2000.\n     Hon. Jesse Helms,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Helms: I write you as a staunch Republican and \n     a conservative economist who got his Ph.D. under Milton \n     Friedman at the University of Chicago. I am definitely not a \n     ``tree hugger.'' I have never belonged to the Sierra Club or \n     any other activist environmental group.\n       I am writing because I'm concerned about your support for \n     the Corps of Engineers' proposal to build jetties at Oregon \n     Inlet. I know you have declared yourself in favor of this \n     project on many occasions, extending over many years, and I \n     can see the practical difficulty of withdrawing your support \n     at this juncture. Nevertheless, I am convinced that these \n     jetties should not be built--not for environmental reasons \n     but simply because the benefits claimed by the Corps are \n     nowhere near as large as the likely cost to taxpayers. This \n     is a bad economic deal, even if we forget about the \n     environment.\n       You may wonder whether there is a valid basis for my strong \n     negative opinion of the Corps' proposal. Last summer I did a \n     benefit/cost analysis of the proposal as a private consultant \n     hired by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. (You may wonder \n     about the objectivity of a study that was commissioned by an \n     agency that opposes the jetties. All I can say is that I \n     examined a ton of material on the proposal, and I tried to \n     apply accepted economic analysis to all of it, regardless of \n     the source.) My findings were clearcut and unambiguous: there \n     is no way these jetties can pass a standard benefit/cost \n     test.\n       You may also wonder whether my conclusions would be \n     accepted by most other fairminded economists. I would be glad \n     to have my work scrutinized by a neutral panel (assuming one \n     could be found!). But I can assure you with complete \n     confidence that the benefit/cost analysis provided by the \n     Corps is full of flaws and would be accepted as valid by few \n     if any professional economists. This simply is not an \n     appropriate basis for committing over $100 million of \n     taxpayer money! At the very least the Corps should be \n     required to submit its analysis to some outside panel for a \n     thorough critique before they get a green light on this one.\n       By US Postal Service I am mailing you a copy of my August \n     1999 report, and I will welcome reactions from you or your \n     staff.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Richard T. Selden, Ph.D.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Finally, I underline my appreciation for the hard work of \nboth Senators from North Carolina, Mr. Helms, as well as Mr. Edwards. \nThis has been a very contentious issue. But as a consequence of the \nmutual hard work, this amendment can be accepted by voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent it be in order for \nme to deliver my remarks in a seated position.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I am grateful for the willingness of the \nSenator from Montana to work with us, to make certain the stabilization \nof Oregon Inlet is once more a priority of Congress and of the U.S. \nCorps of Engineers--in the next 180 days.\n  I confess some unease at the prospect of yet another study of the \nOregon Inlet, inasmuch as there already have been almost 100 such \nstudies previously. If one more study is what is required to save the \nlivelihoods of the good people of Oregon Inlet who make their livings \nas commercial fishermen, then so be it. But let there be no mistake. \nThis is the last study that will be conducted before action is taken. \nThat is agreed to by the Senator from Montana and me--to help those \ngood people, because enough, Mr. President, is enough.\n  I will work in good faith with the Senator from Montana and others to \nmake certain that swift action will follow this latest, and I hope \nlast, study to be undertaken.\n  Mr. President, for nearly three decades--nearly 28 years, to be \nexact--I have been urging the enactment of legislation to restore \nsecurity and safety to the remarkable people who live and work on North \nCarolinas Outer Banks.\n  And for those almost three decades, those fine people have been \nshort-circuited by a federal bureaucracy more intent in imposing its \nown will than following through on a much-needed project authorized by \nCongress in 1970: That is, to begin the process of creating two hard-\nrock jetties to stabilize and secure Oregon Inlet, the only deep-sea \naccess along the East Coast for a distance of 220 miles between Cape \nHenry, Virginia, and Morehead City, N.C.\n  The purpose of the provision being challenged here tonight is to \nfirst, protect the lives of literally thousands of both commercial and \nrecreational fishermen who live and work in the Outer Banks, and \nsecond, to protect the livelihoods of those fishermen, their boats\n\n[[Page S7365]]\n\nand their cargo, which is so vital to their making a living.\n  So let's be clear about what's at stake in this debate. We're talking \nabout saving lives and saving a way of life for many of thousands of \nfine decent people trying to make a living providing fine, fresh \nseafood.\n  Wayne Gray, a Coast Guard officer stationed at the base there told \nme, ``Oregon Inlet is a nightmare. In my 32 years in the Coast Guard, \nit's the most dangerous place I've ever seen.''\n  The Coast Guard station there receives on average a distress call \nevery other day. In this fiscal year alone, the Oregon Inlet Coast \nGuard has responded to nearly 100 call for help by distressed seamen. \nThere will be many more this summer, I'll promise you: There always \nare.\n  Over the years, more than 20 lives have been lost because of the \ndeadly situation in the Inlet. In fact, I recently received a letter \nfrom a man named Robbie Maharaj who recounted an incident which \nhappened about 4 years ago.\n\n       In November of 1996 a friend and I were fishing on the \n     northern side of the ocean bar at Oregon Inlet. It was a \n     fairly rough day at the bar.\n       We had caught out limit of striped bass and were pulling in \n     our lines when I heard on the radio that some of my friends \n     had gone down. I immediately finished pulling up my lines and \n     went to help.\n       As I pulled up to the boat, I was able to get one man \n     aboard. We laid him on the deck. He was so cold from being in \n     the water that he looked pale, and almost dead. As we got him \n     on deck, water began to break over the stern of my boat. I \n     had to leave the scene to avoid going down myself.\n       All in all, four of the five men in the water made it. I \n     was able to get two in my boat. Other fishermen pulled out \n     the two other survivors. the Coast Guard got the one man that \n     didn't make it.\n       People ask me all the time whether I would do it again. \n     There's no question that I would try and pull men out of the \n     water if I were faced with the same situation again. It's \n     sort of a buddy system out there. You hear cries for help and \n     you can't leave them there. You've got to try to help. This \n     is especially true when the people yelling for help are \n     friends. Who knows, the next time it could be me yelling to \n     be saved.\n       Thanks to the events of 1996, I know just how dangerous \n     Oregon Inlet can be. Senator, thank you for trying to get the \n     stabilization effort moving. We really need it.\n\n  The provision in question merely transfers the land relevant to the \nproject from the Department of the Interior to the Army Corps of \nEngineers, so that the wheels of the inlet stabilization project can \nfinally begin. This project is sound. Almost one hundred separate \nstudies have been made on the project; therefore, we can reasonably say \nthat just about every possible issue relevant to the project has been \nthoroughly considered and resolved.\n  On an economic scale, the project has a cost/benefit ratio of 1.0/\n1.6, meaning for every $1 spent on the project, $1.60 in benefits are \nreturned.\n  As for the environmental concerns that have been raised, the Corps \nhas made numerous compromises and alterations to the jetties in order \nto alleviate every single negative impact upon the local habitat and \nwildlife.\n  How many more lives will be lost before Congress makes good on the \ncommitment made 30 years ago. That time has finally come.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? The \nSenator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to announce to all Senators \nwe are only 2 or 3 minutes away from getting a managers' package of \namendments to wrap up the final consideration of this bill. We also \nhave some colloquies and statements that Senators have presented to us \nduring the final stages of the consideration of the bill we are now \nreviewing and processing. I expect to be able to present for unanimous \nconsent agreement, for inclusion in the Record, these statements and \ncolloquies.\n  We know of no other amendments that are to be offered.\n  May I ask the Chair, what is the pending business?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, can we have a vote on the amendment, \nplease?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment of the Senator from Montana has \nnot yet been disposed of.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Chair.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3981) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, for the information of Senators, we have \nbeen awaiting word from the minority staff of the subcommittee to clear \nthe managers' package. We have cleared the managers' package on this \nside of the aisle. We have statements and colloquies relating to the \nmanagers' package, and I will momentarily send up all of the amendments \nand the statements and colloquies related thereto.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I will be happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I wonder if we can have a voice vote on \nfinal passage.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I have no objection to passing the bill \non a voice vote.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 3982 through 4014, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I now have an indication that the \nmanagers' package has been cleared. I send the managers' package of \namendments to the desk and ask that they be reported en bloc and \nconsidered en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran], for himself and \n     Mr. Kohl, proposes amendments numbered 3982 through 4014, en \n     bloc.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3982\n\n (Purpose: To provide for a Animal and Plant Health Services wildlife \n                  services methods development study)\n\n       On page 20, line 8, strike the ``.'' and insert in lieu \n     thereof the following:\n       ``: Provided further, That not less than $1 million of the \n     funds available under this heading made available for \n     wildlife services methods development, the Secretary of \n     Agriculture shall conduct pilot projects in no less than four \n     states representative of wildlife predation of livestock in \n     connection with farming operations for direct assistance in \n     the application of non-lethal predation control methods: \n     Provided further, That the General Accounting Office shall \n     report to the Committee on Appropriations by November 30, \n     2001, on the Department's compliance with this provision and \n     on the effectiveness of the non-lethal measures.''.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I am pleased that the \nSmith-Boxer amendment on Wildlife Services was accepted to the \nAgriculture appropriations bill.\n  Our amendment will create a pilot study in four States that will \nexamine the effectiveness of nonlethal predation control methods under \nWildlife Services. Our amendment is reasonable and fair.\n  Let me briefly talk about the lethal predator control program \nadministered under the Wildlife Service program.\n  With our scarce tax dollars, Wildlife Services personnel kill more \nthan 80,000 mammalian predators a year, mainly coyotes, but also black \nbears, mountain lions, foxes, and bobcats.\n  They conduct this killing by engaging in aerial gunning, poisoning, \nand trapping.\n  Since 1993, there have been 18 aerial gunning crashes. In addition, \nthe aerial gunning program has caused the deaths of seven individuals, \nboth Federal and contract employees.\n  Banned in 89 nations because it is so inhumane, leghold traps catch \nany animal unlucky enough to trigger the device. Animals caught in \ntraps languish and suffer for days, sometimes resorting to twisting off \nor chewing off a leg to escape its vice grip.\n  I am not standing before you today saying that every program that \nWildlife Services executes is harmful or a waste of taxpayer money.\n\n[[Page S7366]]\n\n  There are some valuable programs dealing with property protection, \nhuman health and safety, crop protection, natural resources, forest and \nrange protection, and aquiculture which are not affected by this \namendment.\n  However, Wildlife Services spends more than $10 million a year on \nlethal predator control programs.\n  But does the lethal predator control program really work? It does not \nseem to be controlling the coyote population, it has tripled in number \nand increased in range because the surviving coyotes will breed more \noften and produce larger litters.\n\n  In fact, according to a recent article in the Washington Times, \ncoyotes have now spread to Virginia and Maryland.\n  In addition, this program has been under scrutiny for decades. \nSeveral presidential commissions, including commissions in the Kennedy, \nJohnson, and Carter administrations have criticized the program's \nneedless reliance on lethal predator control.\n  In 1995, the General Accounting Office came to the same conclusion, \nstating the Animal Damage Control had failed to opt for non-lethal \nprograms.\n  I am well aware that ranchers need to protect their livestock, their \ninvestment. During the last 2 decades, there have been a variety of \npractical and effective nonlethal husbandry techniques developed and \nput into practical use: The use of guard animals, such as dogs, \ndonkeys, or llamas; the use of electronic sound and light devices; \npredator exclusion fencing; shed lambing; and night penning, et cetera.\n  By deploying these techniques, ranchers can minimize the need for \nlethal responses to predators, which are indiscriminant and cruel to \nanimals.\n  In closing I would like to read you a quote from the Tulsa World \nnewspaper, which says it all:\n\n       Despite steady increases in the Wildlife Services annual \n     budget, and an 8 percent increase in the coyote kill in the \n     past decade, livestock losses to predators have not declined. \n     The statistics show that in every state where predator \n     control was practiced, the agency spent more money on control \n     than the value of livestock lost. It would be cheaper simply \n     to compensate ranchers for their losses.\n\n  I will repeat that last sentence: ``It would be cheaper simply to \ncompensate ranchers for their losses.''\n  In short, the lethal predator control program doesn't work, it is \ndangerous for humans, cruel to animals, and a waste of taxpayer \ndollars.\n  I thank the managers of the bill for including this pilot study of \nnonlethal predator control methods in the Agriculture appropriations \nbill.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the managers for their assistance \nin adding an amendment to the Agriculture Appropriations bill that \nrequires the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Wildlife Services \nResearch Center to design and implement on-the-ground demonstration \nprojects to test the application of non-lethal mammalian predator \ncontrol techniques.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to generate data that can be used in \ndetermining the effectiveness of non-lethal methods for protecting \nlivestock from predators. These nonlethal methods include: the use of \nguard animals such as dogs, donkeys, and llamas; the use of predator-\nproof electric fencing; special light and sound deterrents; and \npromotion of sound animal husbandry techniques such as carcass removal, \nnight penning, and shed lambing to protect pregnant animals and their \nnewborns when they are most vulnerable.\n  Lethal predator control measures, such as shooting, poisoning, or \ntrapping, should not be employed in these projects. In order to produce \nuseful outcomes, the pilot projects should involve ranchers whose \ncircumstances are representative of the types of livestock/predator \nconflicts that other ranchers experience around the country.\n  The General Accounting Office has been tasked with reporting on these \npilot projects and providing an assessment of the effectiveness of \nthese non-lethal mammalian predator control measures. I look forward to \nworking with the Department, along with Senator Smith and my other \ncolleagues, to ensure that this program gets underway quickly and \nsmoothly to begin demonstrating the value of these non-lethal predator \ncontrol methods.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3983\n\n      (Purpose: To amend the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n       ``Sec.   .

Mr. President, I wish to thank Senators Cochran and \nHarkin for their assistance in getting this proposal included in the \nAgriculture Appropriations bill for FY 2001. The biomass program is a \ncollaborative effort between Oklahoma State University and Mississippi \nState University.\n  We are now 56 percent dependent on foreign oil. It is projected that \nby 2020 we will be more than 65 percent dependent on oil from foreign \nnations. Such dependency is a major threat to our national security. We \nneed to make every effort possible to reduce and curb this dependency. \nThis program will aid us in this effort.\n  The effort between these two universities will focus on the continued \ndevelopment of a unique gasification-bioconversion process at OSU that \nutilizes biomass including crop residues, underutilized grasses, and \nplant byproducts.\n  Those conducting the research consist of a senior team of nationally \nrecognized experts in biomass production, feedstock harvesting and \nprocessing of technologies, environmental impact assessment, and \nbiochemical process.\n  I ask my colleagues for their support of this unique opportunity for \nOklahoma, Mississippi and for the nation.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 4000\n\n(Purpose: To provide fiscal year 2000 supplemental contingent emergency \n   funding to the Department of the Treasury for the Customs Service \n                      Automated Commercial System)\n\n       On page 93 of division B, as modified, after line 21, \n     insert the following:\n\n                    ``GENERAL PROVISION--THIS TITLE\n\n       ``Sec.  .

Mr. President, I appreciate the Chairman and the \nCommittee including $123,000,000 in emergency funding for the Customs \nService Automated Commercial System, or ACS. The current legacy \ncomputer system of the Customs Service is in dire need of this \nemergency funding. This 16 year old system regularly experiences what \nis called ``brownouts'' or system-wide outages. When this system goes \ndown, believe it or not, the Customs Service must process all entries \nby hand. These outages are only becoming more frequent and they are \nlasting longer and longer. You can imagine the delays at the border \nthat this situation causes. For example, in an outage in March at the \nBuffalo port, a five-hour delay generated so much paper that the entry \ndocuments were piled so high Customs could not see their customers on \nthe other side of the counter. Not only do these outages create long \nlines at the ports, but after the system is back up and running, \nCustoms employees must then work overtime trying to enter all of the \npaper entries generated during the outage. Therefore, Mr. President, I \nam pleased that the Committee has included this funding to address this \nvery serious issue.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 4001\n\n(Purpose: To fully fund the Food and Drug Administration's food safety \n                         initiative activities)\n\n       On page 57, line 2, strike ``$78,589,000'' and insert \n     ``$72,589,000''.\n       On page 57, line 10, insert before the period the \n     following: ``: Provided further, That in addition to amounts \n     otherwise appropriated under this heading to the Food and \n     Drug Administration, an additional $6,000,000 shall be made \n     available of which $5,000,000 shall be made available for the \n     Centers for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition and related \n     field activities in the Office of Regulatory Affairs, and \n     $1,000,000 shall be made available to the National Center for \n     Toxicological Research''.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The American food supply is one of the safest in the \nworld--but it is not safe enough. Over 75 million Americans a year are \nstricken by disease caused by contaminated food they eat. Each year, \n9,000 people--mostly the very young and the very old--die as a result. \nThe costs of medical treatment and losses in productivity for these \nillnesses are as high as $37 billion annually.\n  The emergence of highly virulent strains of bacteria, and the \nincrease in the number of organisms resistant to antibiotics, are \ncompounding these problems and making foodborne illnesses an \nincreasingly serious public health challenge.\n  Americans deserve to know that the foods they eat are safe, \nregardless of their source. Yet too many citizens today are at \nunnecessary risk of foodborne disease. This Congress can make a \ndifference. The FDA requested a budget increase of $30 million in 2001 \nfor its Food Safety Initiative activities. With these additional funds, \nthe FDA can improve its inspection of high-risk food establishments and \nstrengthen its laboratory capabilities. Without this funding, the \nagency will conduct 700 fewer inspections next year. The Senate \nAppropriations Committee recognized the importance of protecting our \nfood supply by granting the FDA the majority of its requested increase \nfor food safety. The amendment I propose will give the FDA the \nadditional $6 million it needs for these efforts.\n  In response to improved surveillance and increased sampling and \ntesting, illnesses from the most common bacterial foodborne pathogens \ndecreased by 21% from 1997 to 1999. As a result, 855,000 fewer \nAmericans each year suffer from foodborne diseases. But contaminated \nfood still remains a significant public health problem.\n  Recently, a new strain of an organism contaminated oysters in Texas, \nand caused an epidemic of diarrhea. This year, the FDA recalled several \nsmoked fish products manufactured in New York because of outbreaks of \ndisease. In March, 500 college students in Massachusetts became ill \nwith Norwalk-like virus. Each year there are also at least 4700 cases \nof Salmonella in Massachusetts. We must do more to protect our citizens \nfrom foodborne diseases.\n  Imported foods are a significant part of the problem and often pose \nespecially serious health risks. Americans are consuming foods from \nother countries at increasing rates. Since 1992, the number of food \nimports has tripled. At that time, the FDA was able to inspect only 8% \nof these imports. Since then the rate of FDA inspections of imported \nfood has dropped to less than 1%, because resources did not increase \nfor monitoring these imports.\n  Other countries have often not implemented food safety protections \ncomparable to those in the United States, and general sanitary \nconditions are often poor. As a consequence, foods from such countries \nare more likely to be contaminated with disease-producing organisms. In \n1995, 242 people contracted Salmonella from alfalfa sprouts imported \nfrom the Netherlands. In 1996, over 1,400 people became ill from \ncontaminated raspberries from Guatemala. Just this year, infected \nshrimp from Vietnam caused Salmonella and E. coli outbreaks.\n\n[[Page S7369]]\n\n  In earlier decades, diseases such as tuberculosis and cholera were \nthe focus of food safety concerns. Today diseases caused by dangerous \nnew strains of E. coli have become primary causes of foodborne illness. \nThese new organisms necessitate increased investment in research, \ntechnology, and surveillance to protect the safety of our food supply.\n  Food safety are also especially important to protect the growing \nnumber of individuals in vulnerable populations, such as young \nchildren, the elderly, those with lowered immunity from HIV, and those \nwith inadequate access to health care.\n  By providing the FDA with the necessary resources to combat foodborne \ndiseases, we can protect tens of millions of our fellow citizens across \nthe country each year. Investment in food safety is an investment in \nthe health of every American. Congress should give the FDA the \nresources it needs in order to ensure the safety of the food we eat. \nThe amendment I am proposing is a major step to meet this challenge, \nand I urge the Senate to approve it.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 4002\n\n       On page 71, line 3, strike the comma and insert the \n     following: ``prior to July 1, 2001,''.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise to report on an agreement reached \ntoday between Senator Inouye and myself regarding the Fort Reno \nAgriculture Research Station at El Reno, Oklahoma.\n  Our agreement delays any decision on the ARS until the next \nAdministration. It also preserves the right of Congress to play a role \nin the future of the ARS. Our agreement ensures that any decision made \nabout the research station will be made based on the merits of the work \nperformed there rather than a decision based on November political \nconsiderations.\n  The agreement should not be read to mean that the research station \nwill be eliminated, nor that the lands at Fort Reno should or will be \nreturned to the Cheyenne-Arapaho tribe of Oklahoma.\n  I do not want the status of the Agriculture Research Station to be \ninfluenced by presidential politics, which has been the case in the \npast. This agreement will help prevent the future of the research \nstation from becoming an election-year tool and better protect both the \ntribe and the research station from pressures surrounding the November \nelection.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I agree with Senator Nickles that Congress \nshould have oversight of this issue and that decisions made about the \nresearch station should be made based on the merits of the work \nperformed there rather than political considerations.\n  If one day Fort Reno is declared surplus or excess property by USDA, \nI hope that the Cheyenne and Arapaho's interest in the land will be \nconsidered. I believe they have a legitimate case in their pursuit of \nthat land, and I look forward to working further with Senator Nickles \non this issue.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 4003\n\n  (Purpose: To prohibit products that contain dry ultra-filtered milk \n products or casein from being labeled as domestic natural cheese, and \n                          for other purposes)\n\n       On page 75, between lines 16 and 17, insert the following:\n       Sec. 740.

Mr. President, we have before the Senate S. 2536, the \nFiscal Year 2001 Appropriations Act for Agriculture, Rural Development, \nFood and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies. I am concerned that \nthis bill omits an appropriation included in the House version of this \nbill (H.R. 4461).\n  H.R. 4461 appropriates $309,600 for the Agriculture Research Service \n(ARS) to fund research addressing Postharvest Handling and \nMechanization to Minimize Damage for Fruits. This research is vital, \nnot only for Michigan, but for all fruit producing states.\n  This research has the potential to allow fruit growers to realize \ngreater profits by better ensuring fruit quality. Given the significant \npotential of this program to assist fruit producers in my home state, I \nam troubled by its exclusion in S. 2536.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Senator from Michigan for his comments. He \nis\n\n[[Page S7371]]\n\ncorrect in stating that the House Appropriations Act for Agriculture, \nRural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies \nfor Fiscal Year 2001 funds research regarding Postharvest Handling and \nMechanization to Minimize Damage for Fruits while the Senate \ncounterpart does not.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would appreciate the Senate conferees giving full \nconsideration to the House position on this matter.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I assure the Senator from Michigan that this specific \nrequest will be carefully considered in conference as I can understand \nhow important this matter is.\n\n\n                      fda's adverse event reports\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. Chairman, I strongly support an increase to the Food \nand Drug Administration's Adverse Event Monitoring System regarding \ndietary supplements. This would be administered by the FDA's Center for \nFood Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN). This increase in FDA's \nAdverse Event Monitoring System for dietary supplements is an important \ncomponent in the overall effort to implement fully the Dietary \nSupplement Health and Education Act.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am proud to join my distinguished colleague, the Senior \nSenator from Utah, in supporting this endeavor. This proposed increase \nin FDA's Adverse Event Monitoring System for dietary supplements is an \nimportant component in the overall effort to implement fully the \nDietary Supplement Health and Education Act. It also continues our \nmutual efforts to promote better public health and consumer safety. The \nFDA monitors adverse events related to dietary supplements. The dietary \nsupplement sales have doubled in the past five years. In fact, surveys \nindicate that nearly half of all Americans use some type of dietary \nsupplement, spending over $12 billion annually for these products. FDA \nestimates that the industry markets approximately 29,000 of these \nproducts, which are sold under 75,000 distinct labels.\n  Mr. HATCH. Despite this phenomenal growth in the supplement industry, \nthe FDA currently does not have the resources to process adverse event \nreports in a timely manner and with comprehensive information. As a \nresult, a substantial backlog currently exists in reviewing adverse \nevent reports in the dietary supplement area. However, we must assure \nthat these funds for AERs are effectively spent. Accordingly, Mr. \nChairman, I respectfully request that you work with Senator Harkin and \nmyself on this issue. More specifically, we request that the FDA be \ndirected to assign additional personnel to maintain the timeliness and \naccuracy of the AER system for dietary supplements. In addition, \nCongress needs to be assured that all published reports are accompanied \nby the results of a scientific evaluation of the link between the \nproduct and the adverse event and evidence of timely prior notification \nof any manufacturer or distributor mentioned in the report.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I appreciate your bringing this issue to the attention \nof the Committee, and I will carefully consider this issue affecting \nthe FDA's Adverse Event Monitoring System regarding dietary \nsupplements. I thank the Senator for raising this matter to my \nattention.\n\n\n     USDA-ARS New England Plant, Soil and Water Research Laboratory\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his continuing \nsupport for the New England, Plant, Soil, and Water Research Laboratory \nin Orono, Maine. Quite frankly, with his help and the support of his \nSubcommittee, we have literally snatched this USDA-Agricultural \nResearch Service potato research laboratory--so important to the Maine \npotato industry--from the jaws of defeat ever since the Administration \ncalled for its closing in 1995. Not only have we kept the doors open, \nbut with his support, the research facility on the University of Maine \ncampus in Orono now has not only Dr. Wayne Honeycutt as its very \ncapable lead scientist, but has added two plant pathologists, a \nresearch chemist, and a soon to be added research agronomist because of \nhis support last year. I want to once again re-emphasize just how \ncritical the lab's survival is to the state of Maine, its potato \ngrowers, and its economy.\n  Ninety-five percent of the potato acreage in the six states in the \nNew England region are in Maine, and the lab has the benefit of being \nin close proximity to the grower's fields. There has been a long and \nproductive history of collaborative potato research involving the \nstate, the university research program, and private agricultural \ninterests.\n  The laboratory's last need is for a soil physicist to complete its \nscientific staff and not for a soil pathologist as originally requested \nand for which $300,000 is provided for as stated on page 31 of the \nReport Language for S. 2536. I request that this technical correction \nbe made for a soil physicist.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Senior Senator from Maine for her tireless \nefforts over these past five years to not only keep the ARS laboratory \nopen but to assure that the facility is staffed with skilled scientists \nand support staff that continue to be of great service to the \nagriculture community in Maine. This research facility has my support \nand the appropriate technical change will be made for a soil physicist.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Once again, I thank the chairman for his support of \nagriculture throughout my State, and I praise him for your fine \nleadership as Chair of the Subcommittee.\n\n\n           Quality and Shelf Life of Agricultural Commodities\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President. I want to thank the Senator from \nMississippi, for drafting an excellent FY2001 Agriculture \nAppropriations bill that will help meet the needs of our nation's \nfarmers and agricultural communities. I especially want to thank him \nfor working closely with me to ensure that issues affecting the Idaho \nagriculture are addressed in the bill.\n  I know that the Senator from Mississippi works hard with limited \nresources to fund worthwhile and fiscally responsible agricultural \nresearch programs. One important area of agriculture research involves \nincreasing the shelf life of our food, while maintaining its quality, \nand one of the most promising methods is irradiation. In Idaho, Idaho \nState University is home to the Idaho Accelerator Center (IAC) which is \nproposing a research program to investigate the effects of small \namounts of irradiation--as compared to conventional food irradiation--\non the behavior of potatoes. IAC and several Idaho-based partners have \nbeen studying the positive effects of low doses of x-ray and electron \nbeam irradiation on the storage properties and shelf life of potatoes. \nSignificant improvement in shelf life has been demonstrated over the \nentire range of standard storage conditions, with virtually no decline \nin quality. The results indicate that long term storage losses can be \nreduced to very low levels and that shelf life during transport, \nstorage by vendors and by consumers is extended indefinitely. It is \nbelieved that these findings will also hold true for other commodities \nsuch as onions, sugar beets, etc. These results are achieved without \nchemicals, radioactive materials or other environmentally harmful \nprocesses. The irradiation is provided by the electron beams produced \nfrom compact, portable high-energy electron-linear accelerators.\n  While I know that the project is not funded in the Senate bill, I \nwant to ask the Chairman to consider the IAC proposal during Conference \non the bill. This is a worthy project and one that I am confident will \nlead to real results that will benefit our farmers and consumers.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Idaho \nfor his kind remarks. We have tried hard to accommodate every \nworthwhile request but, as we all know, we are constrained by our \nbudget allocation. I want to assure him, however, that I will \nthoroughly review the request made by the Idaho Accelerator Center at \nIdaho State University and will give it appropriate consideration \nduring Conference.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President. I want to thank the Chairman for his \nwillingness to look at this, and for all he does for American \nagriculture and a safe, secure, food supply.\n\n\n               Montana Food Stamp Standard Utility Waiver\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an amendment that \nSenator Burns and I were working with the Committee on in this \nAgriculture Appropriations bill that would\n\n[[Page S7372]]\n\nhelp Montana's senior citizens and low-income citizens. In particular, \nthis measure would provide an additional $500,000 to enable the State \nof Montana continue its food stamp program standard utility allowance \n(``SUA'') waiver. Montana is currently operating under an agreement \nwith the U.S. Department of Agriculture to continue extending the \nwaiver.\n  Montana has approximately 25,000 households using food stamps. Of \nthis number, over 19,000 would be tragically affected by the loss of \nthis waiver. For example, many elderly food stamp recipients who live \non fixed incomes and/or reside in public housing would be hard hit be \nthe loss of the Standard Utility Allowance waiver. In many such cases, \nrecords from the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services \nindicate that the loss could be higher than fifty percent of the \nbenefit.\n  Second, the state of Montana is currently serving 952 ``able-bodied \nadults without dependents.'' Many of these are either homeless or at \nrisk of losing their housing. Decreasing their current food stamp \nbenefit would only exacerbate their difficult situations.\n  Finally, many of these food stamp recipients live in Montana's 634 \ngroup homes for the disabled. The loss of the Standard Utility \nAllowance would decrease food stamps for these individuals with \ndisabilities creating further hardship for group homes which already \noperate with very little budget flexibility.\n  The entire Montana delegation has worked hard over the past two years \nin conjunction with our Montana Department of Public Health and Human \nService, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Office of \nManagement and Budget to maintain this critical program. I am pleased \nthat Senator Cochran is willing to work with Senator Burns and myself \nto address this issue within the context of this Agriculture \nAppropriations bill.\n  Mr. BURNS. I whole-heartedly support this amendment which is so \ncritical to so many Montana families. The SUA waiver is of particular \nconcern because long winters and high utility costs are something all \nMontanans face, regardless of income. This waiver allows a credit to a \nhousehold's income when determining eligibility and amount of food \nstamp benefits. Because of the unique set of challenges facing \nMontanans in terms of extreme weather conditions, termination of the \nStandard Utility Allowance could very well put many needy households at \nrisk of experiencing hunger.\n  The current SUA waiver is scheduled to expire on September 30, 2000. \nHowever, the USDA Food Nutrition Service has conditionally approved the \nextension of the Montana SUA waiver for an additional year to September \n30, 2001. A primary condition to that approval is congressional \napproval of adequate funding.\n  To date, this waiver has been very successful in its goals to provide \nnutritional assistance to low-income citizens. I strongly support \nfunding this program at $500,000 and will work with my colleagues to \nmake that happen by the end of conference.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Senators from Montana for working with the \nAgriculture Appropriations Committee to bring to our attention the need \nfor funding of this important measure.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Thank you, Senator Cochran, for your support. Montana's \nhungry families appreciate your efforts.\n\n\n            BIOINFORMATICS INSTITUTE FOR MODEL PLANT SPECIES\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wish to engage in a colloquy with the \nChairman of the Subcommittee, the Senator from Iowa, and the Senator \nfrom New Mexico regarding the establishment of a Bioinformatics \nInstitute for Model Plant Species as a collaborative effort between the \nUSDA Agriculture Research Service, New Mexico State University, and \nIowa State University.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I will be pleased to speak with my colleagues regarding \nthis issue. I understand that this is a cooperative approach to enhance \nthe accessibility and utility of genomic information for plant genetic \nresearch, and Senator Domenici championed the authorization for this \ninstitute in the recently enacted Agricultural Risk Protection Act.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The chairman is correct that this cooperatively \noperated institute would reduce duplication of effort as research \ninstitutions across the country find the need to develop bioinformatics \nsystems to validate and disseminate results from plant genomic studies. \nThree model plant species have been identified by the National Science \nFoundation, and this institute would incorporate software platforms \nthat will enable the integration of these model plant bioinformatic \nresources with crop plant bioinformatic resources.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Over the past several months, my staff and I have had the \npleasure of discussing this collaboration between Iowa State \nUniversity, New Mexico State University, and the Agriculture Research \nService with representatives of the National Center for Genome \nResources, and want to express my support for establishing this \ninstitute. It would bring research scientists from the State \nAgriculture Experiment Stations and ARS together with the expertise in \nbioinformatics and software platforms developed by NCGR and its work on \nthe Human Genome Project. Through this combination of expertise, the \ninstitute would greatly reduce the chances of having to ``reinvent the \nwheel,'' so to speak, as genomic research continues to expand into \ngreater numbers of agricultural plant species.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I concur with my colleagues' assessment that this \ninstitute would provide a valuable addition in the research area of \nplant genomics. It would let us avoid redundant genomics research in \ncrop species and leverage information for crop improvement. Funding for \nthis institute would augment existing skills and resources, rather than \nbuilding new bioinformatics infrastructure.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Funding from the Agricultural Research Service will be \nneeded to establish this institute. I understand that with the funding \nprovided for ARS in this bill, that may not be possible. I ask the \nChairman if he would assist us in the upcoming Conference Committee to \nensure that ARS funding is adequate to accommodate this important \nproject?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I want to thank my colleagues for bringing this issue to \nthe attention of the Senate. I appreciate the significance of \nestablishing this institute, and I will make every effort to \naccommodate their request in the Conference.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I want to thank the Chairman of the Subcommittee, and \nlook forward to working with him in the Conference.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I, too, thank the Chairman for his assurance.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chairman of the Subcommittee.\n\n\n            STUDY TO IMPROVE AFRICAN AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with the \ndistinguished Chairman of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee \nregarding a study to improve farming practices in Africa.\n  As the chairman knows, the Trade and Development Act of 2000 was \nsigned into law in May. This Act authorized a study on ways to improve \nAfrican agricultural practices. This study will be conducted by the \nU.S. Department of Agriculture in consultation with a land grant \nuniversity and a not-for-profit organization that has firsthand \nknowledge of African farming.\n  While a two year study is authorized, it is my understanding that \nample data and research exists supporting the need to establish a more \nformal relationship to improve farming practices in Africa.\n  To that end, I ask the Chairman if he would work with me to ensure \nthat the USDA takes up this study in a timely fashion and incorporates \nthe existing data so that we can formally implement these \nrecommendations.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I want to thank the Senator from Pennsylvania, and \nappreciate him bringing this issue to my attention.\n  As move forward, I will work with him to ensure that the USDA takes \ninto consideration the existing data and research, and completes the \nstudy within a reasonable timeframe.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Chairman for his commitment, and appreciate \nhis willingness to work with me on this important initiative.\n\n\n                          BOVINE TUBERCULOSIS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we have before the Senate the Fiscal Year \n2001 Appropriations Act for Agriculture,\n\n[[Page S7373]]\n\nRural Development, and Related Agencies (S. 2536). Included in this \nbill is funding which will, among other things, assist our nation's \nfarmers, aid rural development, preserve delicate ecosystems and \nprovide food assistance to our nation's most needy individuals. I \nsupport these measures, but I also realize that there are urgent \nagricultural emergencies which cannot be covered by the scope of the \nannual appropriations process.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The Senator from Michigan is correct in stating that \nfrequently there exist many agricultural emergencies which are best \naddressed by the action of the Secretary of Agriculture.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator from Mississippi. One agricultural \nemergency that currently affects my home state of Michigan, and which \nthreatens livestock in the Upper Midwest is bovine tuberculosis (TB). \nDue to a host of factors, Michigan is the only state in the Union where \nbovine TB has actually been transferred from livestock into the wild. \nMost frequently, this disease has been transferred from cattle to \nmembers of the Cervid family, such as whitetail deer. Deer then are \nable to transfer TB to herds of cattle, wild animals or humans. As a \nresult of this disease, neighboring states have restricted the entry of \nMichigan cattle, farmers have been required to test their cattle for \nthis disease and some livestock producers have had to eradicate their \nherds. I would ask the Senator from Wisconsin, if he believes that the \nmatter of bovine TB constitutes an emergency.\n  Mr. KOHL. I agree with the Senator from Michigan that bovine TB \nconstitutes an agricultural emergency.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator from Wisconsin. I would hope that the \nSecretary of Agriculture would declare an emergency regarding bovine \nTB. Doing so would assist areas where this disease is present and \nprevent the further spread of bovine TB.\n\n\n                        Red River Trade Council\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the Agriculture \nDiversity Project, which is administered by the Red River Trade Council \nthrough the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension \nService. The Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee has funded this \nprogram in the past, and I want to thank the Chairman and the Ranking \nMinority of the Agriculture Appropriations Committee for their support.\n  As my colleagues know, one of the areas of economy that has not \nshared in the current economic boom is agriculture. The farmers and \nthose who live and operate businesses in rural America are struggling \nfinancially to maintain not only a reasonable standard of living, but \nalso the preservation of a rural lifestyle. They are desperate to find \nways that will allow them to stay and to make a living in rural \nAmerica.\n  The Agriculture Diversification Project now underway seeks to add \nvalue to existing crop production, establish high value crop \nalternatives to those crops traditionally grown in the region, develop \nprocessing facilities, and create markets for both new crops and the \nvalue added products. One added dimension to the program in Fiscal Year \n2001 will be an Internet-based information resource for farmers and \nother rural residents intended for those who are interested in a \nsustainable rural economy through entrepreneurship, product \ndevelopment, and marketing. This new aspect of the project will demand \nadditional resources above what the Subcommittee provided in this bill. \nI hope that we might be able to provide at least $500,000 for this \nproject--which is the level of funding that the House provided in its \nbill.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am grateful that the Committee has recognized the need \nfor this project in the past and also in the legislation being \nconsidered today. However, with the expansion of this project beyond \nthe original states of North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota to \nalso include Iowa, and Nebraska, and to establish the Internet resource \na higher level of funding for this project is necessary.\n  Does the Subcommittee Chairman, the senior Senator form Mississippi, \nagree that the House level of $500,000 would be a more appropriate \nfunding level for this program?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I understand that this project is a priority for the \nMinority Leader and the Senator from North Dakota. I will work in \nconference to consider $500,000 for the Red River Trade Council's \nAgricultural Diversity Project in the final version of the Agriculture \nAppropriations bill.\n\n\n                      Land-Grant University System\n\n  Mrs. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, the Nation's Land-Grant University \nsystem is very fortunate to have historically black land-grant colleges \nand universities like Southern University of my home State of \nLouisiana, Tuskegee University of Alabama and Alcorn State of \nMississippi, to name just three of them. These universities were \ngranted Land-Grant status under the Evans-Allen law enacted by Congress \nin 1890. An amendment accepted in House of Representatives during \ndebate on the Agricultural Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2001 \nincreases formula funds for research and extension science performed at \nthese universities in a total amount of $6.8 million. There are 18 such \nhistorically black universities in America which are part of the entire \nnational land-grant university system.\n  The historically black land-grant universities play a very special \nand unique role in our nation. Since 1988, the base formula funding \nprovided to our nation's historically black colleges has eroded. \nFunding provided to these institutions through this mechanism has \nremained flat from the previous fiscal year. Investing in the 1890s \nLand-Grant institutions is a wise investment indeed. Together, our \nhistorically black land-grant universities comprise a unique asset with \nthe multi-cultural depth to enrich the research, extension and \neducation capacity of the nation. Strengthening minority serving \ninstitutions and making them equal partners in the Land-Grant System \nare key elements toward improving minority access to USDA programs. Our \nuniversities need a significant boost in infrastructure investment to \nfully participate and compete for research, extension and education \nfunding. The amendment passed by the House of Representatives would \nincrease base (formula) funding and as a result would be a significant \nstep in that direction. I appreciate Senator Cochran's recognizing the \nimportance of this funding and hope you will give strong consideration \nduring conference to acceding to the amendment passed by the House of \nRepresentatives. $6.8 million divided among the 18 historically black \ninstitutions is not much, but it does mean a great deal to these \ninstitutions and the people they serve through their research and \nextension programs.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I recognize the need to provide adequate support for the \n1890 institutions. The Senator will be pleased to know that this bill \nprovides increases above the fiscal year 2000 level for the 1890 \ninstitution's capacity building grants program and the facilities \ngrants program. I share the Senator's interest in these institutions \nand will keep her comments in mind as we work to enhance funding for \nthese programs in conference.\n  Mrs. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n             Carbon Dioxide Emissions Trading Credit Models\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I want to ask the Chairman about a small \nprovision in report language, under the Natural Resources Conservation \nService. The report encourages the agency to interface with a \nconsortium of universities on developing carbon dioxide emissions \ntrading credit models. I am just seeking clarification on the academic \nnature of the efforts described and the intent of the Committee.\n  In numerous appropriations bills and reports, the Committee and the \nSenate have reiterated the position, consistent with the unanimously-\npassed Byrd-Hagel resolution, that the Kyoto Protocol on global climate \nchange and control of greenhouse gases has not been approved by the \nSenate and must not be implemented by the Administration through the \nregulatory backdoor. Every year, language to this effect has been \nincluded in a growing number of appropriations laws, including the \nAgriculture Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2000.\n  My question arises because emissions trading is inextricably, and \nmost visibly, linked to the limits envisioned in the Kyoto Protocol. I \nassume there is no intention in the report language to be inconsistent \nwith our longstanding position on Kyoto and no implied endorsement of \nemissions trading. I\n\n[[Page S7374]]\n\nwould read the report as simply encouraging the agency in giving \ntechnical assistance to an academic research project relevant to \nagriculture.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The Senator has correctly characterized the Committee's \nintent.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak for a few minutes \nabout my amendment to the Agriculture Appropriations Bill now before \nthe Senate. The amendment identifies vital funding for Indian Country \nin four programs under the Rural Community Advancement Program. The \ncosponsors of the amendment are Senators Campbell, Inouye, Domenici, \nLeahy, Daschle, Dorgan, Feinstein, Bennett, Murray, Johnson, Hatch, \nSnowe, and Conrad.\n  First, I want to thank Chairman Cochran and Senator Kohl for their \nwork on this Agriculture Appropriations Bill. This bill provides \nfunding for a number of programs that are vital to my state of New \nMexico and to the nation.\n  The rural development programs funded in this bill are especially \nimportant for a rural state like New Mexico. Through a variety of grant \nand loan programs, rural development is helping to make sure that our \nsmaller communities are not being left behind in basic infrastructure, \nin quality of housing, in economical utilities, in community \nfacilities, or in business development. Rural development is making \ntremendous progress in improving the quality of life of our smaller \ncommunities and in Indian Country. The basic health and well being of \nrural people in New Mexico, as well as their economic future, are much \nbrighter as a result of the rural development programs.\n  This amendment is straight forward. The bill already provides $24 \nmillion for tribal programs, and I thank the Chairman and Ranking \nMember for providing this important set aside. The amendment simply \nsets the priorities for how the existing tribal funding in the bill \nshould be divided among the various Rural Development Programs. Under \nour amendment, $1 million is set aside for rural business opportunity \ngrants, $5 million for community facilities for tribal colleges, $15 \nmillion for grants for drinking water and waste disposal systems, and \n$3 million for rural business enterprise grants. These priorities have \nthe support of the National Congress of American Indians and the \nAmerican Indian Higher Education Consortium.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters from the NCAI and AIHEC \nsupporting our amendment be included in the Record at the conclusion of \nmy remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. The $15 million in water and wastewater grants in this \namendment include a special provision that allows the department to \nprovide up to 100 percent of the cost of a project for the most \neconomically disadvantaged tribes that can't otherwise qualify for a \nloan as normally required. A similar grant program was first \nestablished by Congress last year to address the urgent needs in Indian \nCountry for basic water and waste water systems. I am pleased that the \nRural Utilities Service has moved quickly this year to implement this \nnew program and we are seeing immediate results. To date, 26 grants \nhave been awarded to tribes in 14 states--from Maine to California. The \naverage grant is a little more than $400,000. The RUS already has in \nhand requests for many millions of dollars in important projects for \nnext year. This amendment will provide the funding to address these \nurgent needs.\n  In addition, the amendment provides $5 million in much needed funding \nfor facilities construction and maintenance at our 33 tribal colleges \nthat comprise the American Indian Higher Education Consortium, AIHEC. \nMany of these institutions are operating in donated, abandoned, and in \nsome cases, even condemned structures. Hazards include leaking roofs, \nasbestos insulation, exposed and substandard wiring, and crumbling \nfoundations. Tribal colleges receive little or no funding from the \nstates. These institutions are located on federal trust land and are a \nfederal responsibility. The $5 million provided in this amendment will \nbegin to address the backlog in facility requirements for tribal \ncolleges.\n  The development of new businesses in Indian Country is one key to \nself sufficiency for Native American communities. The amendment \nprovides $3 million in rural business enterprise grants to support the \ndevelopment of small and emerging tribal business enterprises. These \nfunds can be used to develop land, construct buildings and factories, \npurchase equipment, provide road access and parking areas, extend basic \nutilities, or provide technical assistance, startup and operating \ncosts, or working capital for new business.\n  Finally, the amendment provides a $1 million set aside for tribal \nrural business opportunity grants. Tribes may use these funds to \nanalyze business opportunities that will make use of the existing \neconomic and human resources in Indian Country. Funding can also be \nused to train tribal entrepreneurs and to establish business support \ncenters. Unemployment rates in Indian Country are the highest in the \nnation, sometimes topping 50 percent. Development of new business \nopportunities on tribal lands is one of the keys to improving the \nstandard of living in Native American communities.\n  Congress established the rural development programs to assist in the \neconomic development of rural areas of the nation with the highest \npercentage of low-income residents. Today, some of the most \neconomically disadvantaged communities in America are in Indian \nCountry. The $24 million set aside in this bill for tribal programs \nrepresents only a tiny percentage of the total funding available for \nRural Community Advancement Programs. This funding will begin to \naddress the needs of some of America's poorest communities.\n  Again, I want to thank Chairman Cochran and Senator Kohl for their \nsupport for the tribal funding in this bill. These are important \nprograms to help deal with the critical needs of our tribes. I hope the \nSenate will support our amendment.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                              National Congress of\n\n\n                                             American Indians,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 24, 2000.\n\n     Re Support for Bingaman Tribal Amendment\n\n       Dear Senator:The National Congress of American Indians \n     (NCAI), the oldest and most representatives Indian advocacy \n     organization, respectfully request your support for an \n     amendment to be offered by Senator Jeff Bingaman to S. 2536, \n     the FY2001 Agriculture Appropriations bill during full Senate \n     consideration. This amendment would designate the $24 million \n     currently proposed for water and wastewater loans and grants \n     in the Indian Rural Utilities Service (RUS) programs into \n     four grant programs: 1) Rural Business Opportunity Grants; 2) \n     Community Facilities Grants for Tribal College Improvements; \n     3) Drinking Water and Waste Disposal Systems for Economically \n     Disadvantaged Tribes; and 4) Rural Business Enterprise \n     Grants.\n       NCAI supports this amendment because it designates the \n     funds for grant programs that are targeted to the specific \n     rural development needs of tribes and tribal colleges, rather \n     than for the general purpose of benefiting federally \n     recognized Native American tribes.\n       In FY2000, Senator Bingaman was instrumental in securing \n     the original set aside of $12 million for the Indian RUS \n     program. To date, 19 Indian projects have been funded, with \n     five requests on hand, and an additional four that are or \n     forthcoming.\n       NCAI respectfully request your support of the Bingaman \n     Tribal amendment when it is offered for full Senate \n     consideration. If you have any questions in regards to this \n     amendment, please contact me or Victoria Wright, NCAI \n     Legislative Associate at (202) 466-7767.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   JoAnn K. Chase,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            American Indian Higher\n\n\n                                         Education Consortium,\n\n                                        Alexandria, VA, July 2000.\n       Dear Senator: The 33 Tribal Colleges and Universities that \n     comprise the American Indian Higher Education Consortium \n     (AIHEC) respectfully request your support of the Bingaman \n     amendment to be offered during Senate consideration of the \n     FY01 Agriculture Appropriations bill (S. 2536/H.R. 4461). \n     This amendment would simply allocate the proposed $24 million \n     available for loans and grants to federally recognized \n     American Indian tribes through the Rural Community \n     Advancement Program into four grant programs: 1) Rural \n     Business Opportunity Grants; 2) Community Facilities Grants \n     for Tribal College Improvements; 3) Drinking Water and Water \n     Disposal Systems for Economically Disadvantaged Tribes; and \n     4) Rural Business Enterprise Grants.\n       Tribal Colleges serve as community centers, providing \n     libraries, tribal archives, child care centers, nutrition and \n     substance abuse counseling and a broad range of other vitally \n     needed facilities to their rural communities. Yet, many of \n     our colleges are still\n\n[[Page S7375]]\n\n     operating in trailers, renovated gymnasiums, reclaimed \n     abandoned BIA facilities with leaking roofs, exposed and \n     substandard wiring and crumbling foundations. The Federal \n     government has never funded authorized facilities programs \n     for the Tribal Colleges. The Rural Community Programs were \n     created to assist in the development of essential community \n     facilities located in rural areas with a high concentration \n     of low-income residents. This is by definition of the \n     reservation communities served by the Tribal Colleges.\n       Our 33 colleges, 26,000 students and the 250 tribal nations \n     we serve are extremely grateful to Senator Bingaman for \n     championing this effort and for your support. The inclusion \n     of the amendment will be a first step in bringing the Tribal \n     Colleges much needed resources to address critical facilities \n     needs.\n           Respectfully,\n                                             Veronica N. Gonzales,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the agricultural appropriations bill is \nvery important bill--it provides federal assistance to our nation's \nfarming communities, funds social service programs for women and \nchildren, and addresses natural resource management needs across the \ncountry.\n  I commend Chairman Cochran and other members of the Agriculture \nAppropriations subcommittee for their hard work to complete this year's \nbill. So, it is with regret that I had to vote against passage of this \nbill.\n  Mr. President, approval of the annual budget is among our most \nserious responsibilities. We are the trustees of billions of taxpayer \ndollars, and we should evaluate every spending decision with great \ndeliberation and without prejudice.\n  Unfortunately, each year, we find new ways to violate budget policy. \nAppropriators have employed every sidestepping method in the book to \ncircumvent Senate rules and common budget principles that are supposed \nto strictly guide the appropriations process. The excessive fodder and \ntrickery have never been greater, resulting in the shameless waste of \nmillions of taxpayer dollars. Included in this bill is more than $243 \nmillion in pork-barrel spending and additional ``emergency spending'' \nat the cost of $2 billion.\n  Traditional earmarks run rampant in this bill and its accompanying \nreport for unrequested and low-priority spending. Other sly methods are \nalso utilized to secure funding for parochial projects. If a direct \namount is not earmarked, then the committee has covertly directed the \nUSDA to grant special consideration to certain projects that would \notherwise be subject to a competitive grant review. Appropriations \nbills are also popular targets to attach policy riders which clearly \nhave no place in budget bills.\n  Another $2 billion in designated ``emergency'' spending was also \nadded to this bill for various crop and disaster related assistance. \nThis ``emergency'' spending is in addition to billions already spent in \nthe past few years for farm relief spending, as well as other \nsupplemental appropriations included in the military conference report \nfor fiscal year 2000, and several billion more included in the recently \npassed crop insurance reform bill.\n  I rise today to tell my colleagues that I object.\n  I object to the $243 million in directed earmarks for special \ninterest projects in this bill. I object to sidestepping the \nlegislative process by attaching erroneous riders to an appropriations \nbill. I object to speeding through appropriations bills without \nadequate review by all members. I object to budget gimmickry practiced \nby attaching non-germane and non-priority items to appropriations bills \nand designating them as ``emergencies'' to avoid exceeding budget \nallocations.\n  It is no surprise that many of these earmarks are included for \npolitical glamour rather than practical purposes. Members can go back \nto their districts to ride in public parades and garner votes at the \nexpense of average citizens who are struggling to maintain minimum wage \njobs.\n\n  Again, some of these items are not particularly objectionable on an \nindividual basis. However, I am merely objecting to the way these \nprojects have been selectively identified and prioritized for earmarks \nwhen so many other needs around our country go unaddressed. Other items \nclearly do not belong in this particular bill and, therefore, could be \nsubject to budget points-of-order.\n  Numerous earmarks are included that are of questionable relation or \npriority to the purposes of this bill. A few examples are:\n  $20 million for construction of a Los Angeles replacement laboratory \nand office space project in California;\n  $3.5 million for the Delta Teachers Academy;\n  $5 million for demonstration housing grants for agriculture, \naquaculture, and seafood processing works in Mississippi and Alaska;\n  $500,000 for cooperative efforts with the Claude E. Phillips \nHerbarium in Delaware;\n  $87,000 for North American Studies in Texas;\n  $436,000 for a clean air PM-10 study in Washington;\n  $2,150,000 for a rural health program in Mississippi to train health \ncare workers to serve in rural areas; and,\n  An additional $520,000 for seven additional inspectors at the U.S.-\nMexico Border at the San Diego ports of entry.\n  Again, Mr. President, these projects may be meritorious and helpful \nto the designated communities, but they do not appear appropriate to \ntag onto this year's agriculture spending bill. This appropriations \nmeasure is intended to address farmers, women, children and rural \ncommunities with the greatest need. Yet, by diverting millions to non-\nagricultural needs, we fail in this responsibility, forcing Congress to \npass ad-hoc emergency spending bills with billions in farm relief and \nbail-outs for producers who cannot pay back their federal loans.\n  I hope my colleagues will agree that we have higher spending \npriorities that are directly related to the purposes of this \nagriculture bill. Had we more responsibility allocated funding in these \nappropriations bills, we certainly could have avoided this type of \negregious pork-barrel and emergency ad hoc spending which cuts deep \ninto the budget surplus.\n  Mr. President, I have compiled a list of objectionable provisions in \nthis bill and its accompanying report. However, the list is too lengthy \nto include in the Record, but will be available from my Senate office.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the American food supply is one of the \nsafest in the world--but it is not safe enough. Over 75 million \nAmericans a year are stricken by disease caused by contaminated food \nthey eat. Each year, 9,000 people--mostly the very young and the very \nold--die as a result. The costs of medical treatment and losses in \nproductivity from these illnesses are as high as $37 billion annually.\n  The emergency of highly virulent strains of bacteria, and the \nincrease in the number of organisms resistant to antibiotics, are \ncompounding these problems and making foodborne illnesses an \nincreasingly serious public health challenge.\n  Americans deserve to know that the foods they eat are safe, \nregardless of their source. Yet too many citizens today are at \nunnecessary risk of foodborne diseases. This Congress can make a \ndifference. The FDA requested a budget increase of $30 million in 2001 \nfor its Food Safety Initiative activities. With these additional funds, \nthe FDA can improve its inspection of high-risk food establishments and \nstrengthen its laboratory capabilities. Without this funding, the \nagency will conduct 700 fewer inspections next year. The Senate \nAppropriations Committee recognized the importance of protecting our \nfood supply by granting the FDA the majority of its requested increase \nfor food safety. The amendment I propose will give the FDA the \nadditional $6 million it needs for these efforts.\n  In response to improved surveillance and increased sampling and \ntesting, illnesses from the most common bacterial foodborne pathogens \ndecreased by 21 percent from 1997 to 1999. As a result, 855,000 fewer \nAmericans each year suffer from foodborne diseases. But contaminated \nfood still remains a significant public health problem.\n  Recently, a new strain of an organism contaminated oysters in Texas, \nand caused an epidemic of diarrhea. This year, the FDA recalled several \nsmoked fish products manufactured in New York because of outbreaks of \ndisease. In March, 500 college students in Massachusetts became ill \nwith Norwalk-like virus. Each year there are also at least 4700 cases \nof Salmonella in Massachusetts. We must do more to protect our citizens \nfrom foodborne diseases.\n\n[[Page S7376]]\n\n  Imported foods are a significant part of the problem and often pose \nespecially serious health risks. Americans are consuming foods from \nother countries at increasing rates. Since 1992, the number of food \nimports has tripled. At that time, the FDA was able to inspect only 8 \npercent of these imports. Since then the rate of FDA inspections of \nimported food has dropped to less than 1 percent, because resources did \nnot increase for monitoring these imports.\n  Other countries have often not implemented food safety protections \ncomparable to those in the United States, and general sanitary \nconditions are often poor. As a consequence, foods from such countries \nare more likely to be contaminated with disease-producing organisms. In \n1995, 242 people contracted Salmonella from alfalfa sprouts imported \nfrom the Netherlands. In 1996, over 1,400 people became ill from \ncontaminated raspberries from Guatemala. Just this year, infected \nshrimp from Vietnam caused Salmonella and E. coli outbreaks.\n  In earlier decades, diseases such as tuberculosis and cholera were \nthe focus of food safety concerns. Today diseases caused by dangerous \nnew strains of E. coli have become primary causes of foodborne illness. \nThese new organisms necessitate increased investment in research, \ntechnology, and surveillance to protect the safety of our food supply.\n  Food safety efforts are also especially important to protect the \ngrowing number of individuals in vulnerable populations, such as young \nchildren, the elderly, those with lowered immunity from HIV, and those \nwith inadequate access to health care.\n  By providing the FDA with the necessary resources to combat foodborne \ndiseases, we can protect tens of millions of our fellow citizens across \nthe country each year. Investment in food safety is an investment in \nthe health of every American. Congress should give the FDA the \nresources it needs in order to ensure the safety of the food we eat. \nThe amendment I am proposing is a major step to meet this challenge, \nand I urge the Senate to approve it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for and \ncosponsorship of the Hatch-Durbin amendment to the Agriculture \nAppropriations bill to increase funding for the Office of Generic Drugs \n(OGD) at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by $2 million.\n  As we all know, the high costs of prescription drugs are on the minds \nof Americans because having access to affordable prescription drugs is \nessential for people of all ages. Over the next 5 years, the patents of \nname brand drugs with approximately $22 billion in sales will expire. \nConsumers will save millions of dollars from generic prescription drug \nalternatives. This will help to alleviate cost pressures facing some of \nour most vulnerable citizens--seniors and the chronically ill.\n  The FDA will be able to help make drugs more affordable only if it \nhas adequate resources to review and approve generic drug applications \nin a timely manner. In recent years, I have worked with Senators \nSpecter, Harkin, and other cosponsors of this amendment to urge our \ncolleagues to increase funds for the Office of Generic Drugs. These \nefforts have paid off in a reduction in the backlog of generic drug \napplications. Unfortunately, the President did not request an increase \nfor the Office of Generic Drugs for the 2001 fiscal year. However, the \nworkload for the office continues to increase and for the first time in \nseveral years, the backlog of applications has increased rather than \ncontinue to decline.\n  An increase of $2 million for the Office of Generic Drugs will be \nused for training and the upgrade of information technology systems \nthat will allow for the electronic submission and review of generic \ndrug applications.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment. This \namendment will put the review record of the Office of Generic Drugs \nback on course.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Department of \nAgriculture and Related Agencies Appropriations bill for fiscal year \n2001.\n  The Senate-reported bill provides $75.1 billion in new budget \nauthority (BA) and $39.4 billion in new outlays to fund most of the \nprograms of the Department of Agriculture and other related agencies. \nAll of the discretionary funding in this bill is nondefense spending.\n  When outlays from prior-year appropriations and other adjustments are \ntaken into account, the Senate-reported bill totals $64.2 billion in BA \nand $46.7 billion in outlays for FY 2001. Including mandatory savings, \nthe subcommittee is at its 302(b) allocation in both BA and outlays.\n  The Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee 302(b) allocation \ntotals $64.4 billion in BA and $46.7 billion in outlays. Within this \namount, $14.9 billion in BA and $15.0 billion in outlays is for \nnondefense discretionary spending.\n  For discretionary spending in the bill, and counting (scoring) all \nthe mandatory savings in the bill, the Senate-reported bill is $315 \nmillion in BA and $6 million in outlays below the subcommittee's 302(b) \nallocation. It is $75 million in BA below and $131 million in outlays \nabove the 2000 level for discretionary spending, and $630 million in BA \nand $77 million in outlays below the President's request for these \nprograms.\n  I recognize the difficulty of bringing this bill to the floor at its \n302(b) allocation. I appreciate the committee's support for a number of \nongoing projects and programs important to my home State of New Mexico \nas it has worked to keep this bill within its budget allocation.\n  I urge adoption of the bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nSenate Budget Committee scoring of the bill be inserted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n S. 2536, AGRICULTURE APPROPRIATIONS, 2001 SPENDING COMPARISONS--SENATE-\n                              REPORTED BILL\n                [Fiscal year 2001 in millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                          General\n                                          purpose   Mandatory    Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\n  Budget authority.....................     14,539     49,616     64,155\n  Outlays..............................     14,961     31,775     46,736\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority.....................     14,584     49,616     64,470\n  Outlays..............................     14,967     31,775     46,742\n2000 level:\n  Budget authority.....................     14,614     50,295     64,909\n  Outlays..............................     14,830     33,088     47,918\nPresident's request\n  Budget authority.....................     15,169     49,616     64,785\n  Outlays..............................     15,038     31,775     46,813\n \n    SENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED TO\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority.....................       -315  .........       -315\n  Outlays..............................         -6  .........         -6\n2000 level:\n  Budget authority.....................        -75       -679       -754\n  Outlays..............................        131     -1,313     -1,182\nPresident's request\n  Budget authority.....................       -630  .........       -630\n  Outlays..............................        -77  .........       -77\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote.--Details may not add to totals due to rounding. Totals adjusted\n  for consistency with scorekeeping conventions.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of H.R. \n4461, the FY2001 Agriculture appropriations bill. I commend Senator \nCochran for bringing forward what I believe is a solid bill to fund \nthose programs of greatest importance to production agriculture and \nrural America. The task to complete this legislation is never easy, but \nthe Senator from Mississippi has again worked to craft a bill that \nserves the states of all members of the Senate.\n  In this era of tight budget caps, crafting this legislation becomes \nmore difficult each year. Despite these difficulties, the chairman has \nstill found a way to provide increases in funding for several vital \nprograms, including:\n  Farm Service Agency Staffing +$20 million from FY00; Conservation \nPrograms +$63.4 million; Food Safety Inspection Service +$29 million; \nand Agricultural Research +60.4 million.\n  Mr. President, I know that many Senators and our constituents are \noften upset to see increases in funding for federal staffing. But, I \nmust tell you that this increase in funding for FSA staffing is \nessential.\n  The Farm Service Agency is responsible for distributing all AMTA, \nLDP, and market loss payments and programs to our producers. With the \nlow prices of the past two years, these staff have faced a tremendous \nworkload. These programs are essential to our producers and without \nproper staffing the delivery of these programs will be delayed. This is \nfunding that will benefit our producers.\n  The productivity of today's U.S. agricultural machine is a modern day \nmiracle that is a model for the rest of the world. We grow more food, \nfor more people, on less land each year. Much of this productivity is a \ndirect result of the commitment Congress has provided to agricultural \nresearch in the past. Additional research and productivity\n\n[[Page S7377]]\n\nwill be essential, as the world's population continues to grow in the \nnext fifty years. The U.S. must be a leader in this area, and I thank \nthe chairman for his commitment to research funding in this \nlegislation.\n  In addition, I want to thank the chairman for the additional funding \nprovided for the Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS). Kansas is the \nlargest beef packing state in the country and beef accounts for nearly \n\\1/2\\ the farm income in my state each year. We have many small plants \nand lockers located throughout the state, and we have the ``Big 4'' \npackers located within a 100-mile radius of each other in the \nsouthwestern part of the state. These plants have experienced inspector \nshortages at several points during the past year. These shortages \nresult in reduced production chain speeds, which results in lost income \nfor the processors, and fewer cattle being slaughtered which directly \naffects the pocketbooks of my cowboys and cattle ranchers, I am hopeful \nFSIS will use this money to hire inspectors and locate them in those \nareas where they are most needed.\n\n  I think it is also important to point out the significantly larger \namount of funding for USDA agricultural export programs in the Senate \nbill compared to the House Agricultural Appropriations bill. We need \nfull funding of these programs if our producers are to continue gaining \nadditional world market shares, and I am hopeful the Senate position \nwill prevail in conference with the House.\n  Finally, I thank the chairman for the funding he has provided for \ncontinued wheat and grain sorghum research in the State of Kansas \nthrough the Agricultural Research Service and Kansas State University. \nKansas is the No. 1 producer of both wheat and grain sorghum in the \nU.S. Thus, the two crops play a vital role in our state's agricultural \neconomy. This funding will allow us to continue research that allows us \nto combat emerging diseases in these crops and to find better ways to \nmarket them as well.\n  Again, I thank the Chairman for his efforts on this legislation. As \nalways, he and staff--Rebecca Davies, Martha Scott Poindexter, Les \nSpivey, and Hunt Shipman--have taken very difficult budget numbers and \nhave gone out of their way to address the needs of the constituents of \nall members of the Senate. They should be applauded for their work, and \nI urge my colleagues to support quick passage of this important piece \nof legislation.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, during consideration of the 1990 Farm \nBill, a provision was inserted granting the USDA Graduate School the \nability to enter non-competitive, interagency agreements for the \nprovision of training services to other agencies. The Graduate School \npursues and enters into these side agreements with other Federal \nagencies on a non-competitive basis. The private sector is shut out, \nunable to bid on these contracts.\n  Section 1669 enables the United States Department of Agriculture \nGraduate School (Graduate School) to accept non-competitive agreements \nfrom federal agencies to provide training and other human resource \nservices. The provision limits--and even discourages--competition in \ncontracting, the cornerstone of fair and equitable pricing in the award \nof government contracts.\n  Despite its name and 80-year history, the Graduate School is not a \npart of the federal government. The Comptroller General of the United \nStates ruled that the Graduate School is a ``Non-Appropriated Fund \nInstrumentality'' (NAFI). NAFIs do not receive budget authority or \nappropriations from Congress and are supported entirely by fees or \nprices for their services. Like other NAFIs the Graduate School is not \nsubject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations, the Freedom of \nInformation Act, or other laws and regulations governing the operations \nof federal agencies. The Comptroller General ruled that the Graduate \nSchool, as a NAFI, is not a proper recipient of interagency order from \nGovernment agencies for training services. And under law, these orders \nare only permissible if a commercial enterprise can't provide the goods \nor services as conveniently or cheaply.\n  Various federal laws do indeed provide preferential treatment for \neconomically disadvantaged firms in the award of government contracts. \nUnder these programs administered and monitored by federal agencies, \nsuch as the Small Business Administration, Department of Labor, and \nDepartment of Commerce, many small businesses, minority-owned \nenterprises, and firms in labor surplus areas qualify by meeting \nestablished regulatory standards.\n  The Graduate School, however is not economically disadvantaged. The \nGraduate School earned net profits exceeding $13 million over the past \nfive years. Effective on the close of its 1998 fiscal year on September \n30, its net worth was $18.5 million; its aggregate retained earnings \n(1993-1998) were $13.3 million, and its current asset/liability ratio \nwas 2.01. In spite of this financially advantageous position, the \nGraduate School pays ``bargain rate'' non-profit postage, receives \ndonated space and services from federal agencies, and pays no federal \nincome tax.\n  Only the Graduate School benefits from the preferential treatment \nafforded by Section 1669.\n  The Graduate School has government subsidized facilities in \nWashington, D.C., Chicago, Philadelphia, Honolulu, Atlanta, Dallas, and \nSan Francisco. It offers a range of business, finance and management \ncourses that could be offered by hundreds of local community colleges \nor private training firms.\n  The Graduate School benefits at the expense of small and large tax-\npaying businesses and is not selling any commodity they could not \nprovide. Indeed, many large and small-business training enterprises are \nready, willing, and able to compete for the Graduate School's share of \nagency training budgets.\n  Mr. President, competition requires a level playing field. Without \nit, American taxpayers take the hit. And agencies and taxpayers are not \nreceiving the benefits for quality and pricing that competition \nprovides. In Section 1669 restrictive, narrowly based, preferential \nlegislation undermines proven forces of the market economy to determine \nfair and equitable prices. Section 1669 of the 1990 Agriculture Act (PL \n101-624) must be repealed.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate passed by a margin of \n74-21 the Jeffords-Dorgan amendment to allow for importation of FDA-\napproved prescription medicines by licensed pharmacists and drug \nwholesalers. This amendment addresses a very important issue for \nAmerican consumers, especially for senior citizens who must pay for \ntheir medicines out of their own pockets. The same medications sold in \nthe United States are also sold in Canada and other countries, often at \nsubstantially lower prices. This amendment has the potential to save \nAmerican consumers millions of dollars by giving them access to their \nmedicines at these lower prices at their local pharmacies.\n  I am pleased that this amendment has the support of the National \nCommunity Pharmacists Association, and I ask unanimous consent that a \nletter of support from the NCPA be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                National Community\n\n\n                                      Pharmacists Association,\n\n                                                    July 17, 2000.\n     Re H.R. 4461--Ag Appropriations Jeffords/Dorgan/Wellstone et \n         al., amendment.\n\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the independent pharmacists in \n     your state, I would like to express the National Community \n     Pharmacists Associations' endorsement of the strongly \n     bipartisan cited amendment that safely allows American \n     consumers to benefit from international price competition for \n     prescription medicines.\n       The Jeffords/Dorgan/Wellstone amendment is designed to \n     permit the importation of prescription drugs by American \n     pharmacies so long as the drugs meet Food and Drug \n     Administration standards, including compliance with current \n     good manufacturing practices. Such FDA-approved drugs are \n     sold in Canada, the United Kingdom, EU countries, and other \n     countries for prices considerable lower than the best prices \n     available to retailers in this country. We agree with its \n     sponsors that it ``is a fair commonsense, free-market \n     approach to lowering drug prices for constituents while \n     benefiting small businesses'' and that ``it's outrageous that \n     Americans should have to resort to crossing borders to \n     purchase their prescriptions. We should be able to buy our \n     medications at reasonable prices from pharmacies in our \n     neighborhoods.''\n       This amendment encourages and supports the role of \n     pharmacists in our health care system and strengthens their \n     ability to continue to provide affordable, critical products \n     and services. It also will likely encourage\n\n[[Page S7378]]\n\n     more employers to continue and even initiate prescription \n     drug coverage for their employees.\n       The objectives of this amendment are fully compatible with \n     the 1988, Prescription Drug Marketing Act [PL 100-293] \n     authored by your former colleague Spark Matsunaga and the \n     dean of the House of Representatives, Representative John \n     Dingell. This law in an effort to prevent the importation of \n     counterfeit or adulterated prescription drugs banned \n     reimportation of all prescription drugs, except by \n     manufacturers. The proposed amendment would authorize \n     importation including reimportation by legitimate \n     pharmacists, pharmacists buying groups and wholesalers. Under \n     the amendment, pharmacies and wholesalers importing drugs \n     would still have to meet the same standards set by FDA, which \n     allowed $12.8 billion worth of Rx drugs to be imported into \n     the U.S. by manufacturers in 1997.\n       Obviously, imports by legitimate businesses including the \n     independent pharmacies will not increase counterfeit drugs \n     and will not put the health of American consumers at risk. To \n     claim otherwise would at best be deceptive.\n       According to the United States International Trade \n     Commission staff, more than 16% of the prescription drugs \n     consumed by American patients were in fact imported. Typical, \n     would be a nasal inhaler for asthma patients whose labeling \n     reads ``Assembled in Great Britain from products manufactured \n     in Great Britain, Sweden, and Finland and manufactured for \n     Astra USA, Inc. Westborough, MA.''\n       Further, the amendment provides for a paper trail to assure \n     that the drugs are properly transported and stored; and to \n     prevent the importation of counterfeit, adulterated or other \n     inappropriate prescription drugs. It also allows for testing \n     of imported drugs when appropriate.\n       It is noteworthy that both the FDA and the PMA (now PhRMA) \n     testified against and otherwise opposed the 1988 \n     reimportation provision. Now the drug maker organization has \n     done a 180, claiming that limiting reimports to them protects \n     the public and disingenuously claiming that community retail \n     pharmacy is not a competitive marketplace and that, \n     consequently, any lower acquisition cost available to \n     community pharmacies would benefit consumers only if \n     pharmacies were forced through price controls to pass on \n     savings to patients.\n       The truth is that the community pharmacy marketplace has \n     virtually all of the characteristics of a healthy competitive \n     marketplace. It has a significant number of widely dispersed, \n     diversely owned businesses that are readily available to \n     consumers. These competitive businesses predictably have \n     modest gross margins or markups and low profits. What these \n     businesses do not have is access to fairly priced branded Rxs \n     based on economies of scale. Drugmakers, through \n     discriminatory pricing practices, are responsible for this \n     unhealthy characteristic of the community pharmacy \n     marketplace.\n       In addition to the strong and growing number of bipartisan \n     cosponsors, Congress has already taken key steps in support \n     of the Jeffords/Dorgan/Wellstone approach. On April 6, 2000, \n     the Senate approved the Gorton/Jeffords Sense of the Senate \n     resolution that the ``cost disparity between identical \n     prescription drugs sold in the United States, Canada and \n     Mexico should be reduced or eliminated.'' On Monday, July 10, \n     2000, two relevant and significant amendments were approved \n     by the House of Representatives on the Agriculture \n     Appropriation bill, H.R. 4461. The first amendment was \n     approved 363 to 12. It forbids the FDA from enforcing the ban \n     on reimportation. The second amendment was approved 370 to \n     12. It prevents any FDA action regarding prescription drugs \n     manufactured in FDA approved facilities in the US, Canada and \n     Mexico. Notably, the House Commerce Committee Chairman and \n     its five subcommittee chairs voted for both of these \n     amendments.\n       A recent survey by the Senior Citizens League found that \n     88% of seniors favor the Jeffords/Dorgan/Wellstone amendment \n     to allow safe prescription drugs to be imported from Canada \n     and other countries.\n       The small businesses, independent health care professionals \n     we represent are the preferred choice of American consumers. \n     Our members function in the market in a variety of forms. \n     They do business as single stores ranging from apothecaries \n     to full line high volume pharmacies; as independent chains \n     (e.g. 100 pharmacies) and as franchises (e.g. Medicine \n     Shoppe, 1200 pharmacies). Whatever the form of business \n     entity, however, independent pharmacists are the decision \n     makers for this wide variety of NCPA member companies.\n       The most in depth consumer survey to date conducted by \n     Consumer Reports, involving 15,000 consumers, published last \n     fall, found that consumers preferred independently owned \n     pharmacies for several reasons: Independents provided more \n     personal attention; Independents provided more useful \n     information about both prescription and nonprescription \n     drugs; Independent druggists were seen as more professional, \n     more sensitive to families' needs, and easier to talk to; \n     Independents kept consumers waiting less time for drugs, had \n     prescriptions ready for pickup more often, and provided out-\n     of-stock medicine faster\n       Our 1200 plus independently owned members in the Medicine \n     Shoppes franchise were ranked second; the supermarket \n     drugstores were third, the mass merchandisers were fourth; \n     and the worst stores overall were the big corporate run \n     chains. No preference was expressed for mail order.\n       The community pharmacist of today is simultaneously a \n     health care professional and a small businessperson. As \n     owners, managers, and employees of independent pharmacies, \n     our member's 30,000 pharmacies and our 75,000 are committed \n     to provide legislative and regulatory initiatives, which are \n     designed to protect the public; to provide them a level \n     playing field and a fair chance to compete; and to provide \n     quality pharmacists services to your constituents. The \n     Jeffords/Dorgan/Wellstone et. al. amendments with its safe, \n     but free trade approach, meets each of these criteria.\n       We urge you to vote for the Jeffords/Dorgan/Wellstone \n     amendment to H.R. 4461. It will unleash market forces to help \n     reduce the cost of safe prescription drugs for all of your \n     constituents, including seniors.\n           Warm Regards,\n\n                                               John M. Rector,\n\n                                            Senior Vice President,\n                           Government Affairs and General Counsel.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Cochran, my chairman, \nand his fine staff for the efficient completion of S. 2536. My friend \nfrom Mississippi has conducted this debate--as he always does--in a \nbalanced, fair, and non partisan manner. He is a gentleman and a \nfriend, and it is an honor and a pleasure to work with him.\n  The bill we just passed includes funding for a wide variety of \nprograms important to the American people. This is especially true now \ndue to economic conditions in rural America which have not kept pace \nwith the general prosperity enjoyed by most Americans.\n  The bill also responds quickly and adequately to the very real crisis \nthat has hit the dairy industry across this nation. Last December, milk \nprices dropped unexpectedly and dramatically. Today, the base price \nfarmers receive for their milk is $9.46. The average base price for \n1998 was $14.21, and the average for 1999 was $12.43.\n  Those cold numbers cannot express the hard damage that has been done \nto dairy farmers and their families throughout my State, and throughout \nthe nation. They add up to families that have stopped milking after \ngenerations, and rural towns that are collapsing as farms disappear. \nAmerica's dairyland is in real danger of becoming a wasteland.\n  And today with this bill, the Senate has responded with emergency \npayments to the small farmers hardest hit by this disaster. I am proud \nof this institution for putting aside regional differences and \ninterests, and for seeing this provision as--not just helping Wisconsin \nfarmers, or Vermont farmers, or Pennsylvanian farmers--but as helping \nAmerican families.\n  I also thank the Senator from West Virginia, the distinguished \nranking member of the Appropriations Committee, for his vital \nassistance in securing these emergency dairy payments. At the end of \nlast year, when we spent a great deal of the Senate's time on dairy \nissues, he listened to me and to the unique struggles of Wisconsin \ndairy farmers. He said then he would do whatever he could to help. And \nhe has. He is a man who speaks some of the most inspiring and powerful \nwords spoken on the Senate floor--and he is a man of those words. It is \nan honor to serve with him.\n  This is a good bill and, again, we should all congratulate Senator \nCochran for his fine leadership of our subcommittee. I also want to \nthank the members of my staff who have helped make this process run as \nsmoothly as it has this year: Paul Bock, my chief of staff, and Ben \nMiller, who is new on my staff this year, have done a fine job. Special \nthanks goes to the subcommittee's minority clerk, Galen Fountain, \nwithout whom I do not believe there could be an Agriculture bill in the \nSenate. His knowledge of the subject, his patience, his loyalty, and \nhis work ethic are legendary around here, and deservedly so.\n  I look forward to moving this bill through conference quickly, and \nhaving a solid Agriculture budget in place well before October 1st.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, there are no more amendments. I \nappreciate very much the cooperation of all Senators. We are ready to \ngo to third reading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there are no further amendments, the \nquestion is on the engrossment of the amendments and third reading of \nthe bill.\n\n[[Page S7379]]\n\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read \nthe third time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill, as amended, pass?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Did we just pass the bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair has not yet announced the final \npassage of the bill.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I want to express my deepest appreciation \nfor the excellent cooperation of our professional staff members of the \nAppropriations Committee. Our subcommittee staff, in particular, led by \nour chief clerk, Rebecca Davies, and other staff members, including \nMartha Scott Poindexter; Hunt Shipman; Les Spivey; and Coy Neal; the \nminority professional staff, Galen Fountain and Carole Geagley; the \nfull committee staff member, Jay Kimmitt; Senator Kohl's personal staff \nmembers, Ben Miller and Paul Bock. They were all enormously helpful in \nthe handling of this legislation and the passage of this legislation \ntonight in the Senate. For all of their assistance, I am deeply \ngrateful.\n  I also have to thank Senator Herb Kohl, the distinguished ranking \nmember of the Democratic side of the aisle on this subcommittee.\n  I appreciate the able assistance we received during the final, \ncrucial stages of the handling of this bill from Senator Lott, the \nmajority leader; Senator Stevens, chairman of the full Committee on \nAppropriations; and Senator Reid of Nevada, who provided assistance all \nduring the handling of the bill on the floor of the Senate today. We \nappreciate all of the good work they did.

The Senator from Delaware is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ROTH. Madam President, tomorrow this Senate will approve the \nMarriage Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2000. This is a great victory \nfor the American family--all of America's families. It is not one that \nhas been won for America's families, as much as it has been earned by \nAmerica's families.\n  This bill is the centerpiece of our efforts to reduce the tax \noverpayment by American taxpayers. It is fair, it is responsible, it is \nthe right thing to do for American families. And it is long overdue \nthat they receive it.\n  The provisions in this bill will help 45 million families. That is \nsubstantially every family in the U.S. Some of my colleagues have \nargued that almost half of those families--21 million families located \nin every state in this country--do not deserve any tax relief. I reject \nthat. I reject it because in my home state of Delaware it would mean \nleaving over 30,000 families that contributed to our ever-growing \nbudget surplus out of family tax relief.\n  Why should the family in which one spouse stays home to raise the \nchildren and keep the house not receive a tax break? Does that spouse \nnot work? Do you imagine that spouse doesn't work just because she or \nhe does not get paid? Does that family not count? They do in Delaware, \nthey do in this country, and they do in this bill.\n  All of these American families have contributed to the record surplus \nthat we have in Washington. They deserve to get some of it back. I \nbelieved that three months ago when I first unveiled this package. And \nI believe it even more so now in light of estimates recently released \nby the Congressional Budget Office.\n  Today's bill amounts to less than 5 percent of the total budget \nsurplus over the next 5 years. That is less than a nickel on the dollar \nof our total budget surplus. It amounts to just 9 percent of the total \nnon-Social Security surplus over the next five years. That is less than \na dime on the dollar of the non-Social Security surplus. A nickel and a \ndime. By any comparison or estimation, this marriage tax relief is \nfiscally responsible. Those who dispute that are themselves seeking to \n``nickel-and-dime'' America's families out of tax relief.\n  I would ask those who oppose this family tax relief: just how big \nwill America's budget surplus have to get before America's families \ndeserve to receive some of their tax dollars back? If not now, when? If \njust 5 percent of the budget surplus and just 9 percent of the tax \noverpayment is too big a refund, how little should it be? How long do \nthey have to wait? How hard do they have to work? How large an \noverpayment do they have to make? How large a budget surplus do we need \nto have?\n  This bill is fair. We have addressed the three largest sources of \nmarriage tax penalties in the tax code--the standard deduction, the \nrate brackets, and the earned income credit. And we have done so in a \nway that does not create any new penalties--any new disincentives in \nthe tax code. We have ensured that a family with one stay-at-home \nparent is not treated worse for tax purposes than a family where both \nparents work outside the home. This is an important principle because \nthese are important families.\n  Let's take a look at what all these families will receive under our \nbill--and just as importantly, let's look at when they will get it. \nFirst, our bill increases the standard deduction for married couples \nfiling a joint return to twice the deduction for singles.\n\n  This benefit, which would reduce a couple's taxable income by $1,450, \nis effective for this taxable year. That's right--for the year 2000. \nThat means when a couple files their tax returns this coming April, \nthey will be able to see and feel the results of our work. This \nprovision will benefit about 25 million taxpayers. As a result, I \nbelieve that we should call this bill the ASAP tax relief bill for \nAmerica's taxpayers--tax relief for America's families now.\n  Now, I know that those who search for excuses to oppose tax relief \nwill question the immediacy of this tax cut. Before they do, I would \nremind those people: it was not a problem for them to raise taxes \nretroactively seven years ago. And of course, when you are raising \ntaxes retroactively, it is a big problem because people have already \nmade their financial commitments. In contrast, giving people an \nimmediate tax cut is only a problem if you object to letting people \nkeep their money.\n  Second, our bill increases the 15 percent rate bracket for married \ncouples so that it is twice the size of the corresponding rate bracket \nfor singles. While we phase in this doubling, we begin the increase \nimmediately. Taxpayers will receive a portion of the benefit as soon as \npossible--as soon as they file their year 2000 tax returns. And they \nwill see the entire benefit--a total of over $1,100 per family--in the \nyear 2004. This provision will help about 21 million taxpayers.\n  Third, our bill helps married couples who are receiving the earned \nincome credit. We increase the beginning and ending points of the \ncredit's income phase-out for these couples by $2,000. Just like the \nother provisions in the bill, we deliver this relief immediately--for \nthe tax year 2000. The hard working families who receive the EIC will \nsee the benefit as soon as they file their year 2000 tax returns. This \nprovision helps almost four million families, including an expansion of \nthe EIC to one million families who were previously ineligible for the \ncredit because of their combined income.\n  Finally, our bill ensures that families will continue to receive \ntheir family tax credits. Congress has delivered a variety of tax \ncredits to American families--credits like the child credit, the HOPE \ncredit, the Lifetime Learning credit, the dependent care credit, and \nthe adoption credit. This bill extends a temporary provision that \ncarves out these credits from the ever-reaching grasp of the \nalternative minimum tax. Millions of families will also see this \nbenefit. For them, this tax relief won't be an empty promise.\n  In any House-Senate conference, both sides are forced to make \ncompromises. This one was no exception. I would like to have included \nthe doubling of the 28 percent bracket as we did in the Senate and as \n61 Senators supported. I think that these families deserve their full \ntax break as well. Even the Democratic alternative offered in the \nSenate accounted for these families by not completely phasing-out their \nrelief until $150,000. I fought hard, but our colleagues in the House \ndid not agree and they refused to budge. I also would have liked to \nkeep our earned income credit provision at $2,500. Once again, the \nHouse disagreed. But this is still a good bill and it still delivers \nthe tax relief families have earned and deserve.\n\n  Despite the red flags thrown up by those who want to stand in the way \nof marriage tax relief, this bill actually makes the tax code more \nprogressive. Families with incomes under $100,000 receive a tax cut \nunder our bill that is proportionally higher than the amount of taxes \nthey currently pay. In other words, their tax burden will fall.\n  Let's look at a few examples prepared by the Joint Committee on \nTaxation. First, let's take a married couple with two children earning \n$30,000. When this bill is fully effective, that couple would see a \nreduction in its taxes of over 143 percent. On the other hand, a two-\nchild couple earning $100,000 would see its taxes drop by 11 percent, \nand a couple earning $200,000 would see its taxes drop by less than 4 \npercent.\n  This same dynamic holds true for a couple with no children. Under our \nbill, a couple earning $20,000 would see its taxes reduced by 28 \npercent; a couple earning $75,000 would have its taxes reduced by 16 \npercent, and a couple earning $100,000 would have its taxes reduced by \n9.5 percent.\n  There is no honest way people can claim that this bill is tilted \ntowards the rich. I believe that the real complaint of those who oppose \nthis bill is not that it is tilted towards the rich--because it is \nnot--but because it is tilted away from Washington. As a result, some \nof America's tax overpayment will flow back to America's families.\n  And while I would rather have seen the 28 percent bracket doubling \nincluded in the bill, its absence does do one thing. Its absence \nremoves any excuse for the President not to sign this bill. If \nPresident Clinton does not sign this bill, then there is only one \nexplanation. No matter how much the amount of surplus, no matter how \nmuch the size of the tax overpayment,\n\n[[Page S7381]]\n\nno matter how high the overall tax burden, and no matter how much \nfamilies deserve tax relief, it is all less important than the fact \nthat Washington wants the money more. They are saying to America: those \nin the White House need your money more than the people in your house \ndo.\n  With the passage of this bill, Congress has met every test that the \nPresident has set for tax relief. He wanted it to go to deserving \npeople. Who could be more deserving than America's families? He wanted \nit to be fiscally responsible. What could be more fiscally responsible \nthan using just a nickel on America's budget surplus dollar and a dime \non its tax overpayment? He wanted it to be one provision and not part \nof a large package. How could it be smaller than the single proposal of \nfamily tax relief included here?\n  Every test, no matter how illusory, has been met. With this bill, \nPresident Clinton has run out of excuses for not giving American \nfamilies tax relief. No more if's, and's, or buts. No more excuses. No \nmore obstacles and no more conditions, this Senate will go on record \ntomorrow: Family tax relief now.\n  Madam President, the time for excuses has passed, the time for family \ntax relief has come. While President Clinton has been focused on \ninternational affairs, families across America have been waiting for us \nto make good on our promise. For President Clinton to make good on his \npromise. They have been patient. They are waiting for us to return some \nof this record surplus to them.\n  There is no reason, none whatsoever, that this bill, the ASAP tax \nrelief bill for America's family taxpayers, should not be immediately \nsigned. Let's approve the Marriage Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of \n2000 and let's divorce the marriage tax penalty from the tax code once \nand for all.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I yield back the time of the minority \ntonight, leaving the equally divided half hour in the morning.\n  Mr. ROTH. Madam President, I will yield back whatever time is not \nused by the distinguished Senator from Kansas, who wishes to speak.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I will need somewhere around 10 \nminutes to discuss the conference report. May I proceed at this time?\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Kansas, and I will \nyield back the remainder of our time tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I thank the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee for putting forward this legislation. This is the marriage \npenalty tax. It has been before this body. We passed it with 61 votes \nin favor of it, and 9 Democrats voted in favor of this bill. Almost the \nentire Republican side voted for this bill. Now we have a conference \nreport in front of us.\n  I hope people will look at this and look at what is in the conference \nreport. That is why I wanted to take some time to go through it. It is \na 5-year package, $89 billion. I don't want people saying it is $250 \nbillion or anything; it is an $89 billion package. It only hits the 15-\npercent tax bracket. There has been concern about the 28-percent \nbracket being hit. It doesn't include the 28-percent bracket. The House \nside has a 15-percent bracket in dealing with the marriage penalty but \nnot the 28-percent bracket. So we went with the House side and said: \nOK, we will pull out the 28-percent bracket. So it is just that 15-\npercent bracket. It is phased in faster than the Senate bill that \npassed. It does continue to contain the earned-income tax provisions \nwithin it so that married couples who are currently being hit by a \nmarriage penalty associated with the earned-income tax credit are no \nlonger impacted by that.\n  This is an overall excellent bill that meets virtually everybody's \nsuggestions that they were making about this bill. I hope we can get \n100 percent support within the Senate for this bill.\n  It eliminates the marriage penalty built into the standard deduction \neffective back to the beginning of this year. It backs it up to the \nbeginning of the year 2000. It widens the 15-percent bracket gradually \nso that joint filing is two times that of singles. It starts at the \nbeginning of this year, and is fully effective by the year 2004.\n  In other words, we are taking that 15-percent bracket for two-wage \nearners, or spouses with combined incomes, or even only one spouse, and \nwe are doubling the standard deduction. We are doing it up until 2004.\n  It increases the top phaseout amount of the earned-income tax \ncredit--the provision I was talking about earlier--for joint filers by \n$2,000 effective to the beginning of this year; again, the beginning of \nthe year 2000. It sunsets the tax relief provisions in accordance with \nthe Byrd rule at the end of 2004. I want to make sure to point out that \nprovision to people as well. This is a 5-year marriage penalty \nelimination for the 15-percent tax bracket and earned-income tax \ncredit.\n  That is basically what the package is. I think it should contain \nmore. I think we ought to have the 28-percent bracket as well on \ncombined incomes. We couldn't get agreement to that in the House. We \ndid on the 15-percent bracket.\n  I direct most of my statement tonight to the administration. This is \ngoing to pass. It is going to pass strong. We have had a lot of calls \nand contacts in our office from people saying: Of course you shouldn't \ntax marriage. Let's do away with this penalty. That is what we are \nsimply pleading to the President.\n  After tomorrow morning when this passes with at least 61 votes, this \nwill be on the administration's desk. It is up to the President and \nVice President to determine whether they are going to sign this tax \ncut. Are we going to sign this tax correction and send to the American \npeople, or are we going to veto it?\n  The President has been saying: OK. Send me prescription drugs and I \nwill sign the marriage penalty. In the State of the Union Message, he \nsaid: Let's deal with the marriage penalty tax, and let's eliminate it. \nHe didn't say then that you have to send this to me at the same time. \nHe asked for a hundred things in the State of the Union Message. He \ndidn't say they have to be linked together. I think he is hiding behind \nthat issue rather than saying whether he is for or against eliminating \nthe marriage penalty within the Tax Code.\n  I call on the President to sign this for the American people. After \ntomorrow morning, the President and the Vice President and this \nadministration are all that stands in the way of the American people \nbeing able to receive this correction within the Tax Code so people who \nare married don't pay more taxes than people who are single.\n  It simply makes equitable a situation for most people impacted by the \nmarriage penalty; not all. It would be better if it dealt with \neverybody. It is a simple statement that we should not be taxing \nmarriage. We have said that repeatedly. For most people impacted by the \nmarriage penalty, this bill will deal with that situation. We will not \nbe taxing people just for being married. Plus, I think it is just the \nright message to send across to the American public saying we think \nmarriage is a valuable institution; it shouldn't be taxed. We think it \nis at the center of family values. Let's all say we are for it and that \nwe shouldn't be taxing it.\n\n  Also, it gets around that iron rule in government that if you want \nless of something, tax it; if you want more of something, subsidize it. \nI don't think we want to tell the American public we want less \nmarriage, and therefore we are taxing them.\n  This is the time for us to accomplish this.\n  I say in conclusion that this is going to pass, and it will pass \nlarge tomorrow morning. At least nine Democrats voted for it the last \ntime. The only thing that stands in the way of this tax relief--this \ntax sanity, that we shouldn't be taxing marriage and the American \npublic--is the President of the United States. Please, Mr. President, \nsign this bill.\n  This is good tax policy. This Congress is doing a number of things. \nWe are getting them to the President. It is up to the President whether \nhe will sign them into law.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S7382]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, the Marriage Tax Relief Act that \npassed in the Senate previously and that has now come back to us from \nconference is a piece of legislation of historic importance. I would \nlike to share a few thoughts with this body concerning why I think it \nis so important.\n  Not long ago a Harvard president wrote a book about the beginning of \nour Republic--the first 150 years. He said every piece of legislation \nthat was considered and passed was debated on the principle of whether \nor not it would make the American people better as individual people, \nas human beings. It would encourage their self-reliance, their \ndiscipline, and their work ethic. It would encourage them to educate \nthemselves and their families. It would make them more law abiding.\n  We know that public policy does, indeed, affect social policy and \nthat actions have consequences. We know that a tax is a penalty. A tax \nis a detriment. When you tax something, you get less of it. In fact, \nthat is why we tax cigarettes and beer more than we do food and \nmedicine. We believe you can reduce certain activities to some degree \nby a tax. We now know if you subsidize an event, you get more of it.\n  Those are principles that I think are undisputed. How much I don't \nknow. How much it affects any one single event in the life of a nation \nI don't know. But when you have over 200 million people making \nthousands and thousands and hundreds of thousands of decisions every \nday, every week, and every month of the year, penalties on one type of \ndecisionmaking and a subsidy on another type of decisionmaking can \naffect what happens.\n  We are in the position that this great Nation through inadvertence, I \nsuppose, has created a system that actually penalizes marriage. It, \nindeed, can be said to subsidize divorce.\n  I know a friend who got a divorce in January. I was told had they \ndivorced in December it would have saved them $1,600 in tax dollars; \nthe Federal Government would be prepared to subsidize that divorce. But \nhad they married in December, it would have cost them on their tax \nreturn an additional $1,600; $1,600 is a lot of money.\n  The average family who pays this marriage tax penalty according to \nthe best estimates pays around $1,400 more per year in taxes. That is \n$100 a month. That is real money for American families.\n  I want to say how excited I am that I believe we are on the verge of \npassing and sending to the President a bill that I trust he will feel \nquite comfortable signing--a bill to eliminate this bizarre penalty.\n  How much has it impacted marriage and families in America? I don't \nknow. But we know this: Marriage and family is a good institution. It \nstrengthens America through families. Traditions, stability, and \neducation are ways of getting along in the world and transmitted \npartnerships occur. People live longer who are married, for the most \npart. It is a good institution. It is the institution that raises our \nnext generation, trains them, and prepares them for the world.\n\n  It is such a delight and a thrill to know that we will, tomorrow, I \nam quite confident, vote to eliminate this penalty on one of America's \nmost valuable institutions, the family. What a good day that is going \nto be. I look forward to it. I am going to celebrate it when it is \nsigned, as I am confident the President will do. We will have made a \nmajor step in this body to strengthening one of America's greatest \ninstitutions, and that is the family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/20/senate-section/article/S7382-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HONORABLE NANCY EKSTRUM, MAYOR OF PHILIP\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, on July 10, 2000, one of South Dakota's \nfinest mayors stepped down after two decades of public service. Nancy \nEkstrum, former city council member and mayor of the town of Philip for \n12 years, provided thoughtful and decisive leadership for her community \nduring a time of considerable change.\n  The first woman to lead Philip, Mayor Ekstrum began her service as \nmayor facing difficult issues that would be familiar to anyone who \nlives in a rural community. Poor quality water supplies made treatment \nexpensive and difficult. An aging sewer system needed repair and road \nprojects awaited completion. Meeting these challenges with a shrinking \ntax base and during a time of hardship for area ranchers required a \nsense of vision and tenacity. Most of all, it required a mayor who was \nwilling to roll up her sleeves and put her heart and soul into finding \ncreative solutions to difficult problems.\n  Nancy Ekstrum was just that kind of mayor. Under her leadership, the \ncity built long-needed roads and made great strides toward providing \nits citizens with clean, healthy drinking water. When it became clear \nthat the Mni Wiconi Rural Water System was still several years from \nreaching the community, Mayor Ekstrum rallied area residents to work \nwith the congressional delegation to find an affordable interim \nsolution to the city's water crisis. It is my hope that this project \nwill be funded this year so that clean water will be Mayor Ekstrum's \nlasting legacy to the city.\n  On a more personal level, I will miss working with Mayor Ekstrum. Her \nadvice on issues facing western South Dakota is always thoughtful and \non target. I suspect that I will continue to turn to her long into the \nfuture for her thoughts and input as South Dakota faces the challenges \nof adapting a rural state to a global economy. I look forward to \nmaintaining our strong friendship.\n  In conclusion, I simply would like to extend my congratulations to \nMayor Ekstrum on her 23 years of service to her community. I am \ndelighted that she plans to stay involved in education and will \ncontinue to make a difference for the youth of Philip. I wish her the \nbest as she enters this new phase of her life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/20/senate-section/article/S7382-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, the role of unilateral economic sanctions \nin the conduct of American foreign policy has been part of our debate \nin the Congress and in the executive branch for the past three years. \nAttempts to modify or reform the way the United States utilizes \nunilateral economic sanctions in the conduct of our foreign policy have \nconsumed the attention of several committees, spawned numerous \nsanctions reform bills--including my own efforts--resolutions and \namendments, generated a number of floor debates, stimulated countless \ndiscussions within this body and with the administration and prompted \nmany press conferences and news releases. It even moved the \ndistinguished Majority Leader to appoint an ad hoc bipartisan Senate \ntask force to sort through the issue in the hopes of finding a policy \npath or sanctions that best promotes our national interest.\n  Outside the United States Government, virtually every think tank, \nuniversity, trade association, and foreign policy association has \ninvested time and resources to studying, analyzing and making \nrecommendations on the subject of unilateral economic sanctions. This \nis as it should be. The subject is integral to our approach on foreign \npolicy, national security and international trade.\n  I have been pleased that our debate and the large volume of \nliterature have led to considerable re-thinking about the efficacy of \nunilateral economic sanctions. I have noted that the frequent resort to \nuse of unilateral sanctions to achieve foreign policy goals has \ndeclined and that our sophistication about the inter-relationship \nbetween unilateral economic sanctions and policy has grown \ndramatically. One of the most important players in our debate over the \npast few years has been the unique coalition of some 675 export-\noriented companies in the United States called USA*ENGAGE. They have \nbeen critical in helping to shape the debate on unilateral economic \nsanctions, a debate which continues virtually as I speak.\n\n[[Page S7383]]\n\n  I recently read a short speech by Mr. William Lane who serves as the \nChairman of the USA*ENGAGE trade association and the Washington \nDirector of Caterpillar corporation titled ``USA*ENGAGE: Lessons \nLearned: The Cost of Conducting Foreign Policy on the Cheap.'' The \nremarks were offered at the French Institute on International Relations \nlast month.\n  I believe my colleagues will find Mr. Lane's remarks insightful and \ninformed so I ask unanimous consent that the full speech be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          Remarks of William Lane: USA*ENGAGE: Lessons Learned\n\n\n           the cost of conducting foreign policy on the cheap\n\n       I very much appreciate the opportunity to discuss the issue \n     of economic sanctions before such an influential audience. \n     For the past four years I've been closely associated with the \n     public policy effort known as USA*ENGAGE. Today, I'd like to \n     talk about that effort--with specific focus on the lessons \n     we've learned during what has turned into a rather remarkable \n     campaign.\n       USA*ENGAGE was organized in reaction to a disturbing \n     development: for much of this decade the United States has \n     embraced an outdated policy tool--unilateral sanctions--to \n     influence foreign governments. In fact, the U.S. has imposed \n     sanctions with such vigor that by 1997 over half the world's \n     population was the target of some form of economic punishment \n     at the hands of the United States.\n       Recognizing that such sanction policies rarely work, are \n     often counterproductive and almost always costly to other \n     national objectives, U.S. business and agriculture felt \n     compelled to challenge the wisdom of a sanctions-based \n     foreign policy. Organized as USA*ENGAGE, the four-year-old \n     effort has had a definite impact on how America's \n     policymakers now view sanctions.\n       To appreciate the lessons learned, it is best to recall the \n     scope of the problem. Put bluntly, with the end of the Cold \n     War, many U.S. policymakers embraced the simplistic view that \n     sanctions were the perfect compromise between doing nothing \n     and taking military action.\n       So the United States sanctioned. It sanctioned South Korea \n     and Saudi Arabia over labor rights; India and Pakistan for \n     nuclear testing; Colombia for narcotics; and China for human \n     rights abuses and environmental concerns. Citizens of Canada \n     and Israel were sanctioned for doing business in Cuba. Egypt \n     and Germany were threatened with sanctions because of \n     concerns about religious persecution, as were companies in \n     Russia, Malaysia and France for investing in Iran's petroleum \n     sector.\n       How many sanctions were imposed? In 1997, the President's \n     Export Council found that the U.S. was targeting unilateral \n     sanctions against 73 countries, while the Congressional \n     Research Service cited 125 measures authorizing unilateral \n     sanctions.\n       Did the sanctions work? The Institute for International \n     Economic concluded that less than one in five unilateral \n     sanctions resulted in anything close to the desired result. \n     However, the one thing unilateral sanctions have clearly done \n     is to hurt U.S. interest--annually costing as many as 250,000 \n     high-paying American jobs and reducing U.S. exports by about \n     $19 billion.\n       From our perspective, sanctions also ran counter to the \n     reality that in many developing countries American business \n     represents one of the most progressive elements of society. \n     By encouraging trade and investment abroad, America not only \n     helps create jobs and higher living standards; if also \n     promotes values that encourage political freedom, the rule of \n     law, and respect for human rights. From better schools and \n     health care to improved infrastructure and housing, \n     commercial engagement can make a positive difference in the \n     lives of millions.\n       At the same time, the positive contribution made by the \n     many non-governmental organizations (NGOs) cannot be \n     underestimated. While we recognize there are no guarantees in \n     foreign policy, we've learned that for engagement to work, it \n     needs to be pursued at many levels--political, diplomatic, \n     economic, charitable, religious, educational, and cultural. \n     Rather than view each other as adversaries, business and the \n     NGO communities would be well served to be supportive of \n     common objectives.\n       So, the strategy of USA*ENGAGE was to engage friend and foe \n     alike in the sanctions debate. Our original hope was that 100 \n     companies would join us. Clearly, this was an issue of great \n     concern for the business community, as our membership quickly \n     swelled to 675 companies.\n       Moreover, we engaged the academic community and think \n     tanks. We engaged non-traditional business allies ranging \n     from religious and humanitarian organizations to human rights \n     groups. We engaged the Congress and Clinton Administration. \n     We worked with the media and aggressively used the Internet \n     to engage the public--building a web outreach program that \n     was receiving 140,000 hits per month at its peak. With our \n     encouragement, the sanctions issue even became the national \n     college-debating topic.\n       To be frank, our message evolved with time. Initially we \n     stressed what our experience told us was true:\n       (1) Unilateral sanctions don't work and can be costly;\n       (2) Engagement--when pursued at all levels--can be a strong \n     force for positive change;\n       (3) Isolating a country from positive values and means of \n     influence rarely gets results;\n       (4) Multilateral actions are almost always more effective \n     than unilateral ones.\n       As the public debate continued, our views coalesced around \n     one overriding theme: the United States cannot conduct an \n     effective foreign policy on the cheap. Unilateral sanctions \n     are not only the lazy man's foreign policy, but a symptom of \n     a larger problem: a lack of recognition of the broad array of \n     foreign policy tools--ranging from carrots to sticks--that \n     are available.\n       Sanctions--even unilateral ones--at times may be necessary, \n     but other foreign policy tools must be part of the equation. \n     These include the Foreign Service. USAID, military and \n     intelligence agencies, as well as multilateral institutions \n     like the UN, World Bank, IMF and WTO. But for these tools to \n     work, U.S. leadership, commitment, and funding is essential.\n       The problem with unilateral sanctions is that they often \n     cut off American influence and hurt the very people the U.S. \n     is trying to help. We don't think it is an accident that the \n     countries the United States has attempted to isolate the \n     most--Cuba and North Korea--have changed the least over the \n     past 40 years.\n       The efforts of USA*ENGAGE have prompted a reexamination of \n     many U.S. sanction policies. Sanctions have been lifted \n     against Colombia, Vietnam, and both South and North Korea. \n     The U.S. has rejected sanctions against Mexico, Indonesia, \n     Russia, Malaysia and France and waived sanctions against \n     India and Pakistan. Earlier this week, the U.S. Supreme \n     Court, in a rare unanimous vote, ruled that state and local \n     sanctions are unconstitutional. There has even been movement \n     toward engaging Cuba, with legislation now moving in the \n     Congress that would open the door to U.S. shipments of food \n     and medicine.\n       While a few new sanctions--Burma and Sudan--have been \n     imposed in recent years, it is clear that policymakers view \n     unilateral sanctions in a more critical light. It is \n     important to note that last year, and so far this year, the \n     United States has not imposed any unilateral sanctions of \n     note. This is a far cry from 1996, when USA*ENGAGE was \n     organized. In that year alone, according to the National \n     Association of Manufacturers, the U.S. imposed 23 unilateral \n     sanctions, including two measures--the Helms-Burton Act and \n     the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act--that were unusually onerous in \n     that extraterritorial sanctions were authorized.\n       For our part, business now sees value in supporting issues \n     that it previously ignored--such as encouraging America to \n     pay its UN arrears and ensuring that the IMF and Foreign \n     Service are adequately funded.\n       Under the leadership of foreign policy and trade experts \n     like Senators Lugar, Kerrey and Hagel and Representatives \n     Crane, Dooley and Manzullo, there is a serious effort in \n     Congress to enact legislation that would put in place a more \n     deliberate process to use when the U.S. considers new \n     unilateral sanction proposals. Known as The Sanctions Process \n     Reform Act, this common sense legislation is a good bill and \n     should be enacted.\n       While this legislation is important, it won't be new laws \n     that stop policymakers from adopting new unilateral sanctions \n     rather than pursuing more effective multilateral actions. Nor \n     will new laws ensure that our leaders recognize the full \n     power of engagement and the risks associated with isolation. \n     That is why we must continue to be vigilant and keep U.S. \n     foreign policymakers on a path that included multilateral \n     solutions to international problems.\n       What will ultimately change America's sanctions-base \n     foreign policy will be Americans who--armed with the facts--\n     demand a more effective foreign policy. To that end, the \n     ultimate success of USA*ENGAGE will depend on whether the \n     lessons learned are reinforced by a commitment from our \n     leaders to refrain from conducting foreign policy on the \n     cheap.\n       As a conclusion, I'd like you to note that perhaps the most \n     telling event to illustrate the evolution of U.S. sanctions \n     policy took place earlier this week. The decision this week \n     by President Clinton to drop many of the U.S. sanctions that \n     have been in place against North Korea for nearly a half a \n     century was indeed profound. What better way to mark the 50th \n     anniversary of the Korean War than to finally make \n     significant progress towards ending the Cold War on the \n     Korean Peninsula?\n       The United States should now further follow the lead of \n     South Korea, as we too face an opportunity to ease tensions \n     with a hostile neighbor. America can learn from the Koreans \n     by opening a dialogue with the government of Cuba. Engagement \n     is working throughout the world--it can work in our backyard \n     too. Perhaps that will be the greatest lesson we have yet to \n     learn.\n       Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/20/senate-section/article/S7383-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7383-S7384]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           BANKRUPTCY REFORM\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to take a brief moment to speak on \nbankruptcy reform legislation, which in my view, our Nation desperately \nneeds. We\n\n[[Page S7384]]\n\nhave a balanced bankruptcy reform bill. The administration is on record \nas saying they support it. If the President really wants a bill, and if \nmy colleagues in the Senate really want a bill, then they should let us \nmove to a formal conference. Furthermore, they should tell us why the \nclinic violence provision is even necessary.\n  Current law already prevents perpetrators of clinic violence, as well \nas other types of violence, from discharging the judgments against them \nin bankruptcy. Given this, it is clear that the overbroad abortion \nclinic violence amendment serves no substantive purpose. No one has \nbrought forth a single case in which current law has been used to \ndischarge debts from clinic violence. I raised this issue in a letter \nto Senator Schumer last week, and am still awaiting a response.\n  Let's move forward with a bankruptcy conference--we have waited long \nenough.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 13, 2000.\n     Hon. Charles Schumer\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chuck: I am writing you regarding your clinic violence \n     amendment to the bankruptcy reform legislation. This \n     amendment appears to be one of the final remaining issues \n     holding up the overdue reform our bankruptcy laws truly need \n     to both stop the abuse of the system by those who are able to \n     pay back a portion of their debts and to implement new \n     consumer protections such as enhanced credit card \n     disclosures, which you played a major role in drafting.\n       I respect your views and the general objective of your \n     amendment to prevent criminals from paying their debts to \n     society or to others by using our bankruptcy laws. \n     Furthermore, I am committed to addressing any legitimate \n     abuse of our bankruptcy laws. However, I am concerned that \n     some who oppose the broadly supported proposed reforms have \n     capitalized on the issue of abortion clinic violence and have \n     spread some misconceptions regarding this issue. Such \n     misconceptions, unfortunately, appear to be jeopardizing \n     passage of the important bankruptcy reform legislation.\n       For example, in a document circulated by one of our \n     colleagues, it was represented that ``[t]he Schumer amendment \n     prevents a documented abuse of the bankruptcy system. . . .'' \n     and the compromise language that is in the conference report \n     ``would continue to allow many perpetrators of clinic \n     violence to seek shelter in the nation's bankruptcy courts.''\n       There has not been a single case reported or presented \n     where the current bankruptcy laws were held to allow a \n     perpetrator of clinic violence to ``seek shelter in the \n     nation's bankruptcy courts,'' nor is this a ``documented \n     abuse'' of the system. On the contrary, when those who have \n     committed violence have tried to hide behind the bankruptcy \n     laws, they have found their debts were non-dischargeable \n     under current bankruptcy law. Given this, I do not think that \n     the amendment you offer is necessary.\n       Indeed, the abortion rights group NARAL recognized in a \n     1999 publication that ``[c]oncluding that clinic violence-\n     associated debts are non-dischargeable under section \n     523(a)(6) is consistent with the Supreme court's \n     interpretation of [current bankruptcy law's] ``willful and \n     malicious injury.'' Therefore such true debts are non-\n     dischargeable.\n       Even given such interpretation of current law, and though \n     the House-passed bill had no abortion-related provision, the \n     current reform legislation goes further and incorporates \n     compromise language that would expand current law and further \n     make debts arising from willful and malicious threats also \n     non-dischargeable. This is done in a politically neutral \n     manner and protects debts from all threats of injury \n     irrespective of the political message of the protestors. In \n     addition, knowing that one of your biggest concerns regarding \n     this subject is the ability of perpetrators to avoid debts \n     arising from settlement or contempt orders, the compromise \n     language specifically covers debts from settlement orders and \n     violations of other orders of the court.\n       I appreciate your consideration of these points and would \n     welcome any response you might have.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/20/senate-section/article/S7384-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7384]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          CHANGES TO H.

Mr. President, I rise today to once again draw \nattention to the continuing war in Chechnya. This war has raged for too \nlong. The war in Chechnya from 1994-1996 left over 80,000 civilians \ndead, and the Foreign Relations Committee has received credible \nevidence that the current war has again resulted in the death of \nthousands of innocent civilians and the displacement of well over \n250,000 others. The committee also received credible evidence of \nwidespread looting, summary executions, detentions, denial of safe \npassage to fleeing civilians, torture and rape, committed by Russian \nsoldiers. Colleagues, regardless of the politics of this war, this kind \nof behavior is unacceptable. War has rules, and the evidence and \ntestimony the Foreign Relations Committee received raises serious \ndoubts as to whether or not the Russian Federation is playing by those \nrules. Much of the evidence we received showed clear violations of \ninternational humanitarian law, including the well-established Geneva \nConvention.\n  Tomorrow is the official opening of Group of Eight Summit in Japan. \nThe President must use this opportunity to relay our serious concerns \nwith the actions of the Russian Government in Chechnya. Let's remember, \nwhat was the Group of Seven and became the G-8 with the inclusion of \nthe Russian Federation, is an association of democratic societies with \nadvanced economies. Although Russia is not yet a liberal democracy or \nan advanced economy, it was invited to take part in this group to \nencourage its democratic evolution. Today as I watch Russia refuse to \ninitiate a political dialogue with the Chechen people, and continue to \ndeny international humanitarian aid organizations and international \nhuman rights monitors access to Chechnya, I must question that \nevolution.\n  I am disappointed that the Group of Eight will not include the \nsituation in\n\n[[Page S7385]]\n\nChechnya on is formal agenda, but I am hopeful that the President will \nvoice our serious concerns about Russia's conduct in Chechnya and take \nconcrete action to demonstrate our concern, during bilateral talks with \nPresident Putin.\n  The United States should demand that the Russian Federation push for \na negotiated, just settlement to this conflict. The conflict will not \nbe resolved by military means and the Russian Federation should \ninitiate immediately a political dialogue with a cross-section of \nrepresentatives of the Chechen people, including representatives of the \ndemocratically elected Chechen authorities. The United States should \nremind the Russian Federation of the requests the Council of Europe for \nan immediate cease-fire and initiation of political dialogue, and of \nRussia's obligation to that institution and the Organization for \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe.\n  And colleagues, the President must also remind the Russian Federation \ngovernment of its accountability to the international community and \ntake steps to demonstrate that its conduct will effect its standing in \nthe world community. This body and the U.N. Human Rights Commission has \nspoken out demanding the Russian government allow into Chechnya \nhumanitarian agencies and international human rights monitors, \nincluding U.N. Special Rapporteur, yet the Russian government has not \ndone so. This body and the international community has also demanded \nthat the Russian Federation undertake systematic, credible, transparent \nand exhaustive investigations into allegations of violations of human \nrights and international humanitarian law in Chechnya, and to initiate, \nwhere appropriate, prosecutions against those accused. But again, the \nRussian Federation has not done so.\n\n  During his meeting with President Putin, the President is expected to \ndiscuss economic reform in Russia and regional stability issues. \nPresident Clinton must relay to the Russian President that Russia's \nconduct in Chechnya is not only in violation of international \nhumanitarian law, but that it threatens Russia's ability for economic \nreform and creates instability in the region. And President Clinton \nmust make clear to President Putin that while the United States fully \nsupports the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation, and is \nfully aware of the evidence of grave human right violations committed \nby soldiers on both sides of the conflict, we strongly condemn Russia's \nconduct of the war in Chechnya and will continue to publicly voice our \nopposition to it. President Clinton should tell President Putin that \nthe United States will take into consideration Russian conduct in \nChechnya in any request for further rescheduling of Russia's \ninternational debt and U.S. assistance, until it allows full and \nunimpeded access into Chechnya humanitarian agencies and international \nhuman rights monitors, in accordance with international law.\n  Colleagues, the war in Chechnya has caused enormous suffering for \nboth the Chechen and Russian people, and the reports of the grave human \nrights violations committed there, on both sides of the conflict, \ncontinue daily. We must raise our concerns about the war in Chechnya at \nevery chance and in every forum possible, including the G-8 Summit. I \nremind you again that the Group of Eight is an association of \ndemocratic societies with advanced economies--the Group of Seven \ninvited the Russian Federation to encourage its democratic evolution. \nIt is not yet a liberal democracy or an advanced economy. By not taking \nconcrete steps during this Summit to demonstrate to the Russian \nFederation that its conduct is unacceptable for a democratic nation, is \nto condone it. I fear we have already put given human rights a back \nseat to economic issues by not placing Russian conduct in Chechnya on \nthe formal agenda of the G-8 Summit. I hope that will not be the \noutcome of our bilateral talks with Russia in Japan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/20/senate-section/article/S7385-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7385]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

SPARKY ANDERSON INDUCTED INTO BASEBALL HALL OF FAME\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Mr. \nGeorge Lee ``Sparky'' Anderson, who will be inducted into the National \nBaseball Hall of Fame Museum in Cooperstown, New York on July 23, 2000. \nMr. Anderson spent 26 seasons as a manager in the Major Leagues, 17 of \nthese with the Detroit Tigers. During this time, he was recognized not \nonly as one of the best managers in the game of baseball, but also as \none of the best ambassadors for the game of baseball.\n  Mr. Anderson was born on February 22, 1934, in Bridgewater, South \nDakota. Upon graduation from high school, he signed with the Brooklyn \nDodgers. He spent six years in the minor leagues before being called up \nto the major leagues by the Philadelphia Phillies in 1959. He was the \nregular second baseman for the Phillies that year, and was recognized \nas an intelligent, hustling player. He had a batting average of .218, 0 \nhome runs and 34 runs batted in. He earned the nickname ``manos de \noro'' from his teammates: ``the man with the golden hands.''\n  As it turned out, 1959 was the only year Mr. Anderson spent in the \nmajor leagues as a player. He never left the game of baseball, though, \nand in 1964 he became the manager of a minor league team in Toronto. In \n1969, he accepted a coaching position with the San Diego Padres, and \nprior to the 1970 season the Cincinnati Reds named him as their \nmanager.\n  It quickly became apparent that managing suited Mr. Anderson well. \nNot only did it provide him with the opportunity to utilize his immense \nknowledge of the game of baseball, it also highlighted his ability to \nrelate to and motivate players. Hall of Famer Joe Morgan, a member of \nthe Reds during Mr. Anderson's years there and now a wonderful and \nrespected baseball commentator, once said, ``Sparky had a way of making \neverybody look in the mirror at themselves. As far as I'm concerned, \nthat's the key to being a good manager.''\n  Under Mr. Anderson's guidance, the Reds became the dominant team of \nthe 1970's. The team became known as The Big Red Machine for its \nability to produce runs, led by such great offensive players as Morgan, \nPete Rose, Johnny Bench, Tony Perez and Ken Griffey, Sr. Mr. Anderson \nearned the nickname ``Captain Hook'' for his innovative employment of \nrelief pitchers, which was not the common practice of the time. This \ncombination of offense and strategic wizardry proved to be lethal for \nopponents. In his first year with the team, the Reds won 102 games and \nthe National League Pennant. From 1972-76, the Reds averaged more than \none hundred wins per season, won three more National League pennants, \nand won back-to-back World Series Championships in 1975 and 1976.\n  After nine years in Cincinnati, Mr. Anderson came to the Detroit \nTigers in 1979. The Tigers were struggling at the time, but possessed a \ncore of young, talented players, including Jack Morris, Lou Whitaker, \nAlan Trammell and\n\n[[Page S7386]]\n\nLance Parrish. Mr. Anderson molded this group of unique personalities \ninto a team of champions. In 1984, just five years after his arrival, \nthe team started 35-5--still the best 40-game start in the history of \nMajor League Baseball--and never stopped their winning ways, ultimately \nbringing the Detroit Tigers their first World Series Championship since \n1968. Very few people in the City of Detroit have forgotten Kirk \nGibson's home run off the San Diego Padres' Goose Gossage in the eighth \ninning of Game 5, the hit which sewed up the series for the Tigers.\n  Mr. Anderson retired from managing the Tigers in 1995, having led the \nteam to one more pennant win in 1987. Ultimately, in his 26 seasons as \na Major League manager, nine with the Reds and 17 with the Tigers, his \nteams won 2,194 games, placing him third all-time, behind just Connie \nMack and John McGraw. He was named Manager of the Year three times, \ntwice in the National League and once in the American League. He is the \nonly manager in the history of the game to win a World Series in both \nthe American and National Leagues; he is the only manager to win 100 \ngames in one season in both leagues; and he is the only manager to have \nover six hundred career victories in each league. His 34-21 mark in the \npostseason remains the best winning percentage for a manager in Major \nLeague history.\n  During his seventeen years in Detroit, Mr. Anderson became an \nimportant member of the community, and not because his position as \nManager of the Detroit Tigers. His involvement with many charitable \norganizations led him to found his own in 1987. The organization is \ncalled CATCH, Caring Athletes Team for Children's & Henry Ford \nHospitals, but is better known as ``Sparky Anderson's Charity for \nChildren.'' The mission of CATCH is to improve the quality of life of \npediatric patients at Children's & Henry Ford Hospitals in the State of \nMichigan. Since its inception, CATCH has issued grants to Children's \nHospital of Michigan and Henry Ford Hospital of Detroit for \napproximately $1.4 million. In addition, the charitable organization \nhas built an endowment of $4.5 million. When he founded CATCH, Mr. \nAnderson said ``there is nothing in this world that you will ever do \nthat's better than helping a child.'' The growth of this endowment will \nallow ``Sparky Anderson's Charity for Children'' to continue helping \nchildren long into the future.\n  I thank Mr. Anderson for all that he has done for the City of Detroit \nand the State of Michigan. He spent his life in baseball quite simply \nbecause he loved the game, and he has never stopped believing that he \nis indebted to the game for the doors it opened for him, and the life \nit afforded him. Perhaps his greatest accomplishment, then, is having \nsuccessfully given back to the game of baseball more than it gave to \nhim, because he certainly has done this. He stands out as one of the \nbest ambassadors for baseball in the history of the game, a sports \nfigure who managed to give as much to his community as he did to his \nteam. I know that he is loved and revered in the State of Michigan not \nonly because of the World Series championship he helped bring to the \nCity of Detroit in 1984, but also because of the manner in which he \nhandled himself over the course of his seventeen years there. He became \nan important part of the Detroit community--his place there transcended \nwins and losses.\n  I am sure that Mr. Anderson will enjoy this special occasion with his \nwife, Carol, who has been with him through the entire journey, and \ntheir family. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I \ncongratulate Mr. Sparky Anderson on his induction into the National \nBaseball Hall of Fame this weekend. Though he will enter the Hall \nwearing a Cincinnati Reds uniform, I know that the Detroit Tigers, the \nCity of Detroit and the State of Michigan will always hold a special \nplace in his heart, just as Sparky continues to hold a special place in \nthe hearts of millions of Michiganians.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/20/senate-section/article/S7386-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7386]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            26TH ANNIVERSARY OF TURKEY'S INVASION OF CYPRUS\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the 26th \nanniversary of the Turkish invasion and occupation of Cyprus. Twenty-\nsix years ago today, Turkey seized on a period of political unrest in \npredominantly Greek Cyprus and invaded its shores. Landing on the north \ncoast of Cyprus with 6,000 troops and 40 tanks, nearly 40 percent of \nthe island was in Turkish control in less than a month, displacing \n200,000 Greek Cypriots from their homes. Today, there are still more \nthan 1,600 Greek Cypriots who remain unaccounted for, serving as silent \nreminders of the unlawful invasion. Turkey continues to defy the \ninternational community and United Nations' Resolutions with its policy \ntowards Cyprus, keeping more than 30,000 troops in the north of the \nisland.\n  I believe that if we want to see future progress in resolving the \ninjustices of a divided Cyprus, the United States, European and \ninternational organizations must put further pressure on the government \nin Ankara. It is Turkey's military and financial backing that provides \nthe leverage for the Turkish Cypriot leadership and its unwillingness \nto make any compromises. Late last year, the European Union accepted \nTurkey as a candidate for admission into the 15-nation economic bloc. \nThe EU has indicated that resolution on the Cyprus matter is a key \ncondition to Turkey's membership, and it has outlined specific economic \nand humanitarian standards that must be accomplished. One such \ncondition is an end to restrictions on the human rights of Greek \nCypriots living in the occupied northen region. I was pleased to \ncosponsor my colleague Senator Snowe's Concurrent Resolution 9 to bring \nattention to this issue.\n  Greece and Turkey are critical members of the NATO alliance and have \nboth been key allies to the United States, supporting our operations in \nthe Balkans and no-fly zones over Iraq. We know the two nations can \nwork together in times of crisis. Last fall, following a massive \nearthquake in Turkey, Greece was among the first to send aid. Greek \nrescue teams helped pull Turkish victims from the rubble. Then Greece \nendured its own deadly quake and Turkey was quick to respond, saving \nmany Greek lives. These examples of bilateral cooperation should also \nbe employed by Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders to demilitarize the \nisland and establish a unified Cyprus with constitutional guarantees \nfor all Cypriots regardless of ethnicity.\n  A new round of proximity talks began on July 5, 2000 between Greek \nand Turkish Cypriot leaders in Geneva, Switzerland. These talks \nrecessed on July 12 but will resume again in early August. Little \ninformation has been available due to the mutual observance of a press \nblackout. However, I hope that these talks will initiate commitments by \nboth sides to come to an agreement.\n  In the past few years we have seen remarkable progress on seemingly \nintractable international conflicts. Northern Ireland is closer to \npeace than any time in history and whatever the outcome of the current \nMiddle East Summit, just the fact that Prime Minister Barak and \nPalestinian leader Yasser Arafat have been talking for nine days is of \ngreat historic significance. I believe the people of Cyprus want and \ndeserve the same opportunity. This year, the Senate version of the FY01 \nForeign Operations Bill again appropriates $15 million to reduce \ntensions, promote peace and cooperation between the two communities. \nHowever, I think we can do more. It is my hope that my colleagues and \nthe Administration will commit to actively assisting the parties in \nresolving the situation in Cyprus. Then we can commemorate the \nreunification rather then the division of this Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/20/senate-section/article/S7386-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7386-S7387]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SPECIAL OLYMPICS ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. GRAMS.

With the motto ``Let me win, but if I cannot \nwin let me be brave in the attempt,'' Special Olympics has for more \nthan 20 years been providing challenges and opportunities for \nindividuals with mental retardation.\n  I want to take this opportunity to commend the numerous ways Special \nOlympics helps not only the athletes who participate, but also their \nfamilies and friends and the many volunteers who have made the program \nsuch a success.\n\n[[Page S7387]]\n\n  Special Olympics plays an important role in the lives of many of the \nmentally challenged throughout the world, including my home state of \nMinnesota. Since the start of Special Olympics, the organization has \ngrown to include more than 1.7 million athletes worldwide, with 3,300 \nin Minnesota.\n  Special Olympians compete in a variety of events at all skill levels. \nCompetitions in events such as basketball, golf, figure skating, and \ngymnastics enhance the lives of all participants and the families who \nroot for them from the stands. These athletes start training as early \nas age six, with some participants in Minnesota competing into their \nsixties. Special Olympics athletes can compete in as many events as \nthey choose.\n  Not only does Special Olympics hold annual competitions, but the \norganization helps participants train year round for their events. This \nencourages Special Olympic participants to develop physical fitness and \ngenerally helps improve their quality of life.\n  The Special Olympics would not be possible without the devoted \nvolunteers who lend their time and effort to this worthwhile cause. \nThere are over 1,700 volunteers in Minnesota who serve as coaches, \nofficials, teachers, and in other capacities. I want to thank all who \ntake time out of their schedule to volunteer through Special Olympics.\n  Mr. President, it is an honor to be able to recognize the \naccomplishments of the Minnesotans involved in Special Olympics. This \norganization deserves recognition for all they do and the positive \nimpact they have on the lives of our Special Olympians.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/20/senate-section/article/S7387-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7387]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      BREAST CANCER RESEARCH STAMP\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

To the very end, Tom was full of life and bullish on the \nfuture.\n  Tom was a loving husband and father, as well as a committed public \nservant. His care and concern for the residents of his city of \nWilmington, and for the people of Delaware, were unmatched. As mayor, \nTom led the effort to bring more people, more jobs, and more \ndevelopment to Wilmington. In many ways, Tom was the originator of the \ndowntown renaissance that continues today.\n  Tom was my opponent in the 1976 race for the U.S. Senate. He was a \nworthy adversary, but an even better friend. In that unique Delaware \ntradition of Return Day, Tom and I ``buried the hatchet'' and forged a \nfriendship that flourished for the next 25 years. Tom and I continued \nto work together on projects and issues important to Wilmington and to \nall Delawareans. The people of the First State owe Tom Maloney a debt \nof thanks for all he has done.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Linda, and the rest of the \nMaloney family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/20/senate-section/article/S7387-3", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7387]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NECESSARILY ABSENT\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, due to important family obligations, \nI was necessarily absent this evening during votes on the Agriculture, \nRural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies \nAppropriation bill for fiscal year 2001.\n  Mr. President, were I present, I would have voted for Senator \nWellstone's amendment, number 3919.\n  Further, were I present, I would have voted for Senator Specter's \namendment, number 3958. I am a cosponsor of the amendment. It corrects \nan inadvertent error in the 1997 Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act \nof 1997 that prevents Amtrak from leasing automobiles from the General \nServices Administration. The amendment will enable Amtrak to continue \nleasing such vehicles until 2003.\n  Further, were I present, I would have voted to find Senator Durbin's \namendment, number 3980, germane. I am a cosponsor of the amendment. The \nAgriculture Appropriation bill includes a rider that would block \nefforts to reform the hardrock mining industry, which has caused and \ncontinues to cause substantial environmental damage to public lands. \nSenator Durbin's amendment would have allowed needed reforms to \nproceed. I have submitted an additional statement on this issue into \nthe Record.\n  Finally, were I present, I would have voted for final passage of the \nAgriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and \nRelated Agencies Appropriation bill for fiscal year 2001.\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Reid for \nrequesting a leave of absence for me for the duration of this week. I \nam traveling home today to attend and speak at tomorrow's memorial \nservice for Mr. Bernie Whitebear, of Seattle, Washington, who passed \naway at the age of 62 on Sunday, July 16, 2000.\n  Earlier in the week, I did have a statement for the Congressional \nRecord about Bernie Whitebear and his many contributions to Washington \nstate. He was a special man to my constituents. He was a special man to \nme. Bernie helped me understand Native American cultures from the \ninside as a participant not as someone sitting on the sidelines. On \nmany occasions, Bernie exposed me to the sense of community and respect \nthat he was always so proud of. Washington state will miss this great \nman and clearly, it is appropriate for me to be with my constituents \ntomorrow to celebrate Bernie Whitebear.\n  I thank my colleagues for their consideration and courtesies and I \nwill have a longer statement next week to discuss Senate floor \nvotes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/20/senate-section/article/S7387-4", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7387-S7388]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING JOSEPH M. GATT\n\n Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a \ndistinguished citizen of Nevada, Joseph M. Gatt. Mr. Gatt's vision and \ninnovation paved the way for millions of Americans to be able to secure \na comfortable retirement. Nearly twenty-five years ago, he was \ninstrumental in developing the prototype that was used for what \nultimately became the 401(k) pension program.\n  Mr. Gatt has been a resident of Las Vegas, Nevada for almost forty \nyears and was a pioneer in the field of financial planning. He worked \nas the Las Vegas agent for the Hartford Insurance Company when he \ninitiated the new pension program for the benefits of the employees of \nthe then MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas. The key to the program was the \nutilization of an existing IRA program on a joint funding basis; that \nis, with contributions from both the employer and the employees, which \nhad never been done before. The incentive to the employee to contribute \nto the program was, of course, that the contribution was tax \ndeductible. The Hartford program was so unique that it was necessary \nfor the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to approve it. On August 25, \n1976, the IRS gave final approval for the Hartford program, and it went \ninto effect immediately. Features of this pension plan included \nportability, 100 percent vesting whether or not the employees remained \nat MGM Grand, and\n\n[[Page S7388]]\n\ngenerous company contibutions. Indeed, Mr. Gatt and the MGM Grand were \nahead of their time.\n  The Las Vegas resorts of Caesar's Place and Circus Circus Hotels soon \nfollowed suit. Today, 401(k) plans are an almost standard part of \nbenefit packages for employees. According to Cerrulli & Associaties, a \nmarketing and research firm, there were 330,000 401(k) plans in the \nUnited States during the last quarter of 1999 in which $2.7 trillion \nwere invested. The creation of this now universally accepted and \nacclaimed program is a considerable credit to the State of Nevada, the \ngaming industry for being the first employer participants, and Joe Gatt \nfor his insight and vision. On behalf of the citizens of Nevada and all \nAmericans, I congratulate Mr. Gatt on this achievement and wish him \ncontinued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/20/senate-section/article/S7388-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7388]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/20/senate-section/article/S7388-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7388]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT ON THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA'S FISCAL YEAR 2001 BUDGET REQUEST \n                ACT--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 121\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  In accordance with section 202(c) of the District of Columbia \nFinancial Management and Responsibility Assistance Act of 1995 and \nsection 446 of the District of Columbia Self-Governmental \nReorganization Act as amended in 1989, I am transmitting the District \nof Columbia's Fiscal Year 2001 Budget Request Act.\n  The proposed FY 2001 Budget reflects the major programmatic \nobjectives of the Mayor, the Council of the District of Columbia, and \nthe District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management \nAssistance Authority.

A bill to normalize trade relations with Cuba, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                THE UNITED STATES-CUBA TRADE ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the outdated \nU.S. embargo on Cuba.\n  Last weekend I traveled to Havana along with my distinguished \ncolleagues Senator Roberts and Senator Akaka. It was a brief trip. But \nit gave U.S. an opportunity to meet with a wide range of people and to \nassess Cuba first-hand. We met with Cuban cabinet ministers and \ndissidents, with the head of the largest NGO in Cuba, with foreign \nambassadors and with Fidel Castro.\n  I left those meetings more convinced than ever that it is time to \nfinally end our Cold War with Cuba policy. We should have normal trade \nrelations with Cuba. Let me explain why.\n  First, this is a unilateral sanctions policy. Nobody else in the \nworld supports it. Not even our closest allies. I have long opposed \nunilateral economic sanctions, unless our national security is at \nstake. Forty years ago Cuba threatened our national security. The \nSoviet Union planted nuclear missiles in Cuba and aimed them at the \nUnited States. Twenty years ago, Cuba was still acting as a force to \ndestabilize Central America.\n  Those days are gone. The missiles are gone. The Soviet Union is gone. \nCuban military and guerilla forces are gone from Central America. The \nsecurity threat is gone. But the embargo remains.\n  My reason for my opposing unilateral sanctions is entirely pragmatic. \nThey don't work. They never worked in the past and they will not work \nin the future. Whenever we stop our farmers and business people from \nexporting, our Japanese, European, and Canadian competitors rush in to \nfill the gap. Unilateral sanctions are a hopelessly ineffective tool, \nexcept that they hurt Americans.\n  The second reason for ending the embargo is that the U.S. embargo \nactually helps Castro.\n  How does it help Castro? I saw it for myself in Havana. The Cuban \neconomy is in shambles. The people's rights are repressed. Fidel Castro \nuses the embargo as the scapegoat for Cuba's misery.\n  As absurd as it sounds, Castro blames the United States for his \nfailed economic policies. Without the embargo, he would have no one to \nblame except himself.\n  Mr. President, for the past ten years I have worked towards \nnormalizing our trade with China. My operating guideline has been \n``Engagement Without Illusions.'' Trade rules don't automatically and \ninstantly yield trade results. We have to push hard every day to see \nthat countries follow the rules. That's certainly the case with China.\n  I have the same attitude towards Cuba. Yes, we should lift the \nembargo. We should do it without preconditions and without demanding \nany quid pro quo from Cuba. We should engage them economically. But we \nshould do so without illusions. Once we lift the embargo, Cuba will not \nbecome a major buyer of our farm goods or manufactured products \novernight.\n  We need to be realistic. With Cuba's failed economy and low income, \nending the embargo won't cause a huge surge of U.S. products to Cuba. \nInstead, it will start sales of some goods, such as food, medicine, \nsome manufactures, and some telecom and Internet services. Right now, \nCuba's imports are primarily from Europe and Asia. With the embargo \nlifted, U.S. products and agriculture will replace some of those sales. \nU.S. exporters will have the advantage of lower transportation costs \nand easier logistics. It will be a start.\n  In addition, ending the embargo will increase Cuban exposure to the \nUnited States. It will result in more travel by tourists, businessmen, \nstudents, and scholars. It will bring U.S. into closer contact with \nthose who will be part of the post-Castro Cuba. It will spur more \ninvestment in Cuba's tourist infrastructure, helping, even if only a \nlittle, to further develop a private sector in the economy.\n  Mr. President, in May of this year, I introduced bipartisan \nlegislation that would repeal all of the Cuba-specific statutes that \ncreate the embargo. That includes the 1992 Cuban Democracy Act and the \n1996 Helms-Burton Act.\n  Today I am introducing further legislation to eliminate impediments \nto a normal trade relationship with Cuba. I am joined in this effort by \nmy colleagues, Senators Lincoln and Murray. My great friend, \nCongressman Charlie Rangel, has introduced a companion bill in the \nHouse.\n  This bill, the U.S.-Cuba Trade Act of 2000, would do two things. \nFirst, it would remove Cuba from coverage under the Jackson-Vanik \namendment. This is the part of the 1974 Trade Act which was enacted to \naddress Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union.\n\n[[Page S7394]]\n\nToday, it the legal provision which causes an annual review of normal \ntrade relations with countries such as China. It is a Cold War law \nwhich is no longer relevant to our 21st century world.\n  In addition, the U.S.-Cuba Trade Act would eliminate a technical \nprovision that prevents Cuba from obtaining normal WTO tariff rates.\n  Mr. President, the world has changed since the United States started \nthis embargo forty years ago. Our policy has to change with it. I \nencourage all of my colleagues to support this effort to put in place a \nresponsible economic policy toward Cuba.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROBB (for himself, Mr. Breaux, Ms. Landrieu, Ms. Snowe, \n        and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 2897. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nthe use of completed contract method of accounting in the case of \ncertain long-term naval vessel construction contracts; to the Committee \non Finance.\n\n\n              COMPLETED SHIP DELIVERY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING\n\n Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce this \nlegislation today with Senators Breaux, Landrieu, Snowe, and Warner. \nThis legislation is an important step towards supporting and \nmaintaining a 300 ship Navy to defend our Nation's shores and waters. \nBy allowing military ship builders to go back to the Completed Ship \nDelivery Method of accounting, more resources will be available for \nresearch and development which will ultimately lead to better naval \nvessels made more inexpensively. Ultimately, this is a win-win \nsituation.\n  Prior to 1982, ship builders calculated and paid their tax \nliabilities when they had completed building the vessel. Due to \nconcerns over abuses, this accounting method was changed and military \nship builders were required to pay taxes each year based on an \napproximation of what eventual profits might be. Military ships can \ntake from three to seven years to build. During this period there can \nbe wide fluctuations in various cost factors such as supplies and \nlabor. Accordingly, it is very hard to predict what the eventual \nprofits will be until the last rivet has been put in place. On the flip \nside, because even the most protracted ship building project will be \ncompleted in no more than seven years, the ability to game the system \nis limited. To minimize the ability of anyone to abuse this provision, \nthis legislation requires that only ships that take at least two years \nto build are eligible for this treatment.\n  It is time to correct this unfair tax treatment. By allowing military \nship builders to use the Completed Ship Delivery Method of accounting, \nthe ship builders will continue to pay the same amount of tax and \nreceive the same treatment as non-military ship builders. The only \ndifference is that they will be allowed to pay it when they have an \naccurate idea of the actual profits on that specific vessel. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues on this matter.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SCHUMER:\n  S. 2898. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to provide for \nthe disclosure of electronic monitoring of employee communications and \ncomputer usage in the workplace; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                  NOTICE OF ELECTRONIC MONITORING ACT\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Notice of \nElectronic Monitoring Act (``NEMA''), which will end the practice of \nunjustified secret electronic monitoring of workers by their employers. \nCompanion legislation is also being introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives by Representatives Canady and Barr.\n\n  With the revolutionary changes that technology and the Internet are \nbringing to society, come new threats to individual privacy. One of \nthose is electronic employee monitoring. A lot of people don't know \nthis yet, but, for all intents and purposes, the computer you use at \nwork can watch your every move.\n  Over the course of the past year, new software has been developed \nthat makes it easy and cheap for employers to automatically record an \nemployees' e-mail, web activities, even an employees' every key stroke.\n  For example, one software product claims that it reviews more than \n50,000 e-mail messages per hour, silently, discretely, and continuously \nauditing e-mail content moving in and out of a company. This product \ncan be run from any workstation, and can be set up and running in \nminutes. After a free 30-day trial of the software, an employer can buy \nit for a mere $400.\n  My point is not that such software products are per se bad. Indeed, \nelectronic monitoring can sometimes be helpful in protecting corporate \ntrade secrets or preventing employee harassment. My point is that new \ntechnologies that allow any employer to monitor employees without their \nknowledge is becoming ubiquitous, cheap, and simple to install and use.\n  And it is becoming a problem. The number of employers who monitor \nemployee e-mail has doubled in the last two years. A recent survey \nindicates that as of last year, nearly three quarters of large American \ncompanies actively record and review either e-mail, Internet usage, \ncomputer files, or phone usage.\n  NEMA puts a check on business that is reasonable and fair. It gives \nemployees the right to know whether, when, and how their employer is \nwatching. We would never stand for it if an employer steamed open an \nemployees' mail, read it, and put it back without her knowledge. It \nshould be the same with email.\n  Employees are going to occasionally write personal emails like a \nmessage to a spouse about a financial problem, or use the Internet to \ndo a personal search for a medical question they have. All employees \nshould know before doing a search or sending an email, whether they \nhave privacy or not.\n  NEMA requires employers to notify their employees of any monitoring \nof communications or computer usage. It covers reading or scanning of \nemployee e-mail, keystroke monitoring, or programs that monitor \nemployee web use, as well as monitoring of telephone conversations.\n  Importantly, NEMA does not prohibit any monitoring techniques, it \nmerely requires employers to give clear and conspicuous notice annually \nand whenever policies change. And if the employer has good reason to \nbelieve that an employee is causing significant harm to the employer or \nany other person, the employer can monitor that person without any \nnotice at all.\n  If an employer secretly monitors in violation of the Act, they are \nsubject to suit by the employee for at most $20,000 in damages. \nHowever, I believe that such lawsuits will be few and far between \nbecause employers will simply abide by the modest terms of the Act and \ngive annual notice.\n  New technology has made it cheap and easy for employers to secretly \nmonitor everything an employee does on line. This legislation provides \nworkers a first line of defense against a practice that can sometimes \namount to nothing more than a blatant invasion of privacy. NEMA is a \nmoderate and fair step that addresses an important threat to employee \nprivacy that is quietly but quickly spreading to most workplaces.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 2899. A bill to express the policy of the United States regarding \nthe United States' relationship with Native Hawaiians, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n           UNITED STATES' RELATIONSHIP WITH NATIVE HAWAIIANS\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I stand before you today to introduce a \nbill on behalf of myself and my dear friend and colleague, Senator \nInouye, that is of great significance to the indigenous peoples of \nHawaii--the Native Hawaiians. This measure clarifies the political \nrelationship between Native Hawaiians and the United States. For years, \nCongress has legislated on behalf of Native Hawaiians as the \naboriginal, indigenous, native peoples of Hawaii. This measure \nclarifies that political relationship and provides a process for Native \nHawaiians to form a Native Hawaiian governing body to engage in a \ngovernment-to-government relationship with the United States.\n  The United States has declared a special responsibility for the \nwelfare of the Native peoples of the United States, including Native \nHawaiians. This relationship has been acknowledged by the United States \nsince the\n\n[[Page S7395]]\n\ninception of Hawaii's status as a territory. This relationship was most \nexplicitly affirmed by the enactment of the Hawaiian Homes Commission \nAct of 1920, which set aside 200,000 acres of land in Hawaii for \nhomesteading by Native Hawaiians. Legislative history clearly shows \nthat in addressing this situation, Congress based this action and \nsubsequent legislation on the constitutional precedent in programs \nenacted for the benefit of American Indians.\n  Since Hawaii's admission into the Union, Congress has continued to \nlegislate on behalf of Native Hawaiians as indigenous peoples. Native \nHawaiians have been included as Native Americans in a number of federal \nstatutes which have addressed the conditions of Native Hawaiians. This \npolitical relationship has been discussed within the Native Hawaiian \ncommunity for many, many years. A large portion of the discussion has \ncentered around the history of Hawaii's indigenous peoples and the \nUnited States' role in that history.\n  In 1993, Congress passed P.L. 103-150, the Apology Resolution, which \nextended an apology on behalf of the United States to the Native people \nof Hawaii for the United States' role in the overthrow of the Kingdom \nof Hawaii. The Apology Resolution also expressed the commitment of \nCongress and the President to acknowledge the ramifications of the \noverthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii and to support reconciliation \nefforts between the United States and Native Hawaiians. The process of \nreconciliation is ongoing.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is important not only to Native \nHawaiians, but also to all people in Hawaii. This measure provides the \nprocess to begin resolving many longstanding issues facing Hawaii's \nindigenous peoples and the State of Hawaii. In addressing these issues, \nwe have begun a process of healing, a process of reconciliation not \nonly with the United States but within the State of Hawaii. The essence \nof Hawaii is characterized not by the beauty of its islands, but by the \nbeauty of its people. The State of Hawaii has recognized, acknowledged \nand acted upon the need to preserve the culture, tradition, language \nand heritage of Hawaii's indigenous peoples. This measure furthers \nthese actions.\n  Mr. President, the clarification of the political relationship \nbetween Native Hawaiians and the United States is one that has been \nlong in coming and is well-deserved. The history and the timing of \nHawaii's admission to the United States, unfortunately, did not provide \nthe appropriate structure for a government-to-government relationship \nbetween Hawaii's indigenous native peoples and the United States. The \ntime has come to correct this injustice.\n  Mr. President, I request unanimous consent that the text of this \nmeasure be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the ordered to be printed in the Record, as \nfollows:\n\n                                S. 2899\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Constitution vests Congress with the authority to \n     address the conditions of the indigenous, native people of \n     the United States;\n       (2) Native Hawaiians, the native people of the State of \n     Hawaii are indigenous, native people of the United States;\n       (3) the United States has a special trust relationship to \n     promote the welfare of the native people of the United \n     States, including Native Hawaiians;\n       (4) under the treaty-making power of the United States, \n     Congress exercised its constitutional authority to confirm a \n     treaty between the United States and the government that \n     represented the Hawaiian people, and from 1826 until 1893, \n     the United States recognized the independence of the Kingdom \n     of Hawaii, extended full diplomatic recognition to the \n     Hawaiian Government, and entered into treaties and \n     conventions with the Hawaiian monarchs to govern commerce and \n     navigation in 1826, 1842, 1849, 1875, and 1887;\n       (5) pursuant to the provisions of the Hawaiian Homes \n     Commission Act, 1920 (42 Stat. 108, chapter 42), the United \n     States set aside 200,000 acres of land in the Federal \n     territory that later became the State of Hawaii in order to \n     establish a homeland for the native people of Hawaii, Native \n     Hawaiians;\n       (6) by setting aside 200,000 acres of land for Native \n     Hawaiian homesteads and farms, the Act assists the Native \n     Hawaiian community in maintaining distinct native settlements \n     throughout the State of Hawaii;\n       (7) approximately 6,800 Native Hawaiian lessees and their \n     family members reside on Hawaiian Home Lands and \n     approximately 18,000 Native Hawaiians who are eligible to \n     reside on the Home Lands are on a waiting list to receive \n     assignments of land;\n       (8) the Hawaiian Home Lands continue to provide an \n     important foundation for the ability of the Native Hawaiian \n     community to maintain the practice of Native Hawaiian \n     culture, language, and traditions, and Native Hawaiians have \n     maintained other distinctly native areas in Hawaii;\n       (9) on November 23, 1993, Public Law 103-150 (107 Stat. \n     1510) (commonly known as the Apology Resolution) was enacted \n     into law, extending an apology on behalf of the United States \n     to the Native people of Hawaii for the United States' role in \n     the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii;\n       (10) the Apology Resolution acknowledges that the overthrow \n     of the Kingdom of Hawaii occurred with the active \n     participation of agents and citizens of the United States and \n     further acknowledges that the Native Hawaiian people never \n     directly relinquished their claims to their inherent \n     sovereignty as a people over their national lands to the \n     United States, either through their monarchy or through a \n     plebiscite or referendum;\n       (11) the Apology Resolution expresses the commitment of \n     Congress and the President to acknowledge the ramifications \n     of the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii and to support \n     reconciliation efforts between the United States and Native \n     Hawaiians; and to have Congress and the President, through \n     the President's designated officials, consult with Native \n     Hawaiians on the reconciliation process as called for under \n     the Apology Resolution;\n       (12) despite the overthrow of the Hawaiian government, \n     Native Hawaiians have continued to maintain their separate \n     identity as a distinct native community through the formation \n     of cultural, social, and political institutions, and to give \n     expression to their rights as native people to self-\n     determination and self-governance as evidenced through their \n     participation in the Office of Hawaiian Affairs;\n       (13) Native Hawaiians also maintain a distinct Native \n     Hawaiian community through the provision of governmental \n     services to Native Hawaiians, including the provision of \n     health care services, educational programs, employment and \n     training programs, children's services, conservation \n     programs, fish and wildlife protection, agricultural \n     programs, native language immersion programs and native \n     language immersion schools from kindergarten through high \n     school, as well as college and master's degree programs in \n     native language immersion instruction, and traditional \n     justice programs, and by continuing their efforts to enhance \n     Native Hawaiian self-determination and local control;\n       (14) Native Hawaiians are actively engaged in Native \n     Hawaiian cultural practices, traditional agricultural \n     methods, fishing and subsistence practices, maintenance of \n     cultural use areas and sacred sites, protection of burial \n     sites, and the exercise of their traditional rights to gather \n     medicinal plants and herbs, and food sources;\n       (15) the Native Hawaiian people wish to preserve, develop, \n     and transmit to future Native Hawaiian generations their \n     ancestral lands and Native Hawaiian political and cultural \n     identity in accordance with their traditions, beliefs, \n     customs and practices, language, and social and political \n     institutions, and to achieve greater self-determination over \n     their own affairs;\n       (16) this Act responds to the desire of the Native Hawaiian \n     people for enhanced self-determination by establishing a \n     process within the framework of Federal law for the Native \n     Hawaiian people to exercise their inherent rights as a \n     distinct aboriginal, indigenous, native community to \n     reorganize a Native Hawaiian governing body for the purpose \n     of giving expression to their rights as native people to \n     self-determination and self-governance;\n       (17) the United States has declared that--\n       (A) the United States has a special responsibility for the \n     welfare of the native peoples of the United States, including \n     Native Hawaiians;\n       (B) Congress has identified Native Hawaiians as a distinct \n     indigenous group within the scope of its Indian affairs \n     power, and has enacted dozens of statutes on their behalf \n     pursuant to its recognized trust responsibility; and\n       (C) Congress has also delegated broad authority to \n     administer a portion of the federal trust responsibility to \n     the State of Hawaii;\n       (18) the United States has recognized and reaffirmed the \n     special trust relationship with the Native Hawaiian people \n     through--\n       (A) the enactment of the Act entitled ``An Act to provide \n     for the admission of the State of Hawaii into the Union'', \n     approved March 18, 1959 (Public Law 86-3; 73 Stat. 4) by--\n       (i) ceding to the State of Hawaii title to the public lands \n     formerly held by the United States, and mandating that those \n     lands be held in public trust for the betterment of the \n     conditions of Native Hawaiians;

Mr. President, I rise today to support and cosponsor a \nbill, introduced by my dear friend and colleague Senator Daniel Akaka, \nwhich formally expresses the policy of the United States with regard to \nits relationship with Native Hawaiians.\n  Mr. President, I have had the honor of serving as the Senator from \nHawai`i since 1962. And for twenty of those years I have been \nprivileged to sit on the Committee on Indian Affairs where I have been \na staunch supporter of rights for American Indians, Alaska Natives, and \nNative Hawaiians. The bill reaffirms that the United States has not \nonly a legal and political relationship with the native people of \nHawai`i, but a special trust relationship to promote the welfare of the \nNative Hawaiian people.\n  The Constitution empowers the Congress to direct the United States' \nrelationship with American Indians as aboriginal, indigenous, native \npeople. As territory was added to the United States, it came to be \nunderstood that Congress also has the authority to address the \nconditions of the native people of those areas that have become\n\n[[Page S7399]]\n\npart of the United States, namely Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiians. \nAlthough the three groups of native people are ethnically and \nculturally unique and distinct from one another, the United States \nrecognizes that it has a special trust relationship with each group. \nThis special relationship allows Congress to treat native people \ndifferently than its other citizens.\n  Over the course of the last 80 years, the Congress has enacted over \n150 public laws that recognize and affect Native Hawaiians as native \npeople. And most recently, the United States filed an amicus curiae \nbrief in the United States Supreme Court that clearly established that \nthe United States has a political and legal relationship with Native \nHawaiians. The United States, through the actions of its legislative \nand executive branches, has viewed and treated Native Hawaiians as \naboriginal, indigenous, native people.\n  This bill clarifies that the United States has a legal and political \nrelationship with Native Hawaiians as the aboriginal, indigenous, \nnative people of Hawai`i and reaffirms the Constitutional authority of \nthe Congress to address the conditions of Native Hawaiians through \nlegislation. The bill also reaffirms the policy of the United States \nthat Native Hawaiians have the inherent right to self-determination, \nself-governance, and the right to autonomy in their internal affairs. \nMost importantly this bill establishes a process by which Native \nHawaiians can reorganize their governing body.\n  Mr. President, since I have served in the Congress, the United \nStates' policy toward its native people has been one of self-\ndetermination. We now deal with American Indian Tribes and Alaska \nNatives Villages on a sovereign-to-sovereign basis. I think that this \nis the appropriate policy. Unfortunately, Native Hawaiians have not had \nthe opportunity to fully enjoy this self-determination policy because \nwe have failed to establish the framework for a government-to-\ngovernment relationship. This bill would provide that framework. This \nbill is just, right, and long overdue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url":
