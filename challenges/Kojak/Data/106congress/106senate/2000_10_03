Mr. President, it is my understanding that we are now in \nthe time equally divided on the H-1B matter to be voted on at 10 \no'clock.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, H-1B originated in our immigration laws in \nthe 1950's so that trained professionals could work for a limited time \nin the U.S. In 1990, a cap was set on the category for the first time \nof 65,000.\n  Employers in every industry and sector of our economy, including \nmanufacturing, higher education, health care, research, finance and \nothers, have used it.\n  Employers from major multinational companies to small businesses \nseeking individuals with specific skills needed to grow their companies \nhave used it.\n  It became wildly popular in the mid to late 90s following the \nInternet boom, when hundreds of hungry tech startups across the country \nbegan using it to recruit high tech workers from information technology \njobs, mostly from India, China, Canada, and Britain. Some 420,000 are \nhere today.\n  Those individuals have filled a critical shortage of high-tech \nworkers in this country, which in fact, still exists today.\n  The American Competitiveness in the Twenty-first Century Act of 2000 \nproposes to raise the caps for the number of H-1B workers that \nemployers can bring into the United States for the next 3 years.N O T I \nC E\n\nEffective January 1, 2001, the subscription price of the \nCongressional Record will be $393 per year or $197 for six months. \nIndividual issues may be purchased for $4.00 per copy.

DiMario, Public \nPrinter\n\n[[Page S9644]]\n\n  When Congress set the 65,000 cap on H-1Bs in 1990, it was not based \non any economic data or scientific study of the need.\n  And, this limitation was not challenged until 1997 when for the first \ntime the cap was reached at the end of the fiscal year.\n  The following year the cap was again reached, but this time by May \n1998. The cap has been reached earlier in each successive year.\n  In response to the increased demand, language was incorporated into \nthe Omnibus Appropriations Act of 1998 to raise the cap on H-1B visas \nto 115,000 in fiscal year 1999; and 115,000 in fiscal year 2000; and \n107,500 in fiscal year 2001.\n  Under the Omnibus Act of 1998 the cap would return to its original \nlevel of 65,000 after fiscal year 2001.\n  Despite the increases, continuing economic growth has led many in the \ntechnology sector particularly, to call for a further increase in the \ncaps.\n  In fiscal year 1999 the INS reached the H-1B cap in June and stated \nthat there my have been more than 20,000 additional visas issued over \nand above the ceiling.\n  The higher demand for H-1B visas has continued in fiscal year 2000.\n  In March of this year, the INS stopped accepting new H-1B \napplications, having enough cases in its pipeline to reach the cap.\n  In order to compensate for the demand, the INS began processing \npetitions in August 2000 for workers who are set to begin working \nfiscal year 2001.\n  Based on past years' filling patterns, the INS may have as many as \n60,000 cases already pending to count against the 107,500 visas now \navailable.\n  Most employers predict that the current visa allotment will expire \nbefore January.\n  There is no question we need to raise the cap for H-1B professionals.\n  I have always been in support of H-1B, as many of my colleagues have \nbeen.\n  But I have also been in support of the Latino Immigrant and Fairness \nAct, which I am a cosponsor and which I continue to strongly support.\n  But supporting one does not rule out supporting the other.\n  American industry's explosive demand for skilled and highly skilled \nworkers is being stifled by the current federal quota on H-1B visas for \nforeign-born highly skilled workers.\n  The quota is hampering output, especially in high-technology sectors, \nand forcing companies to consider moving production offshore. Some \ncompanies already have.\n  The number of H-1B visas was unlimited before 1990, when it was \ncapped at 65,000 a year.\n  In 1998 the annual cap was raised to 115,000 for 1999 and 2000 and \ncurrently there is a need once more to raise that cap.\n  The shortage shows no sign of abating.\n  Demand for core information technology workers in the United States \nis expected to grow by 150,000 a year for the next 8 years, a rate of \ngrowth that cannot be met by the domestic labor supply alone.\n  H-1B workers create jobs for Americans by enabling the creation of \nnew products and spurring innovation.\n  High-tech industry executives estimate that a new H-1B engineer will \ntypically create demand for an additional 3-5 American workers.\n  T.J. Rodgers of Cypress Semiconductor testified last year before \nCongress that for every H-1B professional he hires, he creates at least \n5 more U.S. jobs to develop, manufacture, package, sell and distribute \nthe products created.\n  H-1B workers are not driving down wages for native workers, in fact, \nwages are rising fastest and unemployment rates are lowest in \nindustries in which H-1B workers are most prevalent.\n  High tech wages have risen 27 percent in the last decade, compared to \n5 percent for the rest of the private sector.\n  The current unemployment rate for electrical engineers is 1.4 \npercent, 1.7 percent for systems analysts and 2.3 percent for computer \nprogrammers.\n  The vast majority of H-1B workers are being paid the legally required \nprevailing wage or more, undercutting charges that they are driving \ndown wages.\n  The H-1B program mandates that these individuals be paid the higher \nof the average wage paid to workers in an area, or what the employer \npays their U.S. workforce whichever is higher.\n  H-1B workers in many cases, because of their unique or highly \ndemanded skills, earn more than U.S. workers.\n  For the reasons mentioned I am happy to support the American \nCompetitiveness in the Twenty-first Century Act of 2000.\n  The ability to fill gaps in the workforce with qualified foreign \nnational professionals rapidly, helps American business stay strong.\n  Mr. President, I am happy to support H-1B. It is good legislation \nthat is very important. I am disappointed that we are not voting at the \nsame time on the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act, which we debated \nextensively last week, and I am sorry to say that on a straight party \nline vote we were prevented from voting up or down on this issue. That \nis a disappointment to me and to many millions of people in this \ncountry. I think the majority made a terrible mistake in that regard. \nBut that does not take away from the need for the H-1B legislation we \nare going to pass today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. The chairman of the Judiciary Committee is not here. I \nbelieve he would approve of my yielding myself such time as I may need \nto speak this morning.\n  Mr. President, the H-1B visa program, which we will be addressing \ntoday when we vote on the American Competitiveness in the Twenty-first \nCentury Act, is the subject of much interesting debate in our country \ntoday. One thing everybody agrees on is we face a serious worker \nshortage with respect to high-tech employment and skilled labor in \nAmerica today. Most of the recent studies that have been produced on \nthis subject indicate there are perhaps as many as 1 million unfilled \npositions in information technology today. The projections are that we \nwill be creating somewhere between 150,000 and 200,000 new positions in \nthese areas in each of the next 10 years. Yet in spite of the very \nlucrative and, I think, substantive nature of these jobs, our training \nprograms, our college programs, our high school programs are not \nproducing enough American workers to fill these posts today.\n  This presents us with a short-term problem and a long-term challenge. \nThe short-term problem is how to fill these key positions immediately \nso that we don't lose opportunities to foreign competitors, or so that \nwe don't force American businesses to move offshore to where skilled \nworkers might live. The long-term problem is to determine what we can \ndo to make certain that in the future we have a sufficient workforce of \ntrained Americans to fill these jobs, because it is quite clear to me \nthat immigration can only be a stopgap, short-term solution to these \nproblems.\n  I am pleased we have reached an agreement on this legislation across \nthe aisle with our colleagues because we need to act today. The \nlegislation before us will allow a short-term increase in the number of \nskilled professionals allowed to work in this country on H-1B temporary \nvisas and will help and encourage more disadvantaged young people to \npursue studies related to high-tech. It will assure those young people \nof good jobs and good wages far into the future, and I believe it will \nalso provide resources for the training and retraining of people in the \nworkforce today, so they can begin to fill more of these positions as \nwell.\n  To help young people, this bill will provide, we estimate, over \n60,000 scholarships for American students in the math and science \nfields. Scholarships like this have already been available as a result \nof the American Competitiveness Act, which we passed in 1998--\nlegislation that began the process of diverting application fees \nconnected to the H-1B visas into scholarship and retraining funds.\n  The bill's training provisions will provide over 150,000 U.S. workers \nwith access to training to help prepare them for the high-tech jobs of \ntoday and tomorrow. Interestingly, Mr. President, there is overwhelming \nunanimity that we must act in this fashion if we are to keep our \neconomy strong. The support\n\n[[Page S9645]]\n\nfrom across the political spectrum for this H-1B visa increase is \nstrong, ranging from the White House--not just the current occupant and \nstaff but such people as former chief economic adviser to President \nClinton, Laura D'Andrea, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, and \nlegislative leaders on both sides of the aisle.\n  Indeed, in hearings we have conducted in the Immigration \nSubcommittee, we have heard from people throughout industry in America, \nnot just the high-tech companies we think of when we think about these \nworkers but people who employ high-tech workers in other phases and \nforms of manufacturing across the board; they have all indicated that \nthe need to fill these provisions is significant and immediate. Indeed, \nwe received countless pieces of information that led to a pretty clear \nindication that if we don't allow these technically skilled workers to \ncome here, companies will be forced to move product lines, divisions \nperhaps, and whole operations overseas.\n  That won't help Americans. That will cost Americans jobs. Of course, \nthere are those who have criticized this program over the years--people \nwho are protectionist in their views on these sorts of issues. But it \nis important to make sure the record is clear that we can build in \nprotections for American workers to make certain that they cannot be \ntaken advantage of through the high-tech H-1B program.\n  Indeed, in 1998 we addressed many, if not all, of the issues which \nwere raised with respect to H-1B visas and the possible displacement of \nAmericans workers.\n  In 1988, the bill wrote into law three types of lay-off protections \nfor American workers. And we have also, of course, included in the H-1B \nprogram requirements that the prevailing wage be paid to people who \ncome in under this program so companies cannot game the system and \nsomehow or another in any way pay foreign workers less and thus deprive \nAmerican workers of opportunities. But, as I said, whether it is the \nSilicon Valley or the Research Triangle or the traditionally well-known \nhigh-tech sectors or whether it is in my State of Michigan, the need \nfor these workers is extraordinarily strong.\n  For instance, the Michigan Economic Development Corporation is \nspending $2.7 million on an ad campaign and a revamped web site to \nattract knowledgeable workers to our State. The head of our economic \ndevelopment division says we are the only State to fully redirect our \nresources to recruiting businesses for recruiting workers to Michigan. \nIndeed, in one county alone--Oakland County--the estimate is that we \ncurrently need 10,000 engineers just to fill the positions that are \nprojected to be needed today and in the immediate future. If we can't \nfind those people, those companies and the jobs that are connected to \nthose engineering jobs will go elsewhere. It is a challenge that we \nmust address.\n  Let me just say that in the short term the only appropriate way we \nare going to be able to deal with this is through an increase in the H-\n1B visa program. But the long-term solution cannot be based on \nimmigration alone. Indeed, this program is only a 3-year increase.\n  I think it is clear that the world now is competing. Virtually any \ncountry that wants to be competitive is working hard to attract the \nmost talented and skilled people to their country and to their \nbusinesses to create strength in their economies. Thus, America must, \nin addition to the passage of today's legislation, focus even more of \nour resources and more of our attention on the important need of both \nencouraging young people to pursue careers in math, science, \nengineering, computer sciences, and so on but also in retraining \nworkers to try to fill more of these positions because I predict that \nin the very near future immigration will not even come close to meeting \nour employment needs with respect to these high-tech positions.\n  For those reasons, the provisions which were launched in the 1998 \nAmerican Competitiveness Act, and which are strengthened even in this \nlegislation, I hope by the time we finish this process, will provide \neven more resources for education and training which are key to the \nlong-term needs that we have in this country.\n  They alone will not be enough because it is pretty obvious that to \ngenerate the kind of skilled workforce in the 21st century needed to \nfill the sorts of technology positions that are going to be created, \nwhether they are positions in the research area or manufacturing area \nor anywhere else, requires us to go well beyond even what we will have \nin this legislation.\n\n  I am very dedicated to working to make sure that we provide the \nFederal support necessary to make it possible for those kinds of \ntechnology positions to be filled by American workers. But it is going \nto take a comprehensive effort--an effort that is not just a Federal \nprogram but one that incorporates the private sector as well as the \npublic sector, the corporate sector, and the government sector at all \nlevels, and to involve our education system at all levels or we will \nfind ourselves seeing foreign competitors gaining ground on America \nwhen it comes to leading the world with respect to advanced \ntechnologies.\n  This means that not only must we make sure that the students today \nget the training they need but that the college programs be expanded \nand the retraining programs be generated. It also means that we must \naddress so many other issues--whether it is passing our Millennium \nClassrooms Act which will provide more computer courses for the \nclassrooms of America, especially those in the economically \ndisadvantaged areas or whether it means working together in a \ncollaborative effort with the private sector to ensure that there are \nmore resources directed at education and the training of workers who \nare in the workforce today, it is all part of what we must address or \nwe will find that in the global economy of the 21st century our \ncompetitive edge is going to be somewhat reduced. We certainly don't \nwant that to happen.\n  I compliment Senator Hatch for his ongoing leadership on this issue. \nWe have worked together since 1998 when we passed the American \nCompetitiveness Act. He has been a leader on these issues for many \nyears. His leadership in the passage of this legislation, and his \nwillingness to come to the floor and work over a very long period of \ntime to make sure this bill, which we passed out of the Judiciary \nCommittee by an overwhelming vote many months ago, finally, today, gets \nthe consideration it deserves. I think he deserves all of our thanks. \nHopefully, this process will now move quickly towards completion, and \nwe will be able to provide the additional workers needed to make sure \nthe key positions in technology in our country will be filled.\n  I say also to those who have raised some of the other immigration-\nrelated issues that as chairman of the subcommittee, I remain anxious \nto continue to work with people--whether it is on the H-2A visa \nprogram, the agricultural workers issues, or Latino fairness issues, \nand so on. It is unfortunate that we couldn't come to an agreement on \nthis legislation some months ago when we were trying to work out an \nagreement. But certainly the subcommittee intends to continue to focus \non these issues into the future. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on all of these.\n  In conclusion, I thank Senator Hatch for working with me on this. I \nappreciate his leadership very much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor S. 2045, the American Competitiveness in the Twenty-First Century \nAct. Although it deals ostensibly with the visa cap on foreign-born \nhigh-tech workers, its effect would be far more profound--to enhance \nthe dynamism of the American economy at a time when U.S. companies, if \ngiven access to the necessary resources, are poised to dominate the \nInformation Age for decades to come. As the representatives of the \nAmerican people, we in Congress should do all we can to contribute to \ntheir potential for success in the global economy.\n  I am convinced that the best thing government can often do to advance \nthe fortunes of the private sector is to stay out of its way. I support \nthis bill because it makes progress toward that end, by improving \ncompanies' flexibility to hire the talent they need, while providing \nfor the regulatory framework and new educational opportunities to \nprotect and promote American workers. By raising the arbitrary cap on \ntemporary immigrant visas for skilled foreign workers--a cap set in \n1990 and insufficiently increased in\n\n[[Page S9646]]\n\n1998--this legislation gets government out of the way of American \ncompanies, universities, and research labs which simply cannot hire the \nskilled professionals they need in the domestic labor market because of \nan arbitrary, anachronistic cap on H-1B visas that does not reflect the \nforces of supply and demand in the American economy today.\n  T.J. Rodgers, president and CEO of Cypress Semiconductor Corporation, \ncaptures best the logic of the H-1B program when he says, ``It takes \ntwo percent of Americans to feed us all, and five percent to make \neverything we need. Everything else will be service and information \ntechnology, and in that world humans and brains will be the key \nvariable. Any country that would limit its brain power to a single \nselect group from that country alone is going to self-destruct.''\n  The American Competitiveness Act of 1998, which I co-sponsored, \nraised the annual cap on H-1B visas for skilled professionals from \n65,000 in Fiscal Year 1998 to 115,000 in both FY 1999 and FY 2000, and \nto 107,500 in FY 2001. Nonetheless, even the higher number of H-1B \nadmissions authorized by Congress for FY 1999 was reached only eight \nmonths into that fiscal year, and the FY 2000 cap was reached in March \n2000, or only six months into the current fiscal year.\n  S. 2045 authorizes an increase in the annual H-1B cap to 195,000 \nthrough FY 2002. All evidence indicates an increase is warranted. \nHowever, there is little evidence supporting the specific figure of \n195,000. In fact, industry estimates of the number of unfilled high-\ntech jobs range from 300,000-800,000.\n  The original H-1B visa ceiling of 65,000, enacted in 1990, did not \nadequately foresee American companies' need for high-tech foreign \nworkers. As this year's Judiciary Committee report accompanying S. 2045 \nstates, by 1998 ``access [to skilled foreign personnel] was being \ncurbed by a cap on H-1B visas put in place almost a decade earlier, in \n1990, when no one understood the scope of the information revolution \nthat was about to hit.'' Yet, our important 1998 legislation raising \nthe H-1B caps similarly missed the mark by understating domestic demand \nfor highly trained professionals. As the 2000 Committee report states, \n``In fact, in 1998, the error Congress made was in underestimating the \nworkforce needs of the United States in the year 2000. . . . As a \nresult, the 1998 bill has proven to be insufficient to meet the current \ndemand for skilled professionals.''\n  While I strongly support passage of this legislation to increase H-1B \nvisa admissions, I also wonder: given Congress' shortsightedness each \ntime we have attempted to forecast the private sector's demand for \nhighly skilled workers, how are we to know this time that we have \nstruck the right balance? To resolve this dilemma, I introduced \nlegislation on October 27, 1999, that would lift the H-1B ceiling while \nfocusing more heavily on the underlying problem resulting in a shortage \nof skilled American workers. My bill, S. 1804, the 21st Century \nTechnology Resources and Commercial Leadership Act, addresses the need \nto improve Americans' skills in math, science, engineering, and \ntechnology in order to maintain our world leadership in high-tech \nfields. Several other bills before Congress would raise the H-1B visa \ncap, but focus less on the long-term goal of educating and training \nAmericans to fill available high-tech jobs.\n  S. 1804 would encourage innovation in improving elementary and \nsecondary education in math, science, and engineering, as well as \nprovide powerful incentives to retrain American workers who lack the \nskills to compete in the high-tech economy. In the interim, to provide \nfor the requisite number of highly skilled professionals until we have \neducated and trained a sufficient number of Americans to fill these \njobs, the bill would lift the cap on H-1B visas through 2006. All \ncurrent information indicates that the supply of American professionals \nin the math, science, engineering, and technology fields will not meet \nthe demand of American industries through at least that date.\n  Specifically, S. 1804 provides for grants to be awarded under the \nsupervision of the Secretary of Commerce in consultation with the \nOffice of Technology Policy and the National Science Foundation, on a \ncompetitive basis, for implementing programs that will improve the \nmath, science, engineering, and technology skills of American students \nand professionals. The types of programs to be awarded grants are not \nspecified so that Congress does not unintentionally foreclose new and \nmore innovative ideas from surfacing. The grants would be funded from \ncurrent H-1B visa application fees and could be awarded to companies, \norganizations, schools, school districts, teachers, and institutions of \nhigher learning.\n  My legislation would use H-1B visa fees to encourage innovation in \nour schools, to teach American students the skills they will need to \nsucceed in the 21st century economy, and in our companies, to train and \nretain American workers in the high-tech skills American businesses \nrely upon. The legislation would support corporate partnerships with \nschools or school districts to improve math and science curricula; \nscholarships for students willing to study advanced engineering or \ntechnology fields, and for those who agree to teach math or science for \na period of time after graduating college; and innovative worker \ntraining and retraining programs within American companies. It leaves \nopen grant support for any proposal that promises to improve the \nAmerican talent pool in high-tech fields.\n  Although I regret that the Congress chose not to take this approach \nin favor of that proposed by S. 2045, I commend the sponsor of the \npending legislation for incorporating provisions involving public-\nprivate education partnerships in K-12 math, science, and technology \nthrough National Science foundation grants, as my legislation \noriginally proposed. Inclusion of these provisions drawn from S. 1804 \nsignificantly strengthens the final bill we are voting on today. As \noriginally introduced, S. 2045 did not contain these components, and I \nam pleased that the sponsors were able to incorporate them.\n  Ultimately, the answer to the shortage of highly skilled workers must \nbe found at home, in the form of a new generation of Americans educated \nin the skills demanded by our knowledge-based economy in this ear of \nglobalization. In the meantime, raising the H-1B cap is the right thing \nto do. S. 2045, by increasing high-tech visa admissions while devoting \nnew resources to the education and training of American students and \nworkers, represents the way forward for the United States as we seek to \nsustain our leadership in the Information Age. I commend its swift \npassage to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I stand in support of the American \nCompetitiveness in the Twenty-First Century Act (S. 2045) which I have \nco-sponsored with Senators Orrin Hatch and Spencer Abraham. This \nlegislation would increase the number of H-1B visas for skilled labor \navailable to U.S. employers from 115,000 to 195,000 slots, starting \nnext fiscal year, among other measures.\n  This is direly needed legislation. Alarmingly, this year's allotment \nof H-1B visas ran out very early this year, in March. As a result, \nhundreds of thousands of highly skilled positions have gone unfilled \nthroughout America.\n  America is currently riding a very high wave of record economic \ngrowth, unmatched in our generation. With that expansion, the number of \navailable jobs which have gone unfilled has increased dramatically. \nUnfortunately, we have begun to place a cap on this extraordinary \neconomic expansion by limiting the pool of skilled laborers that \ncompanies can draw upon by the present limited visa allotment.\n  The hardest hit sector is the computer industry. This industry \nfunctions in six months cycles, with new products being developed and \nmarketed within this short period of time. The computer industry \nsuffers a severe lack of qualified information technicians. Less \nworkers means a longer development period which means a loss of \ncompetitive edge. This ultimately results in a loss of market, business \nand jobs. In this scenario, everyone loses, including the economy, \nAmerican consumers, companies and workers.\n  To avoid this wasteful and unnecessary result, we must adopt this \nlegislation and expand the visa slots so that American companies can \ncontinue to grow. This is an urgent problem which cannot wait until \nnext year. If we fail to pass this legislation, we could significantly \njeopardize our notable competitive edge in a fierce global market.\n\n[[Page S9647]]\n\n  Some falsely charge that this legislation gives away our most \nlucrative jobs, while skipping over American workers. This is not true. \nClearly, American employers would rather select American workers first \nover foreign guest workers who must be processed through a burdensome \nimmigration bureaucracy involving significant time delays and \ncomplications. This visa process is costly and cumbersome for \nemployers, and can easily be avoided by hiring American workers. \nHowever, American businesses cannot fill these positions with only \nAmerican workers anymore and are forced to search overseas for badly \nneeded talent. Our economy has expanded that significantly and these \nworkers are needed that badly.\n\n  If we do not allow American-based businesses to meet this skilled \nlabor need, some may move their operations to other countries which \nwill gladly accommodate them. Why would we encourage this unfortunate \nresult when we can attain just the opposite, that of attracting new and \nvibrant businesses, by expanding our labor pool?\n  In addition to the new visa allotments, this legislation creates \n20,000 new college scholarships to train American workers in greater \nnumbers. This encourages more degrees among Americans in math, computer \nscience, and engineering--all areas of expertise presently suffering a \nshortage. Thus, this bill addresses both present and future worker \nneeds.\n  On October 1st the new fiscal year began, and the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service estimates that we will use up the entire \nallotment of H-1B visas before the end of this December. In other \nwords, the H-1B visa allotment will be used up in three months. That \nleaves the balance of nine months of no additional visas for desperate \nAmerican computer companies, among other businesses, which will suffer \nthis serious lack of workers.\n  That's bad business and bad politics, which can be corrected with \nthis bill. Americans continue to dream bigger and create greater \ninnovations, generating an unmatched prosperity which we should \nencourage, not discourage. That's why we should support the American \nCompetitiveness in the Twenty-First Century Act of 2000.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today the Senate will complete action on \none of the most important bills in the 106th Congress, S. 2045, the \nAmerican Competitiveness in the 21st Century Act, legislation that will \nhelp ensure our nation's continued growth and leadership in information \ntechnology (IT). S. 2045 will authorize visas for 195,000 high-tech \nprofessionals to work in the U.S. to meet the growing demand for \nskilled IT workers throughout our economy. The legislation also \nauthorizes long term initiatives to ensure that Americans of all ages \nare trained to fill critical IT positions in our Information Age \neconomy. I am pleased to strongly support this legislation.\n  Senate action to increase the ceiling on H1B visas for the next three \nyears, however, is also a warning that we are not providing sufficient \nincentives or education opportunities to encourage our young people, as \nwell as individuals of all ages, to consider careers or retraining in \ninformation technology. In 1998, Congress passed legislation to \nincrease the number of H1B visas for skilled workers to enter the U.S. \nAt that time, the Department of Commerce reported a shortage of 600,000 \nskilled IT workers in the U.S. Since 1998, the demand for skilled \nworkers has increased dramatically.\n  Earlier this year, the Information Technology Association released \nits most recent report, ``Bridging the Gap'', on the demand for skilled \nIT workers in the U.S. That report estimated a shortage of more than \n843,000 skilled workers. Moreover, the Department of Labor projected \nthat the U.S. economy will require more than 130,000 new IT workers \nevery year for the next ten years. Clearly, with our rapidly expanding \neconomy, and the critical need to maintain our leadership in \ninformation technology, we face an extraordinary challenge from this \nshortage of skilled high-tech workers. As economies throughout the \nworld recover, particularly in Asia, we cannot continue to assume that \nwe will meet our demand for high-tech workers by increasing the cap on \nHIB visa every few years.\n  Throughout this debate on the IT worker shortage since 1998, I have \nrecommended incentives to encourage IT worker training and partnerships \nbetween businesses and the education community. Earlier in the 106th \nCongress, I introduced legislation, S. 456, to authorize a tax credit \nof up to $6,000 for employers who provide IT worker training. \nUnfortunately, the Senate has not yet adopted this legislation. I am, \nhowever, very pleased that Vice President Gore has recognized the \nimportance of this IT worker training incentive and included this \nproposal as a priority on his information technology agenda.\n  More recently, I also introduced S. 2347, the Information Technology \nAct of 2000, to encourage IT training partnerships between universities \nor colleges and the information technology community through a program \nof matching Federal grants. I urged that these partnerships focus on \ntraining for Americans that have traditionally not participated in the \ngrowth in information technology--women, veterans, Native Americans, \ndislocated workers, seniors, and students who have not completed their \nhigh school diploma. I am especially pleased to have had such strong \nendorsements for this proposal from groups including the Disabled \nVeterans of America, National Education Association, American \nAssociation of University Women, Green Thumb and the Computing \nTechnology Industry Association.\n  Mr. President, while I regret that we have not been able to authorize \ntax incentives for businesses who provide IT training for workers, I am \nvery pleased that S. 2045 authorizes funding for high-tech \npartnerships, as I proposed in S. 2347, through the Department of \nLabor. Funding for the training would come from the fees collected \nunder the H-1B visa program. S. 2045 also expands K-12 training for \neducators in IT through the National Science Foundation, including the \nprofessional development of math and science teachers in the use of \ntechnology in the classroom. Expanding opportunities for IT training \nfor educators was another important objective in S. 2347. S. 2045 also \nhelps our educational and research communities by exempting them from \nthe cap on recruiting skilled academic professionals.\n  Finally, I would like to express particular appreciation to the \nmanagers of the bill for accepting my amendment regarding J-1 visa \nwaivers. My amendment will improve underserved communities' access to \nphysician services by ensuring the Conrad State 20 J-1 visa waivers do \nnot count against the H-1B visa cap.\n  Mr. President, the shortage of skilled high-tech workers will \ncontinue to be a major issue during the 107th Congress, and I believe \nit will be necessary for us to provide additional training incentives \nin the coming years to meet the growing domestic demand for IT workers. \nAs I noted earlier, as economies throughout the world continue to \nexpand, and countries including Singapore, China, and Malaysia develop \ntheir own high tech corridors, it will be difficult to recruit high-\ntech workers from these Asian countries to fill positions in the U.S.\n  In my view, rather than continue our dependence on H1B visa holders \nto meet our skilled worker demand, we must expand our efforts to \nencourage young people to consider careers in information technology \nand to train current workers to enter the IT field. This will continue \nto be a top priority for me during the 107th Congress, and I look \nforward to working with my colleagues and the information technology \ncommunity on this critical issue. I commend my colleagues on the Senate \nJudiciary Committee for reporting a measure that provides important \nincentives for IT training as well as expanded education and training \nopportunities for teachers through the National Science Foundation.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on this side of \nthe aisle?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Vermont has 10 \nminutes. The Senator from Utah has 1 minute 2 seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am very pleased the Senate is poised to \npass legislation to increase the number of H-1B visas. The bill that we \nwill pass today is the result of long negotiations. It is significantly \nimproved from\n\n[[Page S9648]]\n\nthe version reported from the Judiciary Committee earlier this year.\n  This is an important step that will allow American employers to \ncompensate for the current shortage in highly skilled employees by \nhiring such employees from abroad.\n  Thanks to the efforts of Senators Kennedy, Lieberman, Feinstein, and \nothers, this bill also includes strong education and worker training \ncomponents. That is going to help American workers and students to \nerase the skills shortage.\n  No one on this side of the aisle sees H-1B visas as a permanent \nsolution. It is a stopgap until our renewed commitment to education and \ntraining pays dividends. I would like to thank all of those in the \ncorporate world who have supported our efforts on education and \ntraining.\n  Although I am happy about the passage of this bill, I am somewhat \ndisappointed in the severe way in which debate on this bill was \nrestricted.\n  I had hoped that our consideration of this bill would allow us to \nachieve other crucially important immigration goals that have been \nneglected by the majority throughout this Congress.\n  I had hoped that the Republican majority could agree to at least vote \non, if not vote for, limited proposals designed to protect Latino \nfamilies and other immigrant families.\n  I had hoped that the majority would consider proposals to restore the \ndue process that was taken away from immigrants by the immigration \nlegislation that Congress passed in 1996.\n  I thought we could work together to restore some of America's lost \nluster on immigration issues. That did not happen.\n  Still, we did have a vote on the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act \nthat showed where the Senate stood on issues of extreme importance to \nthe Hispanic community, Eastern Europeans, and the Liberians. On that \nvote, regrettably, every Republican voted no. They refused to even \nconsider the amendment. We should have had a vote. Senators should have \nthe political courage to either vote for it, or vote against it.\n  I hope my Republican colleagues have the chance to reevaluate their \nposition. The President has said he wants Congress to address these \nissues before we adjourn. Many Democratic Members of Congress and I \njoin him in that view, and we will continue to work to see that this \nCongress addresses the real needs of real people, whether they be \nnative-born or immigrant.\n  Both my mother and my wife are first-generation Americans. I think if \nCongress had taken some of the attitudes toward immigration that some \ntake today when their families were seeking to enter the United States, \nneither might be in this country.\n  I agree that we need to increase the number of H-1B visas. The \nstunning economic growth we have experienced in the past eight years \nhas led to worker shortages in certain key areas of our economy, and I \nhave been involved in promoting efforts to ease those shortages. Last \nyear, I cosponsored the HITEC Act, S. 1645, legislation that Senator \nRobb has introduced that would create a new visa that would be \navailable to companies looking to hire recent foreign graduates of U.S. \nmaster's and doctoral programs in math, science, engineering, or \ncomputer science.\n  Although S. 2045 uses a broader approach, the goals are similar. \nAllowing workers with specialized skills to come to the U.S. and work \nfor 6-year periods, as the H-1B visa does, helps to alleviate worker \nshortage. In the recently ended fiscal year, 115,000 such visas were \navailable, and they ran out well before the fiscal year ended. That is \nwhy we have to change the law now.\n  If we do not change the law, there will actually be fewer visas \navailable in fiscal year 2001, as the cap drops to 107,500. This will \nsimply be insufficient to allow America's employers--particularly in \nthe information technology industry--to maintain their current rates of \ngrowth. As such, I think that we need to increase the number of \navailable visas dramatically. The bill we will vote on today \naccomplishes that goal, increasing the number of visas to 195,000 for \nFY 2001. It also contains a provision that will allow educational \ninstitutions to use H-1B visas without counting against the cap, which \nwill greatly help our colleges and universities, which are often on a \ndifferent hiring schedule than our nation's other employers and have \nbeen shut out in the past from obtaining needed visas.\n  Of course, H-1B visas are not a long-term answer to the current \nmismatch between the demands of the high-tech industry and the supply \nof workers with technical skills. Although I believe that there is a \nlabor shortage in certain areas of our economy, I do not believe that \nwe should accept that circumstance as an unchangeable fact of life. We \nneed to make a greater effort to give our children the education they \nneed to compete in an increasingly technology-oriented economy, and \noffer adults the training they need to refashion their careers to suit \nthe changes in our economy. This bill takes significant steps to \nimprove our education and training programs. Since employers pay a $500 \nfee for a visa, increasing the number of visas will lead to an increase \nin revenue generated for worker training programs, scholarships for \ndisadvantaged students, and funding for public-private partnerships to \nimprove science and technology education.\n  I also want to note that the legislation extends current law's \nattestation requirements. These requirements force employers to certify \nthat they were unable to find qualified Americans to do a job that they \nhave hired a visa recipient to fill. The Labor Department also retains \nauthority under S. 2045 to investigate possible H-1B violations.\n  I continue to believe that we could have passed this legislation many \nmonths ago. The Judiciary Committee reported S. 2045 more than six \nmonths ago, with my support. During this long stretch of inactivity, it \nhas often appeared that the Republican majority has been more \ninterested in gaining partisan advantage from a delay than in actually \nmaking this bill law. The Democratic Leader said repeatedly that he \nwanted to pass a bill, and that although Democratic members did want \nthe opportunity to offer amendments, he was ready to agree to limit \ndebate on those amendments so that we could conclude all work on this \nbill in a single day. Those offers were rebuffed again and again by the \nmajority.\n\n  Months went by in which the Republican majority made no attempt to \nnegotiate with us, time which many members of the majority instead \nspent trying to blame Democrats for the delay in their bringing this \nlegislation to the floor. At many times, it seemed that the majority \nwas more interested in casting blame upon Democrats than in actually \npassing legislation. Instead of working in good faith with the minority \nto bring this bill to the floor, the majority spent its time trying to \nconvince leaders in the information technology industry that the \nDemocratic Party was hostile to this bill, which was always false. \nConsidering that three-quarters of the Democrats on the Judiciary \nCommittee voted for this bill, and that the bill has numerous \nDemocratic cosponsors, including Senator Lieberman, this partisan \nappeal was not only inappropriate but absurd on its face.\n  I do regret that we have not made more progress on the longstanding \nproposals that have been combined now under the Latino and Immigrant \nFairness Act. These provisions had been proposed throughout this \nCongress, and in some cases in previous Congresses. They are solid, \npro-family proposals that would reward immigrants who are working and \npaying taxes in the United States. But the Republican majority--as has \nbeen shown repeatedly on the Senate floor over the past week--refused \neven to consider these proposals, instead branding them as rewards for \nillegal immigrants.\n  Thankfully, the President has taken action to provide temporary \nprotection for the Liberians who faced imminent return to their \nconflicted nation, and who would have been protected by the LIFA \nlegislation. It is shameful that the Congress has not taken action on \nthe Liberians' behalf, despite the dogged and dedicated efforts of \nSenator Jack Reed.\n  I am worried about the things we have not done on immigration issues \nin this Congress. It is a disturbing but increasingly undeniable fact \nthat the interest of the business community has become a prerequisite \nfor immigration\n\n[[Page S9649]]\n\nbills to receive attention on the Senate floor. In fact, we are in the \nfinal days of the Congress, and this is the first immigration bill to \nbe debated on the floor. Even humanitarian bills with bipartisan \nbacking have been ignored in this Congress, both in the Judiciary \nCommittee and on the floor of the Senate.\n  The majority has shown a similar lack of concern for proposals by \nSenators to restore the due process protections were removed by the \npassage of the Antiterrorism Death Penalty Act and the Illegal \nImmigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act 4 years ago.\n  There are still many aspects of those laws that merit our careful \nreview and rethinking, including the inhumane use of expedited removal, \nwhich would be sharply reformed by S. 1940, the Refugee Protection Act, \nwhich I have introduced with Senator Brownback and our 10 cosponsors.\n\n  But the Refugee Protection Act has not even received a hearing in the \nJudiciary Committee, despite my requests as ranking member. This is \nquite unusual, because every committee I have served upon has honored \nsuch requests on the part of the ranking member. When I was chairman, \nany request made by a ranking member was honored. Indeed, I have never \nseen anything like this, especially on a bill that has such bipartisan \nsupport.\n  The bill addresses the issue of expedited removal, a process under \nwhich aliens arriving in the United States can be returned immediately \nto their native land at the say-so of low-level INS officers. Expedited \nremoval was the subject of a major debate in this Chamber in 1996. The \nSenate voted to use it only during immigration emergencies. The Senate-\npassed restriction was removed at probably the most partisan conference \ncommittee I have ever witnessed. The Refugee Protection Act is modeled \nclosely on the 1996 amendment. I hope someday we can pass it. We \nshould.\n  As a result of the adoption of expedited removal, we now have a \nsystem of removing people arriving here either without proper \ndocumentation or with valid documents that INS officers suspect are \ninvalid. This policy ignores the fact that somebody who is fleeing a \ndespotic regime is quite often unable to go in and get a passport from \nthe same regime they are trying to flee, either because of religious \npersecution or some other type of persecution. The only way to get out \nof there is with a forged passport.\n  In the limited time that expedited removal has been in operation, we \nalready have numerous stories of valid asylum seekers who were kicked \nout of country without the opportunity to convince an immigration judge \nthat they faced persecution in their native lands. To provide just one \nexample, a Kosovo Albanian was summarily removed from the United States \nafter the civil war in Kosovo had already made the front pages of \nAmerica's newspapers. Imagine what happens to such people when they are \nforced to return to their native lands.\n  I also urge the Senate to take up S. 3120, the Immigrant Fairness \nRestoration Act, which was introduced by Senators Kennedy and Bob \nGraham. This bill would go a long way toward undoing the damage done to \ndue process by the 1996 immigration laws, and the House has already \npassed related, bipartisan legislation. Among other things, S. 3120 \nwould eliminate the retroactive features of those laws, which have led \nto the deportation of legal permanent residents who committed \nrelatively minor crimes decades ago. I have sponsored legislation that \nwould at the very least provide due process to those who have served in \nour Armed Forces, the Fairness for Immigrant Veterans Act, S. 871. This \nlegislation has been endorsed by the American Legion, the Vietnam \nVeterans of America, and other veterans' groups. The Republican \nmajority has refused to consider even this narrow reform.\n  As important as H-1B visas are for our economy and our nation's \nemployers, this is not the only immigration issue that faces our \nnation. Although the legislation we are concerned with today is good \nlegislation, it does not test our commitment to the ideals of \nopportunity and freedom that America has represented at its best. Those \ntests will apparently be left for another day, or another Congress.\n\n  In closing, I commend our leaders in this matter: Senator Daschle, \nSenator Harry Reid, Senator Kennedy, and their able staffs. In \nparticular, I would like to thank Andrea LaRue with Senator Daschle, \nEddie Ayoob with Senator Reid, Esther Olavarria and Melody Barnes with \nSenator Kennedy and the Democratic staff of the Immigration \nSubcommittee, and Tim Lynch with my Judiciary Committee staff. I have \nnot heard thanks from the other side. I thank Senator Abraham and his \nstaff for cooperation in improving the bill and Senator Hatch for \nallowing the matter finally to proceed to conclusion. I also thank Lee \nOtis and Stuart Anderson with Senator Abraham and Sharon Prost with \nSenator Hatch for their hard work on this legislation.\n\n\n                   Visa Waiver Permanent Program Act\n\n  In addition to passing S. 2045, the Senate has also agreed to pass \nH.R. 3767, legislation to make the visa waiver pilot program permanent. \nWe pass this legislation only because Senator Daschle worked with \nSenator Kennedy and me to make sure that the majority agreed to release \nits hold on the bill as part of our broader agreement on H-1B \nlegislation. I hope that Senator Daschle's commitment to this bill is \nappreciated by the thousands of American travelers who benefit from it.\n  This legislation will achieve the important goal of making our visa \nwaiver program permanent. We have had a visa waiver pilot project for \nmore than a decade, and it has been a tremendous success in allowing \nAmerican citizens to travel to some of our most important allies for up \nto 90 days without obtaining a visa, and in allowing citizens of those \ncountries to travel here under the same terms. Countries must meet a \nnumber of requirements to participate in the program, including having \nvery low rates of visa refusals. Of course, the visa waiver does not \naffect the need for international travelers to carry valid passports.\n  Despite having expressed no substantive objection to this bill, the \nmajority refused to allow this legislation to go forward for months. I \nnote for the record that every single Democratic Senator said they \nwould vote for this bill. Those from the business community and \nelsewhere who asked about the bill were assured by Senator Daschle, \nSenator Reid and I that every single Democratic Senator supported this.\n  Even though the travel industry and the State Department urged \nRepublicans to allow this legislation to pass, and even though the visa \nwaiver pilot program had expired April 30, the majority refused to let \nthis bill go forward. They apparently held the bill to use as leverage \nto promote unrelated legislation, just a chit to be used whenever it \nseemed to fix a whim. I am glad they finally have reversed course.\n  The House passed legislation months ago to make this program \npermanent, heeding the calls of American tourists and business people \nwho are able to travel to almost 30 other nations with only a passport \nbecause of the program. By playing political games, the Senate \njeopardized our relationships with the other nations who take part in \nthe program. Thankfully, we have finally moved beyond these games and \nare set to send this legislation back to the House for final approval.\n\n  I would like briefly to note the inclusion of an amendment in the \nvisa waiver bill that is of major importance to my State of Vermont and \nmany other States. This provision extends the EB-5 immigrant investor \npilot program, which allows foreign investors to obtain resident status \nin return for substantial investments in regions that are not sharing \nin the general American prosperity. In my State, this program is \nstarting to bear fruit--I am happy that we are extending it for an \nadditional three years so that we can ensure that its potential is \nrealized.\n  In conclusion, I would like to thank Senator Kennedy for all of his \nwork on immigration issues, from H-1B to visa waiver to the countless \nproposals he has initiated and supported to help immigrant families. He \nhas consistently worked across the aisle with Senators Hatch and \nAbraham to achieve the best possible solutions to our immigration \nproblems. Immigrants in America should understand they have a devoted \nally in the senior Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy. And I thank \nour Democratic Leader Tom Daschle\n\n[[Page S9650]]\n\nfor his commitment to getting this matter concluded without additional \nunnecessary delay. They and their staffs, along with the staff of our \nRepublican counterparts, were instrumental in moving this matter to \npassage.\n  I thank all on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. This is a very important bill. This is a bill that both \nsides have said they wanted for a long time. I have to say it is \npitiful that we had to go through three cloture votes because it was \nfilibustered three times. Even the motion to proceed was filibustered \nby colleagues on the other side. They have tried to make this into a \npolitical brouhaha which it doesn't deserve. Further, when they also \nbrought up a bill that they did not even file until July 25 of this \nyear, the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act, which is anything but \nfair. They brought that up and asked, without hearings, without 1 \nminute of consultation, that we have a rolling amnesty for up to 2 \nmillion illegal aliens--perhaps even more than that; certainly they \nadmit to at least 500,000. It shows the length to which politics can go \nin this body.\n  I am glad we are at this point. It took continual effort by our \nleader to push this bill through. There were many times when we thought \nwe might have to pull it down because of the opposition from the other \nside.\n  But today, I look forward to an overwhelming vote this morning on \nthis important, bipartisan bill and hope that by week's end, the House \nof Representatives will have acted favorably and with dispatch as well.\n  One of our greatest priorities, Mr. President, is and ought to be \nkeeping our economy vibrant, and expanding educational opportunities \nfor America's children and its workers. That is my priority for this \ncountry and for my own State of Utah.\n  I am proud of the growth and development in my own State that has \nmade Utah one of the leaders of the country and the world in our high \ntech economy.\n  In Utah and elsewhere, however, our continued economic growth, and \nour competitive edge in the world economy requires an adequate supply \nof highly skilled high tech workers. This remains one of our great \nchallenges in the 21st century, requiring both short and long term \nsolutions. The legislation we will pass today, S. 2405, addresses both \nof these challenges.\n  Specifically, a tight labor market, increasing globalization, and a \nburgeoning economy have combined to increase demand for skilled workers \nwell beyond what was forecast when Congress last addressed the issue of \ntemporary visas for highly skilled workers in 1998. Therefore, this \nlegislation once again increases the annual cap for this year and the \nnext three years.\n  But increasing the number of H-1B visas is nothing more than a short \nterm solution to the workforce needs in my State and the country. The \nlong term solution lies with our own children and our own workers. Our \ncontinued success in this global economy depends on our ability to \nensure that education and training for our current and future workforce \nmatches the demands in our high tech 21st century global economy. \nWorking with my colleagues, I have included in this bill strong, \neffective, and forward looking provisions directing the several hundred \nmillion dollars in fees expected to be generated by the visas toward \nthe education and retraining of our children and our workforce. Those \nprovisions are included in the substitute which is before us today.\n  Mr. President there are many to whom I want to express my gratitude \nthis morning. This legislation had, from the beginning, an effective \ngroup of Senators at the forefront. That included Senator Abraham, a \nleader on this issue for many years, as well as Senator Gramm from \nTexas. On the other side of the aisle, we were joined early on by \nSenators Graham, Feinstein, and Lieberman, and all have continued their \ncommitment to the continued improvement of our bill. And finally, Mr. \nPresident, I want to thank Senator kennedy for his hard work and his \ntireless dedication to ensuring effective training provisions in this \nbill for American workers. I would be remiss were I not to also mention \nSenator Pat Leahy--the committee's ranking member. He approached this \nbill in the spirit of bipartisanship and facilitated its consideration \nboth here on the floor and in committee.\n  Mr. President. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the \nother body in the coming days to see that this bill becomes law.\n  I hope we can get this done for American workers and children and for \nour continued economic expansion.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to thank all of the dedicated staffers \nhere in the Senate whose talent and hard work have helped get this bill \npassed. First, I'd like to thank my own committee staff, including \nChief Counsel and Staff Director Manus Cooney, Deputy Chief Counsel \nSharon Prost, and Press Secretary Jeanne Lopatto. The conventional \nwisdom in Washington a few months ago was that this bill was not going \nto pass. But they kept fighting for its passage. I want to particularly \ncommend Sharon Prost for her tireless efforts.\n  I also want to thank Lee Otis and Stuart Anderson, of the \nSubcommittee on Immigration for their invaluable technical and legal \nassistance and Esther Olivarria of Senator Kennedy's staff. My thanks \nalso go to Michael Simmons, of Senator Gramm's staff, Caroline Berver, \nwith Senator Graham, James Thurston, with Senator Lieberman, and Lavita \nStrickland with Senator Feinstein. I would also like to thank Jim Hecht \nof Senator Lott's staff for his efforts. Finally, I want to thank Bruce \nCohen and Tim Lynch of Senator Leahy's committee staff.\n  Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I note that each of the component parts of \nthe Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act were filed long before July 25. \nDemocratic Senators repeatedly asked for hearings on this proposal, and \nthose requests were repeatedly denied.\n  It is not fair to say that this legislation is neither ``Latino'' nor \n``fair.'' If anybody wants to know whether it is something that the \nLatino community wants and whether the Latino community thinks it is \nfair, just ask them. They will tell you the Latino fairness bill is \nsupported by the Latino community and it is a fair bill.\n  I do thank my chairman, my close friend, that we are getting this \nthrough.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, let me just take a minute to respond to \nsome of the comments of my colleague, Senator Leahy. The so-called \nLatino Fairness Act has little to do with fairness for immigrants. This \nis no limited measure to undo a previous wrong to a limited class of \nimmigrants who otherwise might have been eligible for amnesty under the \n1986 act. In fact, it is a major new amnesty program with a price tag \nof almost $1.4 billion. That has major implications for our national \npolicy on immigration.\n\n  The bill purports to be about ``immigrant fairness,'' but it does \nnothing to increase or preserve the categories of legal immigrants \nallowed in this country annually. It does nothing to shorten the long \nwaiting period or remove the hurdles for persons who have waited years \nto legally enter this country. This so-called Latino fairness is no \nfairness at all to the millions of immigrants who have and will \ncontinue to play by the rules.\n  Moreover, the bill does not even fix a date for the registry. Rather \nit allows a rolling amnesty. What kind of signal does this send? Our \ngovernment spends millions each year to combat illegal immigrant and \ndeports thousands of persons each year. With the rolling amnesty, \nhowever, if an illegal alien can manage to escape law enforcement for \nlong enough we reward that person with citizenship, or at least \npermanent resident status.\n  Finally, it should be noted that all of these dramatic changes were \nproposed in July of this year with no hearings and with no assessment \nof competing costs and benefits. The Senate appropriately refused to \nconsider this bill because its many consequences were not addressed by \nits proponents.\n  We are proud of the fine bipartisan work that went into the H-1B visa \nbill and welcome its passage.\n\n[[Page S9651]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo).

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate all those who have \nworked so hard for so long on the H-1B bill. Senators Leahy, Hatch, \nKennedy, Abraham, Feinstein, Lieberman and Biden have all done an \nadmirable job at putting together a good bipartisan bill that will \nstrengthen our economy and increase the resources that go to technology \neducation and training.\n  I would also like to thank the Majority Leader for his efforts. While \nwe have disagreements about how the process, here in the Senate, should \nwork, on this bill, we have shared a commitment that the Senate must \nact to ensure the stability of the H-1B program in the years to come.\n  Mr. President, as you know, this legislation responds to the pressing \nneed many American companies are facing for highly-skilled workers. The \nbill increases the annual ceiling for the admission of H-1B non-\nimmigrants to 195,000 for fiscal years 2001, 2002 and 2003. It also \nincludes an important provision to exempt H-1B visa applicants employed \nby higher education institutions and other non-profits from the yearly \nnumerical limits.\n  This visa increase could not come at a more important time. With \nunemployment rates currently at or near historic lows, the H-1B program \nhas become an increasingly important source of skilled labor for U.S. \nemployers. U.S. employers are expected to need roughly 1.6 million \ninformation technology workers in the next year. Unfortunately, the \ndemand far exceeds the supply of qualified individuals. This shortage \nnot only threatens the competitiveness of U.S. high technology \ncompanies but it also threatens our economy, which owes much of its \nsuccess to the technology sector.\n  These labor shortfalls are not just felt in Silicon Valley, Northern \nVirginia and other high tech clusters--they are felt nationwide. In \nfact, 35 percent of the unfilled jobs in the information technology \nsector are in the Midwest. In a study done by the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics, the state of South Dakota had the greatest high-technology \nemployment growth in the early 1990's--a whopping 172 percent increase. \nAnd South Dakota companies, like those in other states, are struggling \nto find the workers they need to continue to grow.\n  That said, the H-1B visa program is only a short-term solution to the \nskills shortage being experienced by American companies. Accordingly, I \nam proud of the work that was done, largely at the behest of Democratic \nSenators, to ensure that this bill begins to address our long-term \nchallenge--ensuring that in the future there are enough Americans with \nthe necessary skills to fill these jobs. Indeed, as Senator Mikulski \nreminded us during this debate, America is facing a skills shortage, \nrather than a worker shortage. It is our job to reverse that trend.\n  This bill is a step in the right direction. It dedicates over half of \nthe H-1B fees collected to the worker training primarily in the fields \nof high technology, information technology and biotechnology skills. By \nincreasing the H-1B visa fee modestly, this bill will triple the money \ngoing to these important training programs enabling 45,000 workers a \nyear to take advantage of these new training opportunities. In \naddition, the bill also triples the money dedicated to providing \nmeaningful educational scholarships for students, particularly minority \nstudents, who are enrolled in a mathematics, engineering or computer \nscience degree program and for improving science, mathematics and \ntechnology education in the K-12 system.\n  There are millions of Americans who yearn for the opportunity to \nparticipate in our new economy and all its rewards. And they need only \none thing to do just that--skills training and education.\n  It is our duty to help these Americans realize their dreams. This \nbill is an important down-payment in that effort. Thus, I look forward \nto this bill becoming law in the near future. Both U.S. workers and \nU.S. companies stand to benefit.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record)\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, as a cosponsor of S. 2045, \n``American Competitiveness in the Twenty-first Century Act of 2000,'' I \nam pleased to see this important legislation pass the Senate today.\n  One of my most sobering experiences as a U.S. Senator occurred a few \nyears ago when several CEOs of California's leading high-tech companies \ntold me our schools were not producing enough skilled graduates and \nasked me to support an increase in the number of H-1B temporary visas \nfor skilled foreign workers.\n  Initially, I did not believe this. But subsequently the problem \nbecame very clear at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the \nsubject. California's high-tech sector has fueled our record economic \nexpansion, providing more than 784,000 high-tech jobs in our state \nalone. But that continued growth is threatened if California cannot \nproduce an adequate number of well-educated workers. Clearly our \neducation system needs major reform.\n  I asked TechNet, a network of the nation's leading high-tech CEOs, to \nhelp me develop a program to reduce our reliance on H-1B workers. The \ndiscussions led to a public-private plan, which Senator Spencer \nAbraham, R-Mich., and I offered as an amendment to the H-1B visa bill. \nIt was approved by the Judiciary Committee in March.\n  From the funds collected for H-1B fees over the next three years, the \namendment would allocate 15 percent of the H-1B fees, or roughly $23 \nmillion for National Science Foundation kindergarten through 12th grade \nmath and science education and skills-development programs. The \ntechnology industry will match these funds and then some. This is an \nincredible commitment by the industry to help develop a pipeline of \nAmerican students who are better prepared for the workplace of \ntomorrow.\n  Additionally, $35 million will be designated for post-secondary \nschool scholarships for 16,000 to 18,000 low-income students to obtain \ndegrees in\n\n[[Page S9656]]\n\nscience, math or other technology-related disciplines so that they can \ncompete for the cutting-edge jobs in the high-tech sector. At the same \ntime, our amendment provides 23.5 percent, or more than $35 million per \nyear in funding--in addition to that already being provided--for \nscholarships so that American students and workers can also enjoy the \nopportunity to work in the high tech and other industries demanding a \nhighly skilled workforce.\n  Another $83 million, or 55 percent of the H-1B fee revenue, as a \nresult of an amendment by Senator Kennedy, would be allocated to \nworkforce training programs and demonstration projects to provide \ntechnical skills training for U.S. workers. I am hopeful that, in the \nend, we can work in a provision to increase the H-1B visa fee from $500 \nto $1,000. This will double the amount of funding for these important \neducation and training programs.\n  I support lifting the H-1B visa cap, but clearly it is only a short-\nterm solution to a long-term problem. The technology industry \nrecognizes this and has already made significant financial \ncontributions to education training programs. These amendments \nrepresent an additional industry commitment to educating America's \nworkforce.\n  Recent research indicates that the number of bachelor of science \ndegrees awarded in computer science and math fell 29 percent from 1985 \nto 1995. Engineering degrees fell 16 percent from 1985 to 1997; \ncomputer and information sciences experience a 42 percent drop. Yet it \nis expertise in these very areas that businesses, especially high-\ntechnology companies, need in order to stay globally competitive.\n  Our society is undergoing a dramatic technological transformation. \nInformation technology has changed every aspect of our society, from \ntelephone and banking services to commerce and education. Given this, \nthe demand for highly skilled professionals has exploded. Even \nexcluding the biotechnology industry, the high-tech explosion has \ncreated over 4.8 million jobs in the United States since 1993 and \nproduced an industry unemployment rate of 1.4 percent.\n  Despite the billions of dollars that companies spend annually on \ntraining, a gap still exists between professionals available in the \nU.S. workforce and the needs of employers. We need to raise the H-1B \ncap for the next few years because often employers' needs are \nimmediate; they cannot afford to wait for workforce training or \nretraining while positions remain unfilled. I look forward to the day \nwhen it is not necessary to bring in workers from abroad for these \npositions because California's schools are producing students who can \nmatch the best and brightest from anywhere across the globe.\n  I am also pleased that the Senate has adopted as an amendment to the \nH-1B legislation, the provisions of S. 2586, the ``Immigration Services \nand Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2000,'' which I introduced \nearlier this year. As we seek to address the needs of the high tech \nindustry by increasing the number of H-1B visas, I am pleased that we \nare also taking an active role in addressing the unacceptably long \nbacklogs in processing other immigration applications.\n  We have all heard the horror stories of the long processing delays \nassociated with the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). What \nwas once a 6-month process has now become a three- to four-year ordeal. \nWhen I first introduced S. 2586, the INS had roughly 2.3 million cases \npending. Out of this number, California had 600,000 naturalization and \nadjustment of status cases pending.\n  While the INS has made some improvements in reducing processing times \nfor some applications, the INS's overall record keeping and computer \nsystems still suffer from serious flaws. Many forms filed during the \napplication process have been lost, automatically disqualifying \nimmigrants from an immigrant visa or naturalization because they missed \ntheir INS appointments.\n  It is unacceptable that millions of people who have followed our \nnation's laws, made outstanding contributions to our nation, and paid \nthe requisite fees have had to wait months, and even years, to obtain \nthe immigration services they need. These processing delays have had a \nnegative impact on businesses seeking to employ or retain essential \nworkers.\n  Faced with a shortage of highly skilled workers in the U.S., many of \nour nation's businesses, including those in the high tech industry, \nmust increasing rely on the INS to help provide them with access to \nhighly skilled foreign professionals. However, long delays and \ninconsistencies in INS processing are causing many companies to \npostpone or cancel major projects that support their fiscal growth.\n  I believe the backlog reduction provisions included in this bill will \nsend a clear signal to the INS that it is time to change the way they \ndo business. The provisions would require the INS to process H-1B \napplications and other non-immigrant visa applications within 30 days, \nand naturalization applications, permanent employment visas, and other \nimmigration visa applications within six months. In addition, the \nprovisions would establish a separate account with the INS to fund \nbacklog reduction efforts.\n  This account would permit the INS to fund across several fiscal years \ninfrastructure improvements, including additional staff, computer \nrecords management, fingerprinting, and nationwide computer \nintegration. Finally, the provisions would require the INS to put \ntogether a plan on how it intends to eliminate existing backlogs and \nreport on this plan before it could obtain any appropriated funds.\n  The backlog reduction provisions are intended to provide the INS with \ndirection and accountability, and would enable millions of law-abiding \nresidents, immigrants, and businesses, who have paid substantial fees \nto the INS, to have their applications processed in a timely manner. I \nbelieve enactment of these provisions as part of the H-1B legislation \nwill send a strong Congressional directive to the INS that timely and \nefficient service is not merely a goal, but a mandate.\n  Our nation has undergone a dramatic technological transformation. The \nU.S. economy has enjoyed unprecedented expansion, in large part because \nof the high tech industry. In California alone, this growth in \ntechnology has made our State number one in high tech employment by \ncreating almost 800,000 jobs and comprising 61 percent of California's \nexports. I am convinced that the economy of California as well as the \nrest of the nation could run out of steam if the driving engine--that \nis, the high tech industry--does not have the resources it needs to \ncontinue its unprecedented growth.\n  Certainly, it is in our interest to ensure that these industries, \nwhich are located in the U.S. and help drive our economy, can continue \nto obtain qualified, highly skilled employees. This bill meets the \nneeds of the industry by providing additional temporary visas for \nexceptional professional personnel. Despite the billions of dollars \nthat companies spend annually to train their work force, a gap still \nexists between professionals available in the U.S. work force and the \nneeds of employers. Often employers' needs are immediate; they cannot \nafford to wait for work force training or retraining while positions \nremain unfilled.\n  I look forward to the day when it is not necessary to bring in \nworkers from abroad for these positions because California's schools \nare producing students who can match the best and brightest from \nanywhere across the globe.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Senate has now approved an increase in \nthe total number of H-1B nonimmigrant visas made available to skilled \nforeign workers.\n  I supported that increase because I believe it will help meet this \ncountry's growing demand for people with high skills, particularly in \nfast growing industries such as the high technology industry. However, \nI want to make clear that I understand this bill to be a short-term fix \nfor the needs of our economy and not a long-term solution.\n  If Congress is going to deal with the workforce needs in this country \nwe can not simply rely on the H-1B program. The national skill shortage \nproblem must be resolved by expanding training programs for American \nworkers and increasing educational opportunities for our young people.\n  Section 10 of this bill provides significant new resources for \nfunding new innovative activities in K-12 math and science across the \nnation. It also represents a major boost beyond what was provided in \nthe H-1B legislation in 1998.\n\n[[Page S9657]]\n\n Under the 1998 H-1B bill, the amount of funding for the National \nScience Foundation (NSF) K-12 activities was fairly small--less than $6 \nmillion in FY 2000. Thanks to the leadership of Senator Feinstein and \nSenator Kennedy, this legislation would more than double that amount to \n$15 million.\n  We can make further progress in our education and training needs by \nincreasing the fee that sponsors pay for H-1B visas. Hopefully, the \nConference Committee will increase the fee to $1000 more than tripling \nthe amount made available for job training grants, low income \nscholarships and NSF enrichment courses--opportunities, which in the \nlong-term, will produce a better trained American workforce. The bill \nbefore us today does not increase the fee because the Senate can not \noriginate a revenue measure. However, I supported the bill because of a \ncommitment made by both Republicans and Democrats on the Judiciary \nCommittee to increase the fee to $1000 when the bill goes to conference \nwith the House.\n  The focus on technology training for teachers addresses a critical \nneed, one that I've fought for in my home state of Michigan. That is \nwhy I'm happy to note that we've included language in this bill, which \nI proposed, with the support of Senator Conrad, specifying that the NSF \nshould make teacher training in the integration of technology into the \nmath and science curriculum a priority in funding projects from \nresources provided under this legislation. My office will be working \nwith the National Science Foundation as they develop programs to be \nfunded under this legislation so that investments in such professional \ndevelopment will lead the list of funding initiatives.\n  This provision is essential if we are going to realize the full \npotential of our investment in new technology in the classroom. So few \nof our school districts have been able to offer state-of-the-art \ntraining, or any training at all for that matter, to their teaching \nstaff. Last year, a report by Education Week's National Survey of \nTeachers' Use of Digital Content revealed some startling findings \nrelative to the lack of teacher training in integrating technology into \nthe curriculum. In a national poll of over 1,400 teachers, 36 percent \nof teachers responded that they received absolutely no training in \nintegrating technology in the curriculum; another 36 percent said they \nhad only received 1 to 5 hours of such training; 14 percent received 6 \nto 10 hours of such training; and only 7 percent received between 11-20 \nhours.\n  This bill is an important step towards addressing this problem, a \nstep that I hope is followed by many others. We are fortunate in my \nstate and across this country to find in the ranks of teachers men and \nwomen who are deeply committed to helping America's children learn. I \nbelieve we have to match their commitment to our children with our own \ncommitment to helping them acquire the skills they seek to be effective \neducators in the digital age.\n  I also supported this bill because it guarantees that H-1B visas will \nbe made available to those working at educational institutions, non-\nprofit organizations, and non-profit or governmental research \norganizations. Currently, these institutions, who recruit scholars and \nresearchers with the highest possible credentials, are forced to \ncompete with for profit companies for the limited number of visas \navailable, and have had difficulties obtaining H-1B visas for their \nprospective employees.\n  Some of those visa holders are people like Thomas Hofweber, a first-\nyear assistant professor in the Philosophy Department at the University \nof Michigan, who has conducted research in the areas of metaphysics and \nepistemology and is believed to be among the most talented young \nmetaphysicians in the world. Another H-1B visa holder at Michigan State \nUniversity's Department of Agricultural Economics is a researcher and \nteacher in Agribusiness Management and brings an outstanding background \nin the economics of horticultural enterprises and the management of \ntheir labor forces.\n  It is of great benefit for Michigan students to be able to study with \nthese scholars. I am pleased that universities and research \ninstitutions will be able to obtain more needed visas under this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/03/senate-section/article/S9657-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   VISA WAIVER PERMANENT PROGRAM ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Murguia, of Arizona, to be U.S. District Judge for the \nDistrict of Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we are here today in the crunch of end-of-\nsession business to debate and take time on four noncontroversial \njudicial nominees. This debate today was demanded by Senate Democrats \nwho, ironically, have stood in the way of these nominations made by \nPresident Clinton, their own President. These are Clinton nominees the \nDemocrats are holding up, Clinton nominees whom Democrats are insisting \nwe take precious time to debate.\n  For the past few years, Senate Democrats have threatened shutdowns, \nclaimed the existence of a so-called judicial vacancy crisis, and \ncomplained of race and sex bias in order to push through President \nClinton's judicial nominees. These allegations are false.\n  First, there is and has been no judicial vacancy crisis. consider, \nfor example, the Clinton administration's statements on this issue. At \nthe end of the 1994 Senate session, the Clinton administration in a \npress release entitled ``Record Number of Federal Judges Confirmed'' \ntook credit for having achieved a low vacancy rate. At that time, there \nwere 63 vacancies and a 7.4 percent vacancy rate. The Clinton \nadministration's press release declared: ``This is equivalent to `full \nemployment' in the . . . federal judiciary.'' Today, there are 67 \nvacancies--after the votes today there will be only 63 vacancies, the \nsame as in the 1994. Instead of declaring the judiciary fully employed \nas they did in 1994. Democrats claim that there is a vacancy crisis.\n  In fact, the Senate has confirmed President Clinton's nominees at \nalmost the same rate as it confirmed those of Presidents Reagan and \nBush. President Reagan appointed 382 Article III judges. Thus far, the \nSenate has confirmed 373 of President Clinton's nominees and, after the \nvotes today, will have confirmed four more. During President Reagan's \ntwo terms, the Senate confirmed an average of 191 judges. During \nPresident Bush's one term, the Senate confirmed 193 judges. After these \nfour judges are confirmed today, the Senate will have confirmed an \naverage of 189 judges during each of President Clinton's two terms.\n  Second, there has not been a confirmation slowdown this year. \nComparing like to like, this year should be compared to prior election \nyears during times of divided government. In 1988, the Democrat-\ncontrolled Senate confirmed 41 Reagan judicial nominees. After these \nfour nominees are confirmed today, the Republican Senate this year will \nhave confirmed 39 of President Clinton's nominees--a nearly identical \nnumber.\n  In May, at a Judiciary Committee hearing, Senator Biden, the former \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, said: ``I have told everyone, and \nI want to tell the press, if the Republican Party lets through more \nthan 30 judges\n\n[[Page S9658]]\n\nthis year, I will buy you all dinner.'' When he said this, Senator \nBiden apparently believed that the confirmation this year of more than \n30 judges would be fair. Well Senator Biden owes some people some \ndinners, maybe everybody in the press. After the votes today, the \nSenate this year will have confirmed 39 judicial nominees.\n  The 1992 election year requires a bit more analysis.\n  The Democrat-controlled Senate did confirm 64 Bush nominees that \nyear, but this high number was due to the fact that Congress had \nrecently created 85 new judgeships. Examining the percentage of \nnominees confirmed shows that compared to 1992, there is no slowdown \nthis year. In 1992, the Democrat-controlled Senate confirmed 33 of 73 \nindividuals nominated that year--or 45 percent. This year, the Senate \nwill confirm 25 of 44 individuals nominated in 2000--or 57 percent. \nThose who cite the 1992 high of 64 confirmations as evidence of an \nelection-year slowdown do not mention these details. Nor do they \nmention that despite those 64 confirmations, the Democrat-controlled \nSenate left vacant 115 judgeships when President Bush left office--\nnearly double the current number of vacancies.\n  Senate Democrats often cite Chief Justice Rehnquist's 1997 remarks as \nevidence of a Republican slowdown. Referring to the 82 vacancies then \nexisting, the Chief Justice said: ``Vacancies cannot remain at such \nhigh levels indefinitely without eroding the quality of justice that \ntraditionally has been associated with the federal Judiciary.'' \nSenators who cite this statement, however, do not also cite the Chief \nJustice's similar statement in 1993, when the Democrats controlled both \nthe White House and the Senate: ``There is perhaps no issue more \nimportant to the judiciary right now than this serious judicial vacancy \nproblem.'' As the head of the judicial branch, the Chief Justice has \ncontinued to maintain pressure on the President and Senate to speedily \nconfirm judges. He has not singled out the Republican Senate, however. \nSelective use of his statements to imply that he has is inappropriate.\n  The Chief Justice made additional comments in 1997, which also \nundermine the claim of a vacancy crisis. After calling attention to the \nexisting vacancies, he wrote: ``Fortunately for the Judiciary, a \ndependable corps of senior judges has contributed significantly to \neasing the impact of unfilled judgeships.'' The 67 current vacancies, \nin other words, are not truly vacant. There are 363 senior judges \npresently serving in the federal judiciary. Although these judges' \nseats are technically counted as vacant, they continue to hear cases at \nreduced workload. Assuming that they maintain a 25 percent workload \n(the minimum required by law), the true number of vacancies is less \nthan zero.\n  Third, allegations of race or sex bias in the confirmation process \nare absolutely false. Just this month, for example, President Clinton \nissued a statement alleging bias by the Senate. He said: ``The quality \nof justice suffers when highly qualified women and minority candidates \nare denied an opportunity to serve in the judiciary.'' The White House, \nthough, also issued a statement boasting of the high number of women \nand minorities that Clinton has appointed to the federal courts: ``The \nPresident's record of appointing women and minority judges is unmatched \nby any President in history. Almost half of President Clinton's \njudicial appointees have been women or minorities.'' The Senate, \nobviously, confirmed this record number of women and minorities. That \nis hardly evidence of systemic bias--or any bias at all.\n  Last November, Senator Joseph Biden, former chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, stated:\n\n       There has been argumentation occasionally made . . . that \n     [the Judiciary] Committee . . . has been reluctant to move on \n     certain people based upon gender or ethnicity or race. . . . \n     [T]here is absolutely no distinction made [on these grounds]. \n     . . . [W]hether or not [a nominee moves] has not a single \n     thing to do with gender or race. . . . I realize I will get \n     political heat for saying that, but it happens to be true.\n\n  I personally appreciated Senator Biden's comments on that, while \nothers were trying to play politics with these issues. He knows how \ndifficult it is under the circumstances to please both sides on these \nmatters. The chairman takes pain from both sides on these matters. \nThere is no question there are some on our side who have wanted to slow \ndown this process, and others on the other side have wanted to speed up \nthe process. The important thing is that we do a good process. That is \nwhat we have tried to do.\n  The statistics confirm Senator Biden's position. Data comparing the \nmedian time required for Senate action on male versus female and \nminority versus non-minority nominees shows only minor differences. \nDuring President Bush's final two years in office, the Democrat-\ncontrolled Senate took 16 days longer to confirm female nominees \ncompared with males. This differential decreased to only 4 days when \nRepublicans gained control of the Senate in 1994. During the subsequent \n105th and 106th Congresses, it increased.\n  The data concerning minority nominees likewise shows no clear trend. \nWhen Republicans gained control in 1994, it took 28 days longer to \nconfirm minority nominees as compared to non-minority nominees. This \ndifference decreased markedly during the 105th Congress so that \nminorities were confirmed 10 days faster than non-minorities. The \npresent 106th Congress is taking only 11 days longer to confirm a \nminority nominees than it is to confirm non-minority nominees.\n  These minor differences are a matter of happenstance. They show no \nclear trend. And even if there were actual differences, a differential \nof a week or two is insignificant compared to the average time that it \ntakes to select and confirm a nominee. On average, the Clinton White \nHouse spends an average of 315 days to select a nominee while the \nSenate requires an average of 144 days to confirm.\n  Under my stewardship, the Judiciary Committee has considered \nPresident Clinton's judicial nominees more carefully than the \nDemocratic Senate did in 1993 and 1994. Some individuals confirmed by \nthe Senate then likely would not clear the committee today. The \nSenate's power of advice and consent, after all, is not a rubber stamp.\n  But there is no evidence of bias or of a confirmation slowdown. \nSenate Democrats claim that Republicans have politicized the \nconfirmation process. Republicans, though, have not levied false \ncharges or used petty parliamentary games.\n  In conclusion, it always is the case that some nominations die at the \nend of the Congress. In 1992, when Democrats controlled the Senate, \nCongress adjourned without having acted on 53 Bush nominations. \nCurrently there are only 38 Clinton nominations that are pending before \nthe Judiciary Committee.\n  It is not the end of the line for nominees that do not get confirmed \nthis year. Republican nominees who failed to get confirmed have bone on \nto great careers, both in public service and the private sector. \nSenator Jeff Sessions, Governor Frank Keating, Washington attorney John \nRoberts, and law professor Lillian BeVier are just a few \nexamples. Lillian BeVier and a number of other women are prime examples \nof those who were denied the opportunity of being on the court for one \nreason or another back in those days.\n\n  I bitterly resent anybody trying to play politics with this issue. I \nstand ready to defend our position on the Judiciary Committee, and I \nlook forward to confirming these last four nominees today. And, of \ncourse, once we have done that, we will have matched what was done back \nin 1994, when the President said we had a full judiciary, with a \nvacancy of 7.4 percent.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is my understanding that under the unanimous consent \nrequest, I have 10 minutes to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have spoken with the staff of Senator \nLeahy and, if I go beyond 10 minutes, I ask that the additional time be \ntaken from that allocated to Senator Leahy.\n  I thank Senator Hatch for his leadership and friendship on the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. We have our differences. When I served on the \ncommittee, we had some profound differences, but I respect him very \nmuch, and I respect the job he does.\n  I thank Senator Hatch personally for the kind attention which he has \ngiven to the vacancies in my home State of\n\n[[Page S9659]]\n\nIllinois. I am happy to report that with the nomination and \nconfirmation of Michael Reagan, we will have a full complement of \nFederal judges in our State, which will make the workload more \nmanageable all across the State. So I thank Senator Hatch and also \nSenator Fitzgerald. We have been working for the last 2 years, on a \nvery bipartisan basis, toward approving these nominees to have come \nbefore the Senate.\n  Before I address the nomination of Michael Reagan, I would like to \naddress a larger issue which involves not only the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee but the entire Senate, the Congress, and the people of this \ncountry because this week marks the opening of the Supreme Court's new \nterm. It is a good moment to reflect on the role of the Supreme Court, \nits past, and its future.\n  This brief statement that I present to you represents some of the \nconcerns I have about the Supreme Court, the role it is playing, and \nthe impact of the Presidential election on the future of that Court.\n  One of the most interesting books ever written about America was \nwritten by a French tourist by the name of Alexis de Tocqueville. He \ncame to the United States 165 years ago, traveling around different \ncities and making observations about this American character. This was \na brand new nation. De Tocqueville wrote in his famous work his \nobservations and took them back to Europe.\n  One might think that a book such as that would be lost in history. It \nturns out that de Tocqueville's observations were so impressive that \n165 years later we still turn to this book, and I think it is nothing \nshort of amazing that his observations turn out to be valid today. De \nTocqueville made an observation about America and about all of the \nimportant political questions in our country which sooner or later turn \nout to be judicial questions. This wasn't a criticism. Quite the \ncontrary. De Tocqueville admired the innovations in the American \njudiciary that granted the courts the independence and clarity of \nfunction that were found nowhere else in the world. De Tocqueville \nbelieved these observations would mean that America's judicial system \nwould hear, and act on, the most important issues of the day. He \ncouldn't have been more correct.\n  Think about the ``big issues''. The issues that the American people \nhave cared about--argued about--most deeply. The issues that spark the \nmost debate--and the most passion. Sooner or later, the battle over \nthese issues comes before the highest court in the land. Slavery. Child \nlabor. Worker safety. Monopolies. Unionization. Freedom of the press. \nCapital punishment. Segregation. Environmental protection. Voting \nrights. A woman's right to choose.\n  The battle always comes to the Supreme Court; always comes before the \nnine justices who are Constitutionally granted enormous \nresponsibilities, and enormous power.\n  In just the past year, the Supreme Court has offered important \nrulings on abortion, school prayer, gay rights, aid to parochial \nschools, pornography, Miranda rights, violence against women, parental \nrights--just to name a few. Not all of these decisions have turned out \nas I would have hoped.\n  For instance, take the case of U.S. vs. Morrison. The Supreme Court \nstruck down a provision of the Violence Against Women Act that gave \nvictims of rape and domestic violence the right to sue their attackers \nin federal court. Congress passed this law to give women an additional \nmeans of pursuing justice when they are the victims of assault. We \npassed this law because the States themselves did not always adequately \npursue rapists and assailants. And the States acknowledged this!\n  Thirty-six States had entered this suit on behalf of the woman who \nhad been victimized. They wanted victims of violence against women to \nretain the right to bring their attackers to court. But the Supreme \nCourt, in a narrow vote, decided otherwise. The vote . . . five to \nfour.\n  But this close margin is not unusual on our highest court--it is \nbecoming commonplace. Rarely has the Supreme Court been so narrowly \ndivided for such a long period of time. The replacement of just one \njudge could drastically change the dynamic of the Court for decades to \ncome.\n  Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Scalia and Thomas--the Court's \nmost conservative members--tend to vote together on hot button social \nand political issues such as affirmative action and school prayer. \nCentrist conservatives, Justices O'Connor and Kennedy, usually join \nthem. The dissent is often written by the more liberal justices--\nStevens, Souter, Ginsberg and Breyer. Both Ginsberg and Breyer are \nClinton appointments.\n  Many of the Supreme Courts decisions have been made on the basis of a \nsingle vote. Partial birth abortion--five to four. Age discrimination--\nfive to four. Gay rights--five to four. Warantless police searches--\nfive to four. The federal role in death penalty cases--five to four.\n  These are not mere academic cases. These are decisions that change \npeople's lives. We all hope that the Supreme Court will act wisely and \nfairly. But we also all know--history and human nature tell us so--\nthat this is not always the case.\n\n  We learned in school about the Dred Scott case. Mr. Scott had lived \nin my home state of Illinois--where slavery was banned--and sued for \nhis freedom on the basis that he had already lived as a free man, and \nhad the right to continue to do so. The Supreme Court infamously \ndisagreed, finding that Mr. Scott was nothing more than property--``to \nbe Used in Subserviency to the Interests, the Convenience, or the Will, \nof His Owner'', a man ``Without Social, Civil, or Political Rights.'' \nThe decisions of the Supreme Court--and at times, the opinion of just \none Justice--can make the difference between having, or losing, a \ncherished right.\n  Perhaps that is the reason that my colleague, the senior Senator from \nUtah, is of the opinion that a President's power to make nominations to \nthe Supreme Court and to the federal bench is--and this is a quote--``. \n. .the single most important issue of this next election.''\n  I think he's right. The next President may have the opportunity to \nmake two or three appointments to the Supreme Court. He may even \nappoint the next Chief Justice.\n  In the first two hundred years since the signing of the Constitution, \nthe Supreme Court invalidated 128 laws that had been passed by \nCongress. About one law every two years, on average. Since 1995, \nhowever, the Court has struck down 21 laws, more than four per year. \nThis is an unprecedented assertion of judicial power.\n  Will the next President try to use the appointment process to further \nshift the balance of power between the branches of government?\n  Will the next President of the United States use a litmus test to \n``pack'' the Supreme Court with Justices--Justices whose minds were \nalready made up on important issues?\n  That is what the far right, members of the Federalist Society, want. \nThey want to turn back the hands of the clock.\n  So I'm inclined to agree with the distinguished Senator from Utah. \nThis is, indeed, one of the most important issues of the Presidential \ncampaign.\n  Imagine a Supreme Court with three Antonin Scalia's--three Clarence \nThomases--three radically conservative Justices bent on greatly \nrestricting the authority of the federal government. The philosophical \nbalance of the Court would shift dramatically. One by one the \nprotections that have been built up over the past thirty five years \ncould fall.\n  If you read the history of the Supreme Court, you will note that up \nuntil the time Franklin Roosevelt was President, it was an extremely \nconservative and somewhat lackluster Court. The Court started to change \nduring Roosevelt's Presidency, and beyond. Republican and Democratic \nPresidents thereafter appointed more activist judges who looked at the \nproblems facing America. One by one, the protections which we built up \nover that period of time would be in jeopardy.\n  Protection of the rights of minorities, women, and the handicapped; \nprotection of voting rights, civil rights, worker rights, reproductive \nrights; protection of the environment; protection from gun violence; \nand protection of our fundamental freedoms as Americans. One by one, a \ndifferent court could challenge each of these protections.\n\n[[Page S9660]]\n\n  No longer could the federal government require background checks for \ngun purchases, rein in polluters, or protect the persecuted.\n  I hope all Americans will give some thought to the type of Supreme \nCourt they feel can best serve the American people. I hope they give it \nsome thought before they go out and vote in November.\n  In addition to who will be appointed, it's also critical to realize \nwho is not being appointed.\n  More than any previous president, President Clinton has succeeded in \ndiversifying the bench. Nevertheless, women and minorities are still \nunderrepresented in our Federal courts. It isn't as if some Members of \nCongress have not tried to address this disparity. But as hard as we \ntry to diversify the bench, we have not been able to produce the record \nof success that we would like to show.\n\n  I wonder how one of the great Justices ever to serve on the Supreme \nCourt, Justice Thurgood Marshall, would have reflected on the treatment \nof a nominee, Ronnie White for the Federal District Court in Missouri. \nHe is a member of Missouri Supreme Court. He is African American. He \nwas judged qualified and reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee. \nThen he was rejected on the Senate floor by a party-line vote. Some \nlabeled him a ``judicial activist.'' They produced some excuses or \nreasons for not confirming him, and he was defeated--one of the few \ntimes in modern memory that a judge made it to the floor and lost on a \nrecorded vote.\n  I wonder how Justice Thurgood Marshall, the first black Justice \nappointed to the Supreme Court 33 years ago, would observe and reflect \non what happened to Ronnie White.\n  I think Justice Marshall would have viewed the current state of \njudicial nominations differently than the Federalist Society. This \nconservative group has over 25,000 members plus scores of affiliates, \nincluding former Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr; Supreme Court \nJustices Thomas and Scalia; and University of Chicago's Richard Epstein \nand Frank Easterbrook, also a federal appellate judge.\n  And their numbers are growing. The Federalist Society has chapters in \n140 out of the 182 accredited law schools. The campus chapter at the \nUniversity of Illinois College of Law is very active.\n  I don't have to tell you about the Society's ``originalist'' approach \nto the Constitution. Justice Scalia's and Justice Thomas's opinions \nclearly reflect their point of view.\n  I don't have to tell you the Federalist Society has been instrumental \nin influencing the law. They have helped to weaken or rolled back \nstatutes on civil rights and affirmative action; voting rights; women's \nright's and abortion rights; workers' rights; prisoners' rights; and \nthe rights of consumers, the handicapped and the elderly.\n  Martin Luther King., Jr., once said, ``The moment is always right to \ndo what is right.''\n  I think the moment is right to hold the tobacco industry responsible \nfor the costs incurred by the federal government for the medical \ntreatment of individuals made ill by their deadly products.\n  I think the moment is right to hold the gun industry accountable for \nthe irresponsible design, manufacture, distribution and marketing of \ntheir lethal weapons.\n  The moment is right to ensure that HMOs and health insurance \ncompanies can be held accountable for their wrongdoing that results in \nthe injury or death of American citizens.\n  The moment may be right to elect a President who will appoint \nJustices who reflect that point of view and will protect our civil \nliberties.\n  I think the moment is right to remove barriers to the bench so that \nevery citizen--whether man, woman, or whatever ethnic, racial, or \nreligious background--can be adequately represented on our court.\n  I will say a word on behalf of my nominee who is before the Senate, \nMichael Reagan, the judicial nominee for the U.S. District Court for \nthe Southern District of Illinois. Senator Fitzgerald and I reached an \nagreement about the selection of these nominees. Michael Reagan is the \nproduct of this agreement.\n  Michael Reagan possesses all the qualities necessary to make a \ntremendous contribution to the federal bench.\n  He has strong bipartisan support, as well as, the support of several \nrespected judges, leaders, and organizations including: the National \nSheriffs' Association; the Honorable Moses Harrison II, Chief Justice, \nIllinois Supreme Court; The Most Reverend Wilton D. Gregory, Bishop of \nthe Diocese of Belleville; the Illinois Federation of Teachers; and the \nIllinois Pharmacists Association.\n  They have all written letters supporting Michael Reagan's nomination \nto fill the Southern District of Illinois' judicial vacancy.\n  Michael Reagan is a full-time public servant who wears several hats. \nIn addition to his private practice, Mr. Reagan serves as a \nCommissioner of the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission \nof the Supreme Court of Illinois. Mr. Reagan has held this position \nsince 1995 and is responsible for supervising the attorney registration \nand disciplinary system in Illinois, a very important assignment.\n  In addition, Mr. Reagan serves as Assistant Public Defender in St. \nClair County, Illinois. In this capacity, he represents indigent \ncriminal defendants charged with major felonies. Mr. Reagan has served \nas an Assistant Public Defender since 1996.\n  Mr. Reagan also serves as an Honorary Deputy Sheriff in St. Clair, a \nfully commissioned law enforcement position that he has held for the \npast three years. His background as a police officer certainly \nqualified him in that capacity. As an Honorary Deputy Sheriff, Mr. \nReagan has full arrest powers and is subject to be called to duty in \nthe event of an emergency.\n  Mr. Reagan began his career in public service as a police officer \nafter graduating with a Bachelor's of Science degree from Bradley \nUniversity in 1976, his law degree from St. Louis University in 1980.\n  Although Mr. Reagan holds many notable positions, the most important \nroles he plays are that of husband and father. Mr. Reagan has been \nmarried to Elaine Catherine Edgar since 1976. They have four boys. I \nhave met them all; they are great kids.\n\n  The Reagans will soon be celebrating their 25th anniversary. It is a \ngreat family.\n  I am pleased that the Senate will have this opportunity to vote for \nMichael Reagan. He possesses a rare combination of intelligence, \npractical experience, temperament, and devotion to public service that \nmakes for a great Federal judge. I look forward to his service on the \nFederal bench.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I join my distinguished colleagues to \nexpress my outrage at the treatment of judicial nominees this year. I \ndo so with the same preface as my distinguished friend from Illinois, \nin saying that I have a good working and personal relationship with the \nchairman of the committee, but the failure to confirm the nominees at \nthis time is an outrage.\n  I would like to focus my remarks on our efforts to fill one of the \nvacancies on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has fifteen seats. Five of those \nseats are currently vacant.\n  We have one seat on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals that has been \nvacant for a decade--longer than any other vacancy in the nation.\n  Filling this vacancy has been deemed a ``judicial emergency'' by the \nU.S. Judicial Conference.\n  On June 30, the President of the United States nominated Roger \nGregory, a distinguished lawyer from Virginia, to fill this vacancy. \nMr. Gregory graduated summa cum laude from Virginia State University \nand received his J.D. from the University of Michigan. He has an \nextensive federal practice, is an accomplished attorney, and was \ndescribed by Commonwealth Magazine as one of Virginia's ``Top 25 Best \nand Brightest.'' And he has bipartisan support. Senators John Warner \nand Arlen Specter have also written to the Judiciary Committee to seek \na hearing for Mr. Gregory.\n  Despite the well-documented need for another judge on this court, and \ndespite Mr. Gregory's stellar qualifications, the Judiciary Committee \nhas\n\n[[Page S9661]]\n\nstubbornly refused to even grant Mr. Gregory the courtesy of a hearing. \nIn failing to provide Mr. Gregory with a hearing, the Judiciary \nCommittee is abdicating its Constitutional responsibility and is \neffectively standing in the courthouse door to block this nomination.\n  Article II of the United States Constitution makes clear that the \nPresident is to nominate and the Senate is to provide advice and \nconsent on the nomination. It is difficult for the Senate to provide \nadvice or give its consent if it won't even allow the nominee to be \nheard. Many excuses have been offered for why this nominee won't be \ngranted a hearing. One convenient excuse is that this is a presidential \nelection year.\n  There is nothing in Article II of the United States Constitution, \nhowever, that suspends its provisions every four years. We have a \nconstitutional obligation to render our advice and, if appropriate, \ngrant our consent or, if not appropriate, decline to grant our consent. \nBut we cannot just throw up our hands and declare that this provision \nof the Constitution is rendered meaningless during presidential \nelection years.\n  The supposed logic that underlies this excuse is that the nominee may \nnot reflect the judicial philosophy of the next Administration. But how \ncan we even question the nominee's judicial philosophy if we never hear \nfrom him. So even this excuse argues in favor of granting the nominee a \nhearing.\n  The most recent excuse for failing to act on Mr. Gregory's nomination \nis that five years ago a gentleman from North Carolina was nominated \nfor this seat, and so the argument goes this seat now ``belongs'' to \nNorth Carolina. But five years before that, when this seat and three \nothers were created, a Virginian was arguably nominated to fill this \nseat--but the Senate only acted to fill the other three seats and this \none has been vacant ever since.\n  More importantly, however, seats on Courts of Appeal don't ``belong'' \nto any state. As I have already noted, there are only ten judges \ncurrently sitting in the Fourth Circuit. Four of these ten judges are \nfilling seats that were previously filled by a candidate judge and then \nfrom another state. Finally, it's a little hard for the senior Senator \nfrom North Carolina to complain that the seat belongs to North Carolina \nwhen he is the one who has been blocking a North Carolinian from \nfilling the seat.\n  Rather than hide behind excuses, the Senate Judiciary Committee ought \nto seize the opportunity to right a historical wrong. The Fourth \nCircuit Court of Appeals has the largest percentage of African-\nAmericans in the nation. Yet, the Fourth Circuit has never been \nintegrated. In fact, it is the only Circuit in the country that has \nnever in history had minority representation. If we were to confirm \nRoger Gregory--who is African-American--we could knock down yet another \nbarrier that has existed for far too long.\n  In my view, courts should better reflect the people over whom they \npass judgment. We still have time, if only we have the will to act. In \n1992, when there was a Republican in the White House and the Democrats \nran the Senate, we confirmed 6 Circuit Court judges later than July: 3 \nin August 2, in September 1, in October. In fact, its instructive to \nlook at the one nominee who was confirmed in October of 1992. Timothy \nK. Lewis was nominated to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals on \nSeptember 17. The Judiciary Committee gave him a hearing on September \n24. He was reported out of the Judiciary Committee on October 7, and \nconfirmed by the Senate on October 8.\n  Roger Gregory is an outstanding nominee. Rather than standing in the \ncourthouse door, we ought to throw the door open and desegregate the \nFourth Circuit. We ought to end this judicial and moral emergency and \nwe ought to do it now.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve any time remaining for \nthose covered under the unanimous consent order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Chair, in his capacity as a \nSenator from Wyoming, suggests the absence of a quorum with time to be \nallocated equally between the sides.\n  Without objection, the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Senate today will vote on the \nconfirmation of a number of judicial nominees. I not only have no \nproblem with that, I very much favor it. These nominees deserve a vote. \nThe districts in which they will serve surely deserve to have their \nnominations acted upon. I believe the Nation, as a whole, deserves to \nhave these nominees, and other nominees awaiting hearings and votes \nacted on by this Senate as well.\n  The Judiciary Committee held hearings for three of the nominees and \napproved those nominations less than a week after the nominations were \nreceived. Other nominees wait in vain for years just for a hearing. \nThat strikes me as being an arbitrary and inexplicable system, unfair \nto nominees awaiting hearings, awaiting votes, and unfair to the \ndistricts or the circuits in which they would serve if confirmed. I \nbelieve it is also unfair--perhaps this is most important of all--to \nthe people who await justice in their courts.\n  Two Michigan nominees to the Sixth Circuit have been waiting \nunsuccessfully for a hearing for more than 3\\1/2\\ years and 1 year \nrespectively. Two women, highly qualified, nominated from Michigan for \nthe Sixth Circuit where there is a severe shortage of judges and an \nenormous caseload that sits there pending, while they have been waiting \nfor more than 3\\1/2\\ years and 1 year respectively.\n  Judge Helene White, who is a court of appeals judge in Michigan, was \nfirst nominated in January of 1997. Her nomination to the Sixth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals has never been acted upon. She has never been granted \na hearing.\n  Kathleen McCree Lewis was nominated to the Sixth Circuit over a year \nago. It has been pending before the Judiciary Committee for over a \nyear. No hearing, no action.\n  These are two judicial nominees from my home State of Michigan. \nDespite there being no objection that I know of to their nominations, \nand in the absence of any explanation whatsoever, they have been kept \nin limbo without even a hearing for 3\\1/2\\ years and 1 year \nrespectively. I believe that is truly unconscionable. In the history of \nthe Senate, no nominee has waited as long as Judge White for a \nconfirmation hearing. The seat that she has been nominated for has been \nvacant for 5\\1/2\\ years. It is considered a ``judicial emergency'' by \nthe Judicial Conference of the United States.\n  There is no apparent reason for the denial of hearings for these two \nnominees. No one has questioned their qualifications for the bench. No \none that I know of objects to their candidacies. It is well known Judge \nWhite and Ms. Lewis are both talented, hard-working nominees.\n  Each are highly respected for their records which show them to be \nwomen of integrity and fairness. Judge White has had a distinguished \ncareer. She was a trial judge for 10 years on the Wayne County Circuit \nCourt bench and in 1992 was elected to the Michigan Court of Appeals \nwhere she has served ever since. She also serves on the board of \ndirectors of the Michigan Legal Services and the board of governors of \nthe American Jewish Committee.\n  Kathleen McCree Lewis is a distinguished appellate practitioner at \nthe Detroit law firm of Dykema Gossett, one of the most prestigious law \nfirms in our State. She also served as a commissioner on the Detroit \nCivil Service Commission and on the Civic Center Commission. She has \nargued dozens of cases and is a respected appellate lawyer in the very \ncircuit to which she has been nominated. She also happens to be the \ndaughter of the late Wade McCree, a highly respected judge who served \non the Sixth Circuit, and was a former Solicitor General of the United \nStates. If confirmed, Kathleen McCree Lewis will be the first African \nAmerican woman ever to serve on the Sixth Circuit.\n  Gov. George Bush has said that the Senate should act on nominees \nwithin 60 days. That deadline passed years ago for Judge White and for \nKathleen McCree Lewis. According to Governor Bush:\n\n       The Constitution empowers the President to nominate \n     officers of the United States, with the advice and consent of \n     the Senate.\n\n  Then he said:\n\n       That is clear-cut, straightforward language. It does not \n     empower anyone to turn\n\n[[Page S9662]]\n\n     the process into a protracted ordeal of unreasonable delay \n     and unrelenting investigation.\n\n  To keep these nominees pending for so long without hearings is unfair \nto the nominees, particularly where there is no known objection and \nwhere there is no explanation for the refusal to grant hearings.\n  Even more important, it is unfair to the citizens served by the \ncourt. There is a large backlog of cases in the Sixth Circuit which is \na serious concern for not just Michigan but for all the States that are \nserved by that court. Over one-fourth of the judgeships on the Sixth \nCircuit are currently vacant, and that is among the highest vacancy \nrate of any circuit court in the country.\n  Judge Gilbert Merritt, who recently served as chief judge of the \nSixth Circuit, wrote in a March 20 letter to Chairman Hatch: The court \nis ``hurting badly and will not be able to keep up with its workload \ndue to the fact that the Senate Judiciary Committee has acted on none \nof the nominations to our court.''\n  Judge Merritt went on to say the following--and this is the former \nchief judge who still sits on the court. This is what Judge Merritt \nsaid:\n\n       Our court should not be treated in this fashion. The \n     public's business should not be treated this way. The \n     litigants in the Federal courts should not be treated this \n     way. The remaining judges on a court should not be treated \n     this way. The situation in our court is rapidly deteriorating \n     due to the fact that 25 percent of the judgeships are vacant. \n     Each active judge of our court is now participating in \n     deciding more than 550 cases a year--a caseload that is \n     excessive by any standard. In addition, we will have almost \n     200 death penalty cases that will be facing us before the end \n     of the next year.\n       The Founding Fathers certainly intended the Senate \n     ``advise'' as to judicial nominations, i.e., consider, debate \n     and vote up or down. They surely did not intend that the \n     Senate, for partisan or factional reasons, would remain \n     silent and simply refuse to give any advice or consider any \n     vote at all, thereby leaving the courts in limbo, \n     understaffed and unable to properly carry out their \n     responsibilities for years.\n\n  That is Judge Merritt's letter. In addition to that, the Judiciary \nCommittee chairman, Senator Hatch, received a letter from 14 former \npresidents of the State bar of Michigan. These include, by the way, \nDemocrats and Republicans. That letter pleads for action relative to \nthe situation on the Sixth Circuit.\n\n  The Michigan bar presidents wrote in their letter to Senator Hatch \nthat the state of affairs on the Sixth Circuit has ``serious adverse \neffects on the bar and the administration of justice for our clients. \nWe urge you to promptly schedule hearings for, and to pass to the \nSenate floor for a vote, the nominations of Judge Helene White and \nKathleen McCree Lewis.''\n  In the last few months, there have also been several articles and \neditorials in papers around Michigan calling on the Senate to confirm \nthe court of appeals nominees for Michigan.\n  An editorial in the Detroit Free Press said:\n\n       The Senate's delay in considering President Clinton's \n     nominations to the [Sixth Circuit] court is unfair to \n     Michigan, to the nominees, and to anyone whose future might \n     be affected by a decision of this court.\n\n  An editorial in the Observer and Eccentric newspapers urged the \nJudiciary Committee and its members to ``give two thoughtful and well-\nrespected Michigan lawyers the courtesy of timely hearings on their \nnominations to the Federal judiciary that is currently hamstrung in \ncarrying out its work.''\n  An editorial in the Detroit News described the failure to act on \nSixth Circuit nominees as ``the sort of die-hard intransigence that \nshould be out of bounds.''\n  And a Jewish News editorial called the stall a ``travesty of \njustice.''\n  If Senators have concerns about something in the records of these \nMichigan candidates--and no one has raised anything to that effect--\nthen Senators should air their concerns in a committee hearing and then \nlet the committee vote. It is unfair to Michigan, it is unfair to the \ncitizens who use this court to keep these judicial nominees endlessly \nin limbo, despite the absence of any objection that I know of to their \nnominations and with no explanation forthcoming whatsoever.\n  A number of us have spent many hours over the last few years trying \nto get hearings for these Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals nominees from \nMichigan, and yet two well-qualified candidates, each deserving a \nhearing and a Senate vote, have been left in limbo with no explanation, \nno stated objection.\n  What we are doing today in approving these four nominees, it seems to \nme, is surely our function, totally appropriate, and I believe and hope \nthe nominees will be confirmed.\n  As we do this, we should also focus on nominees pending in the \nJudiciary Committee, awaiting hearings or awaiting a vote by the \ncommittee after a hearing, who are left there no matter how long they \nhave been waiting, sometimes, again, years in the case of Helene White \nand Barry Goode. We have others who have been waiting since April of \nlast year, June of last year, August of last year, September of last \nyear. I think we can do better than that. We should rise above that \nkind of nonaction on the part of our Judiciary Committee.\n  No plea from me or from others who have worked with me on these \nnominations has produced hearings, despite the editorials, despite the \nletters from the bar associations and from Judge Merritt. Despite all \nthese efforts, we have received just silence and statements about \nwaiting a little longer or ``we'll see'' or ``we'll try.''\n  We should be better than that. The Constitution wants us to be better \nthan that. I will vote to confirm these nominees whose nominations, in \nmany cases, were sent to the Senate, heard by the Judiciary Committee, \nand approved by the Judiciary Committee in less than a week. At the \nsame time, I will be thinking of the vacancies that exist on the Sixth \nCircuit Court of Appeals that have remained unfilled for years, where \nthere is a judicial emergency, an enormous backlog, and where, despite \nall the pleas from the bar association, the Sixth Circuit, from indeed \nthe Chief Justice of the United States, to vote on confirmations, we \nhave these two well-qualified women from Michigan sitting there, \nawaiting a hearing, endlessly in limbo, nothing but silence, no \nexplanation as to why their hearings are refused, no objection being \nnoted or stated to their nominations, only two well-qualified women \nleft in limbo and in silence.\n  We can do better. We should do better. I hope we find a way some day \nto do better.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the following letters \nand editorials.\n  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             U.S. Court of Appeals\n\n\n                                        for the Sixth Circuit,\n\n                                    Nashville, TN, March 20, 2000.\n\n     Re: Vacancies on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals\n\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: Several years ago during the period \n     that I was Chairman of the Executive Committee of the United \n     States Judicial Conference, we met from time to time, and you \n     were always concerned that the Senate Judiciary Committee do \n     its duty in filling the vacancies on the various Courts of \n     Appeals. I write now to you to request that the Judiciary \n     Committee bring up for a hearing and a vote nominations to \n     the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       I was taken aback to see an alleged statement of Senator \n     Mike DeWine from Ohio that no vote would be taken for a \n     nomination to fill the vacancy currently existing from Ohio. \n     Senator DeWine was quoted as saying that due to partisan \n     considerations there would be no more hearings or votes on \n     vacancies for the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. I hope that \n     this was not an accurate quote.\n       The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals now has four vacancies. \n     Twenty-five per cent of the seats on the Sixth Circuit are \n     vacant. The Court is hurting badly and will not be able to \n     keep up with its work load due to the fact that the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee has acted on none of the nominations to \n     our Court. One of the vacancies is five years old and no vote \n     has ever been taken. One is two years old. We have lost many \n     years of judge time because of the vacancies.\n       By the time the next President is inaugurated, there will \n     be six vacancies on the Court of Appeals. Almost half of the \n     Court will be vacant and will remain so for most of 2001 due \n     to the exigencies of the nomination process. Although the \n     President has nominated candidates, the Senate has refused to \n     take a vote on any of them.\n       Our Court should not be treated in this fashion. The \n     public's business should not be treated this way. The \n     litigants in the federal courts should not be treated this \n     way. The remaining judges on a court should not be treated \n     this way. The situation in our Court is rapidly deteriorating \n     due to the fact that 25% of the judgeships are vacant. Each \n     active judge of our Court is now participating\n\n[[Page S9663]]\n\n     in deciding more than 550 cases a year--a case load that is \n     excessive by any standard. In addition, we have almost 200 \n     death penalty cases that will be facing us before the end of \n     next year. I presently have six pending before me right now \n     and many more in the pipeline. Although the death cases are \n     very time consuming (the records often run to 5000 pages), we \n     are under very short deadlines imposed by Congress for acting \n     on these cases. Under present circumstances, we will be \n     unable to meet these deadlines. Unlike the Supreme Court, we \n     have no discretionary jurisdiction and must hear every case.\n       The Founding Fathers certainly intended that the Senate \n     ``advise'' as to judicial nominations, i.e., consider, debate \n     and vote up or down. They surely did not intend that the \n     Senate, for partisan or factional reasons, would remain \n     silent and simply refuse to give any advice or consider and \n     vote at all, thereby leaving the courts in limbo, \n     understaffed and unable properly to carry out their \n     responsibilities for years.\n       You and other members of the Senate have appeared before \n     the Judicial Conference and other judges' groups many times \n     and said that you care about the federal courts. I hope that \n     you will now act to help us on the Sixth Circuit Court of \n     Appeals. We need your help and the help of the two Senators \n     from Ohio, the two Senators from Tennessee, the two Senators \n     from Kentucky, and the Senators from Michigan.\n           Sincerely,\n     Gilbert S.

Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Hatch and Leahy: Recently, the former and \n     current presidents of the Ohio State Bar wrote Senators \n     DeWine and Voinovich a letter expressing their deep concern \n     over the present situation in the Court of Appeals for the \n     Sixth Circuit. With four of the sixteen seats vacant, the \n     circuit is in a state of judiciary emergency. Former Chief \n     Judge Gilbert Merritt has said:\n       ``Our Court should not be treated in this fashion. The \n     public's business should not be treated this way. The \n     litigants in the federal courts should not be treated this \n     way.

The President \n     has made two nominations. Judge Helene White was nominated in \n     January 1997, and is the longest pending nominee without a \n     hearing by over a year; Kathleen McCree Lewis was nominated \n     in September, 1999. Senator Abraham returned the ``blue \n     slips'' for the nominees in April. Joe Davis, a spokesman for \n     Senator Abraham, was quoted as saying that Senator Abraham \n     wants hearings for these nominees to take place. Still, no \n     hearings have been scheduled.\n       As former Michigan Bar Presidents, we agree with our Ohio \n     colleagues that the situation has serious adverse affects on \n     the bar and the administration of justice for our clients. We \n     urge you to promptly schedule hearings for, and to pass to \n     the Senate floor for a vote, the nominations of Judge Helene \n     White and Kathleen McCree Lewis.\n           Respectfully,\n         Honorable Victoria A.

The court \n     is hurting badly and will not be able to keep up with its \n     workload due to the fact that the Senate Judiciary Committee \n     has acted on none of the nominations to our court.''\n       Those were the words of Judge Gilbert Merritt, former chief \n     judge of the Cincinnati-based circuit, in a letter last month \n     to Senate Judiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and eight \n     other senators--including Senates Carl Levin and Spencer \n     Abraham of Michigan, one of eight states covered by the \n     circuit.\n       Merritt should not be alone in his outrage. The Senate's \n     delay in considering President Bill Clinton's nominations to \n     the court is unfair to Michigan, to the nominees, and to \n     anyone whose future might be affected by a decision of this \n     court.\n       The judicial confirmation process has bogged down in mean-\n     spirited, petty partisan wrangling between Democrat Clinton \n     and the Republican-controlled Senate, which seems determined \n     to wait out the lame duck and let his nominations wither.\n       It's not just the 6th Circuit, either. According to the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee, there are 78 vacancies and 10 \n     future vacancies in the federal judiciary. Only seven judges \n     have been confirmed this year. Six nominees are pending on \n     the Senate floor, 39 in committee, one nominee has withdrawn.\n       The 6th Circuit vacancies are for seats vacated by Judges \n     Damon J. Keith and Cornelia Kennedy. Michigan Appeals Court \n     Judge Helene White was nominated in January 1997 to fill the \n     Keith vacancy. She has never had even a hearing. Nominee \n     Kathleen McCree Lewis has been waiting since September 1999.\n       This is a disgrace that did not have to happen. Abraham \n     sits on the Judiciary Committee and could move these along. \n     Instead, he stalled consideration for three years, claiming \n     the Clinton administration blindsided him with the White \n     nomination.\n       It's hard to fathom what that has to do with the efficient, \n     effective administration of justice in reasonable time, with \n     the best interests of citizens in Michigan.\n       The federal court system should not be treated this way. \n     Neither should the judges who seek to serve it, nor the \n     citizens it is supposed to serve.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Michigan Press, June 25, 2000]\n\n        Is the GOP Playing Politics With Judicial Appointments?\n\n                            (By Phil Power)\n\n       ``The presidential appointments process now verges on \n     complete collapse.'' So concludes Paul C. Light, of the \n     Brookings Institution (usually a liberal Washington think \n     tank) and Virginia L. Thomas, of the Heritage Foundation \n     (usually conservative) in a study of the experiences of 435 \n     cabinet and sub-cabinet officials who served in the Reagan, \n     Bush and Clinton administrations.\n       Some found treatment by the White House appointments people \n     ``an ordeal.''\n       Others--35 percent of Reagan administration appointees and \n     57 percent of Clinton's nominees--were held hostage to the \n     politics of the U.S. Senate in waiting for confirmation \n     hearings.\n       That's one reason a lot of talented people are not about to \n     consider appointment to top government positions.\n       A perfect instance of this general problem concerns the \n     nominations of two Michigan lawyers to fill vacancies on the \n     U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals that have been twisting \n     slowly in the wind of the U.S. Senate for far too long.\n       Helene White is presently a member of the Michigan Court of \n     Appeals; nominated by President Clinton in January 1997, \n     Judge White has yet to receive a hearing from the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee. Kathleen McCree Lewis, the daughter of \n     former U.S. Solicitor General Wade McCree, is a partner in \n     the Dykema Gossett law firm in Detroit; her nomination has \n     been pending before the Judiciary Committee since September, \n     1999.\n       The Sixth Circuit is authorized to have 16 judges. \n     Currently, the Court has four vacancies, one of which goes \n     back for five years. For the Court to operate at 75 percent \n     efficiency means long delays to the litigants and enormous \n     workloads for the remaining judges (each of whom now has a \n     caseload of 550 cases each year). Authorities now consider \n     the number of vacancies in the federal court system to \n     constitute a ``judicial emergency.''\n       What's going on here?\n       Michigan's Senator Carl Levin, a Democrat and a minority \n     member of the Judiciary Committee, says it's because \n     Republicans in the Senate, hoping to win the presidency this \n     fall, have decided to hold up judicial nominations from the \n     Clinton White House.\n       As evidence, he produces a table showing that while the \n     Democrats controlled the Senate during the Bush \n     Administration, a total of 66 federal judges were confirmed.\n       However, when the GOP ran the Senate during the first term \n     of the Clinton Administration, 17 judges were confirmed.\n       So far in Clinton's second term, the Senate has confirmed \n     only seven judges, with a total of 33 judicial nominees \n     hanging fire before the Judiciary Committee without any \n     hearings scheduled on their nominations. There are at present \n     81 vacancies in the federal judiciary.\n       Michigan's other Senator, Spencer Abraham, is also a member \n     of the Judiciary Committee, but as a Republican his party \n     controls the committee.\n       I asked Joe Davis, a spokesman for Senator Abraham, how \n     come it's taken three and a half years (in the case of Judge \n     White) and eight months (in the case of lawyer Lewis) just to \n     get the committee to hold hearings on their nominations.\n       According to Davis, ``Senator Abraham does not know whether \n     or when hearings will take place. He wants them to take \n     place, though.''\n       That's nice. Frankly, I suspect if Senator Abraham really \n     wanted the Judiciary Committee to hold hearings on these \n     nominations, he'd find a way to do it PDQ.\n\n[[Page S9664]]\n\n       A member of the Sixth Circuit, Judge Gilbert S. Merit, \n     wrote in March a letter to Senate Judiciary Chairman Orrin \n     Hatch: ``The Founding Fathers certainly intended that the \n     Senate `advise' as to judicial nominations, i.e., consider, \n     debate and vote up or down.\n       They surely did not intend that the Senate, for partisan or \n     factional reasons, would remain silent and simply refuse to \n     give any advice or consider and vote at all, thereby leaving \n     the courts in limbo, under-staffed and unable properly to \n     carry out their responsibilities for years.''\n       Senator Abraham is running for reelection this fall.\n       He is stressing his performance as an effective senator in \n     his campaign. Somebody should ask him why he can't get his \n     committee to give two able, thoughtful and well respected \n     Michigan lawyers the courtesy of timely hearings on their \n     nominations to the federal judiciary that is currently \n     hamstrung in carrying out its work.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Detroit News, August 13, 2000]\n\n                        Get Judges Out of Limbo\n\n       Michigan Court of Appeals Judge Helene White got the \n     welcome word that she had been appointed to the federal bench \n     in January 1997.\n       That was 43 months, or more than 1,300 days ago. She is \n     still waiting to be approved by the U.S. Senate and take her \n     seat with the Sixth Circuit appeals court in Cincinnati, \n     which covers Michigan and several other states. She now has \n     the distinction of being the longest-delayed judicial nominee \n     in American history.\n       Judge White has been caught in the cross-fire between \n     President Bill Clinton and the Republican Senate leadership. \n     So has Detroit attorney Kathleen McRee Lewis, whose \n     nomination to the same court has been held up for nine \n     months.\n       The Senate is angry, and justifiably so, at the president \n     for deliberately bypassing the confirmation process and \n     appointing Bill Lann Lee head of the civil rights division of \n     the Justice Department. President Clinton knew that Mr. Lee \n     did not stand a chance of being confirmed because of the his \n     record in backing racial quotas.\n       Mr. Clinton got around it by the semi-devious route of \n     making a recess appointment. This has infuriated Senate \n     Majority Leader Trent Lott. In retaliation, he is holding up \n     37 judicial appointments.\n       This is exactly the sort of bitter political obstruction \n     that Texas Gov. George W. Bush pledged to end in his \n     convention acceptance speech last week.\n       ``I don't have enemies to fight,'' he said. ``I want to \n     change the tone in Washington to one of civility and \n     respect.''\n       Senate Republicans should listen to their party's nominee. \n     While their anger is understandable. It is the courts, and by \n     extension those who use the federal courts, who are punished \n     because of the resulting shortage of judges.\n       Sen. Lott hasn't even scheduled hearings for these \n     nominations. And the clock is ticking. If no action is taken \n     by Oct. 6, when the Senate adjourns, the nominations will \n     die.\n       U.S. Sen. Spencer Abraham, the Michigan Republican, \n     initially supported the stall by withholding his approval of \n     the nominations on the grounds that he was not properly \n     consulted by the White House. But he has since been \n     mollified, and he has given his go-ahead. His staff says, \n     however, that he will not push for hearings, which would be \n     within his power as a member of the Judiciary Committee. That \n     is for the Democratic nominators to do, his staff argues.\n       Every nominee deserves, at the least, a hearing within a \n     reasonable time frame. Mr. Bush has specifically suggested 60 \n     days.\n       Certainly, there is ample room for disagreement when the \n     legislative and executive branches of government are in the \n     hands of different parties. But Mr. Lott's pique has outlived \n     any reasonable purpose. [It is the sort of die-hard \n     intransigence that should be out of bounds.]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the time will be equally \ndivided. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: I understand this \nSenator has 30 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I will support consideration by the Senate of these \nnominations to fill district judge vacancies in Arizona and Illinois \nbecause we are entering a critical stage in the rising number of \njudicial vacancies in our Federal courts. However, in addition to the \ndistrict vacancies, there are 22 vacancies in our Federal appeals \ncourts, and pending before the Judiciary Committee are several appeals \ncourt nominations who are more than qualified to fill those positions. \nThat, of course, includes a constituent of mine, Bonnie J. Campbell, \nformer attorney general of the State of Iowa and presently the head of \nthe Department of Justice Office of Violence Against Women. Her \nnomination is for the Eighth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.\n  These positions should be filled with qualified individuals as soon \nas possible. I urge the Republican leadership to take the steps \nnecessary to allow the full Senate to vote up or down on these \nimportant nominations.\n  Basically what I have been hearing from the other side of the aisle, \nthe Republican leadership, is: This is an election year. Why allow \ncircuit nominees a vote on the floor? Hold it up. Maybe Governor Bush \nwill win the election and we will control the Senate and the House, and \nwe can have a whole new batch of appointees next year.\n  That attitude led me to take a look at the history of our judicial \nnominations. Let's go back to a time when there was a mirror image of \nwhat we have here, when there was a Republican President in the White \nHouse and a Democratic majority in the Senate. That year would be 1992. \nThat year, then-President George Bush nominated fourteen circuit court \njudges. From July through October, the Democrat-controlled Senate \nconfirmed nine of those judges. This year, a Democratic President \nnominated seven circuit court judges but with a Republican-controlled \nSenate, only one of these nominees has been confirmed. We have several \npending, but we see no action. Time is running out. Basically what I \nhave been told is, it is over with. They are not going to report any \nmore of these nominees out for circuit courts.\n  I have also heard the argument that Bonnie Campbell was not nominated \nuntil this year so we shouldn't expect this nominee to go through. \nLet's take a look at what I am talking about with these charts. This is \nkind of a busy looking chart, but these are the circuit judges \nnominated in 1992 by then-President George Bush. These were all \nnominated in 1992. There were 14 nominated. There were 9 who had \nhearings, 9 who were referred, and 9 who were confirmed, 9 out of 14 \nwho were nominated that year.\n  There was one nominee--Timothy Lewis--who was nominated in September \nof 1992, had his hearing in September of 1992, was referred in October \nof 1992, and confirmed in October of 1992. If the attitude that \nprevails among the Republican leadership today had prevailed in the \nDemocrat-controlled Senate in 1992, we would not have confirmed anyone \nafter July. This year, we have had none since July.\n  In 1992, we had two in September, two in August, and one in October, \ndespite the fact that it too was late in an election year. This year we \nhave only had one.\n  It is clear who is playing politics with judgeships. The Republican \nleadership of the Senate is playing the most baldfaced politics. It is \nnot alleged that these nominees are not qualified. It is simply that \nthey were nominated by a Democratic President. That is all. I have not \nheard one person on the Republican side tell me that Bonnie Campbell is \nnot qualified to be a circuit court judge.\n  Some people on the other side may have some differences with her on \nsome of her views. I understand that. I have had differences of view \nwith judges I have voted to confirm. Why? Because I thought they were \nqualified.\n  I thought that if the President nominated them, they had a fair \nhearing, and they were reported out, my only decision was whether or \nnot they were qualified--not whether they were ideologically opposed to \nme or to how I feel or what I believe. It has been my observation over \nthe last quarter century that oftentimes when judges who have more of a \nliberal bent get appointed to the court, in many cases they come down \non the more conservative side of cases. And I have seen conservative \njudges appointed to the court come down on the liberal side of cases. \nYou never really know how this will come out, but you know whether or \nnot people are legitimately qualified to serve on the bench.\n  So the arguments made that Bonnie Campbell wasn't nominated until \nthis year--well, as I said, in 1992, we had nine circuit court judges \nconfirmed that were nominated in that year. A couple of these were \nquite controversial. This year, we have had one confirmed. We have six \nmore pending for the circuit courts. I know my colleague\n\n[[Page S9665]]\n\nfrom Vermont, who is ranking member on the Judiciary Committee, stated \nthis last week that when a majority in the Senate starts playing these \nkinds of games, the result is that when the other side becomes the \nmajority they will do the same thing. That is too bad for our \ndemocratic system of government, too bad for the judgeships, and for \nour third branch of Government to have that happen.\n  I am not naive enough not to know that there are always politics \ninvolved in how judges are nominated. I understand that. That is the \nsystem in which we live. But there comes a point where politics ends \nand responsibility begins. When you have people who have had a hearing, \nwho are qualified, yet they won't be reported out for a vote on the \nSenate floor, that is pure politics and that is the height of \nirresponsibility. The Republican leadership is being totally \nirresponsible.\n  Of the judges nominated in 1992, every judge who got a hearing--every \nsingle judge who had a hearing in a Democrat-controlled Congress, when \na Democrat was the Chair of the Judiciary Committee, when the Democrats \ncontrolled the Judiciary Committee, every person who got a hearing was \nconfirmed. Every single one. That is not the case today. Too many \npolitical games are being played, I am afraid, on the Judiciary \nCommittee and on the other side.\n  I would like to mention one other judicial example from 1992. Michael \nMelloy was nominated for the district court in April of that year. He \nwas a Bush nominee, supported by Senator Grassley. As my colleagues \nknow, Senator Grassley and I have a longstanding commitment to support \nthe nominations of individuals from Iowa to our courts. Mr. Melloy is \nan example of this. He was nominated April 9, 1992, received his \nhearing on August 4, 1992, reported out of committee on August 12, \n1992, and confirmed by the Senate that very same day in 1992.\n  Again, I may have been ideologically opposed to Mr. Melloy. There may \nhave been some things he believed in that I didn't, but there was no \nquestion in my mind that Mr. Melloy was fully qualified to be a Federal \njudge. As long as he was qualified and supported by Senator Grassley \nand the administration, I supported that nominee, even though it was in \nthe closing days of 1992.\n  Let's look at the current nominees that we have. Three of the four we \nare going to be voting on today were nominated, got hearings, and were \nreported out of the committee within one week. Mr. James Teilborg was \nnominated on July 21, 2000, got his hearing on July 25, and was \nreported out of the committee on July 27. Now he stands to be confirmed \ntoday. On the other hand, Bonnie Campbell received a hearing by the \nJudiciary Committee in May--more than 2 months before Mr. Teilborg. Yet \nshe is not here on the floor. Why is it that Mr. Teilborg can come out \non the floor today and not Bonnie Campbell? Politics, the rankest form \nof politics.\n  The majority is being very inconsistent in their arguments. They say, \nwell, Bonnie Campbell was nominated this year, so it is too late. Mr. \nTeilborg was nominated this year--nominated, had a hearing, and was \nreported out all in the same week, and he will be confirmed today. If \nthis year was too late for Bonnie Campbell, why wasn't it too late for \nJames Teilborg?\n\n  As I said, nobody has come up and said Bonnie Campbell is not \nqualified. I challenge someone to come on the floor and say that. \nAgain, if people want to vote against Bonnie Campbell to be a circuit \ncourt judge, that is the right of each Senator--not only a right, but \nan obligation--if they believe someone is unqualified. We can't do that \nas long as she is bottled up in the committee.\n  The Senator from Utah has the power on that committee to report her \nout. I say to my good friend from Utah, who just appeared on the floor, \nthe Senator from Utah can report Bonnie Campbell's name out here to the \nfloor and we can have a vote on this nominee. That is the way it should \nbe done. Nobody has come up to me to say she is not qualified. She is a \nformer attorney general of the State of Iowa. Since 1995, she has led \nthe implementation of the Violence Against Women Act as the head of \nthat office under the Justice Department. She has broad support on both \nsides of the aisle. This is a case where a judicial nominee has the \nsupport of both the Republican Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, and the \nDemocratic Senator from Iowa, me. Yet she has not been reported out of \nthe Judiciary Committee. I say report her out. If people want to vote \nagainst her or say something about her qualifications, let them.\n  I can stand here today and talk about the qualifications of James \nTeilborg, or the other people; but, quite frankly, I am convinced they \nare qualified. I may be opposed to the way they think once in a while, \nbut they are qualified. Is the reason Bonnie Campbell is not being \nreported out because somebody on the other side of the aisle doesn't \nlike the way she thinks, or because she may have a view on an issue \ncontrary to theirs? The rankest form of politics is holding up Bonnie \nCampbell's nomination. We have a backlog of nominees and we should vote \non her.\n  The Violence Against Women Act expires this year. The Office of \nViolence Against Women in the Department of Justice has had only one \nperson head it since this bill was first implemented in 1995, and that \nis Bonnie J. Campbell. The reauthorization of the Violence Against \nWomen Act was voted on in the House of Representatives last week. If I \nam not mistaken, I think the vote was 415-3. So 415 Members of the \nHouse voted to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. Now, if the \nonly person to ever head that office had done a bad job in enforcing \nthat law, had not acted responsibly, had not brought honor and acclaim \nto that office and the administration of that law, do you think that \n415 Members of the House would have voted to reauthorize it? No. They \nwould have been on their feet over there, one after the other, talking \nabout how terrible this office has been run and how the person \noperating that office had done such a bad job in enforcing the law. Not \none Member of the House took the floor to so speak.\n  The one person to head that office is Bonnie J. Campbell. Not one \nperson I have ever run across has said she has done anything less than \nan exemplary job in running that office. Yet the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee will not report her name out for action by the full Senate. \nYet we will get the Violence Against Women Act here and Senator after \nSenator will rush up to speak about how great this law is. I will bet \nyou won't hear one Senator get up and say how badly this law has been \nadministered by the Office of Violence Against Women in the Department \nof Justice.\n  That tells you what an outstanding job Bonnie Campbell has done in \nthat office.\n  If that is the case, why won't the Senate Judiciary Committee report \nher name out? Politics; pure rank politics. That is what is going on in \nthe Judiciary Committee today. I hope it won't be that way if the \nDemocrats take charge of the Senate. I am not on the Judiciary \nCommittee, but we tend to get in what I call a ``cesspool spiral,'' \nlike a whirlpool. One side takes over the majority and begins to stall \nnominations, and then the other side takes over, we keep spiraling down \nfurther and further to the point where any nominee for a Federal court \nwill be held up months and perhaps even years while we await the next \nelection. Then our third branch of Government truly becomes a political \nfootball.\n  I hope the Judiciary Committee and the leadership on that side--I say \nto my friend from Utah--will listen to the words of Texas Governor \nGeorge Bush. He said he would call for a 60-day deadline for judges--\nonce they are nominated, the Senate will have 60 days to hold a \nhearing, to report out of committee and vote on the Senate floor.\n  Bonnie Campbell has been there a lot longer than 60 days and so have \nsome of the other judges.\n  I say to my friends on the Republican side--you are supporting George \nBush for President. If he said he would call for a 60-day deadline, I \nask my friends on the Republican side: Why don't we act accordingly?\n  In this Congress, the judicial nominees who have been confirmed had \nto wait on average 211 days. Governor Bush said they should not wait \nlonger than 60 days. This is not getting better; it is getting worse \naround here. It is really a shame.\n  Let's look at the percentages. I am told: This is the same today as \nit was before--blah, blah, blah, blah. I hear this all the time--\nnothing has changed.\n\n[[Page S9666]]\n\n  It has changed dramatically. For example, in the Reagan years, during \nthe 98th Congress, the Republicans were in the majority. They had a \nRepublican President. We received 22 circuit court nominations, and 14 \nwere confirmed. This is a Republican President and a Republican \nSenate--22 received, and 14 confirmed, for a 63.6-percent confirmation \nrate.\n  Let's look at the 100th Congress. President Reagan was still \nPresident, but there was a Democratic Senate. Twenty-six circuit court \njudge nominations were received; 17 were confirmed, for a 65.4-percent \nconfirmation rate.\n  Think about that. Democrats had a higher confirmation rate under \nPresident Reagan--a very conservative President. We had a higher \nconfirmation rate when the Democrats were in charge of the Senate than \nwhen the Republicans were in charge. We didn't block things when the \nDemocrats were in charge.\n  Next, the 102d Congress, 1991-1992. President Bush was the Republican \nmaking nominations and the Democrats were in charge in the Senate. We \nreceived 31 circuit court nominations. Twenty were confirmed, again, \nfor a 64.5-percent confirmation rate--Republican President and a \nDemocratic Senate.\n  Now we move to the 104th Congress. We had a Democratic President, \nPresident Clinton, and we had a Republican Senate. Twenty circuit court \nnominations were received; 11 were confirmed. That was a 55-percent \nconfirmation rate.\n  Now we are in the 106th Congress. We have a Democratic President and \na Republican Senate. Thirty-one circuit court of appeals nominations \nhave been received; 15 have been confirmed, for a 48.4-percent \nconfirmation rate.\n  I ask my friend--and he is my friend--the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee: How can we live with something like that? How can the \nJudiciary Committee come to this Senate with a straight face and say \nthat a 48-percent confirmation rate is what we did in the past, when \nthe record is clear? The record is in the 60-percent confirmation rate \nwhen we had Republican Presidents and a Democratic Senate. Yet today we \nare faced with a 48-percent confirmation rate.\n\n  I have heard from many judges. I have gotten letters from them saying \nthat it is time we filled the bench. Cases are backing up. We need to \nget judges on the bench. But I suppose we first have to pay attention \nto the elections.\n  This one nominee, Bonnie J. Campbell, should be reported out if for \nno other reason than we need people on the bench who are sensitive to \nwhat is happening in domestic abuse cases and violence against women.\n  In 1998, American women were the victims of 876,000 acts of domestic \nviolence. In 5 years--1993 to 1998--domestic violence accounted for 22 \npercent of the violent crimes against women. During those same years, \nchildren under the age of 12 lived in 43 percent of the households \nwhere this violence occurred. It is generational. The kids see it, they \ngrow up, and they become abusive parents themselves.\n  In Iowa, and all across America, prosecutors, victim service \norganizations, and law enforcement officers are fighting. But they need \nhelp. We need to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. But there \nis more we can do to make sure that we have judges who know what is \nhappening from firsthand experience and who can make sure that the law \nis applied fairly and upheld in courts around the country.\n  That is why we need someone like Bonnie Campbell on the circuit court \nof appeals. As I said, she is widely supported. She is supported by me \nand by Senator Grassley. She has the support of judges, police \norganizations, women, and domestic violence coalitions. She has strong \nsupport in the State of Iowa and on both sides of the aisle.\n  I ask the chairman of the committee: Why aren't we reporting out \nBonnie Campbell? Why? Just one simple question: Why? Is there a member \nof the majority who thinks she is not qualified? Let them so state. \nHave specific objections been raised as to her qualifications? If so, \nwe ought to know that so they can be addressed. But all we hear is a \ndeafening silence from the other side. We are left to assume that the \nreason Bonnie Campbell is being held up is because they are hoping \ntheir nominee wins the election. That is their right to hope that. They \ncan work as hard as they can for him. I don't blame them for that. But \nto hold up a qualified person like Bonnie Campbell who had her hearing \n2 months before Mr. Teilborg had his; yet she is being locked up in the \ncommittee--all the paperwork is done. Yet politics is holding her up.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the text of an article that \nappeared in the Des Moines Register the other day regarding the Bonnie \nCampbell nomination and the text of two editorials, one in the Cedar \nRapids Gazette and one in the Des Moines Register, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Des Moines Register, Oct. 1, 2000]\n\n                Campbell Issue Aids Democrats' Politics\n\n                            (By Jane Norman)\n\n       If Iowa Democrats needed any more reason to be excited and \n     energized about this year's presidential race in the state, \n     they probably have found it in the controversy swirling \n     around the stalled nomination of Iowan Bonnie Campbell in the \n     Republican-controlled U.S. Senate. George W. Bush, hello?\n       Campbell, the director of the Violence Against Women office \n     for the U.S. Justice Department, was nominated in March to be \n     Iowa's new appeals-court judge for the 8th Circuit based in \n     St. Louis. She had a spectacularly sedate hearing before the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee in May, but then the nomination \n     process ground to a halt. She's one of 42 judicial nominees \n     pending in the Senate.\n       Campbell has had the support not just of Senator Tom \n     Harkin, but also Senator Charles Grassley, even though it \n     must stick in Grassley's craw. Campbell, who ran for governor \n     of Iowa in 1994 and lost, made remarks during her race about \n     Christian conservatives that riled conservative activists, \n     who appealed to Grassley to kill her bid for the bench. \n     That's fair; whatever you think of the merits of their \n     arguments, it's their right to protest something as \n     significant as a lifetime judicial appointment.\n       Grassley declined to side with his traditional conservative \n     allies and supported Campbell, saying Democrats did not stand \n     in the way he wanted judicial appointments during the waning \n     days of the Bush presidency. While Grassley predicted that \n     Campbell would fall victim to election-year politics, there's \n     no evidence that he has tried to sabotage her behind the \n     scenes.\n       Campbell's nomination hung around all summer, gaining the \n     support of the bar association and the Iowa Police \n     Association. When Congress returned to work in September, \n     Harkin started turning up the heat. During the past week, he \n     has taken to the floor repeatedly to lambaste majority \n     Republicans for holding up the nomination, and he holds forth \n     at length on the Campbell nomination with Iowa reporters.\n       This has been a masterful strategy by Harkin, who's become \n     such a surrogate for Vice President Al Gore that Harkin was \n     paired with GOP vice-presidential nominee Dick Cheney on a \n     Fox News show. Campbell's woes only assist Harkin in making \n     the case for a Democratic presidency, over and over again in \n     media outlets across Iowa.\n       On Tuesday night, Harkin enlisted the help of Senator Joe \n     Biden, the Delaware Democrat and Judiciary Committee member \n     who's a friend of Campbell. Harkin and Biden formed a mutual \n     admiration society on the floor to praise Campbell, and Biden \n     recalled that he recommended that Campbell be made director \n     of the Violence Against Women office when it was launched.\n       Biden insisted it was ``flat malarkey'' that Democrats have \n     held up Republican appointments during the last days of \n     Republican presidencies, and said he pushed through a flock \n     of qualified Texas judges for Senator Phil Gramm in late \n     1992. ``To be fair about it there were three members of our \n     caucus who ripped me a new ear in the caucus for doing \n     this,'' said Biden.\n       Harkin said no Republican has ever come to him and \n     explained their opposition to the nomination. ``In fact, \n     Republicans in Iowa ask me why she is being held up,'' said \n     Harkin. ``Mainstream Republicans are asking me that.''\n       Biden said it is a ``terrible precedent,'' and that it is \n     hard on Harkin to see someone so ``shabbily treated'' from \n     his home state. You hoped there was a box of tissues close at \n     hand.\n       Then, on Thursday, Harkin revealed to reporters that he had \n     been told by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch \n     ``in no uncertain terms'' that the Republican caucus won't \n     budge on the nomination. Harkin said there's not much he can \n     do now other than fume on the floor and ponder holding up \n     Republican priorities.\n       All of this cater-wauling gives Harkin, and Iowa Democrats, \n     a huge opportunity to seize a way to criticize Republicans on \n     the selection of judges, an issue where the GOP is somewhat \n     vulnerable, particularly among women and undecided voters.\n       Texas Governor Bush does not sit in the Senate, and he is \n     not the one holding up the stop sign. But his party is doing \n     it, ostensibly for his benefit. Is it really wise to have the \n     confirmation of a woman as a judge become a major fuss in a \n     supposedly battleground state in the last month before the \n     presidential election?\n\n[[Page S9667]]\n\n       On top of that, many Iowa Democrats are still angry at how \n     Campbell was treated during her race for governor. The \n     prospect that women such as Campbell will be shut out for \n     another four years if Bush is elected president is like a \n     booster shot for get-out-the-vote efforts.\n       Harkin said Thursday that he `absolutely' would push \n     Campbell to be nominated again if Gore wins the presidency. \n     For the time being, she serves Democrats' purposes just as \n     well if she never dons black robes.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the Cedar Rapids Gazette, Sept. 26, 2000]\n\n                  Stop Stalling on Judicial Candidate\n\n       In three weeks or less, Congress will adjourn before the \n     2000 elections, and increasingly it appears it will do so \n     before the U.S. Senate brings the nomination of Bonnie \n     Campbell to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit \n     up for a vote.\n       It's not as if Campbell, the former attorney general of \n     Iowa, is trying to get in at the last minute--unless you \n     consider a six-month wait the last minute. Campbell was \n     nominated to the job by the Clinton Administration in March. \n     She had a hearing in May.\n       What's taking so long?\n       It seems apparent the Republican-controlled Senate \n     Judiciary Committee is growing content to hold onto this \n     nomination until after the session--and, not coincidentally--\n     until after the November election, when they hope to win the \n     White House. That would mean a Republican would more than \n     likely be appointed to the job.\n       It is not unusual for political parties to try to run out \n     the clock on nominations in the hope the next election will \n     bring them to power. That does not make it right, and in this \n     case it makes no sense to sit on the Campbell nomination.\n       U.S. Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, is her sponsor and he pointed \n     out a week ago there are 22 vacancies on the federal appeals \n     court. Campbell has the backing of the American Bar \n     Association and the Iowa State Police Association. She also \n     has the backing of U.S. Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, who is \n     also a member of the Judiciary Committee. Traditionally, \n     Grassley and Harkin have backed the other's nominees, and if \n     Campbell's nomination fails, we would hate to see that \n     understanding damaged.\n       Frustrated proponents of the Campbell nomination--as well \n     as several other nominations--have been arguing recently that \n     over the last three years, women and minority candidates have \n     had to wait longer to get through the confirmation process \n     than their white male counterparts.\n       The chairman of the Judiciary Committee, U.S. Sen. Orrin \n     Hatch, R-Utah, has denied women and minorities are being \n     treated differently in the committee than their white male \n     counterparts. Still, of the 21 candidates for the federal \n     bench who are women or minorities, nine have been waiting for \n     more than a year for a hearing.\n       Campbell has a lengthy record in private legal practice. \n     Elected in 1990, she was the first woman to serve as Iowa \n     Attorney General. She was appointed in 1995 to be the \n     director of the Violence Against Women Office in the U.S. \n     Justice Department. Her hearing revealed no good reason why \n     she should be denied this position.\n       The Senate leadership should do the right thing in the \n     waning days of this session and let the full Senate vote on \n     Campbell. It should set aside whatever reason it has for \n     stalling and move forward. Let the process work and bring \n     this nomination to the floor for a vote.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I see the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee on the floor. He is a good man. He and I have fought many \nbattles together. I like him personally and I respect him. If he would \nlike to engage in colloquy, I will. He knows how strongly I feel about \nthis nominee, about her qualifications and about the kind of job she \nhas done at the Department of Justice. I am sure he knows I will do \neverything that is humanly and senatorially possible to try to get her \nname here. I believe I have a right and an obligation to do that. I \nwill, within the confines of what is right and proper in the Senate, \nnot violating any rules, do everything I can to try to get her name \nout.\n  We will be here this week and we will be here next week. I ask my \nfriend from Utah, will we be allowed to have a vote on Bonnie Campbell \nfor the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I will submit a resolution, and after these \nremarks I will spend some time answering my two dear colleagues, \nSenator Robb of Virginia and Senator Harkin from Iowa, to the best of \nmy ability.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Hatch pertaining to the submission of S. Res. 364 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Submission of Concurrent and \nSenate Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I must respond to the remarks of Senator \nRobb and Senator Harkin.\n  With regard to the nomination of Roger L. Gregory, the position for \nwhich Mr. Gregory has been nominated has been vacant since it was \ncreated in 1990. Before nominating Mr. Gregory, the President had not \neven submitted a name to the Senate for this position in almost 5 \nyears. Despite the longstanding vacancy of this judgeship, the work of \nthe Fourth Circuit has not been adversely affected.\n\n  Moreover, when the President did submit a name to the Senate for \ndisposition almost 5 years ago, he submitted the name of a resident of \nNorth Carolina, J. Rich Leonard. In doing so, the President effectively \nagreed that this seat should be filled by a North Carolinian.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator's previous time \nconsumed on the Olympics will not count against his 7 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent I be able to speak for another 15 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. The President effectively agreed this seat should be \nfilled by a North Carolinian. By nominating Roger Gregory, a Virginian, \nfor the seat instead of a North Carolinian, the President sought to \navoid the traditional practice of seeking the ``advice and consent'' of \nthe Senators from the State where the judgeship is located about which \nlocal lawyer should be nominated.\n  It is very late in the session to be considering a circuit court \nnomination. Some nominations can move through the confirmation process \nquickly, but only where the White House has dealt with the Senate on \nnominations in good faith. The Arizona nominations we are debating \ntoday moved through the confirmation process quickly because the White \nHouse did work closely with Senator Kyl and negotiated in good faith \nover which Arizonans should get these lifetime appointments.\n  In contrast, the White House has not dealt with the Senate on \nnominations in good faith. During our August recess, the President \ndetermined to recess appoint several executive branch officials over \nthe express objections of numerous Senators. Furthermore, Democrats \nstood in the way of these four nominees we are debating today, the \nPresident's nominees, and they threatened to shut down the work of the \nSenate. This is hardly good faith. In fact, it was a Democrat hold--a \nDemocrat hold by the minority leader on these four judges who are put \nforth by this President in accordance with an agreement worked out--\nthat really caused a lot of angst on our side, plus the fact that these \nrecess appointments that were made without consultation caused a lot of \ndifficulty. Then we have virtually every bill filibustered, even on the \nmotion to proceed. As a matter of fact, the H-1B bill, which just \npassed 96-1, had three filibusters on it, from the motion to proceed \nright on up through final passage of 96-1.\n\n  I must respond to some of the things Senator Robb said here this \nmorning. He used some pretty incendiary language to imply that the \nSenate majority is biased against Mr. Gregory because he is an African \nAmerican. Senator Robb said we ``are standing in the courthouse door'' \nand are refusing to ``integrate'' the Fourth Circuit. These allegations \nof racial bias are beneath the dignity of a Senator in the U.S. Senate, \nand they are offensive and politically motivated. When Democrats \nblocked the nomination of Lillian BeVier to the Fourth Circuit--which \nis what they did--the first female nominee to the Fourth Circuit, no \none on our side accused them of gender bias.\n  I am sure Roger Gregory is a fine man. I have no doubt about that. I \nhave been told that by a number of friends of mine, including former \nSecretary Coleman. But I have informed my colleagues that because of \nthe atmosphere that has resulted from the President's refusal to \nconsult with the Senators from North Carolina, because of the \nPresident's recent recess appointments and disregard of commitments he \nhad made up here, and disregard of the advice and consent because of \nthe petty parliamentary games in which our friends on the other side \nhave engaged, Mr. Gregory's nomination is not going to move forward. \nAnd because this is a North Carolina seat. We would have to have \nsomebody nuts, from North Carolina, who would not stand up for a\n\n[[Page S9668]]\n\nNorth Carolinian in this seat. There is just no question about it. The \nPresident knew that, having nominated a North Carolinian before.\n  I would like to respond to Senator Levin for a few minutes. I don't \nwant to go beyond that. There are other things I could say. But I \nbitterly resent anybody trying to play racial politics with judges, \nespecially after what we went through in prior administrations.\n  It had always been my intention as chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee to hold a hearing on judicial nominations during the month of \nSeptember. I planned on doing that. At that hearing I was fully \nprepared to consider the nomination of some of these people, and \nperhaps even Helene White or Kathleen McCree Lewis to the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Sixth Circuit. A number of my colleagues were pressing \nvery strongly for that. I wanted to try to resolve that if I could.\n  However, events conspired to prevent that from happening. First, \nduring the August recess, the President determined to recess appoint \nseveral executive branch nominees over the express objection of \nnumerous Senators. He did so notwithstanding the agreement to clear \nsuch recess appointments with the relevant Senators. We do not have \nmuch power around here in some ways against a President of the United \nStates, but we can demand that he consult with us. These Senators are \nvery aggrieved by the way they were treated on these appointments--I \nthink rightly so.\n  Second, Democrat Senators determined to place holds on the four \nnominations we are debating today and threatened shutdowns of the \nSenate's committee work, going as far as to invoke the 2-hour rule and \nforcing the postponement of scheduled committee hearings, including the \nWen Ho Lee hearing, which is an important hearing, a bipartisan \nhearing, for both sides to look at.\n  Helene White and Kathleen McCree Lewis have only the White House and \nSenate Democrats to blame for the current situation, I might add, \nbecause of some of these petty procedural games we have been going \nthrough around here with filibusters of almost everything that comes \nup, or a threat to bring up all kinds of extraneous amendments if we do \nhappen to bring a bill up that needs to be passed.\n\n  It is very late in the session to be considering a circuit court \nnomination. Some nominations can move through the confirmation process \nquickly, but only where the White House has dealt with the Senate, on \nnominations, in good faith. The Arizona nominations we are debating \ntoday moved through the confirmation process quickly because the White \nHouse worked closely with Senator Kyl and others, and myself, and \nnegotiated in good faith over which Arizonans should get these lifetime \nappointments.\n  Everybody knows there is a tremendous need along the southern border \nin Arizona to have these judges. There is a tremendous court docket \nthere that needs these judges. Yet they have been delayed for 2 solid \nmonths almost.\n  In contrast, the White House and Senate Democrats have not dealt in \ngood faith, given the President's recess appointments in August of \nseveral executive branch nominees over the express objection of \nnumerous Senators and Senate Democrats' efforts to hold up these \nnominees and hold up the work of the Senate.\n  With regard to the nomination of Bonnie J. Campbell, in March, Bonnie \nCampbell was nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth \nCircuit. At the urging of Senator Grassley, the Judiciary Committee \nheld a hearing for Ms. Campbell in May. It had always been my intention \nfor the Judiciary Committee to report Ms. Campbell's nomination. \nHowever, events conspired to prevent that from happening.\n  First, during the August recess, as I have explained, the President \ndetermined to recess appoint several executive branch nominees over the \nexpress objection of numerous Senators. He did so notwithstanding his \nagreement to clear such recess appointments with the relevant Senators. \nBy the way, this type of an agreement arose out of Senator Byrd's \nobjections in earlier Congresses. His objections were followed here on \nthe part of people on our side of the aisle, and the President agreed \nto it and then violated that agreement.\n  Second, after the August recess, Democrat Senators determined to \nplace holds on the four nominations we are debating today, even though \neverybody admits--I think everybody admits --that they are important \nnominations and this arrangement that has been worked out has been \nfair.\n  Again, they threatened to shut down the Senate's committee work, \ngoing as far as to invoke the 2-hour rule and enforce the postponement \nof scheduled committee hearings. And we went through that because of \npique. For these reasons, Bonnie Campbell's nomination has stalled. Ms. \nCampbell has only the White House and Senate Democrats to blame for the \ncurrent situation.\n  I might add, it did not help at all on our side for these petty \nfilibusters on everything. It used to be when I got here, there might \nbe one or two or three filibusters a year at the very most, and then \nthey were on monumental issues that involved a wide disparity of \nbelief. It was not every little motion to proceed, every little bill we \nwere going to pass, like the one we just passed 96-1. To go through \nthree filibuster cloture votes on that bill was beyond belief. But that \nirritated a lot of people. It made it more difficult to get these \njudges through.\n  Mr. Harkin, the Senator from Iowa, claimed that his review of history \nled him to believe we are ``playing politics with the judges.'' I \nstrongly disagree. In President Reagan's last year, the Democrat-\ncontrolled Senate confirmed 41 nominees. After the votes today, the \nSenate this year will have confirmed 39 nominees. And there have been \nsome indications there might be some games played with one of the four \njudges here today. If that is the case, boy, Katie bar the door, after \nwhat we have been trying to do here.\n  The committee worked sincerely to try to get these nominations out, \nand they have been here for quite a while. Finally, few nominees are \nconfirmed when the White House and Senate are controlled by different \npolitical parties. From 1987 to 1992, the Democrat-controlled Senate \nconfirmed an average of 46 Reagan and Bush nominees per year. Things \nchanged when President Clinton was elected. In 1994, the Democrat-\ncontrolled Senate pushed through 100 Clinton nominees. They could not \nhave done that without cooperation from Republicans, but they did that.\n  In 1992, at the end of the Bush administration when Democrats \ncontrolled the Senate, the vacancy rate stood at 11.5 percent. Now at \nthe end of the Clinton administration the vacancy rate after the votes \ntoday will stand at just 7.4 percent.\n  Also in 1992, Congress adjourned without having acted on 53 Bush \nnominations, or should I say nominees who were sitting there waiting to \nbe confirmed. After the votes today, there will be only 38 Clinton \nnominations that are pending.\n  Under both Democrats and Republicans, the Senate historically \nconfirms 65 to 70 percent of the President's nominees. In his last 2 \nyears, President Bush made 176 nominations, and the Democrat-controlled \nSenate confirmed 122 of them, yielding a confirmation rate of 69 \npercent. During the last 2 years, President Clinton made 112 \nnominations, and after today's votes, the Senate will have confirmed 73 \nof them. He has a confirmation rate of almost the same, 65 percent.\n  In May, at a Judiciary Committee hearing, Senator Biden indicated he \ndid not believe we would do even 30 judges this year. He is wrong. We \nwill have now done, at the end of the day, 39 judicial nominees \nconfirmed by the Senate.\n  There has been much debate today about everything but the four \nnominees we ostensibly are debating. I fully support these nominees and \nwant to say a few words about them. They are supported by their home \nState Senators--Senators Kyl, McCain, Fitzgerald, and Durbin.\n  The nominees we are supposedly debating today are as follows: Susan \nRitchie Bolton from Arizona: Ms. Bolton has served as judge in the \nMaricopa County Superior Court since 1989. Before that, from 1977-89, \nshe worked in private practice at a Phoenix law firm. From 1975-77, she \nclerked for the Hon. Laurance T. Wren of the Arizona Court of Appeals. \nMs. Bolton received her law degree, with high distinction,\n\n[[Page S9669]]\n\nfrom the University of Iowa Law School in 1975, and her undergraduate \ndegree, with honors, from the University of Iowa in 1973.\n\n  Mary H. Murguia: Since 1998, Ms. Murguia has served in the Executive \nOffice of U.S. Attorneys, first as Counsel and then as Director. Before \nthat she served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the District of \nArizona from 1990-98. From 1985-90, she was an Assistant District \nAttorney in Wyandotte Country, Kansas. She received her law degree from \nthe University of Kansas Law School in 1985, and her undergraduate \ndegree from the University of Kansas in 1982.\n  Michael J. Reagan: Mr. Reagan has worked in private practice since \ngraduating from law school in 1980; since 1995, he has been a sole \npractitioner at the Law Office of Michael J. Reagan. In addition, he \nhas served as an Assistant Public Defender (part time) since 1995. He \nreceived his law degree from St. Louis University Law School in 1980, \nand his undergraduate degree from Bradley University in 1976.\n  James A. Teilborg: Mr. Teilborg has been a partner at the Phoenix law \nfirm of Teilborg Sanders & Parks since 1972; before that he was an \nassociate at another Phoenix firm from 1967-72. He received his law \ndegree from the University of Arizona School of Law in 1966.\n  Some have complained the Arizona nominations have moved more quickly \nwhile others have not. Some nominations can move through the \nconfirmation process quickly, there is no question about that, but only \nwhere the White House has dealt with the Senate on nominations in good \nfaith. The Arizona nominations we are debating today moved through the \nconfirmation process quickly because the White House worked closely \nwith Senator Kyl and negotiated in good faith over which Arizonans \nshould get these lifetime appointments.\n  All four are Democrats, all four are supported by the President, all \nfour came through the appropriate committee--the Judiciary Committee--\nand all four will be voted on today, and I expect all four to be \nconfirmed unanimously. If there are no politics played, they will be \nconfirmed unanimously.\n  In contrast, the White House and Senate Democrats have not dealt in \ngood faith, given the President's recess appointments in August of \nseveral executive branch nominees over the express objection of \nnumerous Senators and Senate Democrats' efforts to hold up these \nnominees and obstruct the work of the Senate--the filibusters that have \noccurred on almost everything that comes up here and, of course, the \nholds that have been placed on these four nominees who are President \nClinton's nominees. It does not take long until people on our side know \nthere are too many games being played on judicial nominees.\n  We have done a good job. President Reagan had the all-time highest \nconfirmation of judges during his 8 years. That was 382 judges. By the \nend of the day, when we confirm these 4, President Clinton will have \nthe all-time second highest, as far as I know, and that is 377 judges, \n5 fewer than President Reagan. Had we not had all these games played, I \nbelieve I could have held a hearing in September, which I no longer can \nhold, and we would have confirmed probably enough to draw President \nClinton equal to President Reagan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. HATCH. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have been scarcely able to hold back the \ntears listening to my good friend from Utah. I am sure he did not mean \nto mislead the Senate, but those who might not know the numbers could \nbe misled, not by any intent on the part of the senior Senator from \nUtah.\n  As he has said himself, we will have confirmed fewer than 40 judges \nin the last year of President Clinton's term in office. When the \nDemocrats controlled the Senate, in the last year of President Bush's \nterm in office, we confirmed 66. In fact, we were holding hearings \nright into September and voting on judges up to the last days of the \nsession, confirming judges for President Bush.\n  The distinguished Senator from Utah feels perhaps some have suggested \ninappropriately that women, minorities, and others take longer going \nthrough this body. I point out that the ones who suggested that have \nbeen independent bipartisan groups outside the Senate.\n  I have stated over and over, I have never seen or heard a statement \nexpressing--I wonder if the Senator from Utah can stay while I speak; I \ndo not want to say this with him off the floor--I have never once heard \nhim express either a racist or a sexist remark. He has been a close and \ndear friend of mine for over 20 years. Nor have I ever suggested that \nanybody on the Senate Judiciary Committee has taken a racist or sexist \nposition, but I am troubled, as I hope he and others would be troubled, \nby the fact that women and minorities, if they are nominated for \njudgeships, have taken longer to go through this Republican-controlled \nSenate than others if they are allowed to go through at all.\n  We talk about Roger Gregory, nominated to the Fourth Circuit. It has \nbeen suggested this is a seat that is reserved to North Carolina. That \nis not so. As pointed out in the Wall Street Journal in a recent letter \nfrom the President's Counsel Beth Nolan, this is a vacant seat that has \nnot been allocated to the State of North Carolina and is appropriate \nfor an appointment from Virginia. The distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee has said that Senators should work with the White House. In \nthis case, two of the most distinguished Members of the Senate--one a \nRepublican, one a Democrat, John Warner and Chuck Robb--worked very \nclosely with the White House on this Virginia nomination and both \nsupport the nomination of Roger Gregory.\n  Senator Robb strongly urged the White House to appoint Roger Gregory, \na highly distinguished African American. Senator Warner supports him. \nHe has the highest ratings possible from bar associations. But he \ncannot get confirmed by the Senate; he cannot even get a hearing.\n  I commend what Senator Robb said on the floor today in support of \nRoger Gregory. I hope all of us will listen to him.\n  Likewise, I was struck by the remarks of Senator Durbin of Illinois \nwith respect to the Supreme Court and his support for Michael Reagan to \na district court judgeship in Illinois. Senator Durbin laid out what I \nhave also heard from Republicans and Democrats who support Michael \nReagan for that judgeship. Democrats and Republicans were at hearings \nfor him. Democrats and Republicans, ranging across the political \nspectrum, have spoken to me in support of Michael Reagan. He is \nsupported by both home state Senators, one a Republican and one a \nDemocrat.\n  Senator Carl Levin, the distinguished senior Senator from Michigan, \none of the most respected voices in this body, spoke of his support for \nJudge Helene White to the Sixth Circuit and Kathleen McCree Lewis to \nthe Sixth Circuit and how he wished they would be considered. They have \nbeen held up and blocked by this Senate. Is the chairman saying that \nJudge Helene White and Kathleen McCree Lewis do not have the support of \ntheir two Senators from Michigan? If that is the case, we ought to know \nthat. I understand that they both have that support. If they don't have \nthe support of a home state Senator, then let's say that. Judge Helene \nWhite and Kathleen McCree Lewis are extraordinarily well-qualified \nwomen. I wish they would get confirmed.\n  Senator Tom Harkin, was an extraordinary advocate for Bonnie \nCampbell. I can't add to what he has said. Senator Harkin spoke \nextremely well about Bonnie Campbell and, of course, Bonnie Campbell \nshould be confirmed. Again, going to the test: Did the President work \nwith the Senators from that State. Are we saying that the two Senators \nfrom Iowa do not support Bonnie Campbell? My understanding is both of \nthem support her. Why can't she get Committee consideration and a \nSenate vote?\n  The Senate will move forward on a number of nominees today: Michael \nReagan, Susan Ritchie Bolton, Mary Helen Murguia, and James Teilborg. I \nrecommend that all four be confirmed by the Senate. It is unfortunate \nthat this Republican-controlled Senate, is not willing to do for \nPresident Bill\n\n[[Page S9670]]\n\nClinton what a Democratic-controlled Senate did for President George \nBush, and move people forward. We can talk about the numbers that \nvarious Presidents have appointed. Recent Presidents have appointed \nmore judges than George Washington did or Thomas Jefferson or Abraham \nLincoln or Teddy Roosevelt. But we are also a much bigger country, and \nwe have a lot more cases and need more judges. In fact, if we passed \nthe judgeship bill the distinguished senior Senator from Utah and I \nhave introduced, the vacancy rate would be well into the teens with \nover 130 vacancies.\n  We have waited 10 years to authorize new judges, even as this country \nhas expanded over the years and caseloads have grown. The Judicial \nConference is asking us to authorize 70 judges. In fact, I strongly \nurge we pass the judgeship bill before the Presidential election while \nno one knows who is going to be elected President, and we are looking \nat what is best for our court system.\n  I am glad to see the Senate moving forward on these three nominees. I \nexpect they will be approved overwhelmingly. They are all well \nqualified for appointment to the federal courts.\n  Three judicial nominees on the Senate calendar have been cleared by \nDemocrats for action for some time, including two from Arizona and one \nfrom Illinois who has been pending the longest of the four.\n  There were Senators who wanted to be heard and have a chance to \ndebate the lack of hearings and the refusal to give hearings to \nqualified nominees. They have spoken eloquently on behalf of Roger \nGregory, Bonnie Campbell and Judge Helene White. They are not seeking \nto filibuster these nominations and each has agreed to a reasonable \ntime for debate before a vote.\n  The Senator from Arizona is right that there has been a problem with \nthe nomination of James Teilborg, who happens to be a close personal \nfriend of the Senator since their days together back at the University \nof Arizona Law School. Mr. Teilborg was nominated on July 21 and was \nafforded a hearing and was reported by the Judiciary Committee within a \nweek.\n\n  The frustration that many Senators feel with the lack of attention \nthe Committee has shown long-pending judicial nominees has recently \nboiled over. They wish to be heard; they seek parity and similar \ntreatment for nominees they support. I understand their frustration and \nhave been urging action for some time. This could all have been easily \navoided if we were continuing to move judicial nominations like \nDemocrats did in 1992, when we held hearings in September and confirmed \n66 judges that presidential election year.\n  Michael Reagan, nominated to be a District Court Judge for the \nSouthern District of Illinois, is a distinguished private attorney in \nBelleville, Illinois. He graduated from Bradley University in 1976, and \nSt. Louis University Law School in 1980. He has been in private \npractice for over 20 years, and has been an adjunct professor of law at \nBelleville Area College and St. Louis University. He also presently \nserves as an Assistant Public Defender in St. Clair County, Illinois. \nHe enjoys the support of both of his home state Senators. When other \nnominees to the Illinois federal courts were given hearings and \nconfirmed in June, he was held back. He had likewise been nominated in \nearly May. He was finally included in a hearing in late July and \nreported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee on July 27. He could \nhave been confirmed before the August recess or at any time in \nSeptember. I am glad that time has finally come.\n  Judge Susan Ritchie Bolton has presided in the Arizona Superior Court \nfor Maricopa County since 1989. She received her undergraduate degree \nand law degree from the University of Iowa. Following law school she \nclerked for the Honorable Laurence T. Wren on the Arizona Court of \nAppeals. She then went into private practice at Shimmel, Hill, Bishop & \nBruender. She enjoys the support of both of her home state Senators and \nreceived a well-qualified rating from the American Bar Association. She \nwas nominated on July 21, participated in a confirmation hearing on \nJuly 25 and was unanimously reported by the Judiciary committee on July \n27. She could have been confirmed before the August recess or at any \ntime in September. I am glad the Senate is turning its attention to her \nnomination and am confident that she will be confirmed to fill the \njudicial emergency vacancy for which she was nominated.\n  Mary Murguia currently serves as Director of the Executive Office for \nU.S. Attorneys. She also serves as an Assistant U.S. Attorney for the \nDistrict of Arizona. Prior to that, she served as an Assistant District \nAttorney for the Wyandotte County District Attorney's Office. She \nearned her undergraduate and law degrees from the University of Kansas. \nShe enjoys the full support of both of her home state Senators. Like \nJudge Bolton, she was nominated on July 21, received a hearing on July \n25 and was unanimously reported by the Judiciary Committee on July 27. \nShe could have been confirmed before the August recess or at any time \nin September. I know that the Senate will now do the right thing and \nconfirm her to fill the judicial emergency vacancy for which she was \nnominated.\n\n  I thank the Majority Leader and commend the Democratic Leader for \nscheduling the consideration of these judicial nominations. I wish \nthere were many more being considered to fill the 67 current vacancies \nand eight on the horizon. I wish that we were making progress on the \nHatch-Leahy Federal Judgeship Act of 2000, S. 3071, and authorizing the \n70 judgeships affected by that legislation as requested by the Judicial \nConference.\n  I heard Senator Hatch argue last week that the vacancies on the \nfederal judiciary are ``less than zero''. While I marvel at the \naudacity of such argument, it moves us no closing to fulfilling our \nconstitutional responsibilities to the federal judiciary. Likewise the \nnotion that the refusal by some to waive the Senate's 2-hour rule in \nlate September somehow preventing the Committee from holding additional \nconfirmation hearings in early September or now is hardly compelling. I \nwish the Committee and the Senate would have followed the model \nestablished in 1992 and continued holding hearings and reporting \njudicial nominees in August and September. That simply did not happen \nand despite my requests no additional hearings were held. This year we \nheld about half as many hearings as in 1992. Despite all of our efforts \nwe have been unable to get the Judiciary Committee to consider the \nnominations of Bonnie Campbell or Allen Snyder or Fred Woocher \nfollowing their hearings.\n  The debate on judicial nominations over the last several years has \nincluded too much delay with respect to too many nominations. The most \nprominent current examples of that treatment are Judge Helene White, \nBonnie Campbell, Roger Gregory, and Enrique Moreno. With respect to \nthese nominations, the Senate has for too long refused to do its \nconstitutional duty and vote. Nominees deserve to be treated with \ndignity and dispatch--not delayed for two or three or four years. The \nnomination of Judge White has now been pending for over four years, the \nlongest pending nomination without a hearing in Senate history.\n  Of course it is every Senator's right to vote as he or she sees fit \non all matters. But I would hope that in the cases of these long-\npending nominations, those who have opposed them will show them the \ncourtesy of using this time to discuss with us any concerns they may \nhave and to explain the basis for their anonymous holds and the \nSenate's refusals to act.\n  It was only a couple of years ago when the Chief Justice of the \nUnited States chastised this Senate for refusing to vote up or down on \njudicial nominations after a reasonable period for review.\n  This Senate continues to reject his wisdom and, in my view, our duty.\n  It is my hope the Senate will confirm all four district court \nnominees on the Senate calendar. I know there are Senators who want a \nchance to debate the lack of hearings and the refusal to give hearings \nto qualified nominees. I understand that frustration, and it is \njustifiable, especially as it is not the way the Democrats acted when \nthey controlled the Senate with a Republican President.\n  The nominee from Illinois should have been confirmed some time ago. \nThe nominees from Arizona have zipped through here faster than the \nRepublican leadership has allowed most\n\n[[Page S9671]]\n\njudges to go through. When Senators supporting nominations, received \nmonths and years before, see newer nominees zip through, they are, of \ncourse, frustrated.\n\n  The Judiciary Committee has reported only three nominees to the court \nof appeals all year. We have held hearings without even including a \nnominee to the court of appeals. We have denied a committee vote to two \noutstanding nominees who have succeeded in getting hearings; namely, \nBonnie Campbell and Allen Snyder. You have to understand the \nfrustration of Senators and those outside the Senate who know that \nRoger Gregory and Helene White and Bonnie Campbell and Kathleen McCree \nLewis and others should have been considered by the Judiciary Committee \nand voted on by the Senate.\n  On September 14, Senators Barbara Mikulski, Barbara Boxer, Blanche \nLincoln, Tom Harkin, and Carl Levin and Representative Carolyn Maloney \nfrom the other body, highlighted the Senate's failure to act on \njudicial nominations to the Federal bench. They called on the Senate \nleadership to consider qualified women before the Congress adjourned. \nThey also discussed the problems of judicial emergencies, the length of \ntime it takes women and people of color to be confirmed, and how the \nFederal courts do not currently reflect the diversity of our country. I \ndo not recall them or anybody else ascribing motives to those who are \nholding up these people. Rather, they were saying in a diverse country \nsuch as ours, the Federal court should reflect the diversity of our \ncountry.\n  They focused on the following women who have been waiting more than \n60 days for confirmation: Helene White, U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nSixth Circuit, has been pending more than 1,360 days; Kathleen McCree \nLewis, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, has been pending \nmore than 370 days; Bonnie Campbell, U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nEighth Circuit, has been pending more than 215 days; Elena Kagen, U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia, has been pending for \nmore than 480 days; Lynette Norton, U.S. District Court for the Western \nDistrict of Pennsylvania, has been pending more than 890 days; Patricia \nCoan, U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado, has been \npending more than 500 days; Dolly Gee, U.S. District Court for the \nCentral District of California, has been pending more than 495 days; \nRhonda Fields, U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, has \nbeen pending more than 325 days; and Linda Riegle, U.S. District Court \nfor the District of Nevada, has been pending more than 165 days. That \nis why these Senators and this Member of Congress made the statement we \ndid.\n  Mr. President, am I correct in understanding that under the previous \norder, we are to recess at 12:30?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

TEILBORG, OF ARIZONA, TO BE UNITED STATES \n               DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF ARIZONA\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of James A. \nTeilborg, of Arizona, to be U.S. District Judge for the District of \nArizona.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I understand that under the prior unanimous \nconsent agreement the distinguished Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch; the \nSenator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl; and I each have 1 hour for the Teilborg \nnomination, and the distinguished Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, has up \nto 3 hours, unless time is yielded back, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to \nyield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from North Carolina, Mr. \nEdwards, without losing my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I am pleased that today we are discussing \nsome of the vacancies that exist in the Federal judiciary. There was a \ndiscussion this morning about an issue that is near and dear to my \nheart and important to the folks in North Carolina, which is the \nvacancies on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\n  Senator Robb came down and discussed Judge Gregory's nomination. \nChairman Hatch responded. I would like to say a few words about that \ndiscussion.\n  There are 15 authorized judgeships on the Fourth Circuit Court of \nAppeals. There are presently only 10 active judges on that court. By \ntradition, my State of North Carolina, which is the largest, most \npopulous State in the Fourth Circuit, is allocated three of those \njudgeships. Out of those 10 judgeships --presently active judges on the \nFourth Circuit--how many come from North Carolina? None.\n  We are the only State in the nation that is not represented on a \nFederal circuit court, along with Hawaii. We are the largest State in \nthe circuit. We have the largest population in the circuit, and we \ndon't have a judge representing our State on this court. That has been \ntrue since Judge Ervin died in 1999.\n  The people of North Carolina, who have cases regularly heard in the \nFourth Circuit, have no one there representing them. In addition, to \nthe extent the court is regularly interpreting matters of North \nCarolina law, which it is required to do in diversity cases, there is \nno judge in this court who is trained in North Carolina law. Now, this \nCongress recognized some time ago how important it was for States to be \nrepresented on their circuit courts of appeal by enacting a law--in \nfact, requiring that States have a judge on their Federal circuit court \nof appeals. We have none. As I indicated before, along with Hawaii, we \nare the only two States in the country that are not represented on our \ncircuit court of appeals.\n  Now, Chairman Hatch had some discussion this morning about Judge \nGregory and his nomination to the Fourth Circuit in the State of \nVirginia, and the fact that that was a slot traditionally allocated to \nmy State of North Carolina.\n  My question to Chairman Hatch is: What are we doing about the \nnomination of Judge Wynn? Judge Wynn is a very well-respected, very \nmoderate, centrist jurist from North Carolina, who has been nominated \nfor over a year from my State to fill a vacancy that is traditionally \nallocated to North Carolina. There is no question that Judge Wynn would \nbe approved by this\n\n[[Page S9672]]\n\nbody if he ever got a hearing and a vote on the floor.\n  Unfortunately, that has not happened. It is easy to understand why \nthe Clinton administration believed they needed to take some action. \nThat action has turned out to be to nominate Judge Gregory. I have to \nadmit it was somewhat frustrating to me, representing North Carolina, \nto have Judge Gregory nominated for the slot he was nominated for \nbecause it was traditionally allocated to North Carolina. But, I do \nsupport Judge Gregory's nomination.\n  In addition to having no judge from North Carolina being on the \nFourth Circuit Court of Appeals, our court does not presently have, nor \nhas it ever had, an African American judge. The Fourth Circuit Court of \nAppeals has the largest African American population in the country and \ndoes not now have, nor has it ever had, an African American judge. \nObviously, there is a huge part of our population in the Fourth Circuit \nthat has never been represented on this court. They are entitled to \nrepresentation by a well-qualified judge.\n  In fact, Judge Wynn who was nominated over a year ago--from my State \nthat has no judge on the Fourth Circuit--is also an African American \njudge. I urge Chairman Hatch to grant Judge Wynn a hearing and to push \nforward his vote on the floor of this Senate where he will be approved.\n  The bottom line is that Judge Gregory is a well-respected and well-\nqualified African American lawyer from the State of Virginia who also \ndeserves a hearing, and also deserves a vote in this body this year.\n  The argument that is made--and Chairman Hatch made it this morning--\nis we only need 10 judges on the Fourth Circuit, we don't really need \nthe 15 that Congress in fact has authorized. The reason is that the \nchief judge of that circuit, Judge Wilkinson, says they do not need any \nmore judges, they are operating perfectly efficiently.\n  I point out several things.\n  No. 1, the Fourth Circuit issues more one-sentence opinions than any \nFederal circuit court in the country. Litigants come before it and make \ntheir case. Instead of getting a reasoned decision about why they won \nor lost their case, they get one sentence. What does that tell them \nabout how much attention in fact is being paid to their case?\n  This same argument was made when there were 13 judges on the court. \nNow we are down to l0.\n  Since when do we let the chief judge of the circuit court decide how \nmany judges go on the court? That is a function we in Congress have \nresponsibility for--not him.\n  You can certainly make an argument that this is a partisan decision \nthat the chief judge has made--that he likes the present composition of \nthe court. He was a Republican-nominated judge.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I ask unanimous consent for another 3 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield another 3 minutes without losing my \nright to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, here we have the chief judge, who is a \nRepublican-nominated judge, and a court that now has a majority of \nRepublican judges. You can certainly make the argument that he likes \nthe composition of the court the way it is; he never wants that to be \nchanged.\n  That is so fundamentally wrong and so fundamentally different from \nthe way our Constitution provides. We should be nominating judges. \nWhether it is a Democratic or a Republican administration, it shouldn't \nmake any difference in nominating well-qualified judges. This body \nshould act on the qualification of those men and women to serve on the \ncourt, not based upon the Republican or Democratic composition of the \ncourt. It is just that simple. This should be totally nonpartisan.\n  My State has no one representing them on the Fourth Circuit. There is \nnot, nor has there ever been, an African American judge on this court.\n  The simple bottom line is that we have the responsibility of deciding \nhow many judges should be authorized for that court. We have made that \ndecision--15. It is now down to 10. Of those 10, North Carolina has \nnone. The people of North Carolina are entitled to be represented on \nthis court.\n\n  In addition to that, we should deal with the issue that there has \nnever been an African American judge on this court.\n  We presently have pending the nomination of two well-respected and \nvery well qualified African American jurists.\n  This is what I would say to the Chairman Hatch. Let us have a hearing \non Judge Wynn. Let Judge Wynn have a vote on the floor of this Senate, \nand let the people of North Carolina have what, by law enacted by this \nbody, they are entitled to, which is a judge representing them on their \nFederal court of appeals so that when my people go to the Fourth \nCircuit Court of Appeals to have their case heard, they have at least \none judge representing them on that court. Aren't they entitled to \nthat?\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished Senator from \nNorth Carolina for his comments. Senator Edwards has been a friend \nsince he came to this body. I have, at the risk of embarrassing him, \nstated on a number of occasions on this floor that the Senate was \nenhanced by his presence here. As a lawyer, I must say that having him \nhere because of his own experience as one of the most outstanding and \nmost recognized trial lawyers in the country, to say nothing about his \nown State. I think Senators on both sides of the aisle should listen to \nwhat he said.\n  He is not a Senator who speaks in the abstract and who simply reads a \nstatement on this. This is a Senator who has spent time in the courts \nof his State and of the region. He has had active practice in both \nState courts and Federal courts. He understands the judicial system.\n  He has argued cases at all levels. He has worked with lawyers who \nhave been on his side of an issue and opposed to him. He knows, as does \nany lawyer who practices law, that no matter how much you might try a \ncase at the trial level, at some point, especially if the stakes are \nhigh, that case is going to go up on appeal. It is going to go up on \nappeal whether you are the plaintiff or the defendant. Whoever loses \nthat case, if it is of significance, will take it up on appeal.\n  I recall the statements made in court when I was trying cases. The \njudge in chambers would say: OK, we will take it to the jury and let \njustice be done. Usually the person who had the weaker case said: If \nthat is the case, I will appeal, if justice is done.\n  But the fact of matter is cases become more and more complex and more \nand more significant to the litigants and to the issues of law. They go \nup on appeal, and you ought to have a good appellate court.\n  I commend the Senator for what he has said. I hope we will listen to \nwhat is needed in that appellate court.\n  We should also note, I suggest, that there is going to be a \nsignificant debate tonight in Boston between the two candidates of our \ntwo great parties--the Republican and Democratic Parties. Both parties \nhave nominated those we consider to be our best choices. Obviously, I \nstrongly support my friend of over 20 years, Al Gore. But I also know \nthat the Republican Party has nominated a very distinguished Governor, \nGeorge W. Bush.\n  I mention this because Governor Bush and I, while we disagree on some \nissues, have one very significant issue on which we agree. He gave a \nspeech awhile back and criticized what has happened in the Senate where \nconfirmations are held up not because somebody votes down a nominee but \nbecause they cannot ever get a vote. Governor Bush said: You have the \nnominee. Hold the hearing. Then, within 60 days, vote them up or vote \nthem down. Don't leave them in limbo.\n  Frankly, that is what we are paid to do in this body. We are paid to \nvote either yes or no--not vote maybe.\n  When we hold a nominee up by not allowing them a vote and not taking \nany action one way or the other, we are not only voting ``maybe'' but \nwe are doing a terrible disservice to the man or woman to whom we do \nthis. They have to put their life on hold. They do not know what is \ngoing to happen: Are they going to be confirmed, or not? It is not like \nwhen any one of us runs for election; we know that on a certain\n\n[[Page S9673]]\n\nday the election occurs. We either win or we lose. But we know that on \nthat Tuesday, we are going to know our fate. We won or we lost.\n\n  These people come here and they never know what may happen. They \ndon't know whether they will have a hearing. And if they have a \nhearing, they don't know if there will be a vote in committee. And if \nthere is a vote in committee, they don't know whether they will come on \nthe floor. And if they come on the floor, they don't know if they will \nhave a vote because one person hiding in the Cloakroom will say: Don't \nallow it to come to a vote yet. So they may have 99 Senators voting for \nthem but somebody mysteriously in the background says ``Don't vote,'' \nand they don't vote.\n  Helene White of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has \nbeen pending for 1,360 days. Governor Bush said we ought to have a vote \nup or down within 60 days. Let's have a vote on Helene White. She has \nbeen waiting not 60 days, not 600 days, but 1,360 days.\n  Kathleen McCree Lewis, who has been nominated for the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Sixth Circuit, an outstanding African American woman, \nwho has one of highest ratings of anybody we have ever seen come before \nthe Senate, has been waiting for 370 days. Not the 60 days we talked \nabout, but more than six times the 60 days. Bonnie Campbell, for the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, has been spending for \nmore than 215 days.\n  We are debating bringing up the Violence Against Women Act which has \nbeen stalled. The Violence Against Women Act has expired. Distinguished \nSenators on both sides of the aisle are working to bring it up and we \ncannot bring it up for a vote.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Delaware and the distinguished \nSenator from Kansas, both of whom support it on the floor, and we \ncannot get that up for a vote.\n  We also can't get Bonnie Campbell up, even though she is the Director \nof the Violence Against Women Office. She supported, worked for and \nadministered the Violence Against Women Act, an act that has seen a \ndramatic decrease in violence against women.\n  We ought to be standing and applauding Ms. Campbell. She is somebody \nwho shows by her own experience that she can do the things necessary to \nbring down this scourge of violence against women in our country. Now \nthat she has gone through the vetting process, and found out that she \nis one of the most qualified people to be a judge of anyone confirmed \nin the last 20 years, Republican or Democrat, we ought to at least let \nher have a vote instead of holding her in limbo.\n  Elena Kagan for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia has been pending for more than 480 days without a vote; \nLynette Norton, for the U.S. District Court for the Western District of \nPennsylvania, has been pending for more than 890 days; Patricia Coan, \nfor the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado, has been \npending for more than 500 days; Dolly Gee, for the U.S. District Court \nfor the Central District of California has been pending for more than \n495 days; Rhonda C. Fields, for the U.S. District Court for the \nDistrict of Columbia, has been pending for 325 days; Linda Riegle, for \nthe U.S. District Court of Nevada, has been pending for more than 165 \ndays.\n  Let them have a vote. These women are outstanding. They \nhave demonstrated more than most people who get confirmed in this body, \nRepublican or Democrat, how well qualified they are. At least let them \nhave a vote. If people want to vote against them, vote against them.\n\n  I will state for the record that I will vote for every one of them. \nIn checking with our side of the aisle, every single Democrat Senator \nwill vote for every one of these women.\n  President Clinton, in remarks before the Michigan Bar Association, \nrecently spoke about the Senate's failure to act upon his judicial \nnominees, noting his nominees have received more top American Bar \nAssociation ratings than those of any President in 40 years. President \nClinton, to his credit, has nominated people who have received higher \nratings than any President, Democrat or Republican, in 40 years and \nthey still get held up. He said:\n\n       These people are highly qualified, which leads to only one \n     conclusion, that the appointments process has been \n     politicized in the hope of getting appointees ultimately to \n     the bench who will be more political. That is wrong. It is a \n     denial of justice.\n\n  President Clinton is right. We should move forward with these \nnominees. Let them have a vote. Don't do this in the dark of the night \nholding people up.\n  We are going to have four nominees, three from Arizona which has a \ndesperate situation, where they need Federal judges. My friend from \nArizona, Senator Kyl, has pointed out, quite rightly, that cases cannot \nbe heard, several cases cannot be heard. He has had experiences as a \ncivil lawyer. He knows how difficult that is.\n  I say as a former prosecutor, when that happens, the criminal cases \ncan't be heard because you don't have enough people on the bench. When \nthat happens, the prosecutor has to start plea bargaining down. He or \nshe has to either get a lighter sentence or has to start dropping \ncharges all over the place because they know they can't get a trial \nbecause the judges aren't there.\n  If we are going to be tough on law and order, we have to have the \njudges there. We cannot just say we are against crime. I am willing to \nconcede that all 100 of us are against crime. But if we are going to \nfight crime, we have to have the men and women there to do it: the \nprosecutors, the defense attorneys, and the judges.\n  If we will move those judges through, I will vote for every one of \nthem. But I also point out that they can move through very rapidly, all \nthe judges from the time they were nominated, to the hearings, to the \nfloor. A lot of the other judges discussed today are judicial nominees \nwho have waited and waited and waited and waited and cannot get a vote.\n  It is not too late in the session to move on these nominations. We \nknow that we can make quick progress when we want to do so. The group \nof nominees being considered tonight include nominations received on a \nFriday, who had a hearing the next Wednesday and were reported that \nThursday, all within a week. In addition, there is the example of a \nhearing held last month by the Government Affairs Committee on two \nDistrict of Columbia Superior Court judges, one who was nominated on \nMay 1 and the other who was nominated on June 26. Another example of \nthe ability of the Senate to act is the September 8 confirmation of \nJames E. Baker to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. In \naddition, there is the examples of Timothy Lewis who was confirmed in \nwaning days of the 1992 session, the last year of a Republican \npresidential term with a Democratic majority in the Senate. Judge Lewis \nwas confirmed to the Third Circuit on October 8, having only been \nnominated on September 17 of that year.\n\n  Of course, the Republican candidate for the presidency has said that \nnominations should be acted upon within 60 days. Of the 42 judicial \nnominations currently pending, 37 have been pending from 60 days to 4 \nyears without final action.\n  Let us compare the lack of action this year to what a Democratic \nmajority in the Senate accomplished in 1992 during the last year of a \nRepublican presidential term. The Senate confirmed 11 Court of Appeals \nnominees during that Republican President's last year in office and a \ntotal of 66 judges for that year. This year the Senate is will not \nreach anywhere near 66 confirmations, not 60, not 50, not even 40. In \n1992, the Committee held 15 hearings--twice as many as this Committee \nhas found time to hold this year. In the last 10 weeks of the 1992 \nsession, the Committee held four hearings and all of the nominees who \nhad hearings then were confirmed before adjournment. In the last 10 \nweeks of the 1992 session, we confirmed 32 judicial nominations. In the \nlast 10 weeks of this year we will be holding no hearings and \nconfirming only four District Court nominees.\n  We still have pending without a hearing qualified nominees like Judge \nHelene White of Michigan. She has been held hostage for over 45 months \nwithout a hearing. She is the record holder for a judicial nominee who \nhas had to wait the longest for a hearing and her wait continues \nwithout explanation to this day.\n  We still have pending before the Committee, the nomination of Bonnie \nCampbell to the Eighth Circuit. Ms Campbell had her hearing last May, \nbut\n\n[[Page S9674]]\n\nthe Committee refuses to consider her nomination, vote her up or vote \nher down. Instead, there is the equivalent of an anonymous and \nunexplained secret hold. Bonnie Campbell is a distinguished lawyer, \npublic servant and law enforcement officer. She was the Attorney \nGeneral for the State of Iowa and the Director of the Violence Against \nWomen Office at the United States Department of Justice. And she enjoys \nthe support of both of her home State Senators, Senator Harkin and \nSenator Grassley. I understand and share Senator Harkin's frustration \nand believe that the Senate's failure to act on this highly qualified \nnominee is without justification.\n  We still have pending without a hearing the nomination of Roger \nGregory of Virginia and Judge James Wynn of North Carolina to the \nFourth Circuit. Were either of these highly-qualified jurists confirmed \nby the Senate, we would be finally acting to allow a qualified African \nAmerican to sit on that Court for the first time. Fifty years has \npassed since the confirmation of Judge Hastie to the Third Circuit and \nstill there has never been an African-American on the Fourth Circuit in \nthe history of that Circuit. The nomination of Judge James A. Beatty, \nJr., was previously sent to us by President Clinton in 1995. That \nnomination was never considered by the Senate Judiciary Committee or \nthe Senate and was returned to President Clinton without action at the \nend of 1998. It is time for the Senate to act on a qualified African-\nAmerican nominee to the Fourth Circuit. It is also time for the Senate \nto act on the nomination of Kathleen McCree Lewis to be the first \nAfrican American woman to serve on the Sixth Circuit. President Clinton \nspoke powerfully about these matters at the NAACP Convention. We should \nrespond not be misunderstanding or mischaracterizing what he said but, \ninstead, by taking action on these well-qualified nominees.\n\n  I commend Senators Robb and Warner, along with Representatives Bobby \nScott and Jim Clyburn, for speaking out last Wednesday to draw \nattention to the Senate's failure to act upon the nomination of Roger \nGregory to fill an emergency vacancy in the Fourth Circuit. As Senator \nRobb pointed out, Mr. Gregory has been nominated to fill a vacancy that \nhas existed on the Fourth Circuit for 10 years. While the Court is \nauthorized to have 15 judges, it is operating with only 10 judges \ntoday. That means the Court has one-third of its positions vacant. Beth \nNolan, the Counsel to the President, recently wrote in the Wall Street \nJournal:\n\n       [T]he seat for which Mr. Gregory was nominated has not been \n     filed before, nor allocated to any particular state in the \n     Fourth Circuit. Moreover, Roger Gregory has the strong \n     support of both of his home-state senators (who were indeed \n     consulted prior to nomination). Democratic Sen. Chuck Robb \n     recommended Mr. Gregory to the president and has been working \n     tirelessly on Mr. Gregory's behalf. Republican Sen. John \n     Warner has joined Sen. Robb in requesting that Sen. Hatch \n     give Mr. Gregory a hearing.\n\n  It is past time for the Judiciary Committee to consider Mr. Gregory's \nnomination.\n  We still have pending before the Committee the nomination of Enrique \nMoreno to the Fifth Circuit. He is the latest in a succession of \noutstanding Hispanic nominees by President Clinton to that Court, but \nhe too is not being considered by the Committee or the Senate. Mr. \nMoreno succeeded to the nomination of Jorge Rangel on which the Senate \nrefused to act last Congress. These are well-qualified nominees who \nwill add to the capabilities and diversity of those courts. In fact, \nthe Chief Judge of the Fifth Circuit declared that a judicial emergency \nexists on that court, caused by the number of judicial vacancies, the \nlack of Senate action on pending nominations, and the overwhelming \nworkload.\n  I remain vigilant regarding the Senate's treatment of nominees who \nare women or minorities. I have said that I do not regard the Chairman \nas a biased person. I have also been outspoken in my concern about the \nmanner in which we are failing to consider qualified minority and women \nnominees over the last several years. From Margaret Morrow, Margaret \nMcKeown and Sonia Sotomayor, through Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon, \nand including Judge James Beatty, Jr., Judge James Wynn, Roger Gregory, \nEnrique Moreno and all the other qualified women and minority nominees \nwho have been delayed and opposed over the last several years, I have \nspoken out.\n  The Senate will never remove the blot that occurred last October when \nthe Republican Senators emerged from a Republican Caucus to vote \nlockstep against Justice Ronnie White to be a Federal District Court \nJudge in Missouri. At a Missouri Bar Association forum last week, \nJustice White expressed concern that the rejection of his nominations \nto a federal judgeship will have a ``chilling effect'' on the desire of \nyoung African American lawyers to seek to enter the judiciary. The \nSenate took the wrong action last October when the Republican caucus \nrejected Justice White's nomination.\n\n  At our last Executive Business Session in the Judiciary Committee, \nthe Chairman used some of Senator Biden's remarks from a nominations \nhearing last November to make the point that he is neither racist nor \nsexist. And I agree. I do not believe that the Chairman is himself for \nor against a particular nominee based purely on race or gender, though \nI do understand that the Committee does keep track of such numbers for \nstatistical purposes. But to paraphrase our former Chairman from later \non in that Executive Business Session, it would be better for the \ncurrent Chairman to explain to those of us on this side of the aisle \nand the public at large why he is not moving on particular nominations. \nI understand there may be outstanding FBI investigations that he is not \nat liberty to discuss, but I do not believe any such impediments exist \nthat would prevent the Chairman from telling us why Helene White, Roger \nGregory, and Enrique Moreno have not yet had a hearing.\n  There continue to be multiple vacancies on the Third, Fourth, Fifth, \nSixth, Ninth, Tenth and District of Columbia Circuits. With 23 current \nvacancies, our appellate courts have nearly half of the total judicial \nemergency vacancies in the federal court system. I note that the \nvacancy rate for our Courts of Appeals is more than 11 percent \nnationwide. If we were to take into account the additional appellate \njudgeships included in the Hatch-Leahy Federal Judgeship Act of 2000, a \nbill that was requested by the Judicial Conference to handle their \nincreased workloads, the vacancy rate would be 16 percent.\n  Also at our last executive business session, my friend from Utah, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said there is and \nhas been no judicial vacancy crisis. That is a bold statement \nconsidering there are 67 current vacancies in courts and emergency \nsituations, including the Fifth Circuit. If we pass the bill that has \nbeen requested by the nonpartisan judicial conference, we would have \nanother 7 or more judicial vacancies, so we would have over 150 \njudicial vacancies.\n  The chairman went on to say that since 363 senior judges are now \nserving in the Federal judiciary the true number of vacancies is ``less \nthan zero.'' While it is true that there are 363 senior judges now \nserving, it is inaccurate to say that the true number of vacancies is \nless than zero.\n  I commend the large number of senior judges for coming in to help out \nand fill in. Some of them are well into their eighties. But that is not \nthe way it should be. Surely, if we didn't have these senior judges, \nthe courts would collapse under the weight of their own caseloads and \nthe extended and extensive vacancies.\n  What we have is a situation where selfless public servants have made \na conscious decision to hold off on the rewards of retiring from a job \nwell done to help administer fair and proper justice in our country. \nOur senior judges should be thanked for their diligent work and \ndedication. Still, their service does not mean we have fewer vacancies. \nIndeed, the Judicial Conference has recommended 70 new judgeships in \naddition to the already existing 67 vacancies.\n  Let's not say the only way that can happen is if people, no matter \nhow old they are, say: I will never retire; I will just keep on showing \nup and do the best I can. It is the lifeblood of our judiciary to have \nnew judges come in.\n  I regret that the last confirmation hearing for Federal judges held \nby the Judiciary Committee was in July. In fact, that was the last time \nthe Judiciary Committee reported any nominees to the full Senate. \nThroughout August,\n\n[[Page S9675]]\n\nSeptember, and now the first week in October, there have been no \nadditional hearings held, or even noticed; no executive business \nmeetings have included any judicial nominees on the agenda.\n  I mention that because in 1992, the last year of the Bush \nadministration, we had a Republican President and a Democratic majority \nin the Senate. We held three confirmation hearings in August and \nSeptember. We continued to work to confirm judges.\n  How late did we work, even though we have the so-called Thurmond rule \nwhich cuts off judicial nominations after about midyear? Do you know \nhow long the Democrat-controlled Senate was confirming judges for a \nRepublican President? Up to and including the very last day of the \nsession; not up to and including 6 months before the session ended.\n\n  I know there is some frustration. Some Senators have objected to \nSenate committees continuing to meet on other matters while the Senate \nis in session. That is partly because the matter is so acute with \nregard to the numerous vacancies in our court of appeals and the \nqualified women and men who have been nominated and stalled.\n  The chairman says, and he holds the banner for his party, that \nDemocrats have no grounds to complain. I remind the Senate of the hoops \nthat Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon had to jump through in order to get \na vote, including the extraordinary step of overcoming a motion to \npostpone indefinitely the vote on Marsha Berzon.\n  So I hope we will continue to meet our responsibility to all \nnominees--men, women, and minorities. As long as the Senate is in \nsession, I am going to urge action. Highly qualified nominees should \nnot be delayed. The Senate should join with the President to confirm \nwell-qualified, diverse, and fair-minded nominees to fulfill the needs \nof the Federal courts around the country.\n  I see my friend from Arizona on the floor. I have spoken somewhat \nlonger than I suggested to him that I would. I apologize for that, but \nI hope he will take some comfort from the fact that as I said at the \nbeginning of my talk that I would vote for the nominees from his State, \nincluding one who has been a long-time friend of his. I am going to be \nurging Members on this side to do so. I can say with some certitude, \nall four will be confirmed.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate those remarks of the \ndistinguished ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. It is probably \na good segue for me to try to explain what has been going on here \nbecause colleagues who may be watching or people who are not in the \nSenate may be wondering what all of the discussion has been about when \nthere are four specific nominees who President Clinton has nominated \nfor Federal district judgeships and they are ostensibly being \nconsidered by the Senate and I have heard no discussion about the four. \nSo I am going to discuss the four very briefly.\n  The problem, as you have heard, is that many on the other side of the \naisle are unhappy with the fact that other nominees have not been \nconsidered this year. You have heard all the discussion about that. You \nhave heard Senator Hatch on our side explain why that is so. But there \nhas been great displeasure on the other side because, in their view, \nnot all the nominees they would have liked to have considered were \nconsidered.\n  The four nominees who are before us today are the only four the \nSenate can consider. They are the only nominees who have gone all the \nway through the process from nomination, ABA clearance, FBI clearance, \nhearing before the Judiciary Committee, and then the Judiciary \nCommittee having acted upon them to send them to the floor of the \nSenate. These are the only four on whom the Senate can act. I am \npleased that, today, we will have the opportunity to do that.\n  All four of these nominees were pending in July. The majority leader \nmade a request of the minority to consider the four nominees. That \nrequest was denied, however. So these four nominees had to be held over \nthe August recess. Obviously, on our side we would have much preferred \nthat the four confirmations could have occurred because of the need to \nfill these vacancies for the District in Arizona--which I will refer to \nin just a moment--but to which Senator Leahy referred. He acknowledges \nwe have a significant need in Arizona to fill these positions. But \nthere was objection on his side to their consideration.\n\n  So when we came back in September, the majority leader again asked \nthe minority leader for concurrence to bring these four nominees to the \nfloor for a vote. Again, that was denied by the Democratic side.\n  People might ask: Why would Democrats be objecting to President \nClinton's nominees? The reason has nothing to do with their merits. As \nSenator Leahy pointed out, undoubtedly all four of these nominees will \nbe confirmed because they are all four very well qualified. The reason \nhas to do with the politics of this Chamber. Because some Democrats \nwere concerned that not all of their people had been yet considered, \nthey were going to hold up nominees they perceived to be important to \nme and to Senator Fitzgerald from Illinois, the home State of the four \nnominees here before us.\n  But the fact is, these people are needed to serve the people of the \nUnited States of America. They were nominees of President Clinton. So \nthe bottom line is that it is now time for the nominations to be \nconsidered by the full Senate. We need to get over the politics. We \nneed to get on with doing the people's business and confirm these four \nwell-qualified individuals. I am pleased that both the majority and \nminority have now made that possible and that in a few minutes we will \nbe able to vote for all of these candidates.\n  The first three candidates should have been discussed this morning. I \nknow they were not. Instead, we had the discussion that you have heard. \nBut those four nominees, as Senator Hatch mentioned, are Michael Reagan \nfrom Illinois, about whom you will hear a little more in a moment from \nSenator Fitzgerald; Mary Murguia, a very well qualified assistant U.S. \nattorney from Arizona who, by the way, if confirmed, will be the first \nLatina to serve as a Federal district court judge from Arizona; and the \nHonorable Susan Bolton, a very distinguished Superior Court judge in \nArizona. All three of those candidates I deem to be well qualified. I \nchaired the hearing. I can certainly attest to the fact that the two \nfrom Arizona have the highest qualifications.\n  That leaves the fourth who is being considered separately here for \nreasons I will discuss in just a moment, but he is James Teilborg. \nSince I think it is appropriate when we are going to vote on somebody \nto actually have a little discussion about the individual, I am pleased \nto present a couple of minutes on his background here.\n  He was born and raised on a farm in southern Colorado and was State \nPresident of the Colorado Future Farmers of America. He married his \nwife, Connie, 37 years ago. They have two sons, Andy and Jay, and three \ngranddaughters.\n  He and I attended the University of Arizona College of Law beginning \nin 1964. That is where I first met Jim Teilborg. I have known him ever \nsince, and we have been close friends. So I can attest not only to his \nqualifications as a fine lawyer but also as a fine individual. He \nserved in active duty U.S. Air Force to attend Navigator School. He is \na retired colonel in the United States Air Force Reserve after 31 years \nin the National Guard and Reserve service. He was a member of the \nNational Guard for 7 years, a navigator on the C-97 and KC-97 aircraft \nand, by the way, has been 23 years admissions counselor for the U.S. \nAir Force Academy. I would also note for the entire time I have been \nwith the U.S. Congress, Jim Teilborg has chaired my service academy \ncommittee, a huge job of interviewing all the individuals who would \nlike to attend one of our military service academies: interviewing \nthem, making recommendations to me, and then for me to the academies. \nAs a result of his exemplary service, I must say we have a much higher \nthan average rate of acceptance by the service academies--because of \nJim Teilborg's fine service.\n\n  He was a founder of the law firm of Teilborg, Sanders & Parks, the \n12th largest law firm in Arizona. His practice focused on the areas of \naviation, professional negligence, product liability, and complex tort \nlitigation.\n  The Presiding Officer will appreciate, as a pilot himself, that, of \ncourse, Jim\n\n[[Page S9676]]\n\nTeilborg is an accomplished pilot as well.\n  He is a 33-year veteran trial lawyer. He was President of the \nMaricopa County Bar Association, and was a member of the board of \ndirectors. He was the lawyer representative to the Ninth Circuit \nJudicial Conference, a distinguished position for a member of the bar, \nand has served as chairman of the Maricopa County Bar Association \nMedical/Legal Liaison Committee, and also served as chairman of the \nSpecial State Bar Disciplinary Administrative Defense Counsel.\n  He is a Member of the International Association of Defense Counsel \nboard of directors and was its president in 1981; and, a very \nprestigious honor, a fellow of the American College of Trial Lawyers. \nThis is the pinnacle for anybody who really wants to call himself a \ntrial lawyer. In the latest edition of ``The Best Lawyers of America,'' \nof course, he is included.\n  Jim Teilborg is one of those rare individuals who has practiced law \nfor all of this time, made no enemies that I know of, but a lot of \nfriends in the practice of law as a very competent litigator, a fine \nindividual, and one who, as we found when we interviewed people in \nArizona about his potential nomination, had unanimous support among \njudges and lawyers for service on the Federal district court.\n  I cannot think of anyone who would be more suited for the position \nbecause of his background, because of his judicial temperament, and \nbecause of his philosophy of always treating people fairly and his love \nfor the law. It is personally a great honor for me and a pleasure to \nrecommend James Teilborg to my colleagues.\n  That is probably the last you will hear about Jim Teilborg. Nobody is \ngoing to argue against him as an individual, I am sure. Of course, none \nhas so far. I am hopeful that the political disagreement we have had \nover other nominees will not spill over into a negative vote on Jim \nTeilborg.\n  There is only one reason he has been set apart from the other \nnominees, and that is that he happens to be a Republican. Of course, I \nhave supported nearly 97 percent of President Clinton's nominees during \nthe time I have been in the Senate, and I daresay virtually all of them \nhave been Democrats. One cannot base a vote on partisan reasons in this \nbody.\n  I was very pleased to hear Senator Leahy say he would urge the \nsupport for Jim Teilborg, as well as committing that support himself. \nWhile we on both sides of the aisle have voted against candidates for \nreasons having to do with the merits of that individual candidate, I do \nnot know of any time I have seen a colleague vote against a nominee in \nprotest of something someone else had done. That would be wrong. A \nprotest vote having nothing to do with the individual would be wrong.\n  If the Senator from Vermont will still stay on the floor one more \nmoment, I will quote him because I want him to know how much I agree \nwith this important statement of his.\n  He said:\n\n       We should be the conscience of the Nation. On some \n     occasions, we have been, but we tarnish the conscience of \n     this great Nation if we establish the precedents of \n     partisanship and rancor that go against all precedents and \n     set the Senate on a course of meanness and smallness.\n\n  The Senator from Vermont was, I think, very accurate not only in what \nhe predicted would be the consequence of the precedent we would set if \nwe acted in that degree of smallness, but also I think expressed the \nview all of us share that our decisions should be based upon the \nmerits, however we see them--maybe differently--but never voting on an \nindividual because of the actions of someone else, to make a protest \nabout some other point.\n  I appreciate his comments, and I commend to all of his colleagues the \nstatement he has made here with respect to Jim Teilborg.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KYL. I will be very happy to yield.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I appreciate what my friend from Arizona said. And he is \nmy friend. It has been my experience on the committee, even on issues \nthat start out appearing to be partisan, that the Senator from Arizona \nhas worked hard to remove that sense of partisanship. He and I have \njoined together on a number of pieces of legislation. I do not think he \nwould object to the description as a conservative Republican and myself \nas a liberal Democrat, but we have both been pragmatic Senators in \ngetting some very good pieces of legislation through.\n  I mention that because he and I may well share a belief that there \nhave been some times this year when it has become too partisan. I hope \nafter the elections, no matter who is elected President and no matter \nwhat the numbers are in the House and the Senate, that a number of \nSenators who have had the experience of working together across the \naisle will start off the year trying to find pieces of legislation we \ncan do that will demonstrate to the country there are many Members of \ngood will in both parties who do want what is best for this country. \nThere will be issues, of course, where there are distinct party \ndifferences, but there are so many issues where there is far more \nunity. I hope we can do that.\n\n  I thank the Senator for his kind words. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. I will conclude. Some of \nthe best things we have done have been in a bipartisan way--some of the \nthings Senator Leahy and Senator Hatch have worked on in particular, \nthings that Senator Feinstein and I have worked on in particular. I \ncertainly look forward to getting together with Senator Leahy after the \nelection to see how we begin next year, assuming I am returned to this \nbody.\n  I conclude with a quick comment about the need to fill this position \nin Arizona.\n  In 1999, Congress created nine new Federal district court \njudgeships--four for Florida, two for Nevada, and three for Arizona. \nThe Nevada positions and three of four in Florida have been confirmed, \nbut none has been confirmed yet for Arizona. That is why this is such \nan important matter as we conclude our business this year.\n  These nominees are needed to handle the ever-increasing caseload in \nArizona, and here is an illustration of that caseload.\n  Our criminal felony caseload has increased 60 percent in the last 3 \nyears. The district of Arizona ranks second in total weighted filings \nfor a judge among the Nation's 94 districts, by the way, twice the \nnational average--901 compared to the national average of 472. We are \nfourth in weighted felony filings per judgeship. Felony filings per \njudgeship weighted are 236 percent above the national average.\n  So you can see, Mr. President, why this burgeoning amount of work in \nArizona requires that we fill these positions. We have 19 Indian \nreservations and 21 tribes which produces a steady stream of U.S. \njurisdiction cases which are not found in most other States. Because we \nare on the border, we have a lot of illegal immigration and drug \nsmuggling cases. And Arizona is one of the fastest growing States in \nterms of population. It is pretty easy to see how a State such as \nArizona can get into a position where it has to fill these positions.\n  I am very pleased that at this point, just before the Senate \nconcludes its business for the year, we are able to fill these three \npositions in Arizona, as well as the Illinois position. I am delighted \nmy colleague from Vermont will be urging his colleagues on the \nDemocratic side to support all four nominations. I have certainly done \nthe same on our side of the aisle. I think it will send a very good \nsignal of that very kind of bipartisanship Senator Leahy was talking \nabout if all of these nominees receive our unanimous support.\n  I reserve the remainder of whatever time is remaining on my side. Mr. \nPresident, it is my understanding that any quorum call time will be \nattributed to both sides equally; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KYL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will have to make that request.\n  Mr. KYL. I ask unanimous consent that any time spent in a quorum call \nbe equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S9677]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise to make some brief comments.\n  I was listening, while I was chairing the session, to the very \ndistinguished Senator from Vermont talking about how many appointments \nand how many nominees should be acted upon. He was very passionate in \nhis appeal to just have a vote; let's just vote up or down. He named \nnominee after nominee and how many days they have been under \nconsideration.\n  I was tempted to go back and get the history as to some of the \nproblems we are having with this administration and the fact that, yes, \nI am guilty of putting holds on judicial nominees and doing the same \nthing that, back in 1985, Senator Byrd did when Ronald Reagan was \nPresident of the United States.\n  But rather than go into that, I will only say this--I don't want to \ntake much time; I want the Senator from Iowa to have his time--we have \nacted upon President Clinton's nominees. In fact, it is my \nunderstanding that he is only five short of having an all-time record \nof having nominees being confirmed in a period of time.\n  Even though the Senator from Vermont was quite eloquent in talking \nabout all of the judicial nominees who were left without final action \nbeing taken, either to confirm or not confirm, if we quit right now and \ndidn't confirm these four we are discussing today, at the end of \nPresident Clinton's term, that would leave a total of 67 vacancies. It \nis my understanding that 61 is considered to be a full bench.\n  Let's say 67 vacancies are there. Back when President Bush was \nPresident, when he left office at the end of 1992, there were 107 \nvacancies.\n  The bottom line there is the Democrat-controlled Senate at that time \nwas able to stop or was stopping more of the nominations than the \nRepublican-controlled Senate is today.\n\n  Seeing that the Senator from Iowa has left the Chamber and no one \nelse is asking for time, I will go ahead at this point and proceed to \nthe history behind this.\n  Back in 1985, when Ronald Reagan was President of the United States \nand the Senate was controlled by the Democrats, a lot of the \nconservative appointments--not just judicial nominations but others--by \nthe President were not acted upon by the Democrat-controlled Senate. \nConsequently, President Reagan did something he should not have done \nback in 1985. He started making recess appointments, and he made many \nrecess appointments. The majority leader at that time, the very \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, wrote a letter to \nPresident Reagan.\n  In this letter, he reminded him as to what the senatorial prerogative \nwas in accordance with the Constitution. At that time he said: You have \nviolated the Constitution with these recess appointments, and you have \ndone so to avoid our confirmation or lack of confirmation. Therefore, \nif you have any more recess appointments, I will put a hold on all \nnominees, not just judicial nominations but all nominations.\n  Consequently, after a short period of time, President Reagan wrote a \nletter back to Senator Byrd and said: You are right; it was a violation \nof the Constitution. And he recited that the Constitution had a \nprovision for recess appointments only in the cases when the \nappointment occurs during the time we are in recess and that that was \nnot the case when he made his recess appointments.\n  Fifteen months ago, when we found out that President Clinton was \nmaking excessive recess appointments, I found the old letter that Bob \nByrd had sent to President Reagan, and I sent that same letter to \nPresident Clinton, saying the same thing: If you continue to do recess \nappointments, we are going to put holds on all your nominees, except, I \nsaid, just judicial nominees. Consequently, President Clinton, after a \nperiod of 3 or 4 weeks, wrote a letter back and said that he would \nagree to the same terms Ronald Reagan had agreed to back in 1985. Then \nwhen President Clinton violated his word, I put holds on nominations. \nThis was 15 months ago.\n  As we all know, there was a vote to override my holds after a few \nmonths, and that was successful. However, for all judicial nominations \nthat have not gone through the process since President Clinton did have \n17 recess appointments during the August recess, I have renewed that \nhold on all future judicial nominations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, for the benefit of Senators and staff, I \ninitially had 3 hours of time on which to speak about the judicial \nnominees and, more specifically, the holdup that is happening on the \nJudiciary Committee with regard to the former attorney general of the \nState of Iowa, Bonnie J. Campbell, who has been nominated for a seat on \nthe Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  In discussing this with several Senators, I can say that it is now my \nintention to speak for a few minutes and to yield back the remainder of \nmy time. In discussions with our side, I understand there probably will \nbe just voice votes on all of these nominees.\n  Just for planning purposes--I know how sometimes I get irritated when \nI don't really know what is happening when some people have a lot of \ntime--I want Senators to know I am going to speak for a few minutes, \nyield back my time, and then move to the votes on the nominees.\n  Again, I want to respond a little bit to what my friend from Utah \nsaid this morning, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator \nHatch. I am reading from the transcript of this morning's session. \nSenator Hatch said:\n\n       It had always been my intention for the Judiciary Committee \n     to report Ms. Campbell's nomination. However, events \n     conspired to prevent that from happening.\n       First, during the August recess, as I have explained, the \n     President determined to recess appoint several executive \n     branch nominees over the express objection of numerous \n     Senators.\n       He did so notwithstanding his agreement to clear such \n     recess appointments with the relevant Senators. . . .\n       Second, after their August recess, Democrat Senators \n     determined to place holds on the four nominations we are \n     debating today, even everybody admits--I think everybody \n     admits--that they are important nominations and this \n     arrangement that has been worked out has been fair.\n       Again, they threatened to shut down the Senate's committee \n     work, going as far as to invoke the 2-hour rule and forcing \n     the postponement of scheduled committee hearings. . . . For \n     these reasons, Bonnie Campbell's nomination has stalled. Ms. \n     Campbell has only the White House and Senate Democrats to \n     blame for the current situation.\n\n  I don't know what the Senator from Utah is talking about. Bonnie \nCampbell had nothing to do with whether the President made recess \nappointments or not. And the holds that were placed on the four \nnominations--they were saying, wait a minute, Bonnie Campbell had her \nhearing 2 months before some of the nominees that we are voting on \ntoday. Three of these nominees that will get their vote today were \nnominated, got their hearing and were reported out of Committee within \none week in July of this year. Bonnie Campbell's hearing was in May.\n  So we are only saying: Why not take those who had their hearings \nfirst? Why take up those who had them later? Bonnie Campbell had her \nhearing, answered questions; they had more written questions that they \nsent her, and she responded to those. Yet there again, three of the \nfour judges we are voting on here today went through the first three \nsteps of the process within one week.\n  Ms. Campbell has only the White House and Senate Democrats to blame \nfor the current situation? What is the Senator from Utah talking about? \nWhat is to blame are the pure rank politics of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee and the Senate Republicans for holding up Bonnie Campbell's \nnomination and keeping it bottled up in committee.\n  The Senator from Utah knows full well that this Senator from Iowa had \nevery right to exercise his rights as a Senator on the floor, to bottle \nup a lot of things on this floor after the August recess. I did not do \nso because I was led to believe that, by acting in good faith, the \nSenate Judiciary Committee would act on Bonnie Campbell's nomination. \nWhy? Because the Senator from Iowa,\n\n[[Page S9678]]\n\nMr. Grassley--and if I am not mistaken, he is the second ranking member \non the Judiciary Committee--supports Bonnie Campbell and has stated so \npublicly. So I figured, well, he is second ranking.\n  Now, Mr. Kyl, the Senator from Arizona, is fourth ranking on the \ncommittee, but he gets his nominee through. He was nominated, had a \nhearing, and was reported out that week. Mr. Kyl gets his nominee \nthrough.\n  Well, I figured if I acted in good faith--and I did so by not doing \nanything and letting the Judiciary Committee go from one week to the \nnext, one week to the next, and I thought this week they didn't report \nher out, maybe they'll do it next week, or maybe the next week. Well, \nnow, the time has run out and it is clear to me I was being strung \nalong all this time with false promises that the Judiciary Committee \nwould, indeed, act on Bonnie Campbell's nomination.\n  So now to say that it is the Senate Democrats who are to blame for \nthe current situation with Bonnie Campbell is utter fabrication, total \nnonsense. The Senator from Utah knows as well as I do that there is one \nreason it is being held up, and it is called politics--pure rank \npolitics. Then, again, Senator Hatch says that the reason it has been \nheld up is because President Clinton had some recess appointments, and \nthat we had a hold on these four nominees for a while. Well, why is he \nsingling out one nominee? Why is he targeting Bonnie Campbell? Why is \nBonnie Campbell the target? What about all the other judges? Why is he \nsingling her out?\n  Is it because of her work to prevent domestic violence as the \ndirector of the Office of Violence Against Women at the Justice \nDepartment? The Senate Republicans have stalled passing the \nreauthorization of that law just as they have blocked Bonnie Campbell's \nnomination from getting a vote on the Senate floor.\n  Bonnie Campbell has done a superb job of focusing on the issue of \nviolence against women, especially domestic violence. The Violence \nAgainst Women Act has expired. It expired on the last day of September \nof this year. This Republican Congress didn't even see fit to take it \nup and pass it.\n  So it is no surprise to me that in poll after poll after poll across \nthis country women are saying no to Republican candidates because they \nsee what has been happening here. This Republican Senate is holding up \nthe one person who really knows what violence against women is about, \nwho headed that office and has done a superb job; yet Senate \nRepublicans aren't going to let her come out. How well has she done? \nTake a look at the House vote on reauthorization. The vote was 415 to \n3. Do you really think this bill would have been reauthorized if the \nperson who has headed the office to implement its provisions had done a \nbad job?\n  Well, I say to Senate Republicans, you better beware. The women of \nthis country are watching what you do up here on the issues that are \nimportant to them. They want the Senate to reauthorize VAWA. They want \njudges who will enforce that law. Who better to do that than Bonnie \nCampbell? She is qualified, and no one has come to the Senate floor and \nsaid any differently since her hearing.\n  I can tell you, this Republican Senate that is holding up her \nnomination and the reauthorization of VAWA will have only themselves to \nblame if the women of this country vote overwhelmingly against their \nparty in November. It pains me to say this, but I think that is what it \nhas come down to. If they want to play politics with Bonnie Campbell \nand Violence Against Women, go right ahead, but it will bite them bad. \nReal bad.\n  You may think you are only holding up one person, only one judge, \nsaying, well, she was from Iowa, not of any consequence. I say to my \nRepublican friends, you are seriously mistaken. Bonnie Campbell did an \noutstanding job as attorney general for the State of Iowa. She was well \nknown to women all over this country as a role model and someone they \nhave looked to for leadership, someone who has brought honor to our \nState, honor to the legal profession, honor to this administration, and \nhonor to what we are about as a nation in trying to provide more \nequality for women in this country.\n  I say to my friends on the Republican side, if you think you are \nplaying smart politics by holding up Bonnie Campbell's nomination, I \nsay to you that you are sadly mistaken.\n  But I guess it has come down to this. I am told that there is no use \neven talking about it anymore. They are not going to let Bonnie \nCampbell's nomination be reported out. I don't know about that. I say \nit is never over until it's over. And perhaps some cooler heads will \nprevail on the Republican side. They will see that they are only \nhurting their own cause. They are only hurting themselves and their \ncandidates who are out there running by holding up Bonnie Campbell's \nnomination.\n  It is time we have more diversity on the Federal bench. Only 20 \npercent of the Federal judiciary are women. Of the 148 circuit judges, \nonly 33 are women. It is time we have more--qualified women on the \nfederal bench.\n  Last year, a report by the Task Force on Judicial Selection of \nCitizens for Independent Courts--an independent group--verified that \nthe time to confirm female nominees is now significantly longer than \nthat to confirm male nominees. There is a difference that has defied \nlogical explanation. The fact is--it is true--to confirm female \nnominees takes a lot longer than men.\n  We have some men who are being voted on today. We have one man being \nvoted on today who was nominated in July. He was passed out the same \nweek. Bonnie Campbell has waited 215 days since she was nominated.\n  The standard bearer of the Republican Party this year--Gov. Bush of \nTexas--said there should be a deadline of 60 days from nomination \nthrough the process.\n  Evidently, the Republicans in the Senate and on the Judiciary \nCommittee are not paying much heed to their standard bearer.\n  I am sorry to have to disagree with Mr. Hatch. But the White House is \nnot to blame for this, and neither are the Senate Democrats.\n  Mr. Hatch has an argument with the White House on recess \nappointments. That is another matter entirely. It has nothing to do \nwith judicial nominees.\n  Maybe he doesn't like what Mr. Clinton said at a press conference. \nMaybe Senator Hatch doesn't like a lot of things the President does. \nBut does that give the Senator from Utah the right to hold up a \njudicial nominee because he doesn't like what the President did on some \nother matter?\n  I want to point out again that three out of the four nominees voted \non today were nominated, a hearing was held, and they were reported out \nof the committee in 1 week in July. Yet Bonnie Campbell has been \nwaiting 215 days, and they will not report her out of the committee.\n  One can only ask again why the Republicans are playing this political \ncharade. I guess they figure, well, if they just hold on, maybe their \nguy will win and they can move ahead.\n  But, as I said earlier, I think the Republicans over there ought to \nbe aware of this one. This one is going to bite hard.\n  Mr. President, I yield whatever time the Senator from Minnesota \ndesires. I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from New York, Mr. \nSchumer, and I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I came to the floor to support my \ncolleague, the Senator from Iowa, and to speak for a couple of minutes \nabout Bonnie Campbell. I believe Bonnie Campbell would be the second \nwoman to serve on the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. Dianne Murphy \nfrom Minnesota is the first. Bonnie Campbell has done a lot of good \nwork, but most important is her record at the Justice Department in the \nviolence against women office.\n  I come here to speak about this woman's magnificent work. Bonnie \nCampbell has probably more than any single individual made the most \ndifference when it came to reducing violence and trying to end some of \nthe violence in families; unfortunately, most of it directed against \nwomen and children. About every 13 seconds, a woman is battered in our \ncountry. A home should be a safe place. Somewhere between 3 million and \n10 million witness this in their homes.\n\n[[Page S9679]]\n\n  Bonnie Campbell has visited Minnesota. I have seen her speak with \nvery quiet eloquence. I cannot say enough about the magnificent work \nshe has done. As attorney general in Iowa, I think she passed the first \nanti-stalking law in the State. She is well known in Iowa. She is well \nknown throughout the United States of America. She is a skillful \nlawyer. She would be a great judge. She is extremely important when it \ncomes to being a voice for families in this country. She has done \nprobably some of the best work that any individual could possibly do in \nthis incredibly important area of reducing violence in this country. \nThere is way too much violence--especially directed at women and \nchildren.\n  I cannot for the life of me understand why we have been waiting \nalmost 7 months or thereabouts for this nomination to move through the \nSenate.\n  Minnesota is covered by the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. Dianne \nMurphy is from the State of Minnesota. She was the first woman to serve \non this court. She is a great judge.\n  Bonnie Campbell would be a great judge. We need her on this court. We \nneed a judge who understands the concerns and circumstances of too many \nwomen's lives and too many children's lives in this country. We need a \njudge such as Bonnie Campbell who has such a distinguished background \nand such a distinguished career. We need a judge on the Eighth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals like Bonnie Campbell with such a proven record of \npublic service. I can't find anything in her background, I can't find \nanything in her record, I can't find anything about her which would \nmake her anything other than 100 percent eminently qualified to serve \non this court of appeals.\n\n  I share in the indignation that my colleague from Iowa has expressed. \nThere is no excuse to hold this nomination for one day longer. I think \nit is shameful that, in the Senate, really good people who have so much \nto offer, who could do such good--in this particular case, at the \nEighth Circuit of Appeals--find themselves blocked for no good reason.\n  I heard Senator Harkin say he thought this was going to come back to \n``bite.'' I hope it does. It is true; most of the people in the country \nare not so directly connected to this process of how we do \nconfirmations of judicial appointments. We have had Senator Leahy doing \nyeoman work, and there are other Senators who have spoken. Senator \nLeahy provides the leadership. The more people learn about a person of \nthe caliber of Bonnie Campbell--and as a man, I care a lot about how we \ncan reduce this violence in families, how we can reduce the violence in \nhomes--the more people hear about this, the more outraged they will be, \nand for good reason.\n  I know it is asking too much, but I want to see a little bit more \nfairness. I want to see an end to this blocking of good people who \ncould do good work and could help so much. Bonnie Campbell is a perfect \nexample. We shouldn't be delaying this nomination one day. But we are. \nI just want to express my support for Bonnie Campbell.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Before I get into the substance of my remarks dealing \nwith honoraria for judges, I echo the words of my colleague from \nMinnesota, Senator Wellstone, as well as our leader on the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Leahy, about the holdup in judges. Senator Leahy has \nlaid it out quite carefully; that is, that we have not appointed as \nmany judges, on a percentage basis, as when Democrats controlled the \nSenate during the Reagan and Bush years.\n  I particularly add my voice to those who are asking that Bonnie \nCampbell be added to the Eighth Circuit.\n  The reason I rise is not only as a member of the Judiciary Committee, \nnot only as somebody who believes we ought to fill the vacancies in our \ncourts--and I am appreciative that Senator Hatch has worked with me to \nfill those vacancies in New York. Neither the Second Circuit nor any of \nthe New York district courts have vacancies, and we did manage to fill \nat least six judgeships this year. I thank the chairman for that. But \nthat doesn't mean the rest of the country should have things \nunanswered.\n  I worked with Bonnie Campbell. I was the sponsor in the House of the \nViolence Against Women Act. It was authored originally by Senator Biden \nand Senator Boxer, when she was a House Member. She carried it between \n1990 and 1992. When she was elected to the Senate, she asked me to take \nthe reins, and we did. We passed the law. As somebody greatly \ninterested in the Violence Against Women Act, of bringing that dirty \nlittle secret, the amount of violence in our families, out into the \nsunlight so we could deal with it, I believed very strongly the right \nperson should be appointed to be in charge of the act.\n  Bonnie Campbell did a fabulous job on an issue of great concern to \nall Americans. I think it is just unfair to ``reward her'' by letting \nher sit there in limbo when she so deserves and could be such a great \naddition to the Eighth Circuit. I plead with my friend, the Senate \nmajority leader, my friend, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee--\nwho, as I say, has been fair and good to New York on this issue--to \nbring the names of all four judges before the Senate, or all the judges \nwho are waiting in the wings--there are more than four--but \nparticularly Bonnie Campbell.\n\n  On an issue related, as well, of debating a number of nominees to be \nFederal judges, I want to address an issue that affects the entire \nFederal judiciary: The ban on honoraria. Under current law, as we all \nknow, Federal judges are not allowed to accept honoraria. That is how \nit should be. The framers of the Constitution designed article III to \nkeep judges outside of politics and above influence. Read the \nFederalist Papers. One of the great debates was that Federal judges, in \narticle III, achieve life appointment.\n  There was one reason for it: So they would be unfettered, so they \nwould be uninfluenced; they could make their own decisions, knowing \nthat no sanction could be taken against them for decisions they made, \nand, just as importantly, so the public would know it.\n  Because the judiciary has neither the power of the sword, as does the \nexecutive, nor the power of the purse, as does Congress, it is \nessential that the judiciary maintain its power--and it has, thank \nGod--for these 211 years since the Constitution was written, through an \nuntainted reputation for integrity and impartiality. The Federal \njudiciary has had it. It has frustrated us at times. It frustrated \nFranklin D. Roosevelt in the 1930s. It has frustrated some Members \ntoday on issues where we disagree with the majority. There is nothing \nwe can do about it, thank God, because an independent judiciary is \nvital.\n  I believe the public, if the surveys I have seen are correct, \nbelieves the Federal judiciary is independent--far more, I might say, \nthan State and local judiciaries where there are either elections or \nappointments of term so that judges believe they have to please either \nan individual or even the whole electorate to make up their minds.\n  Nothing could do more to undo the justified reputation so much wanted \nby the founders and sustained in this Republic as the provision that \nhas been inserted into H.R. 4690 that would allow judges to accept \nhonoraria. The repeal of the ban would create a significant loophole in \nthe Ethics in Government Act of 1978 which bars high-ranking Federal \nofficials of all branches of Government from receiving speaking fees \nfor 11 years. This prohibition has limited real and perceived \ncorruption. It has limited real corruption and, probably much more \nwidespread, perceived corruption. The conflicts of interest among \nMembers of Congress, Federal judges, and senior members of the \nexecutive branch have been limited, as well.\n  I, for one, opposed honoraria for Members of Congress. I don't \nbelieve in a standard for the judges and a different one for Members. \nWhile honoraria were allowed in the Congress for most of the years I \nserved in the House, I refused to take them. I remember my first \nspeech, right after I was elected. A leading financial institution in \nNew York asked me to speak. I had just been appointed to the Banking \nCommittee, which regulated a lot of their activities. After the speech, \nthey handed me a check. I was sort of surprised; it sort of knocked my \nsocks off. I looked at the check. I said: This is wrong; this is not a \ncheck for the ``Reelect Schumer Committee''--which I\n\n[[Page S9680]]\n\nwould have believed would have been untoward to give me right after a \nspeech anyway--but this is for me. They said: Yes, that is your \nhonorarium.\n\n  I felt bad about it, returned the check, and vowed not to take any \nhonoraria in the future.\n  It is even more important for judges because, as I said, they are not \nsanctioned to election; they are not supposed to be sanctioned to the \nwhims of either the people or of special interest groups. It would \nsimply lower the standard for the very officials for whom standards \nshould be the highest.\n  Thousands of U.S. citizens go before Federal judges every year and \nexpect impartial justice. That is why judges have, as I mentioned, life \nappointments. That is why the rules so assiduously guard against even \nthe appearance of impropriety. And that is why we spend so much time \ndebating the appointment of these judges. We know once they are \nappointed, that is it; they are in for life.\n  Lifting the ban will only leave litigants wondering whether the \nintegrity of the judges has been undermined by speaking fees from \ngroups that have a stake, or may have a stake, in the case before them.\n  The Federal judiciary, it is said, is underpaid. If you believe it, \nraise the pay; budget the money. But don't, please, allow judges to \nmoonlight as talking heads.\n  That demeans our independent Federal judiciary. To simply give them \nleave to forage for speaking engagements is nothing less than an \nabdication of our responsibility. Moreover, exempting judges from the \nhonorarium ban will give the biggest benefit to those who are in high \ndemand for speaking engagements--likely the most famous, the most high \nranking. Presumably inadequate compensation is a problem for all \nFederal judges, not just those who can garner the largest fees or even \nwho are the most eloquent. We don't hire our judges, we don't appoint \nour judges, on the basis of eloquence.\n  Additionally, if judges are underpaid, then they may be more \nsusceptible to influence from outside income--even more reason to \nmaintain the honorarium ban.\n  In conclusion, the issue boils down to one simple, simple nugget: The \nfaith of the people in their government. We have a great Republic. The \nmore I am on Earth, the more I believe that the Founding Fathers were \nthe greatest collection of practical geniuses history has ever known \nand the more I believe that our country is, as they put it, a noble \nexperiment. It was when it started, and, God bless America, it still is \ntoday.\n  Honoraria for judges strike a dagger right in the heart of what the \nFounding Fathers wanted--a totally independent judiciary, perceived as \nindependent as well as actually being independent. Inserting this \nnefarious provision into the thick of an appropriations bill in the \ndark of night ruins that image. Unfortunately, the sneaky addition of \nthis provision matches the substantive effect of it. It will only \nenhance the public's perception that those in government should not be \ntrusted.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to thank all of those responsible for \nhelping in the steering of the confirmation of these four nominees--\nSenator Hatch and Senator Leahy.\n  I also would like to make a quick comment about my colleague, Senator \nGrassley, who observed earlier that even though I rank fifth on the \nJudiciary Committee and Senator Grassley ranks second, I was able to \nsecure these nominees; whereas, the nominee very important to Senator \nGrassley and Senator Harkin has not been considered.\n  I want to make it clear that seniority had nothing to do with it. \nSenator Grassley has worked long and hard on behalf of the nominee that \nSenator Harkin has spoken about, Bonnie Campbell, former attorney \ngeneral of Iowa.\n  I worked very hard on behalf of these nominees. But to make it clear, \nthe nominees from Arizona were President Clinton's nominees. I worked \nwith my colleague in the House, Ed Pastor, a Democrat, in helping to \nensure that these nominees could be considered in\n\n[[Page S9681]]\n\nthis session of the Congress; that we could have the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee approve the nominations, and send them to the floor for \nconsideration. It was still laid over over the August recess. \nNotwithstanding all of that, we were able to get it done.\n  But in the case of Bonnie Campbell, she is a circuit court nominee. I \nknow Senator Grassley and Senator Harkin have an agreement that they \nwill support each other's nominees when the other party is in power. In \nthis case, the Democratic President makes a nominee, and Senator Harkin \nis supportive and Senator Grassley is also supportive. He certainly has \nbeen supportive.\n  I want the Record to be clear--I am sure Senator Harkin would concur \nin this--that Senator Grassley has been a very strong advocate for \nBonnie Campbell.\n  I think the circumstances that permitted us to confirm these other \nfour nominees--one from Illinois and three from Arizona --didn't have \nanything to do with the seniority on the committee or it wouldn't have \nbeen possible for the Arizona judges to have been confirmed by the \nSenate.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I respond by saying I was not trying to \nimply one way or the other that seniority had something to do with who \ngets out of the Judiciary Committee. My main point was that three of \nthe four nominees we voted on today have been pending a very short \ntime. They were nominated in July, their hearing was in July, and they \nwere reported out of Committee in July--all in the same week. And they \nwere brought to the floor today. Bonnie Campbell has been sitting there \nfor 215 days. She had her hearing in May. Yet they won't report her out \nof the Judiciary Committee.\n  This is unfair. It is unfair to her. It is unfair to the women of \nthis country. It is unfair to the court which needs to fill this \nposition. We recognize in Bonnie Campbell a champion, a champion of \nwomen, someone who has done an outstanding job in administering the \noffice of violence against women. She is the only one who has held that \noffice since the legislation was passed. The House last week voted 415-\n3 to reauthorize it. Now we will try to do something in the Senate. I \nthink the women of this country understand the Republican-controlled \nJudiciary Committee and the Republican-controlled Senate are stopping \nthe Senate from having a vote on Bonnie Campbell for pure political \nreasons.\n  I think it is wrong the way they are treating Bonnie Campbell in this \nnomination process. I will continue to point that out every day that we \nremain in session. It is unfair to her. It is unfair to the women of \nthis country to have someone so qualified, someone who has done so much \nto reduce and prevent violence against women, to have the Senate \nJudiciary Committee bottle up her name and not even permit it to come \non the floor for a vote.\n  I am still hopeful perhaps they will see the light and permit that to \nhappen, although time is running out. I will take every day we are here \nto talk about it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, we have heard much debate today about \nFederal judges. One would think that President Clinton has fared very \npoorly in the judicial confirmation process, but this is simply not \ntrue. He has done quite well with the cooperation of the Republican-\ncontrolled Senate.\n  During the President's first term, the Senate confirmed nearly one-\nquarter of the entire Federal Judiciary. After today, the Senate will \nhave confirmed 44 percent or 377 Clinton judges.\n  It is no secret that while I served as Chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee during the first six years of the Reagan Administration, I \nmade the confirmation of judges a top priority of the Committee. I am \nproud of our accomplishments during those years.\n  Yet, with Republican control of the Congress, President Clinton's \nsuccess rate is really no different. After today, the Senate will have \nconfirmed only five more Article III judges for President Reagan than \nit has thus far for President Clinton.\n  Today, the vacancy rate is 7.9 percent, and the Clinton \nAdministration has recognized a 7 percent vacancy rate as virtual full \nemployment for the Judiciary. The vacancy rate at the end of the Bush \nAdministration was 11.5 percent, but there was no talk then about a \nvacancy crisis. At the end of the Bush Administraton, the Congress \nadjourned without acting on 53 Bush nominations. Today, there are only \n38 Clinton nominees pending in Committee.\n  The Fourth Circuit is a good example of the healthy status of the \nJudiciary. The court is operating very well and does not need more \njudges. In fact, today, it is the most efficient circuit. The Fourth \nCircuit takes less time than any other to decide a case on appeal. The \ntruth is that, due to a lack of cases needing oral argument, the Fourth \nCircuit has cancelled at least one term of court for each of the past \nfour years, and two terms of court for the past two years.\n  The Chief Judge of the Fourth Circuit has made clear that additional \njudges are not needed, and he should know better than us the needs of \nhis court. There is no good reason to add judges to the most efficient \ncircuit in the nation. Given that a circuit judgeship costs about one \nmillion dollars per year for the life of the judge, it would be a waste \nof taxpayer money to do so.\n  We also should not be misled by the fact that some vacancies are \ndefined as a ``judicial emergency.'' The term is defined so broadly \nthat, with one exception, all current circuit court judgeships that \nhave been vacant for 18 months are considered ``emergencies.''\n  The issue of judgeships in the Federal courts is not just about \nnumbers and statistics. Much more is at stake. Each judgeship is a \nlife-time appointment that yields great power but is basically \naccountable to no one.\n  The Senate has a Constitutional duty to review each nominee carefully \nand deliberately. We take this responsibility very seriously in the \nJudiciary Committee, as we must. We cannot be a rubber stamp for any \nAdministration. The entire Nation loses when we allow judicial \nactivists or judges who are soft on crime to be confirmed to these \nlife-time positions.\n  Under Senator Hatch's leadership, the Judiciary Committee has taken a \nfair and reasoned approach to the confirmation process. As a result, \nthe Clinton Administration has done quite well regarding judicial \nconfirmations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/03/senate-section/article/S9681-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

This is legislation that I \nintroduced last year, along with Senators Bingaman, Chafee, Durbin, \nKennedy, Schumer, Torricelli, Boxer, Collins, Feinstein, Mikulski, and \nSnowe.

Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to talk about \ncomments that have been made, both on the floor and off the floor, with \nregard to the job that the distinguished Senator from Utah, the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Hatch, has been doing in \nregard to judicial nominations. I rise today to commend my colleague \nfor the outstanding work he has done in regard to these nominations.\n  Make no mistake about it, this is tough work. No one who has not had \nthe opportunity to watch this from a close point of view, to see it up \nclose and personal, really has any idea what kind of effort Senator \nHatch has made to make sure nominees who come to this floor have been \nexamined very closely and very carefully. It is proper; it is correct \nthat this be done. No one can do a better job at this than Senator \nOrrin Hatch. I have watched him, day after day, in his examination and \nhis staff's examination and work on people who have been nominated to \nthe judicial bench. I must say he does a tremendous job.\n  Senate consideration of judicial nominations is always difficult. It \nis always contentious. That is just the nature of the business. Yet in \nthis Congress, under the guidance of Chairman Hatch, the Senate has \nconfirmed 69 Federal judicial nominations--69, for those who offer \ncriticism. Mr. President, 35 of these nominees have been confirmed \nearlier this year, and we have just confirmed 4 more. Yet not only has \nthe chairman been criticized for nominees who are still pending in the \nJudiciary Committee, he has even been criticized for nominees who have \nalready been confirmed; that is, nominees who are now serving, today, \nthis very day, as Federal judges. Chairman Hatch has been criticized \nfor not moving those nominees fast enough. I strongly disagree. I \nbelieve the chairman has done an outstanding job, a fine job. I wanted \nto come to the floor this afternoon to say that.\n  I would like to talk about the confirmation process for a moment \nbecause, again, I think many times people really don't understand what \nthis process entails--or at least what it entails when the chairman is \ndoing a good job. I think an explanation of the process may help those \nwho are listening to the debate today understand why some of the delays \nin confirmation of judicial nominees occur.\n  The President has very broad discretion, as we know, to nominate \nwhomever he chooses for Federal judicial vacancies. The Senate, in its \nrole, has a constitutional duty to offer its ``advice and consent'' on \njudicial nominations. Each Senator, of course, has his or her own \ncriteria for offering this advice and this consent on these lifetime \nappointments.\n  The Judiciary Committee, though, is where many of the initial \nconcerns about nominees are raised and arise. Often these concerns \narise before a hearing is even scheduled. Judicial nominees are \nrequired to respond to a very lengthy and a very detailed questionnaire \nfrom the Judiciary Committee. They must submit copies of every document \nthey have ever published, any writing they have ever published, and \nprovide copies of every speech they have ever given. If they have \npreviously served as a judge, they must provide information regarding \nopinions they authored.\n  There are various background checks conducted on each nominee. \nSometimes outside individuals or organizations provide the committee \nwith information about a nominee. Sometimes that information from \noutside groups comes very early in the process. But sometimes, quite \ncandidly, it comes later on. Each time it comes in, the committee, \ncommittee staff, and ultimately the chairman must review that \ninformation.\n\n  All of this information is, of course, available to every member of \nthe Judiciary Committee and must be thoroughly reviewed before the \nnominee is granted a hearing by the committee. If questions about a \nnominee's background or qualifications arise, further inquiry may be \nnecessary. The chairman will schedule a hearing for a nominee only \nafter thorough review of a nominee's preliminary information. At the \nhearing, a nominee has an opportunity to respond to any remaining \nconcerns about his or her record. But even after a hearing, sometimes \nfollowup questions are necessary to properly examine issues regarding \nthe nominee's qualifications. Obviously, this is a long process, as it \nshould be--as it must be. After all, these are lifetime appointments. \nThese judges will have a tremendous impact on how our laws are \ninterpreted and enforced.\n  Some nominees, of course, have clear records of achievement and \nsuperb qualifications. These nominees often move through the committee \nand to the Senate floor very quickly. Other nominees have records that \nare really not quite so clear. These nominees take more time for \nadditional investigation and careful consideration. If a nominee is \nnominated late in a Congress, and that nominee has questions raised \nabout his or her background or qualifications, it is more likely that \nhis nomination will not be considered by the Senate.\n\n[[Page S9683]]\n\n  If nominees were only considered in the order they were nominated, \nthe process would, of course, grind to a halt. We have heard some \ncomments about that. Some people have argued this is a queuing up \nprocess; we just queue up whoever is next in line; they should go next \non the Senate floor. But we know that cannot happen. If nominees were \nonly considered in the order they were nominated, the process would \ngrind to a halt as more qualified nominees would back up behind \nquestionable nominees.\n  I believe, if it were not for Orrin Hatch's efforts, there would have \nbeen far fewer judges confirmed during this session of the Congress. \nBut I am also sure that if Orrin Hatch had not been chairman, other \nquestionable nominations would have been made. Because of this man's \nintegrity, because of this man's honesty, because of this man's proven \ntrack record, and because he takes his job so seriously, I am convinced \nthat certain nominations this White House might have considered making \nsimply were never made and were never submitted.\n  I commend Senator Hatch for his efforts in moving the nominees along, \nbut also for his efforts in doing a thorough and complete job. I am \nvery proud to have Orrin Hatch as chairman of this committee. We are \nvery honored to have him serve in that capacity.\n  I thank the Chair.

Mr. President, we are now in the midst of National Breast \nCancer Awareness Month, and the air has been filled with new and \nsometimes confusing statistics, new treatment, new research advances, \nand ever-present warnings about the seriousness of this dreaded \ndisease.\n  One aspect of this issue that is close to my heart is National \nMammography Day--a day to increase awareness of how routine periodic \nmammography and early diagnosis of breast cancer are responsible for \nhuge increases in the numbers of long-term survivors of this disease.\n  I note parenthetically that my wife started an organization in my \nState to increase awareness--it is named after her, not me--called the \nBiden Breast Health Initiative, where she and her group of advisers \nbring oncology nurses and oncologists into the local high schools \nthroughout the State to make young women in high school aware of breast \nhealth examinations and self-examination because the key to survival is \nearly detection.\n  Breast cancer is now an illness not to be feared as a death sentence \nbut to be conquered commonly and routinely. This year, National \nMammography Day, which I sponsored years ago, will occur on Friday, \nOctober 20. As in previous years, the Senate has adopted a resolution \nthat I introduced affirming this designation.\n\n  This year's National Mammography Day will see the beginning of a \ntremendous new advance in early detection of breast cancer--digital \nmammography. This new technique offers many advantages over standard \nfilm-based mammography. From the patient's point of view, the usual 40-\nminute examination time can be cut in half, and the exposure to \nradiation can be reduced in almost all instances.\n  For many women, the mammogram images with digital technology are \nconsiderably more precise. The digital technology makes it possible for \nthe radiologist to manipulate the images and to zoom in on questionable \nareas, thus providing more accurate diagnosis in reducing the need for \nrepeat examinations.\n  The digital technology does away with the cost and the disposal \nproblems as well of x-ray film.\n  In addition, the retrieval of prior film for comparison with current \nimages no longer require the time-consuming manual search through an x-\nray room.\n  Finally, by switching to the digital approach, this new technique \nallows all future advances in digital computer technology to be applied \ndirectly to saving women from breast cancer.\n  It is impossible, in my view, to overstate the importance of this \ndigital technique's adaptability to new technological advances. Those \nof us old enough to remember how the first personal computers were a \nhuge advance over the slide rule are also aware of how the incredible \nsubsequent advances in computer technology meant that those first PCs \nwere now useful only as doorstops. I look forward to a similarly rapid \nadvance in the new digital technology as it moves into the field of \nbreast cancer diagnosis.\n  Digital mammography is a revolutionary technology that must be \noffered to seniors and disabled who obtain their medical care through \nMedicare. And it should be done as soon as possible. I strongly \nencourage the Health Care Financing Administration to evaluate this \nproduct expeditiously and to set appropriate payment rates under the \nMedicare program.\n  What I don't want to see happen--I realize this may seem somewhat \npremature--is that digital mammography is only available for those who \nare able to pay, while all those on Medicare or Medicaid, because the \nreimbursement cost is not sufficient to cover a digital mammography, \nwill have to settle for what will prove to be an inferior test. The \nlives of many women who have yet to discover they have breast cancer \nmay hang in the balance.\n  Therefore, I look forward to HCFA establishing a reasonable price at \nwhich reimbursement can be made under Medicare for those women on \nMedicare or Medicaid who seek a breast examination by use of digital \nmammography, the new emerging science, rather than one that is film \nbased.\n  I thank the Chair.

Mr. President, I rise today to draw attention to a \ngroup of federal officers who carry out a vital mission and provide \ncritical services, but are largely unknown to people not in the law \nenforcement community. I am referring to the men and women of the \nUnited States Park Police.\n  An agency within the Department of Interior, the United States Park \nPolice traces its lineage back to 1791 when then President George \nWashington established a force of ``Park Watchmen''. In subsequent \nyears, the authority of what has become the Park Police has been \nexpanded so that today, that department is responsible for providing \ncomprehensive police services in the National Capital Region. \nFurthermore, they have jurisdiction in all National Park Service Areas, \nas well as other designated Federal/State lands.\n  While you will find their officers in New York City and the Golden \nGate National Recreation Area in San Francisco, the bulk of the \nofficers and duties of the United States Park Police are right here in \nthe National Capital Region. Park Police officers provide a multitude \nof services ranging from patrol to criminal investigation and from \ncounter-terrorism to helping to protect the President. They are \nresponsible for patrolling and providing police services in 22% of the \ngeographic area of the District of Columbia, which includes all the \nnational monuments; as well as, Rock Creek Park, National Parklands in \nthe Capital Region, and 300 miles of parkways in the District of \nColumbia, Maryland, and Virginia.\n  The United States Park Police is a tremendous asset, but I am deeply \nconcerned that due to a lack of adequate funding, it is an asset that \nis losing its edge. Make no mistake, I question not the leadership of \nthe Park Police nor the brave men and women who serve selflessly as \nofficers and support personnel in that agency. Chief Langston and his \nofficers will do yeoman's work no matter how well or how poorly funded \ntheir agency is, they are professionals and committed to protecting the \npublic. I am worried that the Department of Interior lacks a commitment \nto providing sufficient funds to the law enforcement operations that \nfall under the authority of the Secretary of the Interior. The Park \nPolice is now 179 officers below its authorized strength of 806 \nofficers. Furthermore, it is an agency that loses approximately 50 \nofficers a year either through retirement or lateral transfers. It is \nunderstandable that it is difficult for some Park Police Officers to \nresist the higher pay of other agencies, especially when you consider \nthat over a 30-year period, a United States Park Police Officer makes \napproximately $135,429 less than what the average salary is for \nofficers at other agencies in this area. In addition to being \nshorthanded, equipment, from the officers' sidearms to the agency's \nradio equipment is antiquated and in need of replacement. The Park \nPolice needs our help.\n  It is truly a shame that the Park Police is facing the challenges it \nis today and we are in a position to do something about it. The men and \nwomen who serve as Park Police Officers have not had a raise since \n1990, and we should support legislation that will give them a much \nneeded pay boost. In an era when it is harder and harder to attract \nqualified individuals into public service, let alone a life threatening \nprofession such as law enforcement, it is vital we do something to \nreward those who already serve, as well as, to attract new officers to \nan agency that provides services that keep the Capital Region safe.\n  It might sound cliche, but the United States Park Police is there \nwhen they are needed. They are there when someone suffers an emergency \nin the waters around Great Falls, they are on the parkways when someone \nis in need of assistance, and they are on the Mall keeping visitors to \nWashington safe. They were there when the tragic shooting took place in \nthis building, and they landed their helicopter on the plaza outside \nthe Capitol in a valiant attempt to get a wounded United States Capitol \nPolice Officer transported to a local trauma center as quickly as \npossible. Giving the officers of the United States Park Police a raise \nis not going to solve all of that agency's needs, but it will help \nrecruit and retain personnel. More importantly, it is the right thing \nto do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/03/senate-section/article/S9684-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9684-S9685]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION BILL\n\n\n                              Section 303\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, section 303 of S. 2507, the Intelligence \nAuthorization bill, as amended by the managers' amendment, establishes \na new criminal offense for the unauthorized disclosure of properly \nclassified information. Existing criminal statues generally require an \nintent to benefit a foreign power or are limited to disclosures of only \nsome types of classified information. Administrative sanctions have \nconstituted the penalty for most other leaks.\n  While I support the basic objective of this provision, we must ensure \nthat it will not be used in a capricious manner or in a manner that \nharms our democratic institutions.\n  I see two respects in which some caution is merited. First, it could \nbe applied to trivial cases. I believe that former Secretary of Defense \nCaspar Weinberger once said that he told everything to his wife. If his \ndiscussions with his wife included classified information, he surely \nwould have violated the letter of this bill. But so-called ``pillow \ntalk'' to one's spouse is common, and I don't think we mean to throw \npeople in jail for incidental talk to a person who has no intent either \nto use the classified information, to pass it on to others, or to \npublish it.\n  Mr. SHELBY. The Senator from Delaware is correct. The Committee \nexpects that the Justice Department will use its prosecutorial \ndiscretion wisely. In some cases, administrative remedies are clearly \nmore appropriate. In each case however--as under all criminal laws--\nprosecutors will need to judge whether criminal charges are warranted.\n  Mr. BIDEN. My second concern is that section 303 not be used as a \njustification for investigations of journalists. Our republic depends \nupon a free press to inform the American people of significant issues, \nincluding issues relating to foreign policy and the national security. \nIf a leak statute were to become a back door for bringing the \ninvestigate apparatus of the federal government to bear on the press, \nwe would be sacrificing our democratic institutions for the sake of \nprotecting a few secrets. Much as we are dedicated to the protection of \nclassified information, that would be a terribly bad bargain.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I agree with the Senator from Delaware 100 percent, and I \ncan assure this body that in passing section 303, no member of the \nSelect Committee on Intelligence intended that it be used as an excuse \nfor investigating the press. That is why the scope of this provision is \nlimited to persons who disclose, or attempt to disclose, classified \ninformation acquired\n\n[[Page S9685]]\n\nas a result of authorized access to such information. Such persons have \na duty to protect classified information has no right to disclose that \nparticular information to persons not authorized to receive it, \npersons, even if he or she should later become a journalist. By the \nsame token, however, the statute is not intended to lead to \ninvestigation or prosecution of journalists who previously had \nauthorized access to classified information and later, in their \ncapacity as journalist, receive leaked information.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/03/senate-section/article/S9685-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9685-S9687]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE COUNTERINTELLIGENCE REFORM ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to discuss \nlegislation arising from the investigation by the Senate Judiciary \nSubcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, which has been \nconducting oversight on the way the Department of Justice and the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation have responded to allegations of \nespionage in the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy. \nThis bipartisan proposal will improve the counterintelligence \nprocedures used to detect and defeat efforts by foreign governments to \ngain unlawful access to our top national security information by \nimproving the way that allegations of espionage are investigated and, \nwhere appropriate, prosecuted.\n  Together with Senators Torricelli, Grassley, Thurmond, Sessions, \nSchumer, Feingold, Biden, Helms and Leahy, I introduced the \nCounterintelligence Reform Act on February 24 of this year. The \nJudiciary Committee unanimously reported the bill on May 18, and it was \nreferred to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence which also \ndeals with espionage matters.\n  The Senate Intelligence Committee unanimously reported the bill on \nJuly 20, and has included the measure as an amendment to the \nIntelligence Authorization bill which passed the Senate today.\n  Few tasks are more important than protecting our national security, \nso building and maintaining bipartisan support for this legislation to \ncorrect the problems we identified during the course of our oversight \nwas my top priority. The reforms contained in this legislation will \nensure that the problems we found are fixed, and that the national \nsecurity is better protected in the future.\n  To understand why this legislation is necessary, I would like to \nreview two of the cases that the subcommittee looked at--the Wen Ho Lee \ncase and the Peter Lee case. Former Los Alamos scientist Dr. Wen Ho Lee \nwas arrested on December 10, 1999, and charged with 59 counts of \nviolating the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and unlawful gathering and \nretention of national defense information. In a stunning reversal on \nSeptember 13, the government accepted a deal in which Dr. Lee would \nplead guilty to one count of unlawfully retaining national defense \ninformation and would be sentenced to time served, in exchange for \ntelling what he had done with the tapes. There remains a question as to \nwhether Department of Justice officials tried to make up for their \nblunders in this case by throwing the book at Dr. Lee. The Judiciary \nSubcommittee on Department of Justice Oversight will continue to hold \nhearings on this matter, but it has been clear from the beginning that \nthe Department of Justice bungled the investigation of Dr. Lee.\n  The critical turning point in this case came on August 12, 1997, when \nthe Department of Justice's Office of Intelligence Policy and Review \n(OIPR) turned down an FBI application for an electronic surveillance \nwarrant under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA. OIPR \nbelieved that the application was deficient because it did not show \nsufficient probable cause, and therefore decided not to let the \napplication go forward to the special FISA court.\n  In making this determination, the DoJ made several key errors. The \nDepartment of Justice used an unreasonably high standard for \ndetermining probable cause, a standard that is inconsistent with \nSupreme Court rulings on this issue. For example, one of the concerns \nraised by OIPR attorney Allan Kornblum was that the FBI had not shown \nthat the Lees were the ones who passed the W-88 information to the PRC, \nto the exclusion of all the other possible suspects identified by the \nDoE Administrative Inquiry. That is the standard for establishing guilt \nat a trial, not for establishing probable cause to issue a search \nwarrant.\n\n  DoJ was also wrong when Mr. Kornblum concluded that there was not \nenough to show that the Lees were ``presently engaged in clandestine \nintelligence activities.'' The information provided by the FBI made it \nclear that Dr. Lee's relevant activities continued from the 1980s to \n1992, 1994 and 1997, yet that was deemed to be too stale, and the DoJ \nrefused to send the FBI's surveillance request to the FISA court.\n  When FBI Assistant Director John Lewis raised the FISA problem with \nthe Attorney General on August 20, 1997, she delegated a review of the \nmatter to Mr. Dan Seikaly, who had virtually no experience in FISA \nissues. It is not surprising then, that Mr. Seikaly again applied the \nwrong standard for probable cause. He used the criminal standard, which \nrequires that the facility in question be used in the commission of an \noffense, and with which he was more familiar, rather than the relevant \nFISA standard which simply requires that the facility ``is being used, \nor is about to be used, by a foreign power or an agent of a foreign \npower.''\n  The importance of DoJ's erroneous interpretation of the law as it \napplied to probable cause in this case should not be underestimated. \nHad the warrant been issued, and had the FBI been permitted to conduct \nelectronic surveillance on Dr. Lee, the Government would probably not \nbe in the position--as it is now--of trying to ascertain what really \nhappened to the information that Dr. Lee downloaded. There should be no \ndoubt that transferring classified information to an unclassified \ncomputer system and making unauthorized tape copies of that \ninformation--seven of which contain highly classified information and \nremain unaccounted for--created a substantial opportunity for foreign \nintelligence services to access our most important nuclear secrets.\n  The FISA warrant could have and should have been issued at several \npoints, some before and some after it was rejected in 1997. Each key \nevent where the FISA warrant was not requested and issued represents \nanother lost opportunity to protect the national security. For example, \nDr. Lee was identified by the Department of Energy's Network Anomaly \nDetection and Intrusion Recording system (NADIR) in 1993 for having \ndownloaded a huge volume of files.\n  As the name of the system implies, it is designed to detect unusual \ncomputer activity and look out for possible intruders into the \ncomputer. Individuals who monitored the lab's computers knew that Dr. \nLee's activities had generated a report from the NADIR system, but \ndidn't do anything about it. They didn't even talk to him. An \nopportunity to correct a problem, to protect national security, just \nslipped away.\n  In 1994, Lee's massive downloading would have again showed up on \nNADIR, but DoE security people never took action. Now, we're told, they \ncan't even find records of what happened. Yet another missed \nopportunity to protect the national security by looking into what was \ngoing on.\n  When Wen Ho Lee took a polygraph in December 1998, DoE misrepresented \nthe results of this test to the FBI. DoE told the FBI that Dr. Lee \npassed this polygraph when, in fact, he had failed. This error sent the \nFBI off the trail for two months.\n\n  When Wen Ho Lee failed a polygraph on February 10, 1999, the FISA \nwarrant should have been immediately requested and granted. It wasn't.\n  The need for legislation to address these problems is obvious. The \nunclassified information on this case shows clearly that it was \nmishandled. The classified files make that point even more clear. Last \nyear the Attorney General asked an Assistant U.S. Attorney with \nsubstantial experience in prosecuting espionage cases to review the Wen \nHo Lee matter. That prosecutor, Mr. Randy Bellows, conducted a thorough \nreview of the case and confirmed all of our major findings: the case \nwas badly mishandled, the FISA request should have gone forward to the \ncourt. The list goes on. Our counter-intelligence system failed in this \ncase, and the information at risk\n\n[[Page S9686]]\n\nis too important to let this dismal state of affairs continue.\n  The Counterintelligence Reform Act of 2000 will help to ensure that \nfuture investigations are conducted in a more thorough and effective \nmanner. Among the key provisions in this legislation is one that amends \nthe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, FISA, by requiring that, \nupon the request of the Director of the FBI, the Secretary of State, \nthe Secretary of Defense or the Director of Central Intelligence, the \nAttorney General shall personally review a FISA application. If the \nAttorney General decides not to forward the application to the FISA \ncourt, that decision must be communicated in writing to the requesting \nofficial, with recommendations for improving the showing of probable \ncause, or whatever defect OIPR is concerned with.\n  Under this legislation, when a senior official who is authorized to \nmake FISA requests goes to the Attorney General for a personal review, \nthat senior official must personally supervise the implementation of \nthe recommendations. This provision will ensure that when the national \nsecurity is at stake, and where there is a serious disagreement over \nhow to proceed, the Attorney General and other senior officials are the \nones who work together to resolve disputes, and that the matter is not \ndelegated to attorneys who have never worked with FISA before.\n  The Counterintelligence Reform Act also addresses the matter of \nwhether an individual is ``presently engaged'' in a particular activity \nto ensure that genuine acts of espionage which are belatedly discovered \nare not improperly eliminated from consideration. As FISA is currently \nworded, it is possible for someone like Mr. Kornblum to conclude that \nactions as recent as a couple of years ago or even a few months are too \nstale to contribute to a finding of probable cause. Although I do not \nagree with Mr. Kornblum's interpretation of the law, I am confident \nthat the changes contained in the Counterintelligence Reform Act will \nmake it clear that activities within a reasonable period of time can be \nconsidered in determining probable cause.\n  The investigation of Dr. Lee was also mishandled in the field, where \nthe FBI and the Department of Energy often failed to communicate. For \nexample, after OIPR rejected the FBI's 1997 FISA application, the FBI \ntold the Department of Energy that there was no longer an investigative \nreason to leave Dr. Lee in place, and that the DoE should do whatever \nwas necessary to protect the national security. Unfortunately, no \naction was taken by DoE until December 1998, some 14 months after the \nFBI had said it was no longer necessary to have him in place for \ninvestigative reasons.\n  To address this problem, and to ensure that there is no \nmisunderstanding about when the subject of an espionage investigation \nshould be removed from classified access, the Counterintelligence \nReform Act requires that decisions of this nature be communicated in \nwriting. The bill requires the Director of the FBI to submit to the \nhead of the department or agency concerned a written assessment of the \npotential impact of the actions of the department or agency on a \ncounterintelligence investigation. The head of the affected agency will \nbe required to respond in writing to the recommendation of the FBI. \nThis requirement with ensure that what happened in the Wen Ho Lee \ncase--where the FBI said he could be removed from access but the Energy \nDepartment didn't pull his clearance for another 14 months--won't \nhappen again.\n  To avoid the kind of problems that happened when the DoE ordered a \nWackenhut polygraph in December 1998, this legislation prohibits \nagencies from interfering in FBI espionage investigations.\n  The provisions of this bill will make an important contribution to \nimproving the way counter-intelligence investigations are conducted. \nThe subcommittee's investigation of the Wen Ho Lee case has made it \nabundantly clear that improvements in these procedures are necessary, \nand the reforms outlined in this legislation are specifically tailored \nto provide real solutions to real problems.\n  The subcommittee also looked at the espionage case of Dr. Peter Lee, \nwho pleaded guilty in 1997 to passing classified nuclear secrets to the \nChinese in 1985. According to a 17 February 1998 ``Impact Statement'' \nprepared by experts from the Department of Energy,\n\n       The ICF data provided by Dr. [Peter] Lee was of significant \n     material assistance to the PRC in their nuclear weapons \n     development program. . . . For that reason, this analysis \n     indicates that Dr. Lee's activities have directly enhanced \n     the PRC nuclear weapons program to the detriment of U.S. \n     national security.\n\n  Dr. Peter Lee also confessed to giving the Chinese classified anti-\nsubmarine warfare information on two occasions in 1997. Under the terms \nof the plea agreement the Department of Justice offered to Peter Lee, \nhowever, he got no jail time. He served one year in a half-way house, \ndid 3,000 hours of community service and paid a $20,000 fine. \nConsidering the magnitude of his offenses and his failure to comply \nwith the terms of the plea agreement--which required his complete \ncooperation--the interests of the United States were not served by this \noutcome.\n  The subcommittee's review of the Peter Lee case led to the inevitable \nconclusion that better coordination between the Department of Justice, \nthe investigating agency--which is normally the FBI--and the victim \nagency is necessary to ensure that the process works to protect the \nnational security. One of the problems we saw in this case was the \nreluctance of the Department of the Navy to support the prosecution of \nDr. Peter Lee. A Navy official, Mr. John Schuster, produced a memo that \nseriously undermined the Department of Justice's efforts to prosecute \nthe case. This memorandum was based on incomplete information and did \nnot reflect the full scope of what Dr. Peter Lee confessed to having \nrevealed. As a consequence of the breakdown of communications between \nthe Navy and the prosecution team, the 1997 revelations were not \nincluded as part of the plea agreement.\n  This legislation contains a provision that will ensure better \ncoordination in espionage cases by requiring the Department of Justice \nto conduct briefings so that the affected agency will understand what \nis happening with the case, and will understand how the Classified \nInformation Procedures Act, or CIPA, can be used to protect classified \ninformation even while carrying out a prosecution. In these briefings \nDepartment of Justice lawyers will be required to explain the right of \nthe government to make in camera presentations to the judge and to make \ninterlocutory appeals of the judge's rulings. These procedures are \nunique to CIPA, and the affected agency needs to understand that taking \nthe case to trial won't necessarily mean revealing classified \ninformation. The Navy's position, as stated in the Schuster memo, that \n``bringing attention to our sensitivity concerning this subject in a \npublic forum could cause more damage to the national security that the \noriginal disclosure,'' was simply wrong. It was based on incomplete \ninformation and a misunderstanding of how the case could have been \ntaken to trial without endangering national security. The provisions of \nthis legislation which require the Department of Justice to keep the \nvictim agency fully and currently informed of the status of the \nprosecution, and to explain how CIPA can be used to take espionage \ncases to trial without damaging the national security, will ensure that \nthe mistakes of the Peter Lee case are not repeated.\n\n  I appreciate the efforts of my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee \nand the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence who have worked with me \nand the cosponsors of this bill. I am confident that the reforms we are \nabout to pass will significantly improve the way espionage cases are \ninvestigated and, if necessary, prosecuted.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                              section 305\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Section 305 of S. 32507, the Intelligence Authorization \nbill, provides, in brief, that no future ``Federal law . . . that \nimplements a treaty or other international agreement shall be construed \nas making unlawful an otherwise lawful and authorized intelligence \nactivity of the United States Government . . . unless such Federal law \nspecifically addresses such intelligence activity.'' This provision is \nnecessary, the Committee report explains, because ``[t]here has been a \nconcern that future legislation implementing international agreements\n\n[[Page S9687]]\n\ncould be interpreted, absent the enactment of section 305, as \nrestricting intelligence activities that are otherwise entirely \nconsistent with U.S. law and policy.'' The concern arises from an \nopinion issued in 1994 by the Office of Legal Council (OLC) of the \nDepartment of Justice. In that opinion, the Office interpreted the \nAircraft Sabotage Act of 1984--a law implementing an international \ntreaty on civil aviation safety--as applying to government personnel. \nAlthough the OLC opinion emphasized that its conclusions should ``not \nbe exaggerated'' and also warned that its opinion ``should not be \nunderstood to mean that other domestic criminal statutes apply to \nU[nited S[tates] G[overnment] personnel acting officially,'' the \nCentral Intelligence Agency, out of an abundance of caution, wants to \navoid cases in which legislation implementing a treaty might \ncriminalize an authorized intelligence activity even though Congress \ndid not so expressly provide. I understand the Agency's concern that \nclarity for its agents is important. At the same time, however, we \nshould take care to specify how section 305 is intended to work.\n  One question is this: how do we tell when a Federal law actually \n``implements a treaty or other international agreement?'' My working \nassumption, in supporting section 305, is that we will be able to tell \nwhether a future law ``implements a treaty or other international \nagreement'' by reading the law and the committee reports that accompany \nits passage. If the text of that future law or of the committee reports \naccompanying that bill states that the statute is intended to implement \na treaty or other international agreement, then section 305 is \npertinent to that statute. If there is no mention of such intent in \nthat future law or in its accompanying reports, however, then we may \nsafely infer that section 305 does not apply. Is that the understanding \nof the Select Committee on Intelligence, as well?\n  Mr. SHELBY. That is certainly our intent. If a future law is to \nqualify under section 305 of this bill, we would expect its status as \nimplementing legislation to be stated in the law, or some other \ncontemporaneous legislative history.\n  Mr. BIDEN. another question is how to tell that a U.S. intelligence \nactivity ``is authorized by an appropriate official of the United \nStates Government, acting within the scope of the official duties of \nthat official and in compliance with Federal law and any applicable \nPresidential directive.'' I am concerned that this could be \nmisinterpreted to mean that some intelligence bureaucrat could \nauthorize some otherwise illegal activity with a wink and a nod. It is \nnot the intent of the Select Committee on Intelligence that there be \nwritten authorization for a U.S. intelligence activity?\n  Mr. SHELBY. I understand the concerns of the Senator from Delaware. \nWe expect that in almost all cases intelligence operations exempted \nfrom future treaty-implementing legislation will have been authorized \nin writing. I would note however, that many individual actions might be \nauthorized through general written policies, rather than case-specific \nauthorizations.\n  Neither would I rule oral authorization in exigent circumstances. The \nCommittee believes that intelligence agencies would be well advised to \nmake written records of such authorizations, so as to guard against lax \nmanagement or later assertions that unrecorded authorization was given \nfor a person's otherwise unlawful actions. Such written records will \nalso protect the government employees from allegations that their \nactions were not authorized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. My final question to the chairman of the Select Committee \non Intelligence relates to how other countries may view section 305. I \ninterpret section 305 as governing only the interpretation of a certain \nset of U.S. criminal laws enacted in the future and whether those laws \napply to government officials. Is that also the understanding of the \nchairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Yes, it is. Section 305 deals solely with the application \nof U.S. law to U.S. Intelligence activities. It does not address the \nquestion of the lawfulness of such activities under the laws of foreign \ncountries, and it is in no respect meant to suggest that a person \nviolating the laws of the United States may claim the purported \nauthorization of a foreign government to carry out those activities as \njustification or as a defense in a prosecution for violation of U.S. \nlaws.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the distinguished chairman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/03/senate-section/article/S9687-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9687]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SUBMITTING CHANGES TO THE BUDGETARY AGGREGATES AND APPROPRIATIONS \n                          COMMITTEE ALLOCATION\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, on July 2, 2000, the people of Mexico \nelected Vincente Fox, candidate of the National Action Party, to be \ntheir President. This election represents a dramatic change and a \nhistoric affirmation of democracy in Mexico. The inauguration of Mr. \nFox later this year will end 71 years of PRI control of the Mexican \nPresidency.\n\n[[Page S9688]]\n\n  I want to join other Members of congress in expressing my \ncongratulations to Mr. Fox and the people of Mexico. I also want to \ncommend President Zedillo, whose leadership helped to ensure the freest \nand fairest election in Mexico's history.\n  Mr. Fox's election has significance far beyond Mexico's borders. It \nrepresents an historic opportunity for our two countries to redefine, \nbroaden and strengthen our relationship.\n  It is a relationship that has been burdened by history, and plagued \nby distrust, arrogance, and misunderstanding. There have been times \nwhen it seemed that on issues of hemispheric or international \nimportance Mexico embraced whatever position was the opposite of the \nUnited States position, simply because we are the United States. At \nother times, our country has treated Mexico like a second-class cousin \nonce or twice removed.\n  Problems that can only be solved through cooperation have too often \nbeen addressed with fences and sanctions, and self-serving assertions \nof sovereignty. It is time for a new approach. There is far too much at \nstake for us to continue down the road of missed opportunities.\n  Mexico is our neighbor, our friend, and our strategic partner. We \nshare a 2,000-mile border. We have strong economic ties, with a two-way \nannual trade of $174 billion. We have a common interest in combating \ntransnational problems, and we have strong cultural bonds, as more than \n20 million people of Mexico descent now live in the United States.\n  At present, there are several issues between the two countries that \ndeserve immediate attention:\n  After more than 6 years, the situation in Chipas remains unresolved. \nMany innocent lives have been lost and thousands of people are \ndisplaced and living in squalor. Tens of thousands of Mexican troops \nhave surrounded the area, which could explode in renewed violence at \nany time. There is an urgent need to demilitarize the area and embark \non an enlightened, sustained, good faith process to address the \nunderlying social, economic, and political issues and resolve this \nconflict peacefully.\n  Since the implementation of NAFTA, trade between our countries has \ndoubled. While NAFTA has been beneficial for both nations, reports of \nviolations of labor and environmental laws must be more effectively \naddressed and outstanding trade disputes must be resolved.\n  The Mexican Government has made progress in combating illegal \nnarcotics trafficking by undertaking a number of measures, including \nfiring more than 1400 federal police officers for corruption, \ncooperating with the FBI last year on an investigation that occurred on \nMexican soil, and increasing seizures of illegal narcotics. However, \nmajor problems remain and far more needs to be done to reduce narco-\ntrafficking and official corruption in Mexico.\n  Illegal immigration continues to be a major concern for both \ncountries. Although we must be sure that our immigration laws are \neffectively and fairly enforced, a long-term solution can only be \nachieved by improving the quality of life in Mexico where half the \npopulation--some 50 million people--struggles to survive on $2 per day.\n  With thousands of United States and Mexican citizens traveling back \nand forth across the border every day, the spread of HIV/AIDS, TB and \nother infectious diseases is inevitable. These health problems, and \nshared environmental problems, can only be effectively addressed if we \nwork together.\n  Human rights is another issue of importance to the Mexican people, \nand to Americans. These are universal rights, and it is very disturbing \nto read reports by the State Department and respected human rights \norganizations of widespread torture by Mexican police. It is also \nunacceptable that American citizens, including priests, some of whom \nhave lived and worked in Mexico for decades, have been summarily \ndeported for as little as being present at a demonstration against \nexcessive force by the Mexican Army. Even when the Inter-American Human \nRights Commission rejected the Mexican Government's arguments in these \ncases, the Mexican Government has refused to change its policy.\n  On August 24, 2000, President-elect Fox came to the United States, \nwhere he met with President Clinton and Vice President Gore. During \nthose meetings, Mr. Fox expressed a strong commitment to democracy, \neconomic development, and human rights, and to cooperate with the \nUnited States to combat corruption, illicit drug trafficking, and other \ntransnational threats.\n  This bodes well for our future relationship. I hope that we would \nsoon invite President-elect Fox to address a joint session of Congress. \nThis should happen as soon as possible after the 107th convenes in \nJanuary. Congress has had a major role in shaping United States policy \ntoward Mexico, and we would all benefit from hearing directly from Mr. \nFox. It would also give him an opportunity to outline in more detail \nhis proposals to address key issues that affect our relations.\n  Like many Americans I was very encouraged by Vincente Fox's election, \nand am confident that he will be a strong partner of the United States. \nI look forward to making the most of this opportunity to strengthen the \nUnited States-Mexico relationship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/03/senate-section/article/S9688-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9688]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           AIR FORCE MEMORIAL\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my displeasure \nand disappointment that two of the four major broadcast networks--NBC \nand Fox, have decided not to broadcast nationally, the presidential \ndebate scheduled tonight between the Democratic and Republican \ncandidates for President.\n  This election is likely to be among the closest national races in the \nlast twenty years. In exchange for the use of spectrum without the \nimposition of a fee, broadcasters have to fulfill their public interest \nobligation. I do not believe it is too much to presume that showing \nvital news information such as a presidential debate is encompassed in \na broadcaster's public interest obligation.\n  Instead of showing the debate, NBC is showing a divisional wildcard \nplayoff baseball game, although they are apparently permitting their \naffiliates to broadcast the debate, if they so choose. Even more \nappalling, Fox is showing its new science fiction series produced by \nits own studio--Dark Angel--which I understand is particularly violent.\n  On Sunday, the Washington Post ran a story entitled--``Even Hits can \nMiss in TV's New Economy.'' That article outlined the enormous \nincentives the Networks have to air programs in which they possess a \nvested financial interest. I quote--\n\n       Just as a supermarket might reserve its best shelf space \n     for its house brands, the networks have begun to favor their \n     in house programs over shows created by others, which are \n     often less profitable in the long term.\n\n  There it is Mr. President. Money trumps the political process once \nagain. Fox has likely spent millions of dollars to develop and promote \nits new series, and NBC likely spent a significant amount of money to \nacquire the rights to broadcast a baseball playoff game. But Mr. \nPresident, when networks choose their own programming or sports \nprogramming over an event as significant as tonight's debate, they fail \nto meet their public interest obligation. Having to reschedule a \nbaseball game or the debut of a new series created by their studios \ndoes not justify NBC or Fox precluding the public from having access to \nthe presidential debates. I understand that one network, ABC, decided \nto postpone the debut of one of its new shows ``Gideon's Crossing'' by \none night so as to air tonight's debate. That is called honoring your \npublic interest obligation. By choosing not to air the debates, these \nother networks have undermined the integrity of the political process \nand our democracy, and engaged in a disrespect of the American \nelectorate.\n  The political process should be covered. The American people deserve \nsuch coverage. The grant of free spectrum worth billions of dollars to \nbroadcasters comes with a public interest obligation that requires them \nto inform the public of issues of vital importance--not simply to do \nwhat is financially expedient.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/03/senate-section/article/S9689-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     OLDER AMERICANS ACT AMENDMENTS\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor for the \nOlder Americans Act Amendments of 1999, which would authorize and \nexpand the programs first set up under the Older Americans Act of 1965.\n  The Older Americans Act authorizes a series of absolutely essential \nservices for our country's seniors. Among others, the Act provides \nnutrition services, legal assistance, disease promotion, elder abuse \nprevention, employment assistance, and numerous informational programs, \nincluding the long-term care ombudsmen. There is hardly a senior in \nthis country that is not touched, directly or indirectly, by one or \nmore of the provisions of the Older Americans Act. These programs have \nbecome an integral part of the infrastructure that helps keep our most \nexperienced citizens vital and constructive members of society.\n  I am particularly pleased that this bill includes a much-needed new \nservice, the National Family Caregivers Program. The major medical \nadvances of the past 50 years have led not only to an overall aging of \nthe population but also to an increasing proportion of the elderly who \nare living with chronic diseases and disabilities. Many of these infirm \nelderly are cared for at home, putting a severe financial and emotional \nstrain on family caregivers. This new program will provide such \ncaregivers with a panoply of assistive services, including provision of \ninformation, assistance with access, counseling and training, respite \ncare, and other supplemental services (home care, personal care, adult \nday care).\n  It is absolutely essential to assist caregivers as much as possible \nin order to allow our infirm seniors to maintain their autonomy and \nsense of self-worth, to permit them to live in the company of their \nloved ones and in the least restrictive environment compatible with \ntheir needs. This is what our seniors fervently desire and it is the \nright thing to do; the likelihood that such programs will save the \ngovernment money in the long run is an added bonus.\n  There is little time left in this session of Congress, and there are \nmany things that must be finished before adjournment. Yet as we \nstruggle with our workload, I hope we can take a few minutes to find a \nway to pass the Older Americans Act Amendments this year, on behalf of \nall of our older loved ones.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/03/senate-section/article/S9689-3", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9689-S9690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   MEMPHIS POLICE DEPARTMENT AND AMERICA'S LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, two years ago this revered but relatively \ninsulated complex we affectionately call Capitol Hill was rocked by a \nlone gunman who shot his way through two security checkpoints and, in a \nrampage, not only terrorized tourists and staff but took the lives of \ntwo dedicated U.S. Capitol Police officers who died defending them and \nthe institution in which we all serve.\n  As a trauma surgeon, I am used to blood and death, but it is one \nthing to treat the result of violence in a hospital; quite another to \nwalk straight into its midst in a place you'd never expect. That day \nbrought home not only at what great risk these dedicated police \nofficers serve, but also how much we take their service--and their \ncourage--for granted.\n  But the U.S. Capitol Police are not the only ones who deserve our \nrespect and support. Every officer, in every city and town across \nAmerica, who walks a beat, patrols a street, intercepts a drug push, \nresponds to the call of an angry neighbor or spouse, or even pulls over \na speeding motorist, runs the same risk of death or serious injury from \nspontaneous violence that Officers Chestnut and Gibson faced that day. \nEach of those officers deserve our thanks and admiration, but most of \nall, they deserve our support.\n  That is why I have consistently fought for more Federal block grant \nfunds for local police departments, as well as the flexibility to use \nthose funds wherever they're needed most--not just to hire more police \nofficers, but to purchase the equipment or training they need to \nprotect not only the lives of our citizens--which they are more than \nwilling to do--but their own lives as well.\n  Three weeks ago, I had the honor of meeting with the Board of the \nMemphis Police Association in Memphis, Tennessee--a hard-working group \nof law enforcement officials who represent the 1,800 police men and \nwomen who respond to over 800,000 calls annually, protecting lives and \nproperty in Tennessee's largest city.\n  As always, they offered many constructive suggestions about how \nCongress might address a variety of law enforcement issues, including \nthe issues of recruitment and quality of life. As the people who man \nthe front lines in the war against crime and see first-hand the \nchallenge that faces all of us, their perspective is invaluable, and I \nhope to translate some of their ideas into legislation for the Senate's \nconsideration next year.\n  One of the advantages of being a U.S. Senator is the opportunity to \nundergo\n\n[[Page S9690]]\n\nextraordinary experiences one would otherwise never have. Getting to \nspend time with the men and women who have made law enforcement their \nlife's work--the officers, the sheriffs, and others--is one such \nextraordinary experience, and it always humbles me to witness their \ncourage and dedication up close. They work long hours away from their \nfamilies, often at great personal risk, and endure low salaries and \nyears of stress at work and at home to make our lives safer and easier. \nAnd I, for one, wish to acknowledge the men and women of the Memphis \nPolice Department, and all law enforcement personnel in Tennessee and \nacross America, for the selfless work they do.\n  We who work every day in this symbol of democracy are fortunate, \nbecause we get to know the men and women of the U.S. Capitol Police on \na personal basis. We greet them every day, we witness their dedication \nto duty, they inquire after us and our families, they become our \nfriends. Long after Officers Gibson and Chestnut were laid to rest, we \nremember still their warmth and their many kindnesses, their lives and \ntheir heroic sacrifice. Unfortunately, other officers with just as much \ncourage and dedication to duty are not known by the people they \nprotect. But that does not mean they should be appreciated any less.\n  And it is not just the people of their communities who should \nappreciate them. As the representatives of those people in Washington, \nwe also must recognize America's police men and women for what they \nare--American heros--and do whatever we can to support their efforts on \nour behalf.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/03/senate-section/article/S9690-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  GLOBAL DISASTER INFORMATION NETWORK\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to commend employees of the many \nFederal departments and agencies responsible for the impressive \npreliminary work on establishing a Global Disaster Information Network, \nGDIN.\n  As a member of the Governmental Affairs Committee, which authorizes \nthe Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, I take a keen interest \nin the way in which institutions in the federal government respond to \ndisasters. I am struck by the tremendous potential advanced \ntechnologies, including satellite imaging, the Worldwide Web, and \ncomputer data systems can play in improving our responsiveness to \nnatural disasters.\n  Much of the credit is due to the visionary leadership of Vice \nPresident Gore for directing GDIN's development and for recognizing the \npotential for harnessing current day technologies in an unprecedented \nand innovative way.\n  GDIN represents a coordinated effort among the Nation's federal \ndisaster agencies, intelligence agencies, the National Aeronautics and \nSpace Administration, academia, and industry, and their international \ncounterparts, to utilize existing and emerging information technology \nmore effectively to provide key decision makers with information \ncritical for reducing loss from natural disasters. As a result of GDIN, \nthe availability of critical disaster response, recovery, mitigation \nand preparedness information is now greater than ever before.\n  Domestic disasters are estimated to cost an average of $54.3 billion, \ncausing 510 deaths per year. International disasters kill more than \n133,000 people and cost more than $440 billion in property damage. The \nadded costs of widespread human suffering and political instability are \nincalculable.\n  The current capabilities of GDIN are impressive, but future \ncapabilities and possibilities hold even greater promise. GDIN's \ndevelopment exemplifies the best international collaborative efforts \nbetween government and industry and illustrates the innovation possible \nonly in this great technological age. Surprisingly, GDIN has received \nscant attention by the American public or the media.\n  Prior to GDIN, there was no common approach to accessing a single \nsource for the broad range of information needed for natural disaster \nreduction or aids to help integrate information from many diverse \nsources. Relevant information was difficult to locate or use \neffectively. Disaster managers worldwide were consistently frustrated \nby poor telecommunications and inadequate infrastructure.\n  In February 1997, Vice President Gore wrote to key Federal \ndepartments and agencies requesting a feasibility study for \nestablishing a global disaster information network, through the \nintegration of the Internet and other emerging technologies, to improve \npreparedness and responsiveness to natural or environmental disasters. \nA Federal task force was formed to explore public/private partnerships \nto make the concept a reality. In April 2000, President Clinton issued \nExecutive Order 13151, formally creating GDIN and setting operational \nobjectives.\n  A key objective of GDIN is to promote the United States as an example \nand leader in the development and dissemination of disaster \ninformation, both domestically and abroad, and to seek cooperation with \nforeign governments and international organizations. Continued Federal \nleadership is essential to its continued success. The creation of a \nhighly sophisticated and widely distributed knowledge base, \nencompassing common systems of measurements, methods of data \nvisualization and exploitation, information analysis, event \nforecasting, knowledge modeling, and data and information management, \nremains key to successful future development.\n  For example, in 1997, the region of Grand Forks, North Dakota \nsuffered losses greater than $400 million when the Red River rose. In \norder to predict flood areas accurately, we need a system that can \noverlay information not only on water levels and rates but also the \nsurrounding infrastructure of levies and roads, which affect the flow \nof water.\n  A positive example of data integration was in the 1996 fire in \nMendocino, California, in which data from the Landsat Thematic Mapper, \nDigital Elevation Models, infrared scanners, information from National \nTechnical Means, and field reports were used to assess fire damage, as \nwell as the potential for erosion and new growth. Additional \ninformation on rangeland, wildlife habitats, and recreational needs \nwere included to build a comprehensive plan for re-vegetation resulting \nin a plan by the U.S. Forest Service, which is estimated to have saved \n$250 million by more efficient planting.\n  These are isolated examples. The program, both nationally and \ninternationally, is still in its infancy. The information is there but \nthe way to access it is still a work in progress. Unfortunately, on the \ndomestic front there has been a lack of support in some circles for \nthis program. Such lack of support is deplorable. The need to find more \neffective ways to respond to disasters in the United States must be \nabove partisan politics.\n  We live in truly amazing times. Rapid improvements in communications, \nthe Internet, space imagery, remote sensing, global positioning \ntechnologies, and early warning forecasting hold promise to continue to \nrevolutionize disaster management and therefore save lives and reduce \nhuman suffering in very significant ways.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/03/senate-section/article/S9690-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9690-S9691]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          ORGANIZED LABOR AND PNTR--NOT A MONOLITHIC APPROACH\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, a week ago I met with a national \nworkforce coalition of unions that came out in support of establishing \nPermanent Normal Trading Relations with China. I had encountered some \nof the labor leaders who belong to this coalition on several other \noccasions, including at the Republican National Convention in \nPhiladelphia in August. I simply rise today to note for my colleagues \nthat organized labor in this country is not monolithic in their views \non such matters as trade and protectionism.\n  The members of the coalition I met with last week came primarily from \nthe aerospace industry in the Pacific Northwest, building the jet \nairplanes, engines, and other aerospace subsystems that are competing \nglobally with the likes of Europe's Airbus. However, I have previously \nmet members of this coalition that extend beyond the aerospace industry \nand the Pacific Northwest. They represent such traditional \nmanufacturing industries as steel, aluminum, diesel engines, farm \nequipment, and rail locomotives. They\n\n[[Page S9691]]\n\nrepesent a diverse array of the American workforce--everything from \nproduction workers on the line to engineers and scientists. And they \nare from across this great nation.\n  The message these union officials had was that they understood that \nChina was a burgeoning market for U.S. exports. They understood that if \nthe U.S. did not approve PNTR for China that we would not only lose the \ntrade concessions they have made to us under this agreement, but we \nwould also lose our ability to gain greater market access and share. \nAnd they understood that the largest beneficiary of such an outcome \nwould be our trade competitors in the European Community, in the rest \nof Asia, and in South America. They understood that one of the best \nways to guarantee that American firms remain in the United States--\nemploying American workers and bolstering our economic growth--was to \neliminate the existing trade barriers that have served to up until now \nto freeze out our products or force U.S. companies to move facilities \nover to China.\n  Without removing these barriers and liberalizing trade between the \nU.S. and China, American firms seeking to compete with their foreign \ncompetitors would have every incentive to move their factories and \noperations over to China. With PNTR and China's entry into the World \nTrading Organization we increase the likelihood that American companies \nwill continue to remain located in the United States. And that is good \nnews for the union workers and households in the state of Michigan \nwhich will continue to produce a wide array of goods that will be \nexported to China.\n  As I pointed out in a statement I made on the floor supporting PNTR, \nexports from Michigan to China increased 25 percent between 1993 and \n1998, and they have undoubtedly grown significantly greater since 1998. \nExports to China from businesses located in the Flint and Lansing areas \ngrew by 84 percent during that period. Meanwhile, exports to China from \nKalamazoo and Battle Creek grew by an extraordinary 353 percent! Not \nall of that business is going to union shops, but certainly a \nsignificant portion of it is, and that sort of expansion in trade with \nChina is going to benefit all workers and businesses in Michigan--union \nand non-union.\n  Clearly the majority of unions and union members in this country \nopposed PNTR for China. I heard from and spoke with many, many such \nworkers from Michigan--both back in Michigan and when the unions have \ncome out to Washington, DC, to meet with their representatives in \nCongress. I come from a union background and grew up in a union \nhousehold. I took their concerns very seriously in weighing the many \nissues that went into my ultimate decision to vote for PNTR. And I have \npledged to hold China accountable for their future behavior and to \nfulfill their trade obligations under the WTO's rules and the agreement \nwe have negotiated with them.\n  But there are indeed unions--rank-and-file members and leadership \nalike--who see the opportunity presented by PNTR and allowing China \ninto the WTO as a tremendous opportunity for the United States to \ncontinue to lead the world in productivity and in our economic \nstrength. They are prepared to answer the challenge posed by the global \neconomy and the opening of China's markets, and they recognize the \nbenefits which will result if we are leading the way into opening China \nto greater trade instead of sitting on the sidelines allowing our trade \ncompetitors to reap all the benefits.\n  We should not forget that the U.S. is a very diverse country and that \nno institution--including organized labor--is a monolithic force. There \nare folks on both sides of the issue, each feeling very strongly and \nvery sincerely that they are doing what is best for them and their \nbrethren.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senator \nHatch's resolution commemorating our Olympic athletes for the spirit, \nenthusiasm and patriotism they displayed in Sydney at the XXVII Summer \nGames. I am proud to represent a state that sent to Sydney two of the \nnation's most recognizable athletes, Marion Jones and Mia Hamm, as well \nas numerous other athletes who valiantly competed in these Olympic \ngames.\n  The nation's eyes were on Marion Jones as she set out to win an \nunprecedented five gold medals in Sydney. While Marion didn't win five \ngolds, she made us all proud with her commanding performance. She set a \ntrack and field record by winning more medals in a single Olympics than \nany other woman in history. Her three gold and two bronze medals have \nput Marion atop the track and field world. More important than winning \nher events, Marion accepted each of her medals with grace and style, \nepitomizing what Olympic competition is all about.\n  Mia Hamm has captivated children and adults alike with her charisma \nand passion for the game of soccer. Thousands of girls across North \nCarolina take to the soccer fields in hopes of being the next Mia Hamm. \nWatching Mia play in Sydney, I understand why. In the women's soccer \nsemifinals against Brazil, Mia was pushed, shoved and thrown to the \nground time and time again. She did not once complain, letting her \nactions speak louder than words by scoring the only goal of the match. \nThe United States Women's Soccer team went on to claim the silver \nmedal, led by other Tar Heels such as goal keeper Siri Mullinix of \nGreensboro and Carla Overbeck of Chapel Hill.\n  I am also extremely proud of other North Carolinians who competed in \nSydney. While these athletes haven't received the attention Mia Hamm \nand Marion Jones have, they are equally important and should be \ncommended for their accomplishments. Robert Costello of Southern Pines \ncompeted in equestrian events. Tim Montgomery and Jerome Young, both of \nRaleigh, Lynda Blutreich of Chapel Hill and Melissa Morrison of \nKannapolis competed in track and field. Charlie Ogletree of Columbia \ncompeted in sailing. Rich DeSelm of Charlotte swam in Sydney. Calvin \nBrock of Charlotte represented the United States in boxing. George \nHincapie and Fred Rodriguez both of Charlotte competed in cycling. \nHunter Kemper of Charlotte competed in the triathlon and Henry Nuzum of \nChapel Hill competed in rowing.\n  The United States should be proud of every athlete who competed in \nthe Olympics. I am especially proud of the North Carolinians who \nrepresented the United States in Sydney, and I am pleased to support \nthis resolution with them in mind.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/03/senate-section/article/S9691-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9691-S9692]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NATIONAL CRIME PREVENTION MONTH\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the \nstrong partnership between localities and the federal government in \npreventing crime across the United States. As my colleagues may know, \nOctober is recognized as ``National Crime Prevention Month.''\n  Earlier this year, the Federal Bureau of Investigation announced that \nserious crime had declined nationally for the eighth consecutive year. \nAlthough many reasons for this promising news can be cited, I believe \nthe efforts of state and local governments have caused a reduction in \ncrime rates. To ensure continued success, the federal government should \nnot impose additional mandates upon local communities that will only \nprevent the development of effective crime prevention programs.\n  During this session of the 106th Congress, I am pleased to have \nworked with Minnesota's public safety officials on a number of crime \nand drug abuse prevention initiatives. Most importantly, I am pleased \nthat the Fiscal Year 2001 Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations bill \nincludes $4 million for the State of Minnesota to develop a statewide \ncomputer network that will provide judicial and law enforcement \nagencies with universal access to critical information about criminal \noffenders at the time of their arrest, prosecution, sentencing, and \nduring other important proceedings. Information is the key to an \neffective and accountable criminal justice system. The Minnesota \nLegislature recently enacted legislation, known as ``Katie's Law,'' \nthat provides state funding for the development of this initiative.\n  I also believe it is essential that Congress do more to ensure that \nanti-drug resources reach the areas of our country where drug abuse and \ncrime is on the rise and the anti-drug resources of state and local law \nenforcement have been seriously strained. That is the situation facing \nlaw enforcement agencies\n\n[[Page S9692]]\n\nin my home state that have worked to combat methamphetamine production \nand trafficking throughout our communities--particularly in rural \nareas.\n  For more than a year, I have been working to address the rising \nmethamphetamine drug epidemic in Minnesota by having Minnesota \ndesignated as a High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, HIDTA. This \ndesignation will provide additional anti-meth resources to Minnesota \nand ensure better coordination of federal-state-local efforts at \ndefeating this threat to public safety. I am pleased that the Fiscal \nYear 2001 Treasury-Legislative Branch Appropriations bill includes \nfunding for new HIDTA designations, and a directive to the Office of \nNational Drug Control Policy that Minnesota must be among the first \nstates considered for HIDTA designation in the upcoming fiscal year.\n  My rural crime prevention agenda has included strong support for S. \n3009, the ``Rural Law Enforcement Assistance Act of 2000.'' The value \nof this legislation was brought to my attention by St. Cloud State \nUniversity Professor John Campbell and several Minnesota police chiefs \nand sheriffs. I greatly appreciate having the benefit of their \nexpertise. The Rural Law Enforcement Assistance Act would provide \nfunding to the National Center for Rural Law Enforcement to expand the \ntechnical assistance and training available to rural law enforcement \npersonnel. As a cosponsor of this bill, I am hopeful that rural \nMinnesota will soon establish a regional center that will bring the \nbenefits of these programs to our state.\n  During National Crime Prevention Month, it is also important to note \nthe impact the Violence Against Women Act, VAWA, has had upon the rate \nof domestic abuse, stalking, and sexual assault across the nation. \nSince its enactment, the VAWA has provided thousands of communities \nwith assistance to develop innovative and effective programs that have \ncontributed toward protecting individuals from sexual offenses and \ndomestic abuse.\n  In Minnesota, domestic violence shelters and centers have improved \ntheir services to victims of sexual, emotional, and physical abuse \nthrough such important programs as the Rural Domestic Violence and \nChild Abuse Enforcement Grant program and funding to combat violence \nagainst women on university campuses. Additionally, many domestic abuse \nvictims have benefited from the counseling and guidance provided \nthrough the National Domestic Violence Hotline established under the \nViolence Against Women Act. I am proud to be a cosponsor of legislation \nto reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act and expect that this \nlegislation will be passed before the 106th Congress adjourns.\n  Finally, I commend the dozens of Minnesota cities that are active \nparticipants in the ``National Night Out'' program. These neighborhood \nresidents have sent a strong message to criminals that our \nneighborhoods are organized and fighting back against the threat of \ncrime. Similar to the TRIAD seniors crime prevention program, National \nNight Out encourages increased citizen interaction with law enforcement \nofficers to prevent crime. I will continue to be a strong advocate in \nCongress for the National Night Out and TRIAD programs.\n  I am proud of the active involvement of our citizens in developing \ninnovative crime prevention initiatives. Their commitment to ensuring \nsafer streets and safer communities throughout our state has made \nMinnesota a better place to work and a better place to call home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/03/senate-section/article/S9692-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9692]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     CONFERENCE REPORT ON THE FY 2001 ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT \n                          APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n  Mr. L. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to share with my \ncolleagues my views on several items contained within the energy and \nwater conference report.\n  The FY 2001 Energy and Water Appropriations conference report \nincludes $24 billion in funding for the Department of Energy, civil \nprojects of the Army Corps of Engineers, the Department of Interior's \nBureau of Reclamation, and a number of independent agencies. I \nunderstand the difficulty of reaching a consensus on such a \ncomprehensive bill. I would like to thank the Managers of the \nlegislation for all their hard work in reaching this consensus.\n  I am particularly pleased with the nearly $4 million in funding \nincluded in the bill for a number of important Rhode Island coastal \nrestoration and water development projects. The bill contains $1.95 \nmillion in funding for authorized repairs to the Fox Point Hurricane \nBarrier. Since its construction in 1966, the barrier has provided \ncritical flood protection to the City of Providence. The bill contains \n$191,000 for Rhode Island Ecosystem Restoration to assist the Army \nCorps of Engineers and the Rhode Island Department of Environmental \nManagement to restore degraded salt marshes and freshwater wetlands, \nimprove overall fish and wildlife habitats, and restore anadramous \nfisheries. The bill also contains $54,000 for South Coast Erosion to \ncomplete feasibility study work on potential coastal protection \nprojects along the southern coastline of Rhode Island.\n  Additionally, the bill contains $584,000 in funding for the final \nEnvironmental Impact Statement and design work associated with \nmaintenance dredging of the Providence River and Harbor federal \nnavigation channel. The proposed maintenance dredging project involves \nthe removal of approximately four million cubic yards of material from \nthe Providence River and Harbor. The Environmental Impact Statement \nprocess will allow for full and open debate on the placement of dredge \nspoils from the project. We certainly cannot overlook the importance of \nprotecting and minimizing the impact on our environment, especially the \nimpact on our fisheries.\n  As we move into the heating season, funding Environmental Impact \nStatements for Providence Harbor dredging projects cannot be \noverstated. Specifically, until dredging Providence Harbor is \ncompleted, deep draft vessels carrying precious heating oil to Rhode \nIsland and other points in the Northeast will have to continue the \ndangerous and inefficient practice of off-loading their cargoes into \nsmall barges, in the middle of Narragansett Bay, for delivery to the \npierside terminals in Providence Harbor. Anyone who has experienced the \nfury of winter wind, ice, and rough waters on the Narragansett \nrecognizes this practice is an accident waiting to happen--one with \ndisastrous consequences.\n  While I voted in support of the conference report last night, I was \ndisappointed to find that the Missouri River provision I objected to \nduring Senate consideration of the bill was not removed during \nconference. I firmly object to this provision which would block funding \nfor consideration of one of the alternatives to the Missouri River \nMaster Water Control Manual. The targeted alternative would require \nseasonal river flow changes along the Missouri River in order to \nrecover three endangered species including the pallid sturgeon, \ninterior least tern, and piping plover. During my past year in the \nSenate, I have voted to remove environmental riders such as this one \nfrom appropriations bills. In my view, the Missouri River provision \ninappropriately transfers the decision regarding endangered species \nprotection along the Missouri River from the Army Corps of Engineers \nand the authorizing committees to the Senate and House Appropriations \nCommittees.\n  I was one of two Republican Senators that voted in favor of an \namendment offered by Senator Daschle and Senator Baucus to strike this \nprovision during Senate consideration of the FY 2001 Energy and Water \nDevelopment Appropriations bill. When the vote failed, however, I voted \nin favor of the legislation because of its important funding for Rhode \nIsland. The FY 2001 Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill, \nand the Missouri River provision contained within, passed \noverwhelmingly in the Senate by a vote of 93 to 1.\n  The legislation still has a probable Presidential veto. I am hopeful \nwe will be able to revisit the Missouri River provision before the end \nof this session, and ensure its elimination from the legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/03/senate-section/article/S9692-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9692-S9693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nextraordinary contributions of Nathaniel T. Cobb of Waterville, Maine, \nto this great Nation.\n  Nate Cobb is a veteran of World War II, where he served as a combat \nengineer in the South Pacific and participated in the planning of six \ninvasions during his tenure in the Army. Like so many brave Americans, \nhe came home after the war and continued to contribute to his country \nand community.\n  Over the years, Nate has generously and selflessly reached out to \nfellow veterans and their families in need, working to ensure that \nveterans receive the benefits they have earned and so richly deserve. \nTo this end, Nate often devoted his weekends and evenings to helping \nveterans, even as he worked full time for the Waterville Morning \nSentinel newspaper in Waterville, Maine for almost 40 years.\n  In the 1960's Nathaniel Cobb demonstrated impressive foresight in \nproposing the idea of a veterans cemetery to former Senator Margaret \nChase Smith, who worked with him to establish--in Maine--the first \nstate veterans cemetery in the entire country.\n  As State Adjutant of the American legion at the time, he presented \nthe resolution calling for a veterans cemetery to the State \nlegislature, which approved it unanimously. Not only that, but he \nworked tirelessly to secure funding for the cemetery, which was \ndedicated in 1970, and later helped establish a chapel there as well.\n  Nate's achievements also extend into the realm of the written word, \nhaving written two books about the Maine Veterans Memorial Cemetery in \norder to raise funds to preserve the ground for generations to come. To \nthis day, the proceeds from the sale of this book are still generating \nsupport for the cemetery association. I am proud that a letter I wrote \nin support of his efforts appears in the second edition of his book.\n  Nathaniel Cobb also initiated the ``Garden of Remembrance'' at the \ncemetery to honor those Mainers whose remains were never found. He was \nSate Adjutant for the American Legion twice, State Treasurer for 12 \nyears, and State Chaplain for 6 years. He has served on the Maine \nVeterans Home Board and on the Veterans Loan Authority Board. It was an \nhonor to work with him on the fight to preserve Maine's only veterans \nhospital--the Togus Veterans Administration Medical and Regional Office \nCenter--as well as other fundamental needs of Maine's veterans.\n  I congratulate Nate today as well as express my profound appreciation \nas an American for the lifetime of service and sacrifice he has \nrendered. He is truly an effective and doggedly determined advocate for \nveterans.\n  I have nothing but the utmost respect for those, like Nathaniel Cobb, \nwho have served with courage, honor and distinction when their \ncountry--and the world, no less--needed them so desperately. From World \nWar II through Korea, Vietnam, the Persian Gulf, Bosnia, Kosovo, and \nnumerous other conflicts, freedom and democracy have survived because \nwhen the call to duty came, our veterans were there to answer.\n  It is because of them that we enjoy lives unfettered by oppression, \nin a democracy that stands as a blueprint--and a beacon--for people the \nworld over. It is because of them that we stand at the vanguard of \nhuman rights, human dignity, and personal opportunity.\n  And as long as America remains a beacon of hope, we must never forget \nit is a beacon that shines with the bright light of all those, like \nNathaniel Cobb, who sacrificed for the principles for which America \nstands. We may hardly know where to begin in reconciling a debt to them \nthat can never be fully repaid. but we know we can do no less than to \ntry our very best.\n  In that light, it is truly an honor to congratulate Nate Cobb on a \nlife of accomplishments and contributions to this country of which he \nshould be rightfully proud. He is a credit to Maine and the Nation and \na true American hero in every possible sense of the world. Thank you, \nMr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/03/senate-section/article/S9693-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9693-S9694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    WATERBURY CENTER'S VILLA TRAGARA\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, one of the joys in living in a State \nas small as Vermont is that you get to know where all the treasures \nare. One such treasure is Villa Tragara in Waterbury Center. My family \nand I have gone there for so many years and have become friends of Tish \nand Tony DiRuocco. When my mother was alive, she knew that she could \ncall Tony when the Italians won soccer matches and have someone she \ncould speak with in her native tongue, while they both toasted Italy's \nvictory.\n  Recently Debbie Salomon, Vermont's foremost chronicler of epicurean \ndelights, wrote about the DiRuocco's Restaurant and I ask that the \narticle from the Free Press be printed in the Record at this \npoint.\n  The article follows:\n\n            [From the Burlington Free Press, Sept. 12, 2000]\n\n    Strong Marriage Is Secret Ingredient to Villa Tragara's Success\n\n                          (By Debbie Salomon)\n\n       Behind every great restaurant chef/owner stands a spouse. \n     If the spouse is a woman, chances are she'll put on a nice \n     outfit, slap on some makeup and stand in front taking \n     reservations, dispatching servers, running credit cards, \n     remembering names, smoothing ruffled feathers and smiling, \n     smiling, smiling through aching feet, a throbbing head and \n     sore back.\n       That's if the baby sitter shows up.\n       That's Tish DiRuocco. Tish and Tony DiRuoccco, owners of \n     Villa Tragara in Waterbury Center, are old-timers in an \n     industry where almost 75 percent of newcomers fail the first \n     year. Villa Tragara recently celebrated its 20th anniversary; \n     in June, Tony was named Restaurateur of the Year by Vermont \n     Lodging & Restaurant Association.\n       Should have been ``Restaurateurs . . .''\n       ``Did you see (the Stanley Tucci film) `Big Night?' Tish \n     asks. ``Tony's like the chef and the brother is me.''\n       ``They are a very strong family, a wonderful team,'' says \n     Joan Simmons of Craftsbury, a 20-year devotee, who celebrates \n     most family occasions at Villa Tragara, including her \n     mother's 90th birthday.\n       Simmons describes their entrance: ``You would have though \n     Queen Victoria was arriving.''\n       I thought of Tish as I watched Hadassah Lieberman's rave at \n     the Democratic National Convention. The motto of these \n     strong-willed spouse-partners seems to be Stand By Your Man \n     and Help!\n       Perhaps Tish and Tony cling so tenaciously to each other \n     and their business because getting there wasn't half the fun.\n       They met when 19-year-old Tish, a Montrealer, lived with a \n     family in Switzerland to improve her French. The small Swiss \n     town had only one nightspot. Tony--born and educated in \n     Capri, Italy--was the showy bartender.\n       ``He threw bottles into the air and caught them.'' Tish \n     recalls, still misty-eyed at 48. ``I had no money but he made \n     me the perfect drink at the perfect price.\n       They fell in love. Tony followed her back to Montreal. They \n     married in 1976.\n       Tish's family had a ski house in Vermont. Her dream was to \n     live here, despite Tony's growing success in cosmopolitan \n     Montreal. They scoped out the Italian restaurant scene in the \n     Stowe vicinity and decided a market existed for Tony's \n     painstakingly elegant (pasta, bread, desserts made in-house) \n     Northern Italian preparations. They found a charming 1820 \n     farmhouse on Vermont 100 in Waterbury Center, which became \n     the restaurant. Tish's parents helped financially, but the \n     complications of non-citizens opening a business in the \n     United States would fill the phone book.\n\n[[Page S9694]]\n\n       ``We were young and naive,'' Tish admits.\n       Add ``fanatically hard-working'' The charming location \n     proved less than ideal, since vacationers driving north to \n     Stowe didn't want to drive back for dinner.\n       ``We had to be creative the first 10 years, until word-of-\n     mouth got around, ``Tony says.\n       Finally, the Stowe Montrealers who had adored Tony's \n     cuisine at home rediscovered him and oh, did he cater to \n     their tastes. ``They want it special, not off the menu,'' he \n     says.\n       ``Tony's so intent on pleasing that he's flexible to a \n     fault,'' Tish adds.\n       But bumps along the way, including an exhausting foray into \n     retail refrigerated pasta that Tish delivered to gourmet \n     shops between caring for two children and running Villa \n     Tragara, might have derailed a less-committed couple. The \n     Stowe restaurant scene was exploding with competition. \n     Attitudes toward food were changing. ``We were a sinking \n     ship but we were going down fighting,'' Tish admits. Once, \n     things got so bad they closed the door and fled to \n     Martha's Vineyard for a week.\n       Tony was forced to make changes, to lighten sauces with \n     vegetable purees, to initiate cabarets, dinner theater, jazz, \n     a moderately priced tapas menu and early-bird discounts. \n     Redecoration turned the farmhouse--particularly the mountain-\n     view solarium--into a lively, informal trattoria. Herbs grow \n     along the path to the front door; zucchini clog the compost-\n     enriched garden plot out back.\n       And, somehow, their marriage has not only survived, but \n     flourished. How? ``We drop the restaurant when we go home,'' \n     Tish says. ``If we have an argument, it keeps until the next \n     day.''\n       Watching them you fee the connection. ``She is my partner, \n     120 percent,'' Tony affirms, touching Tish's shoulder. They \n     have led student tours to Italy. They provide food for \n     Odysesy of the Mind and March of Dimes events. On Christmas, \n     Tony contributes lasagna (of all things) to a Christmas \n     dinner at a Waterbury church and donates food to a retirement \n     home.\n       No wonder, in March of 1999, Tony was one of 59 \n     restaurateurs worldwide (nine in the U.S.) to receive the \n     Insegna Del Ristornate Italiano, which honors chiefs who \n     leave Italy but ``keep the good name alive.''\n       The award was presented by Italian president Oscar \n     Scalfaro. The Pope recognized the honorees during a public \n     audience.\n       Simmons was happy but not surprised at the recognition. \n     ``When you walk in that door you feel special. Tony and Tish \n     are genuinely glad to have your business,'' she says. The \n     Simmonses drive almost an hour once a month to eat at Villa \n     Tragara. ``I'm a schoolteacher, not a rich woman, but we \n     would rather eat at a place we know is good.''\n       Because, Simmons concludes, ``Anything else is going out to \n     get some food. This is going out to dinner.''\n       What a nice story.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/03/senate-section/article/S9694-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         WOLFE MIDDLE SCHOOL NAMED 1999-2000 BLUE RIBBON SCHOOL\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, in 1982, the United States \nDepartment of Education initiated its Blue Ribbon Schools Program. In \neach year since, the Department has recognized schools throughout the \ncountry which excel in all areas of academic leadership, teaching and \nteacher development, and school curriculum. In other words, Blue Ribbon \nSchools are the finest public and private secondary schools our Nation \nhas to offer. They are the schools that set the standard for which \nothers strive. I am very proud to report that nine of the 198 Blue \nRibbon Schools named by Secretary Richard W. Riley for 1999-2000 are \nlocated in the State of Michigan, and I rise today to recognize Wolfe \nMiddle School, in Center Line, Michigan, one of these nine schools.\n  The hope of the Center Line Public School system is that their \nschools will become places where ``every person will be a teacher, \nevery teacher will be a leader and every student will be a success.'' \nTo this end, Wolfe Middle School is a shining example. Its mission \nstatement lays out the following goals: first, to teach students the \nknowledge and understanding embedded in the Michigan core curriculum; \nsecond, to help students explore their elective areas of interest; and, \nthird, to help students as they make the transition from childhood to \nadolescence. Wolfe Middle School has been successful in these areas \nbecause of the teamwork that has developed, not only among faculty and \nadministrators, but also between parents and community members.\n  This teamwork is best represented in planning teams, groups which \ninvolve staff, parents and community members. These teams meet \nregularly in a constant effort to evaluate, improve and enact goals and \nobjectives which will continue to move Wolfe Middle School and its \nstudents in a positive direction. In addition to planning teams, daily \nteacher team meetings take place in which plans are devised for \nclassroom instruction, grade level activities and professional \ndevelopment. There is an unwavering rule that guides both planning \nteams and teacher teams: all programs must be dedicated to helping \nWolfe students develop academically, socially and emotionally.\n  In recent years, school improvement has focused largely around the \npremise that every student should leave Wolfe computer literate. The \nschool has two computer labs, as well as a computer in every classroom. \nLaptop computers are available to take home from the new Media Center \nwhich allow students to do computer homework. In 1999, a Technology \nEducation Laboratory was completed which boasts a robotics area, audio \nand video production studios, and a computer animation station, making \nit among the most advanced laboratories in the Midwest. It is important \nto note that providing students with the opportunity to work with \ncomputers is part of an overall plan to encourage their participation \nin other areas of education and social interaction--it is not an end in \nitself.\n  I applaud the students, parents, faculty and administration of Wolfe \nMiddle School, for I believe this is an award which speaks more to the \neffort of a united community than it does to the work of a few \nindividuals. With that having been said, I would like to recognize Ms. \nSue Gripton, Principal of Wolfe Middle School, whose dedication to \nmaking her school one of the finest in our Nation has been instrumental \nin creating this community. On behalf of the entire United States \nSenate, I congratulate Wolfe Middle School on being named a Blue Ribbon \nSchool for 1999-2000, and wish the school continued success in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/03/senate-section/article/S9694-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE END OF AN ERA\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I was born in 1953, the same year \nthat major league baseball made its way back to Milwaukee. I grew up \nwith County Stadium and the countless memories it produced.\n  When the stadium and I were just six years old, Milwaukee County bore \nwitness to one of the most dramatic games in baseball history. \nPittsburgh's Harvey Haddix, pitched 12 perfect innings and lost both \nthe no-hitter and the game to Milwaukee in the 13th.\n  When the stadium and I were eight years old, the legendary Warren \nSpahn had a spectacular year. He became the second oldest pitcher to \nthrow a no-hitter and became only the 13th pitcher in history to win \n300 games.\n  When the stadium and I reached 20, the Green Bay Packers won their \nvery first Monday Night Football game. Wisconsinites never forget the \nlast game the Packers played at county stadium nearly six years ago \ntoday.\n  On the year of our nation's bicentennial, when the stadium and I were \n23, Hank Aaron hit his 775th and last career home run there. His home-\nrun hitting presence and uncanny style added so much to County Stadium \nand the aura that surrounded him will never be forgotten.\n  When the stadium and I reached the age of 45, it was at County \nStadium that Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa both hit their 65th home runs.\n  And finally, at our ripe age of 47, we must say farewell. \nFortunately, its great and storied past will always be in our memories. \nI look forward to sharing with my family and Brewer fans across the \nstate, the many new thrilling baseball moments that await us at Miller \nPark.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/03/senate-section/article/S9694-3", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9694-S9695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MONTANA OLYMPIANS\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to recognize the achievements of two native Montanans, Mrs. \nMonica Joan Tranel-Michini, and Mrs. Jean Foster.\n  Mrs. Tranel-Michini is a Billings native who competed recently in the \nSydney Olympics. She not only qualified for the finals of the women's \nsingle sculls, a rowing event, but she also placed sixth in the event. \nSix is a magic number for Monica, because she is the sixth of ten \nbrothers and sisters. She and her family grew up on a cattle ranch just \noutside of the city limits of Billings, Montana. Before the age of \ntwenty, this now established U.S. champion and Olympic finalist had not\n\n[[Page S9695]]\n\nseen a body of water larger than her family's irrigation pond. It was \nnot until this accomplished woman attended law school in Philadelphia \nthat she gained the passion for rowing. I salute this young woman, for \nher proud representation of the sport of rowing, the country, and the \nstate of Montana.\n  Mrs. Jean Foster is another young woman from Bozeman, Montana whom I \nwant to recognize. Joan's career in shooting was paved a little better \nthan Monica's. Jean is from a family with world championships in \nshooting under their belt, her mother being a world champion in rifle \nshooting, and her father a two-time Olympian and a USA hall of famer in \nshooting. Jean represented our state and our country with distinction \nin the 3-position rifle event. I congratulate Jean on the effort she \nput forth and on her and her family's commitment to the sport of \nshooting.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/03/senate-section/article/S9695-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                S.C.

This is not only a distinguished honor for Spartanburg and for \nthe school, but also for our state and our nation.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nAmerican Federation of Muslims of Indian Origin (AFMIO), which will \nhold its 10th Annual Convention on October 7-8, 2000 in Southfield, \nMichigan. The theme of the convention is ``Information and Technology: \nThe Digital Divide,'' providing members of the AFMIO with an \nopportunity to explore new ways to expand upon the many beneficial \nthings the organization is already doing in this realm.\n  The AFMIO is an umbrella organization which represents various Indian \nMuslim Associations. It has chapters throughout the world, and a \nmembership which includes academicians, professionals, entrepreneurs \nand social activists. The mission of the organization is the \neducational and economic upliftment of Indian Muslims by seeking \ncooperation among the American and Indian relief and educational \norganizations.\n  The AFMIO stands for a stable democratic, secular and progressive \nIndia, where the human rights of all citizens, regardless of caste, \nreligion, language or region, are preserved. The organization works in \nclose cooperation with others that believe in these same principles, \nand thus serves as a bridge between Indian intellectuals, public \nofficials and business people, and Indian Americans, particularly \nMuslims.\n  The highest priority of the AFMIO continues to be the eradication of \nilliteracy among Indian Muslim children, a goal which goes hand in hand \nwith bridging the digital divide. Access to a computer can upon up new \nworlds for children, and ensure that they are not only literate in the \ntraditional sense, but culturally literate as well, which I think is \nequally important. In this regard, AFMIO has already done a great deal. \nIts grassroots mobilization and motivation program is termed as one of \nthe most successful education programs in India.\n  AFMIO has also done much to aid Indian Muslims on other fronts. The \norganization has financed several projects which draw on the resources \nof local communities and aim for the economic upliftment of these \ncommunities by teaching citizens how to employ these resources. Through \nprograms of political education and awareness, the organization has \nunited forces that have similar beliefs of social justice and the \nupliftment of all people. Furthermore, it has been responsible for \nestablishing several hospitals and orphanages, and has organized relief \nwork at times of natural disasters.\n  I applaud the AFMIO for all of the wonderful work it has done to \nimprove the living conditions of Indian Muslims. A large part of this \nsuccess stems from educational programs which have been incredibly \nsuccessful, and I am sure the discussion this weekend will focus upon \nhow these programs can be even further adapted and improved in this \nDigital Age. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I extend a \nmuch deserved thank you to the American Federation of Muslims of Indian \nOrigin, and wish the organization continued success in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/03/senate-section/article/S9695-3", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EULOGY FOR ELLEN GLESBY COHEN\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I come before you today to pay \ntribute to a staunch patient advocate whose dedication and commitment \nto biomedical research has changed the lives of all around her.\n  Ellen Glesby Cohen was the President and Founder of the Lymphoma \nResearch Foundation of America (LRFA). Ellen founded this organization \nalmost ten years ago after she was diagnosed with a slow growing form \nof non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL).\n  Ellen, being the courageous person she was, decided to turn her \nexperience into something positive by establishing the Lymphoma \nResearch Foundation that is the nation's first and foremost \norganization dedicated to promoting and funding lymphoma-specific \nresearch.\n  Ms. Cohen's efforts on behalf of lymphoma-specific research has led \nto the Lymphoma Research Foundation awarding close to $3 million to \nsupport 92 lymphoma research projects at top universities and cancer \ncenters throughout the nation.\n  The foundation Ms. Cohen founded has been active not only in funding \nresearch, but has helped educate the public about the high incidence \nrates of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma by spearheading such initiatives as the \nNational Lymphoma Awareness Week during the second seek of October and \nan annual Lymphoma Advocacy Day on Capitol Hill.\n  I have been particularly impressed by Ms. Cohen's passion on behalf \nof lymphoma patients and, consequently, have supported increasing the \nfunding for lymphoma research at the National Institutes of Health and \nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n  Ellen is survived by her husband Dr. Mitchell Cohen and her two \nchildren Hailey and Josh. While the last decade of Ellen Cohen's life \nwas dedicated to lymphoma research, Ellen's accomplishments as a mother \nand a wife will forever be remembered even after the day comes that \nnon-Hodgkin's lymphoma has been eliminated.\n  Although Ellen's work has already benefitted thousands across the \ncountry diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and other cancers, I know \nthat she would like us all to continue her fight against this \ndevastating disease by supporting such worthy organizations like the \nLymphoma Research Foundation of America.\n  Despite the fact that Ellen is not here physically, her spirit will \ncontinue to live on through her family and friends. Thank you Ellen for \nwhat you gave to persons everywhere. You will truly be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/03/senate-section/article/S9695-4", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9695-S9696]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NOVI HIGH SCHOOL NAMED BLUE RIBBON SCHOOL FOR 1999-2000\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, in 1982, the United States \nDepartment of\n\n[[Page S9696]]\n\nEducation initiated its Blue Ribbon Schools Program. In each year \nsince, the Department has recognized schools throughout the country \nwhich excel in all areas of academic leadership, teaching and teacher \ndevelopment, and school curriculum. In other words, Blue Ribbon Schools \nare the finest public and private secondary schools our Nation has to \noffer. They are the schools that set the standard for which others \nstrive. I am very proud to report that 9 of the 198 Blue Ribbon Schools \nnamed by Secretary Richard W. Riley for 1999-2000 are located in the \nState of Michigan, and I rise today to recognize Novi High School in \nNovi, Michigan, one of these nine schools.\n  In the past 30 years, enrollment at Novi High School has grown from \napproximately 360 students to 1,577 students. This is representative of \nthe changing shape of the City of Novi during this time period, as it \nhas evolved from a rural crossroads to a thriving Detroit suburb. To \ndeal with the influx of students, in 1996 Novi High School concluded a \nrenovation which had lasted for 30 months and added over 40 percent to \nthe original facility. The school now covers 382,000 feet on three \nlevels, and includes state of the art instructional areas, science \nlabs, a media center, physical education and fine art complexes, and \ntelecommunications systems. All classrooms have e-mail and Internet \naccess as well as voice communications and two-way interactive video \nwithin and between district buildings.\n  The administrators and faculty of Novi High School are committed to \nproviding their students with a well-rounded educational program, \nincluding a rigorous academic schedule, a variety of extra-curricular \nand athletic programs, and an active student leadership program. This \ncommitment led to a two-year, teacher-led initiative of research and \nreview of outstanding international high schools. Following this \nprocess, Novi High School restructured into a four-block class schedule \nso that students would be allowed access to a broader range of \ncurriculum and would also be able to take advantage of the new \ntechnology available for their use. Perhaps more importantly, the \nreview and realignment of the curriculum led to a transformation of \ninstructional strategies, from traditional lecture to interactive, \nhigher-order thinking and application-assessment which have redefined \nthe entire education program of Novi High School.\n  Novi High School has received many awards, including the ``What \nParents Want'' award from SchoolMatch for seven consecutive years \n(1993-99), a Gold Medal District Rating by Expansion Management \nMagazine for three years (1996-98), and in 1999 U.S. News and World \nReport selected it as one of the top 96 ``Outstanding American High \nSchools.'' Being named a Blue Ribbon School for 1999-2000 is reflective \nof a desire on the part of administration and faculty to continue to \nprovide a better education to the students of Novi High School. The \nstaff firmly believes that a quality education program is never static; \nrather, it continually needs to be adapted and improved as new \nresources and different methods of teaching become available. This \nwillingness to adapt has been instrumental in the success of Novi High \nSchool, and I am sure will continue to be instrumental as the school \nleads other high schools, not only in the State of Michigan but \nthroughout the country, into the future.\n  I applaud the students, parents, faculty and administration of Novi \nHigh School, for I believe this is an award which speaks more to the \neffort of a united community than it does to the work of a few \nindividuals. With that having been said, I would like to recognize Dr. \nJennifer Putnam Cheal, Principal of Novi High School, whose dedication \nto making her school one of the finest in our Nation has been \ninstrumental in creating this community. On behalf of the entire United \nStates Senate, I congratulate Novi High School on being named a Blue \nRibbon School for 1999-2000, and wish the school continued success in \nthe future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/03/senate-section/article/S9696-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9696-S9697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   IN PRAISE OF FRED WILBER, BUCH SPIELER AND CYBERSELLING IN VERMONT\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to congratulate Fred Wilber \nfrom my hometown of Montpelier, Vermont on his cyberselling success.\n  For the last twenty-seven years, Fred Wilber has owned Buch Spieler, \na music store in downtown Montpelier. Recently the New York Times \nreported on Buch Spieler's growing sales from its Internet site at \nhttp://www.bsmusic.com. Mr. President, I ask that the full text of the \nNew York Times article of September 22, 2000, titled ``The Opposite of \nAmazon.com,'' be printed in the Record at the end of my remarks.\n  The success of Fred Wilber is a shining example for all Vermont small \nbusiness owners to follow. By taking advantage of the new markets \noffered by the Internet for its goods and services, Buch Spieler has \nincreased overall sales by 10 percent and expanded its customer base by \n20 percent in the last year and a half. For years we Vermonters have \ncomplained about not having access to a major market to sell our goods. \nNow through the Internet, we can sell our goods in the blink of an eye \nto anyone in the world as Fred Wilber and Buch Spieler have shown.\n  I commend Fred Wilber for being a cyberselling leader and tapping \ninto the Internet's world markets.\n  The article follows:\n\n               [From the New York Times; Sept. 22, 2000]\n\n                       The Opposite of Amazon.com\n\n                          (By Leslie Kaufman)\n\n       For 27 years, Fred Wilber has run a quirky music store \n     called Buch Spieler in downtown Montpelier, Vt., population \n     of roughly 8,000. The store, which sells out-of-print movie \n     soundtracks, among other goodies, has had its ups and downs, \n     but in 1998, as Internet music distributors like CDNow and \n     MP3.com exploded in popularity, Mr. Wilber began to worry \n     that the Web would be his Waterloo.\n       His answer was to build his own Web site (www.bsmusic.com). \n     Designed by his brother and lacking time-saving features like \n     one-click shopping, it is hardly slick. But it has been \n     successful.\n       In the year and a half since the site went into service, \n     Mr. Wilber says overall sales have jumped 10 percent. Just as \n     important, he estimates, the Internet has expanded his \n     customer base by some 20 percent. It turns out that Mr. \n     Wilber's peculiar tastes have been strengths on the Web. When \n     the site was recently sent an e-mail message requesting the \n     score from ``Gordy! The Little Pig That Hit It Big!'' a 1995 \n     movie, he simply took it off the shelf and shipped it.\n       ``It is not easy e-commerce,'' Mr. Wilber said of his Web \n     site. ``But we are not trying to compete with Amazon. We \n     focus on our own niche.''\n       To many experts, the advent of the Internet seemed to \n     signal a grim future for mom-and-pop retailers. Increased \n     competition and the availability of a diverse array of \n     merchandise to populations that had been essentially captive \n     audiences threatened to erode their customer base.\n       But a survey of more than 1,500 businesses in 16 downtown \n     commercial districts nationwide, released earlier this month \n     by the National Trust for Historic Preservation, indicates \n     that the Internet can spur sales in storefront retail \n     businesses. Just as they compete in the brick-and-mortar \n     world against big-box enemies like Wal-Mart Stores and Home \n     Depot, small retailers seem to do best in the virtual world \n     by focusing on unusual products or aiming to give excellent, \n     personalized customer service.\n       The National Trust is a nonprofit organization that \n     develops programs to support and maintain historic downtown \n     areas. And because the survey canvassed only merchants in \n     towns where some revitalization of historic downtown areas in \n     under way, the National Trust said its results probably \n     overstate the positive impact of the Web on all small \n     businesses. Even so, the news was surprisingly upbeat.\n       The trust's survey, one of the first in the nation to \n     examine the impact of e-commerce on small retailers, found \n     that some 16.4 percent of Main Street businesses it polled \n     were already using the Internet to sell things. Further, the \n     survey found, merchants that sell online--with most of them \n     starting their Web sites only within the last 18 months--have \n     experienced a 12.8 percent increase in overall sales. On \n     average, 14.3 percent of their total sales are now \n     attributable to the Internet.\n       Small, specialized businesses ``are really starting to \n     gravitate toward the Web,'' said Kennedy Smith, director of \n     the National Trust's Main Street Center. ``The thing that was \n     a surprise was the extent to which it was helping them.'' For \n     a struggling storefront operation, a 5 percent increase in \n     sales can make the difference between shutting its doors or \n     staying open, Ms. Smith said.\n       The news about small storefront retailers presents a stark \n     contrast to larger, purely e-commerce retailers. Many experts \n     once suggested that even individual entrepreneurs working out \n     of homes and garages--selling everything from books to bow \n     ties--would prosper on the Internet as barriers to entry were \n     eliminated. But as it has turned out, while several of these \n     pure e-retailers had jumps in sales initially, they are now \n     struggling to make money as the challenges of\n\n[[Page S9697]]\n\n     marrying cyberspace and the real world have become clear. \n     Hundreds of these operations are now cutting back or going \n     out of business entirely.\n       Established name-brand retailers, so-called clicks-and-\n     mortars, have also had their share of tribulations on the \n     Internet. While many have recorded strong sales through their \n     online arms, it has often come at enormous cost. To sustain \n     the level of service associated with their stores, most big-\n     name retailers have had to do everything from hire new \n     workers to set up a separate warehouse operation to handle \n     the orders.\n       There is no way to know exactly how many small storefront \n     merchants do business over the Web, but their ranks are \n     already in the tens of thousands and growing. As of May, some \n     29 percent of all American small businesses--from retailers \n     to public relations firms--had Web sites, according to the \n     Kelsey Group, a consulting firm specializing in local \n     advertising and e-commerce. That is up from 23 percent in May \n     of last year.\n       Of this Web-connected minority, almost half are selling \n     goods over the Interent, according to the Kelsey Group, which \n     gets its information from a survey of a national panel of 600 \n     businesses with fewer than 100 employees.\n       The use of the Web by small retailers is likely to \n     accelerate because many larger companies, hoping that small \n     businesses could be revenue generators, have been \n     intensifying efforts to bring mom-and-pop stores online over \n     the course of the last year.\n       Last September, for example, Amazon.com started zShops, a \n     service that allows small businesses to have a link to their \n     products pop up when a visitor to Amazon clicks on a relevant \n     book or compact disc. A seller of spice grinders, say, could \n     arrange for a link to appear every time a person clicked on a \n     book about Indian cooking.\n       Web developers of all sizes--from Microsoft to tiny outfits \n     run by a couple of a guys in a college dorm--are offering \n     small businesses access to a range of Web services, from Web \n     site design to purchasing banner advertising. In fact, the \n     business of providing Web services to small operators has \n     already become competitive enough that many of the mom-and-\n     pop retailers said their entry costs had been very \n     reasonable.\n       James and Mary DeFore, for example, own a women and \n     children's store called Unique Boutique in downtown \n     Thomasville, Ga., a small city of about 20,000 people. They \n     were doing a healthy side business in prom dresses, and \n     decided that if they offered them on the Web they might \n     attract rural customers who could not get into town. So last \n     January, they hired a local service provider, who for a few \n     hundred dollars designed a simple but colorful Web site with \n     the catchy name Time for Prom (timeforprom.com).\n       The site went live in February, and by march the DeFores \n     were getting up to 40,000 visitors to their Web site each \n     month. By June, they had nearly 500 orders for dresses that \n     cost $150 to $200. And requests came not just from rural \n     areas in Georgia but also from Missouri and West Virginia and \n     even Hawaii and Japan. ``The biggest problem,'' Mr. DeFore \n     said, ``was fulfilling all the orders.''\n       Despite not having a powerful brand name or being linked to \n     a powerful portal like Yahoo or America Online, Time for Prom \n     shows that small retailers need not get lost in the vast \n     clutter on the Internet if they develop a clear, arrow \n     identity.\n       In fact, another Thomasville retailer, Hi-Fi Sales and \n     Service, which specializes in equipment for home theaters and \n     live field recording, did $1.9 million in business over the \n     Web last year, which represented a significant portion of its \n     total sales, and now gets some 30 percent of its new \n     customers online with no advertising.\n       The key to the success of Hi-Fi Sales is making sure it is \n     visible. ``We spend a lot of energy making sure we come up \n     high in the search engines,'' said Jim Oade, one of the three \n     brothers who co-own the business. Each search engine has \n     different rules for deciding in what order to list businesses \n     related to key words, he said. So one of the brothers, Doug \n     Oade, devotes himself, among other things, to keeping current \n     with the rules and making sure the company's Web site \n     (www.oade.com) has enough of the right key words to pop up \n     swiftly when a consumer wants audio products.\n       The Oade brothers' national customer base is still fairly \n     unusual among mom-and-pop ventures. Most storefront retailers \n     use the Internet mainly for defending and cementing the \n     relationship with customers they already have--a relationship \n     that is very much under siege by giant retailers.\n       Osborn Drugs in Miami (pronounced Mi-AM-a), Okal., has been \n     a family drugstore for 29 years. Since it started its Web \n     site in 1996, sales through the Interent have increased only \n     about 5 percent a year, according to Bill Osborn, who runs \n     the store with his father. But more than 90 percent of the \n     traffic on the Web site comes from regular long-term Osborn \n     customers who just like to e-mail their prescriptions in. \n     ``We view it as a way to service customers we already have,'' \n     Bill Osborn said. ``We are not trying to go public as \n     osborndrug.com.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/03/senate-section/article/S9697-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO EDWIN L.

Cox and to call out his \noutstanding service to the nation through his support of the Library of \nCongress. On Thursday, October 5th, The Library of Congress will be \ncelebrating its bicentennial and the 10th Anniversary of the James \nMadison Council. The Madison Council is the Library's private \nphilanthropic organization and, along with Council Chairman John W. \nKluge, Ed Cox helped found and build the Council from a handful of \nmembers in 1990 to more than one hundred committed supporters today.\n  Madison Council members have supported more than 200 Library projects \nsince 1990. These gifts account for almost half of all private gifts to \nthe Library. Ed served as the first Vice-Chairman of the Madison \nCouncil when it was founded in 1990, and became the first Chairman of \nthe Council's Steering Committee in 1992. To support the Library in \nacquiring new and rare items, Ed and fellow Madison Council member \nCaroline Ahmanson formed the Acquisitions Committee, which has been \ninstrumental in acquiring rare and historically significant items for \nthe Library. Ed also established the Edwin L. Cox American Legacy \nEndowment, which makes possible the purchase of rare and important \nmaterials highlighting our history.\n  Ed Cox's long record of service to his country includes his duty in \nthe United States Navy, where he earned the rank of lieutenant. He left \nto begin building one of America's great independent energy companies, \nCox Oil and Gas. He has translated his success into a strong record of \npublic activism, joining the boards of the Salvation Army, the American \nRed Cross, the Texas Cancer Society, and the Dallas Society for \nCrippled Children.\n  In 1978, recognizing his business acumen and boundless contributions \nto a better society, Southern Methodist University renamed its business \nschool in his honor, and The Edwin L. Cox School of Business is \nrecognized as one of America's best.\n  In this Bicentennial year of the Library, Ed continues to give of \nhimself and to lead others in support of the Library. He chaired the \nCouncil's Bicentennial Committee and mobilized Council members to \nparticipate in the Library's Bicentennial programs. He has also been a \nkey member of the Library's Trust Fund Board for the past 10 years.\n  James H. Billington, the Librarian of Congress, has called Ed ``one \nof the Library's most valued friends.'' His dedication and service have \nmade the Library's collections richer and its services to the Congress \nand the Nation more comprehensive than ever. All Americans are the \nbeneficiaries of Edwin L. Cox's generosity in enriching one of our \nnation's greatest institutions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/03/senate-section/article/S9697-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9697-S9698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    THE ASSOCIATION OF CHINESE AMERICANS CELEBRATES 28TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nAssociation of Chinese Americans, Detroit Chapter of the National \nOrganization of Chinese Americans, which will celebrate its 28th \nAnniversary with an Awards Ceremony on October 7, 2000. The theme of \nthe evening is Unity, Collaboration and Strength, three things the ACA \nhas provided Michigan's Chinese American community since its inception \nin 1972.\n  The mission of the ACA is ``to serve the Chinese American community \nin the Greater Detroit area, and to promote the overall presence of \nChinese Americans.'' In order to do this effectively, members laid out \nsix goals for their organization: provide community services to people \nof Chinese heritage; promote the Chinese presence locally and \nnationally through the political system; make sure the voice of the \nChinese American is heard locally and nationally; promote academic \nexcellence in Chinese American youth; promote Chinese heritage through \nthe arts; and collaborate with other Chinese/Asian organizations.\n  In its effort to achieve above and beyond these goals, the ACA has \nbecome an active force within the Metropolitan Detroit community. It \noperates service and outreach centers in Detroit, Warren and Plymouth \nwhich provide assistance to Chinese Americans in immigration matters, \nlanguage classes, citizenship preparation, and registering to vote. It \nsponsors a free health clinic\n\n[[Page S9698]]\n\nand activities in Detroit Chinatown for the language and economically \ndisadvantaged. In addition, the ACA sponsors many programs for the \nentire community, including the Feed the Homeless program, flood and \nemergency disaster relief, and a bone marrow drive.\n  The ACA provides young Chinese Americans with the opportunity to meet \npeople of their own heritage, but also teaches them the benefits of a \nwell-balanced routine. Each year the organization sponsors camping \ntrips, dancing parties, and basketball games. At the same time, the \norganization has sponsored annual High School Achievement Awards since \n1984. These awards recognize seniors who have achieved academic \nexcellence as well as involvement and leadership in extracurricular \nactivities. Scholarships funded by the ACA and private donors are also \nprovided annually to Chinese Americans seeking higher education.\n  Promoting Chinese heritage has always been a fundamental goal of the \nACA, as members strive not to let their proud ancestry be overlooked or \nforgotten. Events include celebrating Asian American Heritage Month, \npromoting the Chinese New Year Commemorative stamps, and sponsoring or \ncosponsoring a plethora of cultural events. Recently, the ACA held a \nreception for Chinese American author Helen Zia, and on September 9, \n2000, the organization hosted the Michigan premiere of the documentary \nfilm, ``We Served With Pride,'' which chronicles the effort of Chinese \nAmerican soldiers during World War II.\n  I applaud the ACA on the wonderful work it has done in the \nMetropolitan Detroit region. Since its founding in 1972, the \norganization has encouraged Michigan's Chinese Americans to celebrate \nboth their Chinese heritage and the lives they have found in the United \nStates. It has fought vehemently for the rights of Chinese Americans \nyet remains an inclusive group, offering assistance not only to Chinese \nAmericans, but to all Americans. On behalf of the entire United States \nSenate, I congratulate the Association of Chinese Americans on 28 \nglorious years, and wish the organization continued success in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/03/senate-section/article/S9698-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TRIBUTE TO ADMIRAL LEON A.

He retired from \nactive duty in August 1992.\n  Admiral Edney has shown valor and leadership throughout his 35 years \nof dedicated military service to his country, and has been a positive \nrole model for countless sailors in the process.\n  His dedication to service and excellence has not diminished since \nleaving active duty, serving as a trustee of the Naval Academy \nFoundation and the Association of Naval Aviation. For two years, he \nalso held the distinguished Professor of Leadership chair at the U.S. \nNaval Academy.\n  Admiral Edney was elected to the board of directors of The Retired \nOfficers Association in 1994. For the last two years, he served as \nTROA's chairman of the board, the position from which he is now \nretiring.\n  Through his stewardship, The Retired Officers Association continues \nto play a vital role as a staunch advocate of legislative initiatives \nto maintain readiness and improve the quality of life for all members \nof the uniformed service community--active, reserve, and retired, plus \ntheir families and survivors.\n  His tenure as chairman of TROA began simultaneously with my \nchairmanship of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and I am pleased \nto state that these two years have witnessed very substantial quality-\nof-life enhancements for active, reserve, and retired service members \nand their families.\n  Admiral Edney has been a strong supporter of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee's efforts toward improving long-term retention and \nreadiness through a competitive compensation package for active and \nreserve forces, restoration of lifetime health care for retired \npersonnel and their families, and enhancing protections for the \nsurvivors of deceased service members. Under his leadership, TROA has \nbeen an invaluable source of information that has proven of \nconsiderable utility in the committee's deliberations on a long list of \ncompensation and benefits issues during this extraordinarily productive \nperiod.\n  Admiral Bud Edney has been, in every sense of the word, a leader in \nthe military, TROA, and the entire retired community. Our very best \nwishes go with him for long life, well-earned happiness, and continued \nsuccess in service to his nation and the uniformed service members whom \nhe has so admirably led and served.\n  As a former Sailor and Marine, I offer Admiral Edney a grateful and \nheartfelt salute, and wish him ``fair winds and following \nseas.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/03/senate-section/article/S9698-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FRANK ``BUD'' DANIELS\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, the agricultural community across \nMontana was saddened this month by the passing of Frank Daniels. He was \nknown to all of us as ``Bud''.\n  He was born and raised on the northern high plains in eastern \nMontana. He gave up to cancer and was 72. His daughter wrote that he \nleft us as quietly and gently as he walked across that newly cut \nstubble field to be with His Lord.\n  A life long devotion to improving the lives of rural Americans and \nkeeping farmers on the land he loved, which he valued so highly, led \nhim to countless areas of involvement and gained him the admiration of \nhis peers. No man or woman ever gave so much to the Montana Farmers \nUnion than did Bud Daniels.\n  He participated in the three-year Kellogg Extension Program at \nMontana State University which enabled him to visit far corners of the \nworld and taking him to China in 1976. He believed in the fraternity of \nagriculture.\n  His interest in farming issues and programs was generated and groomed \nthrough the Montana Farmers Union. He was president of Montana Farmers \nUnion and vice president of National Farmers Union. He also served on \nthe Farmers Union Mutual Insurance Companies.\n  During his years of farming and serving, he founded the Rural Policy \nInstitute, established a cooperative curriculum at Montana State \nUniversity, and developed strong ties with farm groups in foreign \ncountries. He had a passion for travel as it was his education and his \nway to reach out to the rest of the world that was crying for the \ntechnology and ways to feed a hungry world.\n  We in Montana will miss him as he was the inspiration of leadership. \nDid we always agree? No. That was not important but the dialog and \ncommunications that enabled us to help those in need that farm and \nranch was important. He would say that we are the providers and there \nis no higher calling on God's Earth.\n  Bud is survived by 4 daughters, Amy, Becky, Rachel, and Karen. Also \nby their mother, Laura Daniels of Billings, Montana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/03/senate-section/article/S9698-3", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9698-S9699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       COUSINO HIGH SCHOOL NAMED BLUE RIBBON SCHOOL FOR 1999-2000\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, in 1982, the United States \nDepartment of Education initiated its Blue Ribbon Schools Program. In \neach year since, the Department has recognized schools throughout the \ncountry which excel in all areas of academic leadership, teaching and \nteacher development, and school curriculum. In other words, Blue Ribbon \nSchools are the finest public and private secondary schools our Nation \nhas to offer. They are the\n\n[[Page S9699]]\n\nschools that set the standard for which others strive. I am very proud \nto report that nine of the 198 Blue Ribbon Schools named by Secretary \nRichard W. Riley for 1999-2000 are located in the State of Michigan, \nand I rise today to recognize Cousino High School in Warren, Michigan, \none of these nine schools.\n  Cousino High School is a contemporary American high school set \namongst the ``Big Three'' members of the auto industry--General Motors, \nFord Motor Company and DaimlerChrysler. Much of the instructional \nprogram at Cousino relies upon the same forces that drive these \ninternational automotive giants, a fact which can be attributed to the \nlarge participation of the Warren community in the affairs of Cousino \nHigh School. Teachers, administrators, and parents, along with nearly \n300 leaders from local business and industry, are directly involved in \nshaping the educational program. This involvement has been instrumental \nin creating the high student achievement level that has become a \ntrademark of Cousino High School.\n  A large part of this program is devoted to ensuring that students who \ngraduate Cousino High School leave tecnologically competent. All \nCousino classes use technology as a tool to facilitate learning. \nMultiple computer labs spread throughout the building and additional \ncomputers in the media center and classrooms allow students to easily \naccess the Internet. In addition, Cousino's proximity to the General \nMotors Technical Center, the world's largest auto research institute, \nand the satellite automotive and technical businesses nearby, have \nprovided students with an opportunity to see first-hand the many doors \nthat their education will open for them. This focus on technology has \ncomplemented the core subjects of literature, humanitites, philosophy \nand the arts to provide students with a well-balanced educational \nfoundation.\n  Of course, no school could be successful without students and parents \nwho are willing to devote time and energy to see that their school is \nindeed successful. This dedication has occurred time and again at \nCousino High School. Parents have consistently served on the \nPrincipal's Advisory Committee and School Improvement Plan committees, \nhave volunteered in Booster Clubs and for other school activities, and \nhelped to promote school spirit by promoting school events. This \nparental enthusiasm has rubbed off onto students of Cousino High. Over \n80 percent of students participate in extracurricular activities, and \nstudents have led the way in aiding the community as a whole, working \ntirelessly for numerous charities.\n  I applaud the students, parents, faculty and administration of \nCousino High School, for I believe this is an award which speaks more \nto the effort of a united community than it does to the work of a few \nindividuals. With that having been said, I would like to recognize Mr. \nJoseph Sayers, Principal of Cousino High School, whose dedication to \nmaking his school one of the finest in our Nation has been instrumental \nin creating this community. On behalf of the entire United States \nSenate, I congratulate Cousino High School on being named a Blue Ribbon \nSchool for 1999-2000, and wish the school continued success in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/03/senate-section/article/S9699-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/03/senate-section/article/S9699-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9699-S9700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:10 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, without amendment:\n\n       S. 302.

A bill to convey certain real property located in Tongass \nNational Forest to Daniel J. Gross, Sr., and Douglas K. Gross, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                 the heritage land transfer act of 2000\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Heritage \nLand Transfer Act of 2000. This legislation, while inconsequential when \ncompared to many of the issues we deal with in the U.S. Congress, is \nextremely important to two of my oldest constituents, Douglas and \nDaniel Gross. These two brothers along with the other members of the \nGross family are amongst Alaska's earliest pioneers. These two brothers \nhave spent over 80 years drawing their existence out of the harsh \nSoutheastern Alaskan environment. Through all these years, they managed \nto raise their families and contributed to building the great State \nthat I have the privilege of representing. I would also point out that \nDouglas and Daniel Gross served our Nation during World War II at its \ntime of greatest need--now these two veterans need our help to right a \nwrong that has been vested upon them through no fault of their own.\n  ``The Heritage Land Transfer Act of 2000'' directs the Forest Service \nto convey 160 acres to Daniel and Douglas Gross. This granting of clear \ntitle would fix a problem that has plagued the family for the past 20 \nyears. The need for this action arises from the fact that no records \nremain to substantial the family's claim that they homesteaded on \nGreens Point in the 1930's. Family homesteading records were destroyed \nwhen the Gross home burned to the ground in 1935-1936 and to make \nmatters worse, the Forest Service is unable to locate any documentation \nto substantiate the Gross family claim. With neither title nor \ndocumentation, Doug and Dan Gross are unable to produce any legal \nrecord of ownership to the land their parents homesteaded. The paper \nrecords, however, are the only things missing. The Forest Service \nwillingly acknowledges that a large body of evidence exists that \nclearly establishes the fact that the family built a home on Greens \nPoint in the 1930's, that they grew and sold vegetables from this \nfarmstead, and that they were good neighbors to many people caught out \nin our famous Alaskan storms. While the family and the Forest Service \nhave searched in vain for written records, there is one piece of \nphysical evidence to substantiate the family claim. On September 11, \n1989, Alaska State Senator Robin Taylor traveled to the Gross property \non the Stikine River for the purpose of locating a witness tree which \nwould provide objective proof to the Gross family claim of homestead. \nIn a letter Senator Taylor sent to Richard Kohrt, Wrangell District \nRanger, Tongass National Forest he wrote ``I was present when Mr. \nBungy, United States Forest Service specialist, sawed and chopped open \nthe large spruce tree which the Gross Brothers had identified from \nmemory as being a witness tree. Mr. Bungy verified that the large blaze \nuncovered was of the exact age that coincided with the Gross claim. By \ncounting the annual growth rings it coincided with the many affidavits \nand statements of witness about the Gross claim of homestead.''\n  There is no question that the family settled on the Green Point \nproperty on the Stikine River in the 1930's. They raised all of their \nchildren on their property and were good friends to all who lived and \nworked throughout the region. I have in my possession many affidavits, \neach one testifying to the settlement of the Gross family along the \nStikine River. I offer the following quotations typical of these \ntestaments: ``In the early 1930's I spent a lot of time up the Stikine \nRiver at the Gross Ranch. They had a large two story home and a huge \ngarden . . .'' ``I stayed with Mr. and Mrs. Bill Gross in the middle \nthirties. Bessie Gross took care of my brother Gilbert and I while my \nmother and father were out fishing, they had a house and garden on the \nriver which everyone knows as the Gross place even to this day . . .'' \n``I stayed with Bessie Gross and Family during the late 1930's in their \nplace up the river . . .'' And another from Mr. Harry Sundberg, a \ngillnet fisherman, used to fish in ``what was known locally as the \nGross homestead.'' Mr. Sundberg goes on to say ``While most people \nduring that period did not file on the land they occupied, I distinctly \nrecall that our conversations included the fact that they had applied \nfor their application to own property similar to Captain Lee, who owned \nthe property directly south of them on the mainland.''\n  The Homestead Act requires residency for a minimum of 3 years. These \naffidavits, and many others, verify the Gross families life on this \nproperty since the early 1930's. In a letter from the Department of \nAgriculture to Senator Stevens they write ``Even though it's clear the \nGross family homesteaded on the property, there is no evidence or \nrecord that they completed the process to obtain title.'' Another \nletter from the Department of Agriculture states ``the Forest Service \ndoes not and has not refuted your claim that you and/or your family \nresided at Greens Point in the 1930's.'' An Alaska Magazine article \nwritten in 1984 references the ``Gross place'' along the Stikine River.\n  The Homestead Act authorized the transfer of 160 acre parcels of \nfederal land to private owners. The Gross Homestead is 160.8 acres. A \ntree, both Daniel and Douglas Gross remember being used as a survey \nmarker when they were boys, was examined in 1989 and found to have a \nflat face blazed into the wood approximately 50 years\n\n[[Page S9703]]\n\nprior. This is not a coincidence. It is proof this land was surveyed \nwhen the family claims it was surveyed.\n  This family has lived on, and made use of this land for 70 years. It \nis time for them to be named the legal title holders, and to complete \nthe already started process of shuffling paper.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROTH (for himself, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Baucus, \n        Mr. Hatch, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Breaux, Mr. \n        Jeffords, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Mack, Mr. Graham, Mr. Thompson, Mr. \n        Kerrey, Mr. Robb, and Mr. Bryan):\n  S. 3152. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ntax incentives for distressed areas, and for other purposes; read the \nfirst time.\n\n\n             community renewal and new markets act of 2000\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, today I am, along with 14 cosponsors from \nthe Finance Committee, introducing a Community Renewal tax reduction \nbill that will help all America benefit from today's economic boom.\n  As you know, the House bill embodies an agreement between the House \nand the Administration. Personally, I think that it would be wrong for \nthe Senate to be silent in this process. It is important for this body \nto at least have a voice in crafting this legislation.\n  While I would have preferred that this legislation to have been \nreported from the Finance Committee, I believe my bill represents the \nCommittee's will. It is largely composed of the Chairman's mark and \namendments submitted by the Committee's members. Every Member of the \nFinance Committee had input into this bill. In the regular course of \nFinance Committee business, we would have reported this bill out of the \nCommittee with an overwhelming vote in support. And the fact that 15 \nmembers on both sides of the aisle have joined me as original \ncosponsors, I believe, attests to the Finance Committee's approval of \nthis legislation.\n  It goes without saying that America's communities are important. I \nbelieve that there are many ways in which we can extend help to them. I \nalso feel that any time we can work together with the Administration to \ncut taxes we must try and see it to fruition.\n  While I listened to the concerns of every senator--both on and off \nthe Finance committee--who approached me with a provision in which they \nwere interested, I did not incorporate them all. I did not because I \ncould not without the cost of the bill growing out of control. It is \nimportant that we not forget communities that may not have received as \nmuch as others from America's economic boom. However, it is also \nimportant that we consider the size of this bill in the context of \nother tax relief priorities that remain. These other priorities are \nmarriage tax relief, retirement security, education, estate tax relief, \nsmall business tax relief, and other items. Community renewal tax \nrelief must fit within the overall framework of the tax relief agenda.\n  This Finance Committee bill is fair and it is in line with the \nrevenue loss of the package, proposed by Senators Santorum, Abraham, \nand Lieberman, which was considered earlier this year in the Senate. In \ndesigning this bill, members of the Finance Committee decided not to \nturn this bill into a grab bag of special interest provisions.\n  This Finance Committee bill includes a variety of proposals that will \nfurther the bill's goals of community renewal--rationalizing and \nsimplifying what was and, was proposed to be, a hodge-podge of often \nconflicting provisions. It includes an immediate--let me emphasize \nimmediate--increase in the volume caps for low-income housing tax \ncredits and private activity bonds. It also addresses many, many \nimportant problems left out of the House and Administration proposal. \nAmong other things, this package contains an energy and conservation \ncomponent, a farm relief component, an Individual Development Account \nproposal, an extension of the adoption credit and the enhanced \ndeduction for computer donations, a program to develop high speed rail \naround the country, and a broadband Internet incentive that will make \nsure that no one gets left on the wrong side of the digital divide.\n  One provision that I particularly want to talk about is the tax \ncredit for renovating historic homes. This was one of Senator John \nChafee's signature items and I am pleased to include it in the Finance \nCommittee bill, not only because I support it, but as a tribute to our \ngood friend. We all know that if he were here, he would have fought \nhard for this tax incentive.\n  In fact, Senator Lincoln Chafee came to see me earlier this year. \nLincoln told that in his dad's last speech, John talked about the \nimportance of the tax credit and said that it was something he wanted \nto get done before he left the Senate. Unfortunately, he is not with us \ntoday, but hopefully we can complete this unfinished business for him.\n  This is a fair package and a generous package. I believe it is one \nthat this Senate should feel comfortable embracing. I hope each of you \nwho has not done so, will do so.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, last week the Finance Committee was \nscheduled to mark up the ``Community Renewal and New Markets Act of \n2000,'' but the legislation became burdened by extraneous matters, and \nthe Committee was unable to complete the mark-up. I rise today to join \nmy good friend and Chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, in \nintroducing the ``Community Renewal and New Markets Act of 2000'' as an \noriginal bill with 15 cosponsors from the Finance Committee.\n  Sir, we all should be grateful for Senator Roth's leadership in this \nmatter. Community renewal is an effort to rebuild American communities, \nwhich is based on an agreement reached between the President and the \nSpeaker of the House that this is legislation we ought to have. The \nsignals are clear: the legislation will be enacted this year with or \nwithout us. Today, Senator Roth and I give a voice in this process to \nthe Finance Committee and the Senate.\n  Mr. President, this bill represents the will of the Finance \nCommittee. It incorporates the worthwhile ideas of its members, \nincluding the work of my good friend, Senator Robb, who, along with \nSenator Rockefeller, has worked tirelessly to provide meaningful \nincentives for investment in distressed communities.\n  I also take a moment of the Senate's time to echo Senator Roth's \ntribute to Senator John Chafee. It is fitting that we should enact, in \na bipartisan bill, the tax credit for renovating historic homes in \nhonor of a great Senator.\n  Substantively, the Community Renewal legislation is significant in \nseveral respects. First, it provides a notable measure of tax \nsimplification, even as it accomplishes a worthwhile goal--tax benefits \nfor investment in poor communities. While the bill designates 30 new \n``Renewal Zones,'' it also conforms the tax incentives available to \nindividuals and businesses investing in any of the zone designations, \ncurrent or future. Our legislation smartly unifies these Empowerment \nand Renewal Zones and creates a common set of incentives. This is the \nright kind of legislation.\n  I also note, Mr. President, with some appreciation, two provisions \nthat will make transportation and data transmission very quick indeed. \nThe bill includes provisions to accelerate and expand access to high-\ntechnology infrastructure for all communities. First, it authorizes $10 \nbillion of tax credit bonds for Amtrak to develop high-speed railways. \nHigh-speed railways have the potential to connect the very communities \ntargeted by this legislation and provide them with greater access to \ninformation.\n  Second, the bill includes a proposal that I first introduced on June \n8, 2000. That proposal, which now has 52 Senate supporters, provides \ngraduated tax credits for deployment of high-speed communications--\ncalled ``broadband''--to residential and rural communities. Current \nmarket forces are driving deployment of broadband technology almost \nexclusively to urban businesses and wealthy households. The proposal in \nthe bill will encourage broadband providers to act quickly to deploy \nbroadband to Americans in all communities.\n  Mr. President, if you will allow me one further observation, as I am \ncompelled to compliment the bill in one other respect. Consistent with \nthe purpose of this legislation, it includes a\n\n[[Page S9704]]\n\ntax incentive for investment in labor in Puerto Rico. The provision \ndoes not accomplish all that I had hoped it would, but I believe it \nrepresents a positive step forward. It extends to Puerto Rico tax \nincentives for job creation similar to the ones in other areas of the \nbill, and it does so, quite simply, through an existing tax-code \nprovision, the Puerto Rico economic activity credit.\n  Mr. President, I again applaud the leadership of our revered Chairman \nand proudly join him in introducing the Community Renewal and New \nMarkets Act of 2000.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, as a co-sponsor of the Community Renewal and \nNew Markets Act of 2000, I want to commend Chairman Roth for his usual \nfine work in assembling a bill that garners the support of such a large \nnumber of our Finance Committee colleagues. I am pleased that a number \nof items in this bill are provisions that are extremely important to \nme, and I would like to speak briefly concerning them.\n  But I also want to draw attention to some provisions in this bill \nthat I do not favor. As this bill stands in the place of what would \nhave been a bill reported out of the Committee on Finance, it reflects \nthe compromises that are inherent in the committee process. Unlike \ntypical bills, of which it is reasonable to assume that every provision \nis supported by every co-sponsor, probably every co-sponsor of this \nbill can find provisions contained in it that he does not support. Of \nmany, there are two that I find most troubling: the ``new markets tax \ncredit,'' and the ``individual development accounts.''\n  These two provisions are appropriations masquerading as tax cuts. \nUnder the new markets tax credit, the Secretary of the Treasury would \nannually pay dividends to investors in ``community development \nentities,'' which must be certified by the Treasury Department and \nwhich must have as their primary mission investing in low-income people \nor communities. This proposal is premised on the belief that an entity \nthat lacks a profit-motive, under federal bureaucratic supervision, \nwill be an attractive investment for people if dividends are \nguaranteed. It is the sort of scheme that could only be dreamed up by \npeople who have spent their entire careers in government. A simpler way \nto direct capital to investment-starved pockets is by eliminating the \ntax on capital gains--this is the decentralized, market-oriented \napproach.\n  The ``individual development accounts'' would launder government-\nmatching funds for low income savers through financial institutions. \nThis new entitlement cannot be justified. It is true that, by some \nmeasures, the savings rate in the United States appears low. Simple \nlogic dictates that the savings rate have been lowered due to federal \ntax policies, which impose several layers of taxation upon income that \nis saved. It is one thing to address this problem at the source, by \nremoving the extra taxation on savings--a we do to the extent that \npeople can make deductible contributions to traditional IRAs and \ncontributions to Roth IRAs. But to give people money to reward them for \nsaving is pure income redistribution, a misuse of the taxpayers' money.\n  Despite my disagreement with some of the provisions of this bill, I \nam pleased that the bill contains several initiatives that I have \nproposed over the past few Congresses. The Low Income Housing Tax \nCredit is boosted to make up for over a decade's worth of inflation, \nand is indexed to prevent this problem from reoccurring. The First-Time \nHomebuyer Tax Credit for the District of Columbia is extended and the \nmarriage penalty in the credit is eliminated. Section 1706 of the Tax \nReform Act of 1986, which discriminates against high technology workers \nand the companies that hire them, is repealed. Not-for-hire disaster \ninsurance funds, in my state of Florida and several others, are made \ntax-exempt entities.\n  I am most encouraged by the extension of my zero percent capital \ngains tax rate proposal to businesses in the entire District of \nColumbia, and to businesses in all empowerment and renewal zones. \nAlthough I am concerned that the lengthy, five-year holding period is \nunwise and undermines the power of the proposal, I am nevertheless \npleased that the idea is spreading and people are coming to see \ncapitalism as the only true cure for poverty.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, along with Senator Moynihan and the other \nmembers of the committee I ask unanimous consent that S. 3152, the \nCommunity Renewal and New Markets Act of 2000 be printed in the Record. \nI also ask unanimous consent that a technical explanation of S. 3152, \nwhich has been prepared by the Joint Committee on Taxation, be printed \nin the Record, at a cost of $4,290.00, immediately following the text \nof the bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3152\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The tax incentives with \n     respect to the two additional Round I empowerment zones \n     generally are available during the 10-year period of 2000 \n     through 2009.\n     Round II empowerment zones\n       The 1997 Act also authorized the designation of 20 \n     additional empowerment zones (``Round II empowerment \n     zones''), of which 15 are located in urban areas and five are \n     located in rural areas. Businesses in the Round II \n     empowerment zones are not eligible for the wage credit, but \n     are eligible to receive up to $20,000 of additional section \n     179 expensing. Businesses in the Round II empowerment zones \n     also are eligible for more generous tax-exempt financing \n     benefits than those available in the Round I empowerment \n     zones. Specifically, the tax-exempt financing benefits for \n     the Round II empowerment zones are not subject to the State \n     private activity bond volume caps (but are subject to \n     separate per-zone volume limitations), and the per-business \n     size limitations that apply to the Round I empowerment zones \n     and enterprise communities (i.e., $3 million for each \n     qualified enterprise zone business with a maximum of $20 \n     million for each principal user for all zones and \n     communities) do not apply to qualifying bonds issued for \n     Round II empowerment zones. The tax incentives with respect \n     to the Round II empowerment zones generally are available \n     during the 10-year period of 1999 through 2008.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n     Overview\n       As described in detail below, the provision conforms the \n     wage credit and tax-exempt bond incentives for the Round I \n     and Round II empowerment zones and extends their designations \n     through December 31, 2009. The provision also increases the \n     incentives to existing empowerment zones by (1) increasing \n     the additional section 179 deduction to $35,000, and (2) \n     providing a zero-percent capital gain rate for qualifying \n     assets held for more than five years.\n       In addition, the provision authorizes the Secretaries of \n     HUD and Agriculture to designate 30 new ``renewal zones'' \n     that have the same tax incentives as empowerment zones. The \n     designations of the new renewal zones will take effect on \n     January 1, 2002, and terminate on December 31, 2009.\n       Thus, once the 30 new renewal zones have been designated \n     there will exist a total of 61 zones providing similar tax \n     incentives for distressed areas, all of whose designations \n     will terminate on December 31, 2009. The renewal zones are \n     treated as empowerment zones for all purposes of the Code. \n     After taking into account existing empowerment zones (and the \n     designation of the new renewal zones), each State shall have \n     at least one zone.\n     Existing zones\n       Conforming and enhancing incentives for Round I and Round \n     II empowerment zones.--The provision extends the designation \n     of empowerment zone status for Round I and II \n     empowerment zones through December 31, 2009. In addition, \n     a 15-percent wage credit is made available in all Round I \n     and II empowerment zones, effective in 2002 (except in the \n     case of the two additional Round I empowerment zones, for \n     which the 15-percent wage credit takes effect in 2005 as \n     scheduled under present law). For all the empowerment \n     zones, the 15-percent wage credit expires on December 31, \n     2009.\n       In addition, $35,000 (rather than $20,000) of additional \n     section 179 expensing is available for qualified zone \n     property placed in service in taxable years beginning after \n     December 31, 2001, by a qualified business in any of the \n     empowerment zones.\n       Businesses located in Round I empowerment zones are \n     eligible for the more generous tax-exempt bond rules that \n     apply under present law to businesses in the Round II \n     empowerment zones (sec. 1394(f)). The proposal applies to \n     tax-exempt bonds issued after December 31, 2001. Bonds that \n     have been issued by businesses in Round I zones before \n     January 1, 2002, are not taken into account in applying the \n     limitations on the amount of new empowerment zone facility \n     bonds that can be issued under the provision.\n       Businesses located in any empowerment zone also qualify for \n     a zero-percent capital gains rate for gain from the sale of a \n     qualifying zone assets acquired after date of enactment and \n     before January 1, 2010, and held for more than five years. \n     Assets that would qualify for this incentive would be similar \n     to the types of assets that qualify for the present-law zero \n     percent capital gains rate for qualifying D.C. Zone assets. \n     The zero-percent capital gains rate is limited to an \n     aggregate amount not to exceed $25 million of gain per \n     taxpayer. Gain attributable to the period before the date of \n     enactment or after December 31, 2014, is not eligible for the \n     zero-percent rate.\n     Renewal zones\n       Designation of 30 renewal zones.--The Secretaries of HUD \n     and Agriculture are authorized to designate up to 30 renewal \n     zones from areas nominated by States and local governments. \n     At least six of the designated renewal zones must be in rural \n     areas. The Secretary of HUD is required to publish (within \n     four months after enactment) regulations describing the \n     nomination and selection process. Designations of renewal \n     zones must be made before January 1, 2002, and the \n     designations are effective for the period beginning on \n     January 1, 2002 through December 31, 2009.\n       Eligibility criteria.--To be designated as a renewal zone, \n     a nominated area must meet the following criteria: (1) each \n     census tract must have a poverty rate of at least 20 percent; \n     (2) in the case of an urban area, at least 70 percent of the \n     households have incomes below 80 percent of the median income \n     of households within the local government jurisdiction; (3) \n     the unemployment rate is at least 1.5 times the national \n     unemployment rate; and (4) the area is one of pervasive \n     poverty, unemployment, and general distress. In general, the \n     areas with the highest average ranking of eligibility factors \n     (1), (2) and (3), above will be designated as renewal zones. \n     States without any empowerment zone would be given priority \n     in the designation process. Moreover, the designations of \n     renewal zones must result in (after taking into account \n     existing empowerment zones) each State having at least one \n     zone designation (empowerment or renewal zone).\n       There are no geographic size limitations placed on renewal \n     zones. Instead, the boundary of a renewal zone must be \n     continuous. In addition, a renewal zone must have a minimum \n     population of 4,000 if the area is located within a \n     metropolitan statistical area (at least 1,000 in all other \n     cases), and a maximum population of not more than 200,000. \n     The population limitations do not apply to any renewal zone \n     that is entirely within an Indian reservation.\n       Required State and local commitments.--In order for an area \n     to be designated as a renewal zone, State and local \n     governments are required to submit a written course of action \n     in which the State and local governments promise to take at \n     least four of the following governmental actions: (1) a \n     reduction of tax rates or fees; (2) an increase in the level \n     of efficiency of local services; (3) crime reduction \n     strategies; (4) actions to remove or streamline governmental \n     requirements; (5) involvement by private entities and \n     community groups, such as to provide jobs and job training \n     and financial assistance; and (6) the gift (or sale at below \n     fair market value) of surplus realty by the State or local \n     government to community organizations or private companies.\n       Enterprise community seeking designation as renewal \n     zones.--An enterprise community can apply for designation as \n     a renewal zone. In selecting a nominated area as a renewal \n     zone, the Secretary shall take into account the status of a \n     nominated area as an enterprise community. If a renewal zone \n     designation is granted, then an area's designation as an \n     enterprise community ceases as of the date the area's \n     designation as a renewal zone takes effect.\n       Tax incentives for renewal zones.--Businesses in renewal \n     zones will have the same tax incentives as businesses in \n     existing empowerment zones (as modified by this provision), \n     which will be available during the period beginning January \n     1, 2002 and ending December 31, 2009 (i.e., a zero percent \n     capital gains rate for qualifying assets; a 15-percent wage \n     credit for qualifying wages; $35,000 in additional 179 \n     expensing for qualifying property; and the enhanced tax-\n     exempt bond rules that currently apply to businesses in the \n     Round II empowerment zones).\n       GAO report.--The General Accounting Office will audit and \n     report to Congress every three years (beginning on January \n     31, 2004) on the renewal zone program and its effect on \n     poverty, unemployment, and economic growth within the \n     designated renewal zones.\n\n\n                             effective date\n\n       The extension of the existing empowerment zone designations \n     is effective after the date of enactment.\n       The additional section 179 expensing and the more generous \n     tax-exempt bond rules for the existing empowerment zones is \n     effective after December 31, 2001. The zero-percent capital \n     gains rate applies to qualifying property purchased after the \n     date of enactment\n\n[[Page S9731]]\n\n     (after December 31, 2001 in the case of renewal zones).\n       The 15-percent wage credit generally is effective for \n     qualifying wages paid after December 31, 2001. With respect \n     to the two additional Round I empowerment zones, however, the \n     wage credit is effective for qualifying wages paid after \n     December 31, 2004.\n       The 30 new renewal zones must be designated by January 1, \n     2002, and the resulting tax benefits will be available for \n     the period beginning January 1, 2002, and ending December 31, \n     2009.\n\n    B. Funding for Round II Empowerment Zones (Sec. 116 of the Bill)\n\n       The provision provides a one-time grant in fiscal year 2001 \n     of $5,000,000 for each of the 15 urban empowerment zones \n     designated pursuant to the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, and \n     $2,000,000 for each of the 5 rural empowerment zones \n     designated pursuant to the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997.\n       The provision also provides a one-time grant $250,000 for \n     each of the remaining Round I enterprise communities (i.e., \n     those that have not become empowerment zones).\n\n  C. Extension and Expansion of District of Columbia Enterprise Zone \n                            (``D.C. Zone'')\n\n  1. Extension of D.C. Zone (Sec. 121 of the Bill and Secs. 1400 and \n                           1400A of the Code)\n\n\n                              present law\n\n       The 1997 Act designated certain economically depressed \n     census tracts within the District of Columbia as the District \n     of Columbia Enterprise Zone (the ``D.C. Zone''), within which \n     businesses and individual residents are eligible for special \n     tax incentives. The D.C. Zone designation remains in effect \n     for the period from January 1, 1998, through December 31, \n     2002. In addition to the tax incentives available with \n     respect to a Round I empowerment zone (including a wage \n     credit), the D.C. Zone also has a zero-percent capital gains \n     rate that applies to gain from the sale of certain qualified \n     D.C. Zone assets acquired after December 31, 1997 and held \n     for more than five years.\n       With respect to the tax-exempt financing incentives, the \n     D.C. Zone generally is treated like a Round I empowerment \n     zone; therefore, the issuance of such bonds is subject to the \n     District of Columbia's annual private activity bond volume \n     limitation. However, the aggregate face amount of all \n     outstanding qualified enterprise zone facility bonds per \n     qualified D.C. Zone business may not exceed $15 million \n     (rather than $3 million, as is the case for Round I \n     empowerment zones).\n\n\n                        explanation of provision\n\n       The provision extends the D.C. Zone designation through \n     December 31, 2006. The provision also conforms the D.C. zone \n     wage credit to the wage credit for existing empowerment \n     zones, so that a 15-percent wage credit applies with respect \n     to qualifying wages beginning in 2003 (and ending on December \n     31, 2006).\n\n\n                             effective date\n\n       The provision extending the designation is effective after \n     the date of enactment. For the D.C. Enterprise Zone, the 15-\n     percent wage credit is effective for qualifying wages paid \n     after December 31, 2002.\n\n 2. Extension of Zero-Percent Capital Gains Rate for D.C. Zone Assets \n           (Sec. 122 of the Bill and Sec. 1400B of the Code)\n\n\n                              present law\n\n       Present law provides a zero-percent capital gains rate for \n     capital gains from the sale of certain qualified D.C. Zone \n     assets held for more than five years. In general, a ``D.C. \n     Zone asset'' means stock or partnership interests held in, or \n     tangible assets held by, a D.C. Zone business. A D.C. Zone \n     business generally refers to certain enterprise zone \n     businesses within the D.C. Zone. For purposes of the zero-\n     percent capital gains rate, the D.C. Zone is defined to \n     include all census tracts within the District of Columbia \n     where the poverty rate is not less than 10 percent as \n     determined on the basis of the 1990 Census (sec. 1400B(d)).\n\n\n                        explanation of provision\n\n       The provision eliminates the 10-percent poverty rate \n     limitation for purposes of the zero-percent capital gains \n     rate. Thus, the zero-percent capital gains rate applies to \n     capital gains from the sale of assets held more than five \n     years attributable to certain qualifying businesses located \n     in the District of Columbia.\n\n\n                             effective date\n\n       The provision is effective for D.C. Zone business stock and \n     partnership interests originally issued after, and D.C. Zone \n     business property assets originally acquired by the taxpayer \n     after, December 31, 2000.\n\n3. Gross Income Test for D.C. Zone Businesses (Sec. 123 of the Bill and \n                        Sec. 1400B of the Code)\n\n\n                              present law\n\n       A zero-percent capital gains rate applies to gain from the \n     sale of certain qualified D.C. zone assets. In general, a \n     D.C. Zone asset means stock or partnership interests held in, \n     or tangible property held by, a D.C. Zone business. A D.C. \n     Zone business generally refers to certain enterprise zone \n     businesses within the D.C. Zone, except that 80 percent of \n     the total gross income of the entity must be derived from the \n     active conduct of the business (sec. 1400B(c)(2)).\n\n\n                        explanation of provision\n\n       The provision reduces the level of gross income needed to \n     qualify as a D.C. Zone business to 50 percent.\n\n\n                             effective date\n\n       The provision is effective for D.C. Zone business stock and \n     partnership interest originally issued after, and D.C. Zone \n     business property originally acquired by the taxpayer after, \n     December 31, 2000.\n\n4. Expansion of District of Columbia Homebuyer Tax Credit (Sec. 124 of \n                  the Bill and Sec. 1400C of the Code)\n\n\n                              present law\n\n       First-time homebuyers of a principal residence in the \n     District of Columbia are eligible for a nonrefundable tax \n     credit of up to $5,000 of the amount of the purchase price. \n     The $5,000 maximum credit applies both to individuals and \n     married couples. Married individuals filing separately can \n     claim a maximum credit of $2,500 each. The credit phases out \n     for individual taxpayers with adjusted gross income between \n     $70,000 and $90,000 ($110,000-$130,000 for joint filers). For \n     purposes of eligibility, ``first-time homebuyer'' means any \n     individual if such individual did not have a present \n     ownership interest in a principal residence in the District \n     of Columbia in the one year period ending on the date of the \n     purchase of the residence to which the credit applies. The \n     credit is scheduled to expire for residences purchased after \n     December 31, 2001.\n\n\n                        explanation of provision\n\n       The provision extends the first-time homebuyer credit for \n     two years, through December 31, 2003. The provision also \n     extends the phase-out range for married individuals filing a \n     joint return so that it is twice that of individuals. Thus, \n     under the provision, the District of Columbia homebuyer \n     credit is phased out for joint filers with adjusted gross \n     income between $140,000 and $180,000.\n\n\n                             effective date\n\n       The provision is effective for taxable years beginning \n     after December 31, 2000.\n\nD. New Markets Tax Credit (Section 131 of the Bill and New Sec. 45D of \n                               the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Some tax incentives are available to taxpayers making \n     investments and loans in low-income communities. For example, \n     tax incentives are available to taxpayers that invest in \n     specialized small business investment companies licensed by \n     the Small Business Administration to make loans to, or equity \n     investments in, small businesses owned by persons who are \n     socially or economically disadvantaged.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision creates a new tax credit for qualified equity \n     investments made to acquire stock in a selected community \n     development entity (``CDE''). The maximum annual amount of \n     qualifying equity investments is capped as follows:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                              Maximum qualifying equity\n               Calendar year                         investment\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2002......................................  $1.0 billion\n2003-2006.................................  1.5 billion per year\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       The amount of the new tax credit to the investor (either \n     the original purchaser or a subsequent holder) is (1) a five-\n     percent credit for the year in which the equity interest is \n     purchased from the CDE and the first two anniversary dates \n     after the interest is purchased from the CDE, and (2) a six-\n     percent credit on each anniversary date thereafter for the \n     following four years. The taxpayer's basis in the investment \n     is reduced by the amount of the credit (other than for \n     purposes of calculating the zero-percent capital gains rules \n     and section 1202). The credit is subject to the general \n     business credit rules.\n       A CDE is any domestic corporation or partnership (1) whose \n     primary mission is serving or providing investment capital \n     for low-income communities or low-income persons, (2) that \n     maintains accountability to residents of low-income \n     communities through the representation of the residents on \n     governing or advisory boards of the CDE, and (3) is certified \n     by the Treasury Department as an eligible CDE. No later than \n     120 days after enactment, the Treasury Department will issue \n     guidance that specifies objective criteria to be used by the \n     Treasury to allocate the credits among eligible CDEs. In \n     allocating the credits, the Treasury Department will give \n     priority to entities with records of having successfully \n     provided capital or technical assistance to disadvantaged \n     businesses or communities, as well as to entities that intend \n     to invest substantially all of the proceeds they receive from \n     their investors in businesses in which persons unrelated to \n     the CDE hold the majority equity interest.\n       If a CDE fails to sell equity interests to investors up to \n     the amount authorized within five years of the authorization, \n     then the remaining authorization is canceled. The Treasury \n     Department can authorize another CDE to issue equity \n     interests for the unused portion. No authorization can be \n     made after 2013.\n       A ``qualified equity investment'' is defined as stock or a \n     similar equity interest acquired directly from a CDE in \n     exchange for cash. Substantially all of the investment \n     proceeds must be used by the CDE to make ``qualified low-\n     income community investments.'' Qualified low-income \n     community investments include: (1) capital or equity \n     investments in, or loans to, qualified active businesses \n     located in low-income communities, (2) certain financial \n     counseling and other services specified in regulations to \n     businesses and residents in low-income communities, (3) the \n     purchase from another CDE of any loan made by such entity \n     that is a qualified low\n\n[[Page S9732]]\n\n     income community investment, or (4) an equity investment in, \n     or loans to, another CDE. Treasury Department regulations \n     will provide guidance with respect to the ``substantially \n     all'' standard.\n       The stock or equity interest cannot be redeemed (or \n     otherwise cashed out) by the CDE for at least seven years. If \n     the entity ceases to be a qualified CDE during the seven-year \n     period following the taxpayer's investment, or if the equity \n     interest is redeemed by the issuing CDE during that seven-\n     year period, then any credits claimed with respect to the \n     equity interest are recaptured (with interest) and no further \n     credits are allowed.\n       A ``low-income community'' is defined as census tracts \n     with: (1) poverty rates of at least 20 percent (based on the \n     most recent census data), or (2) median family income which \n     does not exceed 80 percent of the greater of metropolitan \n     area income or statewide median family income (for a non-\n     metropolitan census tract, 80 percent of non-metropolitan \n     statewide median family income). The Secretary also may \n     designate any area within any census tract as a ``low income \n     community'' provided that (1) the boundary of the area is \n     continuous, (2) the area (if it were a census tract) would \n     satisfy the poverty rate or median income requirements set \n     forth above within the targeted area, and (3) an inadequate \n     access to investment capital exists in the area.\n       A ``qualified active business'' is defined as a business \n     which satisfies the following requirements: (1) at least 50 \n     percent of the total gross income of the business is derived \n     from the active conduct of trade or business activities in \n     low-income communities; (2) a substantial portion of the use \n     of the tangible property of such business is used within low-\n     income communities; (3) a substantial portion of the services \n     performed for such business by its employees is performed in \n     low-income communities; and (4) less than 5 percent of the \n     average aggregate of unadjusted bases of the property of such \n     business is attributable to certain financial property or to \n     collectibles (other than collectibles held for sale to \n     customers). There is no requirement that employees of the \n     business be residents of the low income community.\n       Rental of improved commercial real estate located in a low-\n     income community is a qualified active business, regardless \n     of the characteristics of the commercial tenants of the \n     property. The purchase and holding of unimproved real estate \n     is not a qualified active business. In addition, a qualified \n     active business does not include (a) any business consisting \n     predominantly of the development or holding of intangibles \n     for sale or license; or (b) operation of any facility \n     described in sec. 144(c)(6)(B). A qualified active business \n     can include an organization that is organized on a non-profit \n     basis.\n       The General Accounting Office will audit and report to \n     Congress by January 31, 2004 (and again by January 31, 2007) \n     on the new markets program, including on all qualified \n     community development entities that receive an allocation \n     under the new markets tax credit.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective for qualified investments made \n     after December 31, 2001.\n\n E. Modification of Puerto Rico Economic Activity Tax Credit (Sec. 141 \n                 of the Bill and Sec. 30A of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       The Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 generally \n     repealed the Puerto Rico and possession tax credit. However, \n     certain domestic corporations that had active business \n     operations in Puerto Rico or another U.S. possession on \n     October 13, 1995, may continue to claim credits under section \n     936 or section 30A for a 10-year transition period. Such \n     credits apply to possession business income, which is derived \n     from the active conduct of a trade or business within a U.S. \n     possession or from the sale or exchange of substantially all \n     of the assets that were used in such a trade or business. In \n     contrast to the foreign tax credit, the Puerto Rico and \n     possession tax credit is granted whether or not the \n     corporation pays income tax to the possession.\n       One of two alternative limitations is applicable to the \n     amount of the credit attributable to possession business \n     income. Under the economic activity limit, the amount of the \n     credit with respect to such income cannot exceed the sum of a \n     portion of the taxpayer's wage and fringe benefit expenses \n     and depreciation allowances (plus, in certain cases, \n     possession income taxes); beginning in 2002, the income \n     eligible for the credit computed under this limit generally \n     is subject to a cap based on the corporation's pre-1996 \n     possession business income adjusted for inflation. Under the \n     alternative limit, the amount of the credit is limited to the \n     applicable percentage (40 percent for 1998 and thereafter) of \n     the credit that would otherwise be allowable with respect to \n     possession business income; beginning in 1998, the income \n     eligible for the credit computed under this limit generally \n     is subject to a cap based on the corporation's pre-1996 \n     possession business income. Special rules apply in computing \n     the credit with respect to operations in Guam, American \n     Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. \n     The credit expires for taxable years beginning after December \n     31, 2005.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The bill modifies the credit computed under the economic \n     activity limit with respect to operations in Puerto Rico \n     only. First, the proposal expands the lines of business \n     eligible under the credit to include new lines of business \n     established in Puerto Rico after December 31, 2000, and \n     before January 1, 2005 by existing credit claimants. These \n     ``new opportunity credit'' claimants are eligible to claim \n     credits in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2006. In \n     addition, income eligible for the credit computed under the \n     economic activity limitation is subject to the present-law \n     income limitation. Also, these ``new opportunity credit'' \n     claimants are required to calculate their credit in each \n     taxable year, but claim that amount of credit over a five-\n     year period (on a pro-rata basis) beginning the year in which \n     the credit is earned.\n       In addition, for existing credit claimants, the present-law \n     limitation on income eligible for the credit for any taxable \n     year is increased by the ratio of the average number of full-\n     time employees of the taxpayer during the taxable year to the \n     average number of full-time employees of the taxpayer in 1995 \n     and 1996.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision applies to taxable years beginning after \n     December 31, 2000.\n\n F. Creation of Individual Development Accounts (Secs. 731-741 of the \n                  Bill and New Sec. 530A of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       There are no tax benefits to encourage financial \n     institutions to match savings of low-income individuals.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n     In general\n       The bill creates individual development accounts (``IDAs'') \n     to which eligible individuals can contribute, annually, the \n     lesser of: (1) $2,000; or (2) the individual's taxable \n     compensation for the year. An eligible individual is an \n     individual who is: (1) at least 18 years of age; (2) a \n     citizen or legal resident of the United States; and (3) a \n     member of a household with family gross income of 60 percent \n     or less of national median gross income and a net worth of \n     $10,000 or less.\n     Contributions to an IDA by eligible individuals\n       Only eligible individuals are allowed to contribute to an \n     IDA. Contributions to IDAs by individuals are not deductible, \n     and earnings on such contributions are includible in income.\n     Matching contributions\n       The bill provides a maximum annual tax credit of $270 (90 \n     percent of $300) to a financial institution that makes \n     matching contributions to the IDAs of individuals. This \n     credit is available in each year that a matching contribution \n     is made. An additional $100 tax credit would be allowed for \n     each account opened. The credit is for the costs incurred to \n     open and maintain the account, as well as to provide \n     financial education. The credits could be claimed by the \n     financial institution or its contractual affiliates. It is \n     anticipated that a financial institution may collaborate with \n     one or more contractual affiliates, non-profits, or Indian \n     tribes to carry out the IDA program. Contractual affiliates \n     who provide matching funds should be eligible to receive the \n     matching tax credit.\n       Matching contributions (and earnings thereon) are not \n     includible in the gross income of the eligible individual.\n       If an individual withdraws his or her own IDA contributions \n     (or earnings thereon) for a purpose other than a qualified \n     purpose, then the matching contribution attributable to such \n     individual contribution is forfeited. Matching contributions \n     can be withdrawn only for the following qualified purposes: \n     (1) certain educational expenses; (2) first-time homebuyer \n     expenses; (3) business start-up or expansion purposes; and \n     (4) qualified rollovers.\n     Effect on means-tested programs\n       Any amounts in the IDA are not to be taken into account for \n     certain Federal means-tested programs.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The tax credit provision is effective for contributions to \n     IDAs and matching contributions made with respect to such \n     IDAs after December 31, 2001, and before January 1, 2006.\n\n                        G. Additional Incentives\n\n  1. Exclusion of certain amounts received under the National Health \nService Corps Scholarship Program and the F. Edward Hebert Armed Forces \n Health Professions Scholarship and Financial Assistance Program (sec. \n               171 of the bill and sec. 117 of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       The National Health Service Corps Scholarship Program (the \n     ``NHSC Scholarship Program'') and the F. Edward Hebert Armed \n     Forces Health Professions Scholarship and Financial \n     Assistance Program (the ``Armed Forces Scholarship Program'') \n     provide education awards to participants on condition that \n     the participants provide certain services. In the case of the \n     NHSC Scholarship Program, the recipient of the scholarship is \n     obligated to provide medical services in a geographic area \n     (or to an underserved population group or designated \n     facility) identified by the Public Health Service as having a \n     shortage of health-care professionals. In the case of the \n     Armed Forces Scholarship Program, the recipient of the \n     scholarship is obligated to serve a certain number of years \n     in the military at an armed forces medical facility. Because \n     the recipients are required to perform services in exchange \n     for the education awards, the awards used to pay higher\n\n[[Page S9733]]\n\n     education expenses are taxable income to the recipient.\n       Section 117 excludes from gross income amounts received as \n     a qualified scholarship by an individual who is a candidate \n     for a degree and used for tuition and fees required for the \n     enrollment or attendance (or for fees, books, supplies, and \n     equipment required for courses of instruction) at a primary, \n     secondary, or post-secondary educational institution. The \n     tax-free treatment provided by section 117 does not extend to \n     scholarship amounts covering regular living expenses, such as \n     room and board. In addition to the exclusion for qualified \n     scholarships, section 117 provides an exclusion from gross \n     income for qualified tuition reductions for certain education \n     provided to employees (and their spouses and dependents) of \n     certain educational organizations.\n       Section 117(c) specifically provides that the exclusion for \n     qualified scholarships and qualified tuition reductions does \n     not apply to any amount received by a student that represents \n     payment for teaching, research, or other services by the \n     student required as a condition for receiving the scholarship \n     or tuition reduction.\n       Section 134 provides that any ``qualified military \n     benefit,'' which includes any allowance, is excluded from \n     gross income if received by a member or former member of the \n     uniformed services if such benefit was excludable from gross \n     income on September 9, 1986.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision provides that amounts received by an \n     individual under the NHSC Scholarship Program or the Armed \n     Forces Scholarship Program are eligible for tax-free \n     treatment as qualified scholarships under section 117, \n     without regard to any service obligation by the recipient.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective for education awards received \n     after December 31, 1993.\n\n   2. Extension and Modification of Enhanced Deduction for Corporate \n    Donations of Computer Technology (Sec. 172 of the Bill and Sec. \n                         170(e)(6) of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       The maximum charitable contribution deduction that may be \n     claimed by a corporation for any one taxable year is limited \n     to 10 percent of the corporation's taxable income for that \n     year (disregarding charitable contributions and with certain \n     other modifications) (sec. 170(b)(2)). Corporations also are \n     subject to certain limitations based on the type of property \n     contributed. In the case of a charitable contribution of \n     short-term gain property, inventory, or other ordinary income \n     property, the amount of the deduction generally is limited to \n     the taxpayer's basis (generally, cost) in the property. \n     However, special rules in the Code provide an augmented \n     deduction for certain corporate contributions. Under these \n     special rules, the amount of the augmented deduction is equal \n     to the lesser of (1) the basis of the donated property plus \n     one-half of the amount of ordinary income that would have \n     been realized if the property had been sold, or (2) twice the \n     basis of the donated property.\n       Section 170(e)(6) allows corporate taxpayers an augmented \n     deduction for qualified contributions of computer technology \n     and equipment (i.e., computer software, computer or \n     peripheral equipment, and fiber optic cable related to \n     computer use) to be used within the United States for \n     educational purposes in grades K-12. Eligible donees are: (1) \n     any educational organization that normally maintains a \n     regular faculty and curriculum and has a regularly enrolled \n     body of pupils in attendance at the place where its \n     educational activities are regularly carried on; and (2) tax-\n     exempt charitable organizations that are organized primarily \n     for purposes of supporting elementary and secondary \n     education. A private foundation also is an eligible donee, \n     provided that, within 30 days after receipt of the \n     contribution, the private foundation contributes the property \n     to an eligible donee described above.\n       Qualified contributions are limited to gifts made no later \n     than two years after the date the taxpayer acquired or \n     substantially completed the construction of the donated \n     property. In addition, the original use of the donated \n     property must commence with the donor or the donee. \n     Accordingly, qualified contributions generally are limited to \n     property that is no more than two years old. Such donated \n     property could be computer technology or equipment that is \n     inventory or depreciable trade or business property in the \n     hands of the donor.\n       Donee organizations are not permitted to transfer the \n     donated property for money or services (e.g., a donee \n     organization cannot sell the computers). However, a donee \n     organization may transfer the donated property in furtherance \n     of its exempt purposes and be reimbursed for shipping, \n     installation, and transfer costs. For example, if a \n     corporation contributes computers to a charity that \n     subsequently distributes the computers to several elementary \n     schools in a given area, the charity could be reimbursed by \n     the elementary schools for shipping, transfer, and \n     installation costs.\n       The special treatment applies only to donations made by C \n     corporations. S corporations, personal holding companies, and \n     service organizations are not eligible donors.\n       The provision is scheduled to expire for contributions made \n     in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2000.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The bill extends the current enhanced deduction for \n     donations of computer technology and equipment through \n     December 31, 2003. In addition, the enhanced deduction is \n     expanded to include donations to public libraries.\n\n\n                             Effective date\n\n       The provision is effective upon the date of enactment.\n\n3. Extension of the Adoption Tax Credit (Sec. 173 of the Bill and Sec. \n                            23 of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Taxpayers are entitled to a maximum nonrefundable credit \n     against income tax liability of $5,000 per child for \n     qualified adoption expenses paid or incurred by the taxpayer \n     (sec. 23). In the case of a special needs adoption, the \n     maximum credit amount is $6,000 ($5,000 in the case of a \n     foreign special needs adoption). A special needs child is a \n     child who the State has determined: (1) cannot or should not \n     be returned to the home of the birth parents, and (2) has a \n     specific factor or condition because of which the child \n     cannot be placed with adoptive parents without adoption \n     assistance. The adoption of a child who is not a citizen or a \n     resident of the United States is a foreign adoption.\n       Qualified adoption expenses are reasonable and necessary \n     adoption fees, court costs, attorneys' fees, and other \n     expenses that are directly related to the legal adoption of \n     an eligible child. All reasonable and necessary expenses \n     required by a State as a condition of adoption are qualified \n     adoption expenses. Otherwise qualified adoption expenses paid \n     or incurred in one taxable year are not taken into account \n     for purposes of the credit until the next taxable year unless \n     the expenses are paid or incurred in the year the adoption \n     becomes final.\n       An eligible child is an individual (1) who has not attained \n     age 18 or (2) who is physically or mentally incapable of \n     caring for himself or herself. After December 31, 2001, the \n     credit will be available only for domestic special needs \n     adoptions.\n       No credit is allowed for expenses incurred (1) in violation \n     of State or Federal law, (2) in carrying out any surrogate \n     parenting arrangement, (3) in connection with the adoption of \n     a child of the taxpayer's spouse, (4) that are reimbursed \n     under an employer adoption assistance program or otherwise, \n     or (5) for a foreign adoption that is not finalized.\n       The credit is phased out ratably for taxpayers with \n     modified AGI above $75,000, and is fully phased out at \n     $115,000 of modified AGI. For these purposes modified AGI is \n     computed by increasing the taxpayer's AGI by the amount \n     otherwise excluded from gross income under Code sections 911, \n     931, or 933.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The bill extends the adoption credit for the adoption of \n     non-special needs children for two years through December 31, \n     2003.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective on the date of enactment.\n\n 4. Tax treatment of Alaska Native Settlement Trusts (Sec. 174 of the \n             Bill and New Secs. 646 and 6039H of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       An Alaska Native Settlement Corporation (``ANC'') may \n     establish a Settlement Trust (``Trust'') under section 39 of \n     the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (``ANCSA'') and \n     transfer money or other property to such Trust for the \n     benefit of beneficiaries who constitute all or a class of the \n     shareholders of the ANC, to promote the health, education and \n     welfare of the beneficiaries and preserve the heritage and \n     culture of Alaska Natives.\n       With certain exceptions, once an ANC has made a conveyance \n     to a Trust, the assets conveyed shall not be subject to \n     attachment, distraint, or sale or execution of judgment, \n     except with respect to the lawful debts and obligations of \n     the Trust.\n       The Internal Revenue Service has indicated that \n     contributions to a Trust constitute distributions to the \n     beneficiary-shareholders at the time of the contribution and \n     are treated as dividends to the extent of earnings and \n     profits as provided under section 301 of the Code. The Trust \n     and its beneficiaries are taxed in accordance with trust \n     rules.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       An Alaska Native Corporation may establish a Trust under \n     section 39 of ANCSA and if the Trust makes an election for \n     its first taxable year ending after the date of enactment of \n     the proposal, no amount will be included in the gross income \n     of a beneficiary of such Trust by reason of a contribution to \n     the Trust. In addition, unless the electing Trust fails to \n     meet the transferability requirements of the provision, \n     income of the Trust, whether accumulated or distributed, will \n     be taxed only to the Trust (and not to beneficiaries) at the \n     lowest individual tax rates of 15 percent for ordinary income \n     (and the capital gains rate applicable to individuals subject \n     to such 15 percent rate), rather than at the higher rates \n     generally applicable to trusts or to higher tax bracket \n     beneficiaries.\n       The earnings and profits of the ANC will not be reduced by \n     the amount of contributions to the electing Trust at the time \n     of the contributions. However, the ANC earnings and profits \n     will be reduced (up to the amount of the contributions) as \n     distributions are thereafter made by the electing Trust that \n     would exceed the Trusts's total undistributed net income \n     (less taxes paid) plus tax-exempt income for all prior years \n     during which\n\n[[Page S9734]]\n\n     an election is in effect plus for the current year, computed \n     under Subchapter J. In addition, such distributions that \n     exceed such amounts are to be reported and taxed to \n     beneficiaries as if distributed by the ANC in the year of the \n     distribution by the electing Trust, and will be treated as \n     dividends to beneficiaries to the extent the ANC then has \n     current or accumulated earnings and profits.\n       The fiduciary of an electing Trust must report to the IRS, \n     with the Trust tax return, the amount of distributions to \n     each beneficiary, and the tax treatment to the beneficiary of \n     such distributions under the provision (either as exempt from \n     tax to the beneficiary, or as a distribution deemed made by \n     the ANC). The electing Trust must also furnish such \n     information to the ANC.\n       In the case of distributions that are treated as if made by \n     the ANC, as described above, the ANC must then report such \n     amounts to the beneficiaries and must indicate whether they \n     are dividends or not, in accordance with the earnings and \n     profits of the ANC. The reporting thus required by an \n     electing Trust will be in lieu of, and will satisfy, the \n     reporting requirements of section 6034A (and such other \n     reporting requirements as the Secretary of the Treasury may \n     deem appropriate).\n       If the beneficial interests in the electing Trust or the \n     shares of the ANC may be sold or exchanged to a person in a \n     manner that would not be permitted under ANCSA if the \n     interests were Settlement Common Stock (generally, to a \n     person other than an Alaska Native), then all assets of the \n     Trust that had not been distributed as of the beginning of \n     that taxable year of the Trust are taxed to the extent they \n     would be if they were distributed at that time. Thereafter, \n     the Trust and its beneficiaries are generally subject to the \n     rules of subchapter J and to the generally applicable trust \n     income tax rates.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective for taxable years of Settlement \n     Trusts, their beneficiaries, and sponsoring Alaska Native \n     Corporations ending after the date of enactment, and to \n     contributions made to electing Settlement Trusts during such \n     year and thereafter.\n\n5. Treatment of Indian Tribes as Non-Profit Organizations and State or \n    Local Governments for Purposes of the Federal Unemployment Tax \n      (``FUTA'') (Sec. 175 of the Bill and Sec. 3306 of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Present law imposes a net tax on employers equal to 0.8 \n     percent of the first $7,000 paid annually to each employee. \n     The current gross FUTA tax is 6.2 percent, but employers in \n     States meeting certain requirements and having no delinquent \n     loans are eligible for a 5.4 percent credit making the net \n     Federal tax rate 0.8 percent. Both non-profit organizations \n     and State and local governments are not required to pay FUTA \n     taxes. Instead they may elect to reimburse the unemployment \n     compensation system for unemployment compensation benefits \n     actually paid to their former employees. Generally, Indian \n     tribes are not eligible for the reimbursement treatment \n     allowable to non-profit organizations and State and local \n     governments.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The bill provides that an Indian tribe (including any \n     subdivision, subsidiary, or business enterprise chartered and \n     wholly owned by an Indian tribe) is treated like a non-profit \n     organization or State or local government for FUTA purposes \n     (i.e., given an election to choose the reimbursement \n     treatment).\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision generally is effective with respect to \n     service performed beginning on or after the date of \n     enactment. Under a transition rule, service performed in the \n     employ of an Indian tribe is not treated as employment for \n     FUTA purposes if: (1) it is service which is performed before \n     the date of enactment and with respect to which FUTA tax has \n     not been paid; and (2) such Indian tribe reimburses a State \n     unemployment fund for unemployment benefits paid for service \n     attributable to such tribe for such period.\n\n6. Additional Funding for the Social Services Block Grant (Sec. 176 of \n                               the Bill)\n\n       The provision amends Section 2003(c) of Title XX of the \n     Social Security Act and provides an additional one-time \n     amount of $700,000,000 for fiscal year 2001.\n\n               II. TAX INCENTIVES FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING\n\nA. Increase Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Per Capita Amount (Secs. 201 \n              and 202 of the Bill and Sec. 42 of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       In general, a maximum 70-percent present value tax credit, \n     claimed over a 10-year period is allowed for the cost of \n     rental housing occupied by tenants having incomes below \n     specified levels. The credit percentage for newly constructed \n     or substantially rehabilitated housing that is not Federally \n     subsidized is adjusted monthly by the Internal Revenue \n     Service so that the 10 annual installments have a present \n     value of 70 percent of the total qualified expenditures. The \n     credit percentage for new substantially rehabilitated housing \n     that is Federally subsidized and for existing housing that is \n     substantially rehabilitated is calculated to have a present \n     value of 30 percent of total qualified expenditures.\n       To claim low-income housing credits, project owners must \n     receive an allocation of credit from a State or local housing \n     credit agency. However, no allocation is required for \n     buildings at least 50 percent financed with the proceeds of \n     tax-exempt bonds that received an allocation pursuant to the \n     private activity bond volume limitation of Code section 146. \n     Such projects must, however, satisfy the requirements for \n     allocation under the State's qualified allocation plan and \n     meet other requirements.\n       A building generally must be placed in service during the \n     calendar year in which it receives a credit allocation. \n     However, a housing credit agency can make a binding \n     commitment, not later than the year in which the building is \n     placed in service, to allocate a specified credit dollar \n     amount to such building beginning in a specified later year. \n     In addition, a project can receive a ``carryover allocation'' \n     if the taxpayer's basis in the project as of the close of the \n     calendar year the allocation is made is more than 10 percent \n     of the taxpayer's reasonably expected basis in the project, \n     and the building is placed in service not later than the \n     close of the second calendar year following the calendar year \n     in which the allocation is made. For purposes of the 10-\n     percent test, basis means the taxpayer's adjusted basis in \n     land and depreciable real property, whether or not these \n     amounts are includible in eligible basis. Finally, an \n     allocation of credit for increases in qualified basis may \n     occur in years subsequent to the year the project is placed \n     in service.\n       Authority to allocate credits remains at the State (as \n     opposed to local) government level unless State law provides \n     otherwise. Generally, credits may be allocated only from \n     volume authority arising during the calendar year in which \n     the building is placed in service, except in the case of: (1) \n     credits claimed on additions to qualified basis; (2) credits \n     allocated in a later year pursuant to an earlier binding \n     commitment made no later than the year in which the \n     building is placed in service; and (3) carryover \n     allocations.\n       Each State annually receives low-income housing credit \n     authority equal to $1.25 per State resident for allocation to \n     qualified low-income projects. In addition to this $1.25 per \n     resident amount, each State's ``housing credit ceiling'' \n     includes the following amounts: (1) the unused State housing \n     credit ceiling (if any) of such State for the preceding \n     calendar year; (2) the amount of the State housing credit \n     ceiling (if any) returned in the calendar year; and (3) the \n     amount of the national pool (if any) allocated to such State \n     by the Treasury Department.\n       The national pool consists of States' unused housing credit \n     carryovers. For each State, the unused housing credit \n     carryover for a calendar year consists of the excess (if any) \n     of the unused State housing credit ceiling for such year over \n     the excess (if any) of the aggregate housing credit dollar \n     amount allocated for such year over the sum of $1.25 per \n     resident and the credit returns for such year. The amounts in \n     the national pool are allocated only to a State which, with \n     respect to the previous calendar year allocated its entire \n     housing credit ceiling for the preceding calendar year, and \n     requested a share in the national pool not later than May 1, \n     of the calendar year. The national pool allocation to \n     qualified States is made on a pro rata basis equivalent to \n     the fraction that a State's population enjoys relative to the \n     total population of all qualified States for that year.\n       The present-law stacking rule provides that a State is \n     treated as using its annual allocation of credit authority \n     ($1.25 per State resident) and any returns during the \n     calendar year followed by any unused credits carried forward \n     from the preceding year's credit ceiling and finally any \n     applicable allocations from the National pool.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The bill increases the annual State credit caps from $1.25 \n     to $1.75 per resident beginning in 2001. Also beginning in \n     2001, the per capita cap is modified so that small population \n     states are given a minimum of $2 million of annual credit \n     cap. The $1.75 per capita credit cap and the $2 million \n     amount are indexed for inflation beginning in calendar year \n     2002.\n       The bill also makes two programmatic changes to the credit. \n     First, the bill modifies the stacking rule so that each State \n     is treated as using its allocation of the unused State \n     housing credit ceiling (if any) from the preceding calendar \n     before the current year's allocation of credit (including any \n     credits returned to the State) and then finally any National \n     pool allocations. Second, the bill provides that assistance \n     received under the Native American Housing Assistance and \n     Self-Determination Act of 1986 is not taken into account in \n     determining whether a building is Federally subsidized for \n     purposes of the credit.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective for calendar years beginning \n     after December 31, 2000 and buildings placed-in-service after \n     such date in the case of projects that also receive financing \n     with proceeds of tax-exempt bonds which are issued after such \n     date subject to the private activity bond volume limit.\n\n B. Tax Credit for Renovating Historic Homes (Sec. 211 of the Bill and \n                       New Sec. 25B of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Present law provides an income tax credit for certain \n     expenditures incurred in rehabilitating certified historic \n     structures and certain nonresidential buildings placed in \n     service before 1936 (sec. 47). The amount of the\n\n[[Page S9735]]\n\n     credit is determined by multiplying the applicable \n     rehabilitation percentage by the basis of the property that \n     is attributable to qualified rehabilitation expenditures. The \n     applicable rehabilitation percentage is 20 percent for \n     certified historic structures and 10 percent for qualified \n     rehabilitated buildings (other than certified historic \n     structures) that were originally placed in service before \n     1936.\n       A nonresidential building is eligible for the 10-percent \n     credit only if the building is substantially rehabilitated \n     and a specific portion of the existing structure of the \n     building is retained in place upon completion of the \n     rehabilitation. A residential or nonresidential building is \n     eligible for the 20-percent credit that applies to certified \n     historic structures only if the building is substantially \n     rehabilitated (as determined under the eligibility rules for \n     the 10-percent credit). In addition, the building must be \n     listed in the National Register or the building must be \n     located in a registered historic district and must be \n     certified by the Secretary of the Interior as being of \n     historical significance to the district.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The bill permits a taxpayer to claim a 20-percent credit \n     for qualified rehabilitation expenditures made with respect \n     to a qualified historic home which the taxpayer subsequently \n     occupies as his or her principal residence for at least five \n     years. The total credit which can be claimed by the taxpayer \n     is limited to $20,000. Any eligible credit not claimed by the \n     taxpayer in the year in which the qualified rehabilitation \n     expenditures are made may be carried forward to each of the \n     succeeding 10 years.\n       The bill applies to (1) structures listed in the National \n     Register; (2) structures located in a registered national, \n     State, or local historic district, and certified by the \n     Secretary of the Interior as being of historic significance \n     to the district, but only if the median income of the census \n     tract within which the building is located is less than twice \n     the State median income; (3) any structure designated as \n     being of historic significance under a State or local \n     statute, if such statute is certified by the Secretary of the \n     Interior as achieving the purpose of preserving and \n     rehabilitating buildings of historic significance.\n       A building generally is considered substantially \n     rehabilitated if the qualified rehabilitation expenditures \n     incurred during a 24-month measuring period exceed the \n     greater of (1) the adjusted basis of the building as of the \n     later of the first day of the 24-month period or the \n     beginning of the taxpayer's holding period for the building, \n     or (2) $5,000. Only the $5,000 expenditure requirement \n     applies in the case of structures (1) in empowerment zones, \n     (2) in enterprise communities, (3) in census tracts in which \n     70 percent of families have income which is 80 percent or \n     less of the State median family income, and (4) in areas \n     of chronic distress as designated by the State and \n     approved by the Secretary of Housing and Urban \n     Development. In addition, for all structures, at least \n     five percent of the rehabilitation expenditures must to be \n     allocable to the exterior of the structure.\n       To qualify for the credit, the rehabilitation must be \n     certified by a State or local government subject to \n     conditions specified by the Secretary of the Interior.\n       A taxpayer who purchases a structure on which qualified \n     rehabilitation expenditures have been made may claim credit \n     for such expenditures if the taxpayer is the first purchaser \n     of the structure within five years of the date the \n     rehabilitation was completed and if no credit was allowed to \n     the seller with respect to the qualified expenditures. \n     Alternatively, a taxpayer may elect to receive a historic \n     rehabilitation mortgage credit certificate in lieu of the \n     credit otherwise allowable. A historic rehabilitation \n     mortgage credit certificate may be transferred to a lending \n     institution in exchange for which the lending institution \n     provides the taxpayer with a reduction in interest rate on a \n     mortgage on a qualifying structure. The lending institution \n     would then claim the allowable credits against its tax \n     liability. In the case of a targeted area or enterprise \n     community or empowerment zone, the taxpayer may elect to \n     allocate all or a portion of the mortgage credit certificate \n     to reduce the down payment required for purchase of the \n     structure.\n       If a taxpayer ceases to maintain the structure as his or \n     her personal residence within five years from the date of the \n     rehabilitation, the credit would be recaptured on a pro rata \n     basis.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective for expenditures paid or \n     incurred beginning after December 31, 2001.\n\n     C. Exclusion From Gross Income for Certain Forgiven Mortgage \n      Obligations (Sec. 221 of the Bill and Sec. 108 of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Gross income includes all income from whatever source \n     derived, including income from the discharge of indebtedness. \n     However, gross income does not include discharge of \n     indebtedness income if: (1) the discharge occurs in a Title \n     11 case; (2) the discharge occurs when the taxpayer is \n     insolvent; (3) the indebtedness discharged is qualified farm \n     indebtedness; or (4) except in the case of a C corporation, \n     the indebtedness discharged is qualified real property \n     business indebtedness. No exclusion is provided under present \n     law for qualified residential indebtedness.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       In the case of an individual taxpayer, the bill provides an \n     exclusion from discharge of indebtedness income to the extent \n     such income is attributable to the sale of real property \n     securing qualified residential indebtedness. Qualified \n     residential indebtedness is defined as indebtedness incurred \n     or assumed by the taxpayer for the acquisition, construction, \n     reconstruction, or substantial improvement of the taxpayer's \n     residence and which is secured by such residence. The \n     taxpayer may elect to have this exclusion apply. The \n     exclusion does not apply to qualified farm indebtedness or \n     qualified real property business indebtedness.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective for discharges of indebtedness \n     after the date of enactment.\n\n                       D. Mortgage Revenue Bonds\n\n 1. Increase in Purchase Price Limitation Under Mortgage Subsidy Bond \nRules Based on Median Family Income (Sec. 231 of the Bill and Sec. 143 \n                              of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Qualified mortgage bonds (QMBs) are tax-exempt bonds, the \n     proceeds of which generally must be used to make mortgage \n     loans to first-time homebuyers. The recipients of QMB-\n     financed loans must meet purchase price, income, and other \n     restrictions. Generally, the purchase price of an assisted \n     home may not exceed 90 percent (110 percent in targeted \n     areas) of the average area purchase price.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The bill modifies the purchase price rule for QMB \n     financing. Specifically, QMB financing is allowable to \n     qualified residences the purchase price of which does not \n     exceed the greater of (1) 90 percent of the average area \n     purchase price; or (2) 3.5 times the applicable median family \n     income. The applicable median family income is defined as \n     under the present-law QMB income restriction.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective for bonds issued after the date \n     of enactment.\n\n2. Mortgage Financing for Residences Located in Presidentially Declared \n     Disaster Areas (Sec. 232 of the Bill and Sec. 143 of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Qualified mortgage bonds are private activity tax-exempt \n     bonds issued by States and local governments acting as \n     conduits to provide mortgage loans to first-time home buyers \n     who satisfy specified income limits and who purchase homes \n     that cost less than statutory maximums. The income and \n     purchase price limits are increased for homes purchased in \n     economically distressed areas, and a portion of loans made in \n     such areas is exempt from some requirements.\n       Present law waives the three buyer targeting requirements \n     (the first-time homebuyer, purchase price, and income limit \n     requirements) for a portion of the loans made with proceeds \n     of a qualified mortgage bond issue if the loans are made to \n     finance homes in statutorily prescribed economically \n     distressed areas.\n       For bonds issued during 1997 and 1998, a special exception \n     exempted loans made in Presidentially declared disaster areas \n     within two years of the declaration from the first-time \n     homebuyer limit. In addition, the more liberal income and \n     purchase price rules applicable to economically distressed \n     areas applied to such loans. There was no requirement that \n     the specially treated loans be made to repair or replace \n     housing damaged or destroyed by the disaster.\n\n\n                        explanation of provision\n\n       The bill reinstates, with modifications, the prior-law \n     exception for certain qualified mortgage bond financed loans \n     in Presidentially declared disaster areas. First, the bill: \n     (1) allows loans for replacement housing for housing \n     destroyed in the disaster without regard to the first-time \n     homebuyer requirement; and (2) increases the borrower income \n     and house purchase price requirements to those that apply in \n     targeted areas of economic distress. Second, the bill \n     increases the per-borrower ``home improvement loan'' maximum \n     from $15,000 to $100,000 and extends the more liberal \n     borrower income limits for targeted areas to loans for repair \n     of housing damaged by the disaster. In both cases, the \n     exception applies only to loans made during the two-year \n     period after the area was declared a qualified disaster area. \n     A qualified disaster area is defined as an area determined by \n     the President (1) to warrant assistance under the Robert T. \n     Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act and (2) \n     with respect to which the Federal share of disaster payments \n     exceeds 75 percent.\n\n\n                             effective date\n\n       The provision is effective for bonds issued after December \n     31, 2000.\n\n   E. Provide Tax Exemption for Organizations Created by a State to \nProvide Property and Casualty Insurance Coverage for Property for Which \n Such Coverage Is Otherwise Unavailable (Sec. 241 of the Bill and New \n                      Sec. 501(c)(28) of the Code)\n\n\n                              present law\n\n     In general\n       A life insurance company is subject to tax on its life \n     insurance company taxable income, which is its life insurance \n     income reduced by life insurance deductions (sec. 801).\n\n[[Page S9736]]\n\n     Similarly, a property and casualty insurance company is \n     subject to tax on its taxable income, which is determined as \n     the sum of its underwriting income and investment income (as \n     well as gains and other income items) (sec. 831). Present law \n     provides that the term ``corporation'' includes an insurance \n     company (sec. 7701(a)(3)).\n       In general, the Internal Revenue Service (``IRS'') takes \n     the position that organizations that provide insurance for \n     their members or other individuals are not considered to be \n     engaged in a tax-exempt activity. The IRS maintains that such \n     insurance activity is either (1) a regular business of a kind \n     ordinarily carried on for profit, or (2) an economy or \n     convenience in the conduct of members' businesses because it \n     relieves the members from obtaining insurance on an \n     individual basis.\n       Certain insurance risk pools have qualified for tax \n     exemption under Code section 501(c)(6). In general, these \n     organizations (1) assign any insurance policies and \n     administrative functions to their member organizations \n     (although they may reimburse their members for amounts paid \n     and expenses); (2) serve an important common business \n     interest of their members; and (3) must be membership \n     organizations financed, at least in part, by membership dues.\n       State insurance risk pools may also qualify for tax exempt \n     status under section 501(c)(4) as a social welfare \n     organization or under section 115 as serving an essential \n     governmental function of a State. In seeking qualification \n     under section 501(c)(4), insurance organizations generally \n     are constrained by the restrictions on the provision of \n     ``commercial-type insurance'' contained in section 501(m). \n     Section 115 generally provides that gross income does not \n     include income derived from the exercise of any essential \n     governmental function or accruing to a State or any political \n     subdivision thereof.\n       Certain specific provisions provide tax-exempt status to \n     organizations meeting statutory requirements.\n     Health coverage for high-risk individuals\n       Section 501(c)(26) provides tax-exempt status to any \n     membership organization that is established by a State \n     exclusively to provide coverage for medical care on a \n     nonprofit basis to certain high-risk individuals, provided \n     certain criteria are satisfied. The organization may \n     provide coverage for medical care either by issuing \n     insurance itself or by entering into an arrangement with a \n     health maintenance organization (``HMO'').\n       High-risk individuals eligible to receive medical care \n     coverage from the organization must be residents of the State \n     who, due to a pre-existing medical condition, are unable to \n     obtain health coverage for such condition through insurance \n     or an HMO, or are able to acquire such coverage only at a \n     rate that is substantially higher than the rate charged for \n     such coverage by the organization. The State must determine \n     the composition of membership in the organization. For \n     example, a State could mandate that all organizations that \n     are subject to insurance regulation by the State must be \n     members of the organization.\n       The provision further requires the State or members of the \n     organization to fund the liabilities of the organization to \n     the extent that premiums charged to eligible individuals are \n     insufficient to cover such liabilities. Finally, no part of \n     the net earnings of the organization can inure to the benefit \n     of any private shareholder or individual.\n     Workers' compensation reinsurance organizations\n       Section 501(c)(27)(A) provides tax-exempt status to any \n     membership organization that is established by a State before \n     June 1, 1996, exclusively to reimburse its members for \n     workers' compensation insurance losses, and that satisfies \n     certain other conditions. A State must require that the \n     membership of the organization consist of all persons who \n     issue insurance covering workers' compensation losses in such \n     State, and all persons and governmental entities who self-\n     insure against such losses. In addition, the organization \n     must operate as a nonprofit organization by returning surplus \n     income to members or to workers' compensation policyholders \n     on a periodic basis and by reducing initial premiums in \n     anticipation of investment income.\n     State workmen's compensation act companies\n       Section 501(c)(27)(B) provides tax-exempt status for any \n     organization that is created by State law, and organized and \n     operated exclusively to provide workmen's compensation \n     insurance and related coverage that is incidental to \n     workmen's compensation insurance, and that meets certain \n     additional requirements. The workmen's compensation insurance \n     must be required by State law, or be insurance with respect \n     to which State law provides significant disincentives if it \n     is not purchased by an employer (such as loss of exclusive \n     remedy or forfeiture of affirmative defenses such as \n     contributory negligence). The organization must provide \n     workmen's compensation to any employer in the State (for \n     employees in the State or temporarily assigned out-of-State) \n     seeking such insurance and meeting other reasonable \n     requirements. The State must either extend its full faith and \n     credit to the initial debt of the organization or provide the \n     initial operating capital of such organization. For this \n     purpose, the initial operating capital can be provided by \n     providing the proceeds of bonds issued by a State authority; \n     the bonds may be repaid through exercise of the State's \n     taxing authority, for example. For periods after the date of \n     enactment, either the assets of the organization must revert \n     to the State upon dissolution, or State law must not permit \n     the dissolution of the organization absent an act of the \n     State legislature. Should dissolution of the organization \n     become permissible under applicable State law, then the \n     requirement that the assets of the organization revert to the \n     State upon dissolution applies. Finally, the majority of the \n     board of directors (or comparable oversight body) of the \n     organization must be appointed by an official of the \n     executive branch of the State or by the State legislature, or \n     by both.\n\n\n                        explanation of provision\n\n       The provision provides tax-exempt status for any \n     association created before January 1, 1999, by State law and \n     organized and operated exclusively to provide property and \n     casualty insurance coverage for property located within the \n     State for which the State has determined that coverage in the \n     authorized insurance market is limited or unavailable at \n     reasonable rates, provided certain requirements are met.\n       Under the provision, no part of the net earnings of the \n     association may inure to the benefit of any private \n     shareholder or individual. Except as provided in the case of \n     dissolution, no part of the assets of the association may be \n     used for, or diverted to, any purpose other than: (1) to \n     satisfy, in whole or in part, the liability of the \n     association for, or with respect to, claims made on policies \n     written by the association; (2) to invest in investments \n     authorized by applicable law; (3) to pay reasonable and \n     necessary administration expenses in connection with the \n     establishment and operation of the association and the \n     processing of claims against the association; or (4) to make \n     remittances pursuant to State law to be used by the State to \n     provide for the payment of claims on policies written by the \n     association, purchase reinsurance covering losses under such \n     policies, or to support governmental programs to prepare for \n     or mitigate the effects of natural catastrophic events. The \n     provision requires that the State law governing the \n     association permit the association to levy assessments on \n     insurance companies authorized to sell property and casualty \n     insurance in the State, or on property and casualty insurance \n     policyholders with insurable interests in property located in \n     the State to fund deficits of the association, including the \n     creation of reserves. The provision requires that the plan of \n     operation of the association be subject to approval by the \n     chief executive officer or other official of the State, by \n     the State legislature, or both. In addition, the provision \n     requires that the assets of the association revert upon \n     dissolution to the State, the State's designee, or an entity \n     designated by the State law governing the association, or \n     that State law not permit the dissolution of the association.\n       The provision provides a special rule in the case of any \n     entity or fund created before January 1, 1999, pursuant to \n     State law and organized and operated exclusively to receive, \n     hold, and invest remittances from an association exempt from \n     tax under the provision, to make disbursements to pay claims \n     on insurance contracts issued by the association, and to make \n     disbursements to support governmental programs to prepare for \n     or mitigate the effects of natural catastrophic events. The \n     special rule provides that the entity or fund may elect to be \n     disregarded as a separate entity and be treated as part of \n     the association exempt from tax under the provision, from \n     which it receives such remittances. The election is required \n     to be made no later than 30 days following the date on which \n     the association is determined to be exempt from tax under the \n     provision, and would be effective as of the effective date of \n     that determination.\n       An organization described in the provision is treated as \n     having unrelated business taxable income in the amount of its \n     taxable income (computed as if the organization were not \n     exempt from tax under the proposal), if at the end of the \n     immediately preceding taxable year, the organization's net \n     equity exceeded 15 percent of the total coverage in force \n     under insurance contracts issued by the organization and \n     outstanding at the end of that preceding year.\n       Under the provision, no income or gain is recognized solely \n     as a result of the change in status to that of an association \n     exempt from tax under the provision.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective for taxable years beginning \n     after December 31, 2000. No inference is intended as to the \n     tax status under present law of associations described in the \n     provision.\n\n         III. TAX INCENTIVES FOR URBAN AND RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n A. Increase State Volume Limits on Tax-Exempt Private Activity Bonds \n            (Sec. 301 of the Bill and Sec. 146 of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Interest on bonds issued by States and local governments is \n     excluded from income if the proceeds of the bonds are used to \n     finance activities conducted and paid for by the governmental \n     units (sec. 103). Interest on bonds issued by these \n     governmental units to finance activities carried out and paid \n     for by private persons (``private activity bonds'') is \n     taxable unless the activities are specified in the Internal \n     Revenue Code. Private activity bonds on which interest may be \n     tax-exempt include bonds for privately operated \n     transportation facilities (airports, docks and\n\n[[Page S9737]]\n\n     wharves, mass transit, and high speed rail facilities), \n     privately owned and/or provided municipal services (water, \n     sewer, solid waste disposal, and certain electric and heating \n     facilities), economic development (small manufacturing \n     facilities and redevelopment in economically depressed \n     areas), and certain social programs (low-income rental \n     housing, qualified mortgage bonds, student loan bonds, and \n     exempt activities of charitable organizations described in \n     sec. 501(c)(3)).\n       The volume of tax-exempt private activity bonds that States \n     and local governments may issue for most of these purposes in \n     each calendar year is limited by State-wide volume limits. \n     The current annual volume limits are $50 per resident of the \n     State or $150 million if greater. The volume limits do not \n     apply to private activity bonds to finance airports, docks \n     and wharves, certain governmentally owned, but privately \n     operated solid waste disposal facilities, certain high speed \n     rail facilities, and to certain types of private activity \n     tax-exempt bonds that are subject to other limits on their \n     volume (qualified veterans' mortgage bonds and certain \n     ``new'' empowerment zone and enterprise community bonds).\n       The current annual volume limits that apply to private \n     activity tax-exempt bonds increase to $75 per resident of \n     each State or $225 million, if greater, beginning in calendar \n     year 2007. The increase is, ratably phased in, beginning with \n     $55 per capita or $165 million, if greater, in calendar year \n     2003.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The bill increases the present-law annual State private \n     activity bond volume limits to $75 per resident of each State \n     or $225 million (if greater) beginning in calendar year 2001. \n     In addition, the $75 per resident and the $225 million State \n     limit will be indexed for inflation beginning in calendar \n     year 2002.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provisions are effective for calendar years after \n     December 31, 2000.\n\nB. Extension and Modification to Expensing of Environmental Remediation \n         Costs (Sec. 302 of the Bill and Sec. 198 of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Taxpayers can elect to treat certain environmental \n     remediation expenditures that would otherwise be chargeable \n     to capital account as deductible in the year paid or incurred \n     (sec. 198). The deduction applies for both regular and \n     alternative minimum tax purposes. The expenditure must be \n     incurred in connection with the abatement or control of \n     hazardous substances at a qualified contaminated site.\n       A ``qualified contaminated site'' generally is any property \n     that (1) is held for use in a trade or business, for the \n     production of income, or as inventory; (2) is certified by \n     the appropriate State environmental agency to be located \n     within a targeted area; and (3) contains (or potentially \n     contains) a hazardous substance (so-called ``brownfields''). \n     Targeted areas are defined as: (1) empowerment zones and \n     enterprise communities as designated under present law; (2) \n     sites announced before February 1997, as being subject to one \n     of the 76 Environmental Protection Agency (``EPA'') \n     Brownfields Pilots; (3) any population census tract with a \n     poverty rate of 20 percent or more; and (4) certain \n     industrial and commercial areas that are adjacent to tracts \n     described in (3) above. However, sites that are identified on \n     the national priorities list under the Comprehensive \n     Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of \n     1980 cannot qualify as targeted areas.\n       Eligible expenditures are those paid or incurred before \n     January 1, 2002.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The bill extends the expiration date for eligible \n     expenditures to include those paid or incurred before January \n     1, 2004.\n       In addition, the bill eliminates the targeted area \n     requirement, thereby, expanding eligible sites to include any \n     site containing (or potentially containing) a hazardous \n     substance that is certified by the appropriate State \n     environmental agency. However, expenditures undertaken at \n     sites that are identified on the national priorities list \n     under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, \n     and Liability Act of 1980 would continue to not qualify as \n     eligible expenditures.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision to extend the expiration date is effective \n     upon the date of enactment. The provision to expand the class \n     of eligible sites is effective for expenditures paid or \n     incurred after the date of enactment.\n\n C. Broadband Internet Access Tax Credit (Sec. 303 of the Bill and New \n                         Sec. 48A of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Present law does not provide a credit for investments in \n     telecommunications infrastructure.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The bill provides a 10 percent credit of the qualified \n     expenditures incurred by the taxpayer with respect to \n     qualified equipment with which the taxpayer offers ``current \n     generation'' broadband services to subscribers in rural and \n     underserved areas. In the addition, the bill provides a 20 \n     percent credit of the qualified expenditures incurred by the \n     taxpayer with respect to qualified equipment with which the \n     taxpayer offers ``next generation'' broadband services to \n     subscribers in rural areas, underserved areas, and to \n     residential subscribers. Current generation broadband \n     services is defined as the transmission of signals at a rate \n     of at least 1.5 million bits per second to the subscriber and \n     at a rate of at least 200,000 bits per second from the \n     subscriber. Next generation broadband services is defined as \n     the transmission of signals at a rate of at least 22 million \n     bits per second to the subscriber and at a rate of at least \n     10 million bits per second from the subscriber.\n       Qualified expenditures are those amounts otherwise \n     chargeable to the capital account with respect to the \n     purchase and installation of qualified equipment for which \n     depreciation is allowable under section 168. In the case of \n     current generation broadband services, qualified expenditures \n     are those that are incurred by the taxpayer after December \n     31, 2000, and before January 1, 2004. In the case of next \n     generation broadband services, qualified expenditures are \n     those that are incurred by the taxpayer after December 31, \n     2001, and before January 1, 2005. The expenditures are taken \n     into account for purposes of claiming the credit in the first \n     taxable year in which the taxpayer provides broadband service \n     to at least 10 percent of the potential subscribers. In the \n     case of a taxpayer who incurs expenditures for equipment \n     capable of serving both subscribers in qualifying areas and \n     other areas, qualifying expenditures are determined by \n     multiplying otherwise qualifying expenditures by the ratio of \n     the number of potential qualifying subscribers to all \n     potential subscribers the qualifying equipment would be \n     capable of serving.\n       Qualifying equipment must be capable of providing broadband \n     services at any time to each subscriber who is utilizing such \n     services. In the case of a telecommunications carrier, \n     qualifying equipment is only that equipment that extends from \n     the last point of switching to the outside of the building in \n     which the subscriber is located. In the case of a commercial \n     mobile service carrier, qualifying equipment is only that \n     equipment that extends from the customer side of a mobile \n     telephone switching office to a transmission/reception \n     antenna (including the antenna) of the subscriber. In the \n     case of a cable operator or open video system operator, \n     qualifying equipment is only that equipment that extends from \n     the customer side of the headend to the outside of the \n     building in which the subscriber is located. In the case of a \n     satellite carrier or other wireless carrier (other than a \n     telecommunications carrier), qualifying equipment is only \n     that equipment that extends from a transmission/reception \n     antenna (including the antenna) to a transmission/reception \n     antenna on the outside of the building used by the \n     subscriber. In addition, any packet switching equipment \n     deployed in connection with other qualifying equipment is \n     qualifying equipment, regardless of location, provided that \n     it is the last such equipment in a series as part of \n     transmission of a signal to a subscriber or the first in a \n     series in the transmission of a signal from a subscriber.\n       A rural area is any census tract which is not within 10 \n     miles of any incorporated or census designated place with a \n     population of more than 25,000 and which is not within a \n     county with a population density of more than 500 people per \n     square mile. An underserved area is any census tract which is \n     located in an empowerment zone, enterprise community, renewal \n     zone, or any census tract in which the poverty level is \n     greater than or equal to 30 percent and in which the median \n     family income is less than 70 percent of the greater of \n     metropolitan area median family income or statewide median \n     family income. A residential subscriber is any individual who \n     purchases broadband service to be delivered to his or her \n     dwelling.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective for expenditures incurred after \n     December 31, 2000.\n\n  D. Tax-Credit Bonds for the National Railroad Passenger Corporation \n(``Amtrak'') and the Alaska Railroad (Sec. 304 of the Bill and New Sec. \n                            54 of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Present law does not authorize the issuance by any private, \n     for-profit corporation of bonds the interest on which is tax-\n     exempt or eligible for an income tax credit. Tax-exempt bonds \n     may be issued by States or local governments to finance their \n     governmental activities or to finance certain capital \n     expenditures of private businesses or loans to individuals. \n     Additionally, States or local governments may issue tax-\n     credit bonds to finance the operation of ``qualified zone \n     academies.''\n     Tax-exempt bonds\n       Interest on bonds issued by States or local governments to \n     finance direct activities of those governmental units is \n     excluded from tax (sec. 103). In addition, interest on \n     certain bonds (``private activity bonds'') issued by States \n     or local governments acting as conduits to provide financing \n     for private businesses or individuals is excluded from income \n     if the purpose of the borrowing is specifically approved in \n     the Code (sec. 141). Examples of approved private activities \n     for which States or local governments may provide tax-exempt \n     financing include transportation facilities (airports, ports, \n     mass commuting facilities, and certain high speed intercity \n     rail facilities); public works facilities such as water, \n     sewer, and solid waste disposal; and certain social welfare \n     programs such as low-income rental housing, student loans, \n     and mortgage loans to certain first-time homebuyers. High \n     speed intercity rail\n\n[[Page S9738]]\n\n     facilities eligible for tax-exempt financing include land, \n     rail, and stations (but not rolling stock) for fixed guideway \n     rail transportation of passengers and their baggage using \n     vehicles that are reasonably expected to operate at speeds in \n     excess of 150 miles per hour between scheduled stops.\n       Issuance of most private activity bonds is subject to \n     annual State volume limits of $50 per resident ($150 million \n     if greater). These volume limits are scheduled to increase to \n     $75 per resident ($225 million if greater) over the period \n     2003 through 2007.\n       Investment earnings on all tax-exempt bonds, including \n     earnings on invested sinking funds associated with such bonds \n     is restricted by the Code to prevent the issuance of bonds \n     earlier or in a greater amount than necessary for the purpose \n     of the borrowing. In general, all profits on investment of \n     such proceeds must be rebated to the Federal Government. \n     Interest on bonds associated with invested sinking funds is \n     taxable.\n     Tax-credit bonds for qualified zone academies\n       As an alternative to traditional tax-exempt bonds, certain \n     States or local governments are given authority to issue \n     ``qualified zone academy bonds.'' A total of $400 million of \n     qualified zone academy bonds is authorized to be issued in \n     each year of 1998 through 2001. The $400 million is allocated \n     to States according to their respective populations of \n     individuals below the poverty line.\n       Qualified zone academy bonds are taxable bonds with respect \n     to which the investor receives an income tax credit equal to \n     an assumed interest rate set by the Treasury Department to \n     allow issuance of the bonds without discount and without \n     interest cost to the issuer. The bonds may be used for \n     renovating, providing equipment to, developing course \n     materials for, or training teachers in eligible schools. \n     Eligible schools are elementary and secondary schools with \n     respect to which private entities make contributions equaling \n     at least 10 percent of the bond proceeds.\n       Only financial institutions are eligible to claim the \n     credits on qualified zone academy bonds. The amount of the \n     credit is taken into income. The credit may be claimed \n     against both regular income tax and AMT liability.\n       There are no arbitrage restrictions applicable to \n     investment earnings on qualified zone academy bond proceeds.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision authorizes the National Railroad Passenger \n     Corporation (``Amtrak'') and the Alaska Railroad to issue an \n     aggregate amount of $10 billion of tax-credit bonds to \n     finance its capital projects. Annual issuance of the bonds \n     may not exceed $1 billion per year (plus any authorized \n     amount that was not issued in previous years) during the ten \n     Fiscal Year period, 2001-2010. Unused bond authority could be \n     carried forward to succeeding years until used, subject to a \n     limitation that no tax-credit bonds could be issued after \n     fiscal year 2015.\n       Projects eligible for tax-credit bond financing are defined \n     as the acquisition, construction of equipment, rolling stock, \n     and other capital improvements for (1) the northeast rail \n     corridor between Washington, D.C. and Boston, Massachusetts; \n     (2) high-speed rail corridors designated under section \n     104(d)(2) of Title 23 of the United States Code; and (3) non-\n     designated high-speed rail corridors, including station \n     rehabilitation, track or signal improvements, or grade \n     crossing elimination. The last purpose is limited to a \n     maximum of 10 percent of the proceeds of any bond issue. At \n     least 70 percent of the tax-credit bonds must be issued for \n     projects described in (2) and (3).\n       As with qualified zone academy bonds, the interest rate on \n     Amtrak/Alaska Railroad tax-credit bonds will be set to allow \n     issuance of the bonds at par, i.e., without any interest cost \n     to Amtrak or the Alaska Railroad. In general, proceeds of \n     Amtrak/Alaska Railroad tax-credit bonds would have to be \n     spent within 36 months after the bonds are issued. As of the \n     date the bonds were issued, Amtrak or the Alaska Railroad \n     must certify that it reasonably expects--\n       (1) to incur a binding obligation with a third party to \n     spend at least 10 percent of the bond proceeds within six \n     months (or in the case of self-constructed property, to have \n     commenced construction within six months);\n       (2) to spend the bond proceeds with due diligence; and\n       (3) to spend at least 95 percent of the proceeds for \n     qualifying capital costs within three years.\n       Amtrak/Alaska Railroad tax credit bonds may only be issued \n     for projects that are approved by the Department of \n     Transportation and with respect to which the issuing railroad \n     has binding commitments from one or more States to make \n     matching contributions of at least 20 percent of the project \n     cost. Projects having State matching contributions in excess \n     of 20 percent are given a preference. The State matching \n     contributions, along with earnings on investment of the tax-\n     credit bond proceeds must be invested in a trust account \n     (i.e., an sinking fund) and used along with earnings on the \n     trust account for repayment of the principal amount of the \n     bonds.\n       Amtrak/Alaska Railroad tax-credit bonds can be owned (and \n     income tax credits claimed) by any taxpayer. The amount of \n     the credit will be included in the bondholder's income. \n     Additionally, provisions are included in the proposal to \n     allow the credits to be stripped and sold to different \n     investors than the investors in the bond principal.\n       The required State matching contribution may not be derived \n     from Federal monies. Any Federal Highway Trust Fund monies \n     transferred to the States are treated as Federal monies for \n     this purpose. During the period when tax-credit bonds are \n     authorized, Amtrak is not allowed to receive any Highway \n     Trust Fund monies other than those authorized on the date of \n     the provision's enactment.\n       Amtrak is required annually to submit a five-year capital \n     plan to Congress, and to satisfy independent oversight \n     requirements with respect to the management of tax-credit-\n     bond-financed projects. Finally, the Treasury Department is \n     required to certify annually that funds deposited in the \n     escrow accounts for repayment of tax-credit bonds (with \n     actual and projected earnings thereon) are sufficient to \n     ensure full repayment of the bond principal.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective for tax credit bonds issued by \n     Amtrak or the Alaska Railroad after September 30, 2000.\n\n E. Clarification of Contribution in Aid of Construction (Sec. 305 of \n                   the Bill and Sec. 118 of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Section 118(a) provides that gross income of a corporation \n     does not include a contribution to its capital. In general, \n     section 118(b) provides that a contribution to the capital of \n     a corporation does not include any contribution in aid of \n     construction or any other contribution by a customer or \n     potential customer. However, for any amount of money or \n     property received by a regulated public utility that provides \n     water or sewerage disposal services such amount shall be \n     considered a contribution to capital (excludible from gross \n     income) so long as such amount: (1) is a contribution in aid \n     of construction, and (2) is not included in the taxpayer's \n     rate base for rate-making purposes. If the contribution is in \n     property other than water or sewerage disposal facilities, \n     the amount is generally excludible from gross income only if \n     the amount is expended to acquire or construct water or \n     sewerage disposal facilities within a specified time period.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision specifically defines contribution in aid of \n     construction to include customer connection fees (including \n     amounts paid to connect the customer's line to or extend a \n     main water or sewer line). Thus, the provision permits \n     customer connection fees received by a regulated public \n     utility that provides water or sewerage disposal services to \n     be treated as nontaxable contributions to capital (excludible \n     from gross income). Amounts paid as a service charge for \n     starting or stopping services to a customer continue to be \n     includible in gross income of a taxpayer.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective for amounts received after the \n     date of enactment.\n\n F. Treatment of Leasehold Improvements (Sec. 306 of the Bill and Sec. \n                            168 of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n     Depreciation of leasehold improvements\n       Depreciation allowances for property used in a trade or \n     business generally are determined under the modified \n     Accelerated Cost Recovery System (``MACRS'') of section 168. \n     Depreciation allowances for improvements made on leased \n     property are determined under MACRS, even if the MACRS \n     recovery period assigned to the property is longer than the \n     term of the lease (sec. 168(i)(8)). This rule applies \n     regardless whether the lessor or lessee places the leasehold \n     improvements in service. If a leasehold improvement \n     constitutes an addition or improvement to nonresidential real \n     property already placed in service, the improvement is \n     depreciated using the straight-line method over a 39-year \n     recovery period, beginning in the month the addition or \n     improvement was placed in service (secs. 168(b)(3), (c)(1), \n     (d)(2), and (i)(6)).\n     Treatment of dispositions of leasehold improvements\n       A lessor of leased property that disposes of a leasehold \n     improvement which was made by the lessor for the lessee of \n     the property may take the adjusted basis of the improvement \n     into account for purposes of determining gain or loss if the \n     improvement is irrevocably disposed of or abandoned by the \n     lessor at the termination of the lease. This rule conforms \n     the treatment of lessors and lessees with respect to \n     leasehold improvements disposed of at the end of a term of \n     lease. For purposes of applying this rule, it is expected \n     that a lessor must be able to separately account for the \n     adjusted basis of the leasehold improvement that is \n     irrevocably disposed of or abandoned. This rule does not \n     apply to the extent section 280B applies to the demolition \n     of a structure, a portion of which may include leasehold \n     improvements.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision provides that 15-year property for purposes \n     of the depreciation rules of section 168 includes qualified \n     leasehold improvement property. The straight line method is \n     required to be used with respect to qualified leasehold \n     improvement property.\n       Qualified leasehold improvement property is any improvement \n     to an interior portion of a building that is nonresidential \n     real property, provided certain requirements are met. The \n     improvement must be made under or pursuant to a lease either \n     by the lessee (or sublessee) of that portion of the building, \n     or\n\n[[Page S9739]]\n\n     by the lessor of that portion of the building. That portion \n     of the building is to be occupied exclusively by the lessee \n     (or any sublessee). The original use of the qualified \n     leasehold improvement property must begin with the lessee, \n     and must begin after December 31, 2006. The improvement must \n     be placed in service more than three years after the date the \n     building was first placed in service.\n       Qualified leasehold improvement property does not include \n     any improvement for which the expenditure is attributable to \n     the enlargement of the building, any elevator or escalator, \n     any structural component benefitting a common area, or the \n     internal structural framework of the building.\n       No special rule is specified for the class life of \n     qualified leasehold improvement property. Therefore, the \n     general rule that the class life for nonresidential real and \n     residential rental property is 40 years applies.\n       For purposes of the provision, a commitment to enter into a \n     lease is treated as a lease, and the parties to the \n     commitment are treated as lessor and lessee, provided the \n     lease is in effect at the time the qualified leasehold \n     improvement property is placed in service. A lease between \n     related persons is not considered a lease for this purpose.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective for qualified leasehold \n     improvement property placed in service after December 31, \n     2006.\n\n                       IV. TAX RELIEF FOR FARMERS\n\nA. Farm, Fish, and Ranch Risk Management Accounts (``FFARRM Accounts'') \n          (Sec. 401 of the Bill and New Sec. 468C of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       There is no provision in present law allowing the elective \n     deferral of farm or fishing income.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The bill allows taxpayers engaged in an eligible business \n     to establish FFARRM accounts. An eligible business is any \n     trade or business of farming in which the taxpayer actively \n     participates, including the operation of a nursery or sod \n     farm or the raising or harvesting of crop-bearing or \n     ornamental trees. An eligible business also is the trade or \n     business of commercial fishing as that term is defined under \n     section (3) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and \n     Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1802) and includes the trade or \n     business of catching, taking or harvesting fish that are \n     intended to enter commerce through sale, barter or trade.\n       Contributions to a FFARRM account are deductible and are \n     limited to 20 percent of the taxable income that is \n     attributable to the eligible business. The deduction is taken \n     into account in determining adjusted gross income and reduces \n     the income attributable to the eligible business for all \n     income tax purposes other than the determination of the 20 \n     percent of eligible income limitation on contributions to a \n     FFARRM account. Contributions to a FFARRM account do not \n     reduce earnings from self-employment. Accordingly, \n     distributions are not included in self-employment income.\n       A FFARRM account is taxed as a grantor trust and any \n     earnings are required to be distributed currently. Thus, any \n     income earned in the FFARRM account is taxed currently to the \n     farmer or fisherman who established the account. Amounts can \n     remain on deposit in a FFARRM account for up to five years. \n     Any amount that has not been distributed by the close of the \n     fourth year following the year of deposit is deemed to be \n     distributed and includible in the gross income of the account \n     owner.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective for taxable years beginning \n     after December 31, 2000.\n\n B. Exclusion of Rental Income From SECA Tax (Sec. 402 of the Bill and \n                         Sec. 1402 of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Generally, SECA taxes are imposed on an individual's net \n     earnings from self employment. Net earnings from self-\n     employment generally means gross income (including the \n     individual's net distributive share of partnership income) \n     derived by an individual from any trade or business carried \n     on by the individual less applicable deductions. One \n     exclusion from net earnings from self employment involves \n     certain real estate rentals. Under this rule, net earnings \n     from self employment do not include income from the rental of \n     real estate and from personal property leased with the real \n     estate unless the rental income is received under an \n     arrangement between an owner or tenant of land and another \n     individual that provides: (1) such other individual shall \n     produce agricultural or horticultural commodities on such \n     land; and (2) there shall be material participation by the \n     owner or tenant with respect to any such agricultural or \n     horticultural commodities. Other rules apply to rental \n     payments received by an individual in the course of the \n     individual's trade or business as a real estate dealer.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The bill provides that net earnings from self employment do \n     not include income from the rental of real estate under a \n     lease agreement (rather than an arrangement) between an owner \n     or tenant of land and another individual which provides that: \n     (1) such other individual shall produce agricultural or \n     horticultural commodities on such land; and (2) there shall \n     be material participation by the owner or tenant in the \n     production or management of the production of such \n     agricultural or horticultural commodities.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective for taxable years beginning \n     after December 31, 2000.\n\n  C. Exclusion of Conservation Reserve Program Payments From SECA Tax \n            (Sec. 403 of the Bill and Sec. 1402 of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Generally, SECA tax is imposed on an individual's self-\n     employment income within the Social Security wage base. Net \n     earnings from self-employment generally means gross income \n     (including the individual's net distributive share of \n     partnership income) derived by an individual from any trade \n     or business carried on by the individual less applicable \n     deductions. A recent court decision found that payments made \n     under the conservation reserve program are includible in an \n     individual's self-employment income for purposes of SECA tax.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The bill provides that net earnings from self-employment do \n     not include conservation reserve program payments for SECA.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective for payments made after December \n     31, 2000.\n\n D. Exemption of Agricultural Bonds From Private Activity Bond Volume \n          Cap (Sec. 404 of the Bill and Sec. 146 of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Interest on bonds issued by States and local governments is \n     excluded from income if the proceeds of the bonds are used to \n     finance activities conducted and paid for by the governmental \n     units (sec. 103). Interest on bonds issued by these \n     governmental units to finance activities carried out and paid \n     for by private persons (``private activity bonds'') is \n     taxable unless the activities are specified in the Internal \n     Revenue Code. Private activity bonds on which interest may be \n     tax-exempt include bonds issued to finance loans to first-\n     time farmers for the acquisition of land and certain \n     equipment (``aggie bonds'').\n       The volume of tax-exempt private activity bonds that States \n     and local governments may issue in each calendar year \n     (including aggie bonds) is limited by State-wide volume \n     limits. The current annual volume limits are the greater of: \n     (1) $50 per resident of the State; or (2) $150 million. The \n     volume limits do not apply to private activity bonds to \n     finance airports, docks and wharves, certain governmentally \n     owned, but privately operated solid waste disposal \n     facilities, certain high speed rail facilities, and to \n     certain types of private activity tax-exempt bonds that are \n     subject to other limits on their volume (qualified veterans' \n     mortgage bonds and certain ``new'' empowerment zone and \n     enterprise community bonds).\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The bill exempts ``aggie bonds'' from the State volume \n     limits.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision applies to bonds issued after December 31, \n     2000.\n\n E. Modifications to Section 512(b)(13) (Sec. 405 of the Bill and Sec. \n                            512 of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       In general, interest, rents, royalties and annuities are \n     excluded from the unrelated business income (``UBI'') of tax-\n     exempt organizations. However, section 512(b)(13) treats \n     otherwise excluded rent, royalty, annuity, and interest \n     income as UBI if such income is received from a taxable or \n     tax-exempt subsidiary that is 50 percent controlled by the \n     parent tax-exempt organization. In the case of a stock \n     subsidiary, ``control'' means ownership by vote or value of \n     more than 50 percent of the stock. In the case of a \n     partnership or other entity, control means ownership of more \n     than 50 percent of the profits, capital or beneficial \n     interests. In addition, present law applies the constructive \n     ownership rules of section 318 for purposes of section \n     512(b)(13). Thus, a parent exempt organization is deemed to \n     control any subsidiary in which it holds more than 50 percent \n     of the voting power or value, directly (as in the case of a \n     first-tier subsidiary) or indirectly (as in the case of a \n     second-tier subsidiary).\n       Under present law, interest, rent, annuity, or royalty \n     payments made by a controlled entity to a tax-exempt \n     organization are includible in the latter organization's UBI \n     and are subject to the unrelated business income tax to the \n     extent the payment reduces the net unrelated income (or \n     increases any net unrelated loss) of the controlled entity.\n       The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (the ``1997 Act'') made \n     several modifications, as described above, to the control \n     requirement of section 512(b)(13). In order to provide \n     transitional relief, the changes made by the 1997 Act do not \n     apply to any payment received or accrued during the first two \n     taxable years beginning on or after the date of enactment of \n     the 1997 Act (August 5, 1997) if such payment is received or \n     accrued pursuant to a binding written contract in effect on \n     June 8, 1997, and at all times thereafter before such payment \n     (but not pursuant to any contract provision that permits \n     optional accelerated payments).\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The bill provides that interest, rent, annuity, or royalty \n     payments made by a controlled subsidiary to a tax-exempt \n     parent is not Unrelated Business Income except to the extent \n     that such payments exceed arm's length values, as determined \n     under sec. 482 principles.\n\n[[Page S9740]]\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision generally is effective for payments received \n     or accrued after December 31, 2000. The binding written \n     contract exception contained in the 1997 Act will apply to \n     any payment received or accrued under such contract prior to \n     January 1, 2001.\n\n F. Charitable Deduction for Contributions of Food Inventory (Sec. 406 \n                 of the Bill and Sec. 170 of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       The maximum charitable contribution deduction that may be \n     claimed by a corporation for any one taxable year is limited \n     to 10 percent of the corporation's taxable income for that \n     year (disregarding charitable contributions and with certain \n     other modifications) (sec. 170(b)(2)). Corporations also are \n     subject to certain limitations based on the type of property \n     contributed. In the case of a charitable contribution of \n     short-term gain property, inventory, or other ordinary income \n     property, the amount of the deduction generally is limited to \n     the taxpayer's basis (generally, cost) in the property. \n     However, special rules in the Code provide an augmented \n     deduction for certain corporate contributions. Under these \n     special rules, the amount of the augmented deduction is equal \n     to the lesser of (1) the basis of the donated property plus \n     one-half of the amount of ordinary income that would have \n     been realized if the property had been sold, or (2) twice the \n     basis of the donated property. To be eligible for the \n     enhanced deduction, the taxpayer must establish that the fair \n     market value of the donated item exceeds basis. The valuation \n     of food inventory has been the subject of ongoing disputes \n     between taxpayers and the IRS.\n       The special treatment applies only to donations made by C \n     corporations. S corporations, personal holding companies, and \n     service organizations are not eligible donors.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The bill amends Code section 170 to expand the augmented \n     deduction such that any taxpayer engaged in the trade or \n     business of farming is eligible to claim an enhanced \n     deduction for donations of food inventory under section \n     170(e)(3).\n       The value of the enhanced deduction can be no greater than \n     twice the taxpayer's basis in the donated property. The bill \n     provides that in the case of a cash method taxpayer, the \n     taxpayer's basis in the donated food will equal half of the \n     fair market value of the donated food.\n       The bill modifies and clarifies the determination of fair \n     market value for the donation of food inventory. Under the \n     bill, the fair market value of donated food which cannot or \n     will not be sold solely due to internal standards of the \n     taxpayer, lack of market, or similar circumstances is \n     determined without regard to such factors and, if applicable, \n     by taking into account the price at which the same or similar \n     food items are sold by the taxpayer at the time of the \n     contribution or in the recent past.\n       The bill does not apply for taxable years beginning after \n     December 31, 2003.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective for taxable years beginning \n     after December 31, 2000.\n\n     G. Coordinate Farmers and Fisherman Income Averaging and the \nAlternative Minimum Tax (Sec. 407 of the Bill and Secs. 55 and 1301 of \n                               the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       An individual taxpayer engaged in a farming business as \n     defined by section 263A(e)(4) may elect to compute his or her \n     current year tax liability by averaging, over the prior \n     three-year period, all or portion of his or her taxable \n     income from the trade or business of farming. The averaging \n     election is not coordinated with the alternative minimum tax. \n     Thus, some farmers may become subject to the alternative \n     minimum tax solely as a result of the averaging election.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The bill extends to individuals engaged in the trade or \n     business of fishing the election that is available to \n     individual farmers to use income averaging.\n       The bill also coordinates farmers and fishermen income \n     averaging with the alternative minimum tax. Under the bill, a \n     farmer will owe alternative minimum tax only to the extent he \n     or she will owe alternative minimum tax had averaging not \n     been elected. This result is achieved by excluding the impact \n     of the election to average farm income from the calculation \n     of both regular tax and tentative minimum tax, solely for the \n     purpose of determining alternative minimum tax.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective for taxable years beginning \n     after December 31, 2000.\n\n  H. Cooperative Marketing to Include Value Added Processing Through \n        Animals (Sec. 408 of the Bill and Sec. 1388 of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Under present law, taxable cooperatives in essence are \n     treated as pass-through entities in that the cooperative is \n     not subject to corporate income tax to the extent the \n     cooperative timely pays patronage dividends. Tax-exempt \n     cooperatives (sec. 521) are cooperatives of farmers, fruit \n     growers, and like organizations organized and operated on a \n     cooperative basis for the purpose of marketing the products \n     of members or other producers and turning back the proceeds \n     of sales, less necessary marketing expenses on the basis of \n     either the quantity or the value of products furnished by \n     them.\n       The Internal Revenue Service takes the position that a \n     cooperative is not marketing the products of members or other \n     producers where the cooperative adds value through the use of \n     animals (e.g., farmers sell corn to cooperative which is feed \n     to chickens which produce eggs).\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The bill provides that marketing products of members or \n     other producers includes feeding products of members or other \n     producers to cattle, hogs, fish, chickens, or other animals \n     and selling the resulting animals or animal products.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective for taxable years beginning \n     after the date of enactment.\n\n   I. Extend Declaratory Judgment Procedures to Farmers' Cooperative \n     Organizations (Sec. 409 of the Bill and Sec. 7428 of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Cooperatives may deduct from their taxable income amounts \n     distributed to patrons in the form of patronage dividends, \n     and certain other amounts paid or allocated to patrons, to \n     the extent the net earnings of the cooperative from business \n     done with or for patrons, provided that there is a pre-\n     existing obligation to distribute such amounts (sec. 1382). \n     Cooperatives that qualify as farmers' cooperatives under \n     section 521 may claim additional deductions for dividends on \n     capital stock and patronage-based distributions of \n     nonpatronage income.\n       Under present law, there is limited access to judicial \n     review of disputes regarding the initial or continuing \n     qualification of a farmer's cooperative described in section \n     521. The only remedies available to such an organization are \n     to file a petition in the U.S. Tax Court for relief following \n     the issuance of a notice of deficiency or to pay tax and sue \n     for a refund in a U.S. district court or the U.S. Court of \n     Federal Claims.\n       In limited circumstances, declaratory judgment procedures \n     are available, which generally permit a taxpayer to seek \n     judicial review of an IRS determination prior to the issuance \n     of a notice of deficiency and prior to payment of tax. \n     Examples of declaratory judgment procedures which are \n     available include disputes involving the status of a tax-\n     exempt organization under section 501(c)(3), the \n     qualification of retirement plans, the value of gifts, the \n     status of certain governmental obligations, or eligibility of \n     an estate to pay tax in installments under section 6166. In \n     such cases, taxpayers may challenge adverse determinations by \n     commencing a declaratory judgment action. For example, where \n     the IRS denies an organization's application for recognition \n     of exemption under section 501(c)(3) or fails to act on such \n     application, or where the IRS informs a section 501(c)(3) \n     organization that it is considering revoking or adversely \n     modifying its tax-exempt status, present law authorizes the \n     organization to seek a declaratory judgment regarding its tax \n     exempt status.\n       Declaratory judgment procedures are not available under \n     present law to a cooperative with respect to an IRS \n     determination regarding its status as a farmers' cooperative \n     under section 521.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The bill extends the declaratory judgment procedures to \n     cooperatives. Such a case may be commenced in the U.S. Tax \n     Court, a U.S. district court, or the U.S. Court of Federal \n     Claims, and such court has jurisdiction to determine a \n     cooperative's initial or continuing qualification of a \n     farmers' cooperative described in sec. 521.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective with respect to pleadings filed \n     after the date of enactment, but only with respect to \n     determinations (or requests for determinations) made after \n     January 1, 2000.\n\n J. Small Ethanol Producer Credit (Sec. 410 of the Bill and Sec. 40 of \n                               the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       ``Small ethanol producers'' are allowed a 10-cents-per-\n     gallon production income tax credit on up to 15 million \n     gallons of production annually. This credit is in addition to \n     the 54-cents-per-gallon benefit available for ethanol \n     generally.\n       Under present law, cooperatives in essence are treated as \n     pass-through entities in that the cooperative is not subject \n     to corporate income tax to the extent the cooperative timely \n     pays patronage dividends. Under present law, the only credits \n     that may be flowed-through to cooperative patrons are the \n     rehabilitation credit (sec. 47), the energy property credit \n     (sec. 48(a)), and the reforestation credit (sec. 48(b)), but \n     not the small ethanol producer credit.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The bill: (1) provides that the small producer credit is \n     not a ``passive credit''; (2) allows the credit to be claimed \n     against the alternative minimum tax; and (3) repeals the \n     present rule that the amount of the credit is included in \n     income.\n       The bill also allows cooperatives to elect to pass-through \n     small ethanol producer credits to its patrons. The credit \n     allowed to a patron is that proportion of the credit the \n     cooperative elects to pass-through for that year as the \n     amount of patronage of that patron for that year bears to \n     total patronage of all patrons for that year.\n\n[[Page S9741]]\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective for taxable years beginning \n     after date of enactment.\n\n   K. Payment of Dividends on Stock of Cooperatives Without Reducing \n  Patronage Dividends (Sec. 411 of the Bill and Sec. 1388 of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Cooperatives, including tax-exempt farmers' cooperatives, \n     are treated like a conduit for Federal income tax purposes \n     since a cooperative may deduct patronage dividends paid from \n     its taxable income. In general, patronage dividends are \n     amounts paid to patrons (1) on the basis of the quantity or \n     value of business done with or for its patrons, (2) under a \n     valid enforceable written obligation to the patron to pay \n     such amount, which obligation existed before the cooperative \n     received such amounts, and (3) which is determined by \n     reference to the net earnings of the cooperative from \n     business done with or for its patrons.\n       Treasury Regulations provide that net earnings are reduced \n     by dividends paid on capital stock or other proprietary \n     capital interests. The effect of this rule is to reduce the \n     amount of earnings that the cooperative can treat as \n     patronage earnings which reduces the amount that cooperative \n     can deduct as patronage dividends.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The bill allows cooperatives to pay dividends on capital \n     stock without those dividends reducing excludable patronage-\n     sourced income to the extent that the cooperative's \n     organizational documents provide that the dividends do not \n     reduce amounts owed to patrons.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision applies to distributions in taxable years \n     beginning after the date of enactment.\n\n             V. TAX INCENTIVES FOR THE PRODUCTION OF ENERGY\n\n  A. Allow Geological and Geophysical Costs to be Deducted Currently \n            (Sec. 501 of the Bill and Sec. 263 of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n     In general\n       Under present law, current deductions are not allowed for \n     any amount paid for new buildings or for permanent \n     improvements or betterments made to increase the value of any \n     property or estate (sec. 263(a)). Treasury Department \n     regulations define capital amounts to include amounts paid or \n     incurred (1) to add to the value, or substantially prolong \n     the useful life, of property owned by the taxpayer or (2) to \n     adapt property to a new or different use.\n       The proper income tax treatment of geological and \n     geophysical costs (``G costs'') associated with oil and gas \n     production has been the subject of a number of court \n     decisions and administrative rulings. G costs are incurred \n     by the taxpayer for the purpose of obtaining and accumulating \n     data that will serve as a basis for the acquisition and \n     retention of oil or gas properties by taxpayers exploring for \n     the minerals. Courts have ruled that such costs are capital \n     in nature and are not deductible as ordinary and necessary \n     business expenses. Accordingly, the costs attributable to \n     such exploration are allocable to the cost of the property \n     acquired or retained. The term ``property'' includes an \n     economic interest in a tract or parcel of land \n     notwithstanding that a mineral deposit has not been \n     established or proven at the time the costs are incurred.\n     Revenue Ruling 77-188\n       In Revenue Ruling 77-188 (hereinafter referred to as the \n     ``1977 ruling''), the Internal Revenue Service (``IRS'') \n     provided guidance regarding the proper tax treatment of G \n     costs. The ruling describes a typical geological and \n     geophysical exploration program as containing the following \n     elements:\n       It is customary in the search for mineral producing \n     properties for a taxpayer to conduct an exploration program \n     in one or more identifiable project areas. Each project area \n     encompasses a territory that the taxpayer determines can be \n     explored advantageously in a single integrated operation. \n     This determination is made after analyzing certain variables \n     such as the size and topography of the project area to be \n     explored, the existing information available with respect to \n     the project area and nearby areas, and the quantity of \n     equipment, the number of personnel, and the amount of money \n     available to conduct a reasonable exploration program over \n     the project area.\n       The taxpayer selects a specific project area from which \n     geological and geophysical data are desired and conducts a \n     reconnaissance-type survey utilizing various geological and \n     geophysical exploration techniques that are designed to yield \n     data that will afford a basis for identifying specific \n     geological features with sufficient mineral potential to \n     merit further exploration.\n       Each separable, noncontiguous portion of the original \n     project area in which such a specific geological feature is \n     identified is a separate ``area of interest.'' The original \n     project area is subdivided into as many small projects as \n     there are areas of interest located and identified within the \n     original project area. If the circumstances permit a detailed \n     exploratory survey to be conducted without an initial \n     reconnaissance-type survey, the project area and the area of \n     interest will be coextensive.\n       The taxpayer seeks to further define the geological \n     features identified by the prior reconnaissance-type surveys \n     by additional, more detailed, exploratory surveys conducted \n     with respect to each area of interest. For this purpose, the \n     taxpayer engages in more intensive geological and geophysical \n     exploration employing methods that are designed to yield \n     sufficiently accurate sub-surface data to afford a basis for \n     a decision to acquire or retain properties within or adjacent \n     to a particular area of interest or to abandon the entire \n     area of interest as unworthy of development by mine or well.\n       The 1977 ruling provides that if, on the basis of data \n     obtained from the preliminary geological and geophysical \n     exploration operations, only one area of interest is located \n     and identified within the original project area, then the \n     entire expenditure for those exploratory operations is to be \n     allocated to that one area of interest and thus capitalized \n     into the depletable basis of that area of interest. On the \n     other hand, if two or more areas of interest are located and \n     identified within the original project area, the entire \n     expenditure for the exploratory operations is to be allocated \n     equally among the various areas of interest.\n       The 1977 ruling further provides that if, on the basis of \n     data obtained from a detailed survey that does not relate \n     exclusively to any particular property within a particular \n     area of interest, an oil or gas property is acquired or \n     retained within or adjacent to that area of interest, the \n     entire G exploration expenditures, including those incurred \n     prior to the identification of the particular area of \n     interest but allocated thereto, are to be allocated to the \n     property as a capital cost under section 263(a).\n       If, however, from the data obtained by the exploratory \n     operations no areas of interest are located and identified by \n     the taxpayer within the original project area, then the 1977 \n     ruling states that the entire amount of the G costs related \n     to the exploration is deductible as a loss under section 165 \n     for the taxable year in which that particular project area is \n     abandoned as a potential source of mineral production.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision allows geological and geophysical costs \n     incurred in connection with oil and gas exploration in the \n     United States to be deducted currently.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective for G costs incurred or paid \n     in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2001.\n\n B. Allow Certain Oil and Gas ``Delay Rental Payments'' to be Deducted \n       Currently (Sec. 502 of the Bill and Sec. 263 of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Present law generally requires costs associated with \n     inventory and property held for resale to be capitalized \n     rather than currently deducted as they are incurred. (sec. \n     2634). Oil and gas producers typically contract for mineral \n     production in exchange for royalty payments. If mineral \n     production is delayed, these contracts provide for ``delay \n     rental payments'' as a condition of their extension. The \n     Treasury Department has taken the position that the uniform \n     capitalization rules of section 263A require delay rental \n     payments to be capitalized.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision allows delay rental payments to be deducted \n     currently.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision applies to delay rental payments incurred in \n     taxable years beginning after December 31, 2001.\n       No inference is intended from the proposal as to the proper \n     treatment of pre-effective date delay rental payments.\n\nC. Allow Net Operating Losses from Oil and Gas Properties to be Carried \n  Back for Up to Five Years (Sec. 503 of the Bill and Sec. 172 of the \n                                 Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       A net operating loss (``NOL'') generally is the amount by \n     which business deductions of a taxpayer exceed business gross \n     income. In general, an NOL may be carried back two years and \n     carried forward 20 years to offset taxable income in such \n     years. A carryback of an NOL results in the refund of Federal \n     income tax for the carryback year. A carryforward of an NOL \n     reduces Federal income tax for the carryforward year. Special \n     NOL carryback rules apply to (1) casualty and theft losses of \n     individual taxpayers, (2) Presidentially declared disasters \n     for taxpayers engaged in a farming business or a small \n     business, (3) real estate investment trusts, (4) specified \n     liability losses, (5) excess interest losses, and (6) farm \n     losses.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision provides a special five-year carryback for \n     certain eligible oil and gas losses of independent producers. \n     The carryforward period remains 20 years. An ``eligible oil \n     and gas loss'' is defined as the lesser of (1) the amount \n     which would be the taxpayer's NOL for the taxable year if \n     only income and deductions attributable to operating mineral \n     interests in oil and gas wells were taken into account, or \n     (2) the amount of such net operating loss for such taxable \n     year. In calculating the amount of a taxpayer's NOL \n     carrybacks, the portion of the NOL that is attributable to an \n     eligible oil and gas loss is treated as a separate NOL and \n     taken into account after the remaining portion of the NOL for \n     the taxable year.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The proposal applies to NOLs arising in taxable years \n     beginning after December 31, 2001.\n\n[[Page S9742]]\n\nD. Temporary Suspension of Percentage of Depletion Deduction Limitation \n Based on 65 Percent of Taxable Income (Sec. 504 of the Bill and Sec. \n                           613A of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Depletion, like depreciation, is a form of capital cost \n     recovery. In both cases, the taxpayer is allowed a deduction \n     in recognition of the fact that an asset--in the case of \n     depletion for oil or gas interests, the mineral reserve \n     itself--is being expended in order to produce income. Certain \n     costs incurred prior to drilling an oil or gas property are \n     recovered through the depletion deduction. These include \n     costs of acquiring the lease or other interest in the \n     property and geological and geophysical costs (in advance of \n     actual drilling). Depletion is available to any person having \n     an economic interest in a producing property.\n       Two methods of depletion currently are allowable under the \n     Code: (1) the cost depletion method, and (2) the percentage \n     depletion method (secs. 611-613). Under the cost depletion \n     method, the taxpayer deducts that portion of the adjusted \n     basis of the depletable property which is equal to the ratio \n     of units sold from that property during the taxable year to \n     the number of units remaining as of the end of taxable year \n     plus the number of units sold during the taxable year. Thus, \n     the amount recovered under cost depletion may never exceed \n     the taxpayer's basis in the property.\n       Under the percentage depletion method, generally, 15 \n     percent of the taxpayer's gross income from an oil- or gas-\n     producing property is allowed as a deduction in each taxable \n     year (sec. 613A(c)). The amount deducted generally may not \n     exceed 100 percent of the net income from that property in \n     any year (the ``net-income limitation'') (sec. 613(a)). \n     Additionally, the percentage depletion deduction for all oil \n     and gas properties may not exceed 65 percent of the \n     taxpayer's overall taxable income (determined before such \n     deduction and adjusted for certain loss carrybacks and trust \n     distributions) (sec. 613A(d)(1)).\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision suspends the 65-percent-of-taxable-income \n     limit for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2000 and \n     before January 1, 2004.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective for taxable years beginning \n     after December 31, 2000.\n\nE. Tax Credit for Oil and Gas Production from Marginal Wells (sec. 505 \n                 of the bill and sec. 54A of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       There is no income tax credit for oil or gas production \n     from marginal wells generally. Present law does, however, \n     provide a tax credit for production requiring the use of \n     certain tertiary recovery methods (the ``enhanced oil \n     recovery credit'') (sec. 43).\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision provides an income tax credit equal to $3 per \n     barrel of qualified crude oil produced from a marginal well \n     and 50 cents per 1,000 cubic feet of qualified natural gas \n     production. Qualified production is defined as production up \n     to 1,095 barrels per year (3 barrels per day).\n       The credit applies fully only when oil prices are below \n     $14. The credit phases-out ratably when the price of oil is \n     between $14 and $17 per barrel for oil (and equivalent \n     amounts for natural gas).\n       The credit can be claimed against both the regular income \n     tax and the alternative minimum tax.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The proposal applies to production in taxable years \n     beginning after December 31, 2000.\n\nF. Natural Gas Gathering Lines Treated as 7-Year Property (Sec. 506 of \n                the Bill and Sec. 168(e)(3) of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       The applicable recovery period for assets placed in service \n     under the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System is based \n     on the ``class life of the property.'' The class lives of \n     assets placed in service after 1986 are set forth in Revenue \n     Procedure 87-56. Revenue Procedure 87-56 includes two asset \n     classes that could describe natural gas gathering lines owned \n     by non-producers of natural gas. Asset class 13.2, describing \n     assets used in the exploration for and production of \n     petroleum and natural gas deposits, provides a class life of \n     14 years and a depreciation recovery period of seven years. \n     Asset class 46.0, describing pipeline transportation, \n     provides a class life of 22 years and a recovery period of 15 \n     years. The uncertainty regarding the appropriate recovery \n     period has resulted in litigation between taxpayers and the \n     IRS. Recently, the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals held that \n     natural gas gathering lines owned by non-producers fall \n     within the scope of Asset class 13.2 (i.e., seven-year \n     recovery period).\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The bill establishes a statutory seven-year recovery period \n     for all natural gas gathering lines. A natural gas gathering \n     line would be defined to include pipe, equipment, and \n     appurtenances that are (1) determined to be a gathering line \n     by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or (2) used to \n     deliver natural gas from the wellhead or a common point to \n     the point at which such gas first reaches (a) a gas \n     processing plant, (b) an interconnection with an interstate \n     transmission line, (c) an interconnection with an intrastate \n     transmission line, or (d) a direct interconnection with a \n     local distribution company, a gas storage facility, or an \n     industrial consumer.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective for property placed in service \n     on or after the date of enactment. No inference would be \n     intended as to the proper treatment of such property placed \n     in service before the date of enactment.\n\n G. Clarification of Treatment of Pipeline Transportation Income (Sec. \n               507 of the Bill and Sec. 954 of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Under the subpart F rules, U.S. 10-percent shareholders of \n     a controlled foreign corporation (``CFC'') are subject to \n     U.S. tax currently on their shares of certain income earned \n     by the foreign corporation, whether or not such income is \n     distributed to the shareholders (referred to as ``subpart F \n     income''). Subpart F income includes foreign base company \n     income, which in turn includes five categories of income: \n     foreign personal holding company income, foreign base company \n     sales income, foreign base company services income, foreign \n     base company shipping income, and foreign base company oil \n     related income (sec. 954(a)).\n       Foreign base company oil related income is income derived \n     outside the United States from the processing of minerals \n     extracted from oil or gas wells into their primary products; \n     the transportation, distribution, or sale of such minerals or \n     primary products; the disposition of assets used by the \n     taxpayer in a trade or business involving the foregoing; or \n     the performance of any related services. However, foreign \n     base company oil related income does not include income \n     derived from a source within a foreign country in connection \n     with: (1) oil or gas which was extracted from a well located \n     in such foreign country or, (2), oil, gas, or a primary \n     product of oil or gas which is sold by the CFC or a related \n     person for use or consumption within such foreign country or \n     is loaded in such country as fuel on a vessel or aircraft. An \n     exclusion also is provided for income of a CFC that is a \n     small producer (i.e., a corporation whose average daily oil \n     and natural gas production, including production by related \n     corporations, is less than 1,000 barrels).\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The bill provides an additional exception to the definition \n     of foreign base company oil related income. Under the bill, \n     foreign base company oil related income does not include \n     income derived from a source within a foreign country in \n     connection with the pipeline transportation of oil or gas \n     within such foreign country. Thus, the exception applies \n     whether or not the CFC that owns the pipeline also owns any \n     interest in the oil or gas transported. In addition, the \n     exception applies to income earned from the transportation of \n     oil or gas by pipeline in a country in which the oil or gas \n     was neither extracted nor consumed within such foreign \n     country.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective for taxable years of CFCs \n     beginning after December 31, 2001, and taxable years of U.S. \n     shareholders with or within which such taxable years of CFCs \n     end.\n\n               TITLE VI.

Exclusion of 50 Percent of Gain on Sales of Land or Interests in \nLand or Water to Eligible Entities for Conservation Purposes (Sec. 601 \n               of the Bill and New Sec. 121A of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Gain from the sale or exchange of land held more than one \n     year generally is treated as long-term capital gain.\n       Generally the net capital gain of an individual (i.e., \n     long-term capital gain less short-term capital loss) is \n     subject to a maximum rate of 20 percent.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The bill provides a 50-percent exclusion from a taxpayer's \n     gross income for gain realized on the qualifying sale of \n     land, or an interest in land or water, provided the land, or \n     interest in land or water, has been held by the taxpayer or \n     the taxpayer's family for at least three years prior to the \n     date of sale. A qualifying sale is a sale to any agency of \n     the Federal Government, a State government, or a local \n     government, or a sale to 501(c)(3) organization that is \n     organized and operated primarily to meet a qualified \n     conservation purpose. In addition, to be a qualifying sale, \n     the entity acquiring the land, or interest in land or water, \n     must provide the taxpayer with a letter detailing that the \n     intent of the purchase is to further a qualified conservation \n     purpose. A qualified conservation purpose is (1) the \n     preservation of land areas for outdoor recreation by, or the \n     education of, the general public, (2) the protection of a \n     relatively natural habitat of fish, wildlife, or plants, or \n     similar ecosystem, or (3) the preservation of open space \n     (including farmland and forest land) where the preservation \n     is for the scenic enjoyment of the general public or pursuant \n     to a clearly delineated Federal, State or local governmental \n     conservation policy that will yield a significant public \n     benefit.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective for sales after December 31, \n     2003.\n\n[[Page S9743]]\n\n B. Expand the Estate Tax Rule for Conservation Easements (Sec. 602 of \n                  the Bill and Sec. 2031 of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       An executor may elect to exclude from the taxable estate 40 \n     percent of the value of any land subject to a qualified \n     conservation easement, up to a maximum exclusion of $100,000 \n     in 1998, $200,000 in 1999, $300,000 in 2000, $400,000 in \n     2001, and $500,000 in 2002 and thereafter (sec. 2031(c)). The \n     exclusion percentage is reduced by 2 percentage points for \n     each percentage point (or fraction thereof) by which the \n     value of the qualified conservation easement is less than 30 \n     percent of the value of the land (determined without regard \n     to the value of such easement and reduced by the value of any \n     retained development right).\n       A qualified conservation easement is one that meets the \n     following requirements: (1) the land is located within 25 \n     miles of a metropolitan area (as defined by the Office of \n     Management and Budget) or a national park or wilderness area, \n     or within 10 miles of an Urban National Forest (as designated \n     by the Forest Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture); \n     (2) the land has been owned by the decedent or a member of \n     the decedent's family at all times during the three-year \n     period ending on the date of the decedent's death; and (3) a \n     qualified conservation contribution (within the meaning of \n     sec. 170(h)) of a qualified real property interest (as \n     generally defined in sec. 170(h)(2)(C)) was granted by the \n     decedent or a member of his or her family. For purposes of \n     the provision, preservation of a historically important land \n     area or a certified historic structure does not qualify as a \n     conservation purpose.\n       In order to qualify for the exclusion, a qualifying \n     easement must have been granted by the decedent, a member of \n     the decedent's family, the executor of the decedent's estate, \n     or the trustee of a trust holding the land, no later than the \n     date of the election. To the extent that the value of such \n     land is excluded from the taxable estate, the basis of such \n     land acquired at death is a carryover basis (i.e., the basis \n     is not stepped-up to its fair market value at death). \n     Property financed with acquisition indebtedness is eligible \n     for this provision only to the extent of the net equity in \n     the property. The exclusion from estate taxes does not extend \n     to the value of any development rights retained by the \n     decedent or donor.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The bill expands the availability of qualified conservation \n     easements by eliminating the geographical boundary \n     restrictions. Under the bill, the land qualifies without \n     regard to the distance from which the land is situated from a \n     metropolitan area, national park, wilderness area, or Urban \n     National Forest.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective for estates of decedents dying \n     after December 31, 2001.\n\nC. Cost-Sharing Payments Under the Partners for Wildlife Program (Sec. \n               603 of the Bill and Sec. 126 of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Under present law, gross income does not include the \n     excludable portion of payments made to taxpayers by federal \n     and state governments for a share of the cost of improvements \n     to property under certain conservation programs. These \n     programs include payments received under (1) the rural clean \n     water program authorized by section 208(j) of the Federal \n     Water Pollution Control Act, (2) the rural abandoned mine \n     program authorized by section 406 of the Surface Mining \n     Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, (3) the water bank \n     program authorized by the Water Bank Act, (4) the emergency \n     conservation measures program authorized by title IV of the \n     Agricultural Credit Act of 1978, (5) the agriculture \n     conservation program authorized by the Soil Conservation and \n     Domestic Allotment Act, (6) the great plains conservation \n     program authorized by section 16 of the Soil Conservation and \n     Domestic Policy Act, (7) the resource conservation and \n     development program authorized by the Bankhead-Jones Farm \n     Tenant Act and by the Soil Conservation and Domestic \n     Allotment Act, (8) the forestry incentives program authorized \n     by section 4 of the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of \n     1978, (9) any small watershed program administered by the \n     Secretary of Agriculture which is determined by the Secretary \n     of the Treasury or his delegate to be substantially similar \n     to the type of programs described in items (1) through (8), \n     and (10) any program of a State, possession of the United \n     States, a political subdivision of any of the foregoing, or \n     the District of Columbia under which payments are made to \n     individuals primarily for the purpose of conserving soil, \n     protecting or restoring the environment, improving forests, \n     or providing a habitat for wildlife.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision expands the types of qualified cost-sharing \n     payments to include payments under the Partners for Wildlife \n     Program.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision applies to payments received after the date \n     of enactment.\n\n  D. Incentive for Certain Energy Efficient Property Used in Business \n          (Sec. 604 of the Bill and New Sec. 199 of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       No special deduction is currently provided for expenses \n     incurred for energy efficient building property.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision allows a deduction from income for expenses \n     incurred for energy efficient commercial building property. \n     Energy-efficient commercial building property is defined as \n     property that reduces annual energy and power costs with \n     respect to lighting, cooling, heating, ventilation, and hot \n     water supply by 50 percent or more in comparison to a \n     reference building. A reference building is defined as one \n     which meets the requirements of Standard 90.1-1999 of the \n     American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air \n     Conditioning Engineers and the Illuminating Engineering \n     Society of North America. The maximum deduction would be \n     $2.25 per square foot. For all property eligible for the \n     deduction, the depreciable basis of the property is reduced \n     by the amount of the deduction. For public property, such as \n     schools, the Secretary shall issue regulations to allow the \n     deduction to be allocated to the person primarily responsible \n     for designing the property in lieu of the public entity \n     owner.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The deduction is effective for taxable years beginning \n     after December 31, 2000, and before January 1, 2004.\n\n E. Extension and Modification of Tax Credit for Electricity Produced \n      from Biomass (Sec. 605 of the Bill and Sec. 45 of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n     Section 45\n       An income tax credit is allowed for the production of \n     electricity from either qualified wind energy facilities, \n     qualified ``closed-loop'' biomass facilities, or qualified \n     poultry waste facilities (sec. 45). The current value of the \n     credit is 1.7 cents/kilowatt hour of electricity produced and \n     the value of the credit is indexed for inflation. The credit \n     applies to electricity produced by a qualified wind energy \n     facility placed in service after December 31, 1993, and \n     before January 1, 2002, to electricity produced by a \n     qualified closed-loop biomass facility placed in service \n     after December 31, 1992, and before January 1, 2002, and to a \n     qualified poultry waste facility placed in service after \n     December 31, 1999, and before January 1, 2002. The credit is \n     allowable for production during the 10-year period after a \n     facility is originally placed in service.\n       Closed-loop biomass is the use of plant matter, where the \n     plants are grown for the sole purpose of being used to \n     generate electricity. It does not include the use of waste \n     materials (including, but not limited to, scrap wood, manure, \n     and municipal or agricultural waste). The credit also is not \n     available to taxpayers who use standing timber to produce \n     electricity. In order to claim the credit, a taxpayer must \n     own the facility and sell the electricity produced by the \n     facility to an unrelated party.\n     Section 29\n       Certain fuels produced from ``nonconventional sources'' and \n     sold to unrelated parties are eligible for an income tax \n     credit equal to $3 (generally adjusted for inflation) per \n     barrel or BTU oil barrel equivalent (sec. 29) (referred to as \n     the ``section 29 credit''). Qualified fuels must be produced \n     within the United States. Qualified fuels include:\n       (1) oil produced from shale and tar sands;\n       (2) gas produced from geopressured brine, Devonian shale, \n     coal seams, tight formations (``tight sands''), or biomass; \n     and\n       (3) liquid, gaseous, or solid synthetic fuels produced from \n     coal (including lignite).\n       In general, the credit is available only with respect to \n     fuels produced from wells drilled or facilities placed in \n     service after December 31, 1979, and before January 1, 1993. \n     An exception extends the January 1, 1993 expiration date for \n     facilities producing gas from biomass and synthetic fuel from \n     coal if the facility producing the fuel is placed in service \n     before July 1, 1998, pursuant to a binding contract entered \n     into before January 1, 1997.\n       The credit may be claimed for qualified fuels produced and \n     sold before January 1, 2003 (in the case of nonconventional \n     sources subject to the January 1, 1993 expiration date) or \n     January 1, 2008 (in the case of biomass gas and synthetic \n     fuel facilities eligible for the extension period).\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The bill provides that the present-law tax credit for \n     electricity produced by wind, closed-loop biomass, and \n     poultry waste facilities is expanded to include electricity \n     produced from certain other biomass (in addition to closed-\n     loop biomass and poultry waste) and electricity produced from \n     landfill gas. Taxpayers producing electricity from other \n     biomass or landfill gas may claim credit for production of \n     electricity for three years commencing on the later of \n     January 1, 2001, or the date the facility is placed in \n     service.\n       ``Other biomass'' is defined as solid nonhazardous, \n     cellulose waste material which is segregated from other waste \n     materials and which is derived from forest resources, but not \n     including old growth timber. The term includes urban sources \n     such as waste pallets, crates, manufacturing and construction \n     wood waste, and tree trimmings, or agricultural sources \n     (including orchard tree crops, grain, vineyard, legumes, \n     sugar, and other crop by-products or residues). However, the \n     term does not include unsegregated municipal solid waste, \n     paper that is commonly recycled, or certain chemically \n     treated wood\n\n[[Page S9744]]\n\n     wastes. Qualifying other biomass and landfill gas facilities \n     are limited to facilities owned by the taxpayer.\n       A special rule modifies present-law definition of qualified \n     closed-loop biomass facilities to include facilities in which \n     electricity is produced from closed-loop biomass fuels co-\n     fired with coal.\n       In the case of other biomass facilities, the credit applies \n     to electricity produced after December 31, 2000 from \n     facilities that are placed in service before January 1, 2002 \n     (including facilities placed in service before the date of \n     enactment of this provision). In the case of landfill gas \n     facilities, the credit applies to electricity produced after \n     December 31, 2000, from facilities placed in service after \n     December 31, 1999, and before January 1, 2002. In the case of \n     closed-loop biomass facilities in which closed-loop biomass \n     fuel is co-fired with coal, the credit applies to electricity \n     produced after December 31, 2000, from facilities that are \n     placed in service before January 1, 2002 (including \n     facilities placed in service before the date of enactment of \n     this provision).\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective upon the date of enactment.\n\nF. Credit for Certain Energy Efficient Motor Vehicles (Sec. 606 of the \n                   Bill and New Sec. 30B of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Present law does not provide a credit for the purchase of \n     hybrid vehicles. However, taxpayers may claim a credit of 10 \n     percent of the cost of an electric vehicle up to a maximum \n     credit of $4,000 (sec. 30). A qualified electric vehicle is a \n     vehicle powered primarily by an electric motor drawing \n     current from rechargeable batteries, fuel cells, or other \n     portable sources of electrical current. The credit does not \n     apply to property placed in service after December 31, 2004 \n     and is reduced ratably between 2002 and 2004.\n       Taxpayers may claim an immediate deduction (expensing) for \n     up to $2,000 of the cost of a qualified clean-fuel vehicle \n     which is a car and up to $50,000 in the case of certain \n     trucks or vans (sec. 179A). For the purpose of the deduction, \n     gasoline and diesel fuel are not clean-burning fuels. The \n     deduction expires after December 31, 2004, and is phased out \n     ratably between 2002 and 2004.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The bill provides a temporary tax credit for qualified \n     hybrid vehicles, with a rechargeable energy system used in \n     business and for personal use. For vehicles with a \n     rechargeable energy system that provides five percent to less \n     than 10 percent of the maximum available power, the credit \n     amount is $500; for a system that provides 10 percent to less \n     than 20 percent of maximum available power the credit is \n     $1,000; for a system that provides 20 percent to less than 30 \n     percent of maximum available power, the credit is $1,500; and \n     for a system that provides 30 percent or greater of maximum \n     available power, the credit is $2,000. The credit amount is \n     increased for qualified hybrid vehicles that also actively \n     employ a regenerative braking system that supplies energy to \n     the rechargeable energy storage system. For a hybrid vehicle \n     with a regenerative braking system that provides 20 percent \n     to less than 40 percent of the energy available from braking \n     in a typical 60 miles per hour to zero miles per hour braking \n     event, the additional credit amount is $250, for 40 percent \n     to less than 60 percent, the additional credit would be $500, \n     and for 60 percent or greater, the additional credit is \n     $1,000.\n       In addition, the sponsors note that this proposal is one \n     portion of a package of proposals in the Alternative Fuels \n     Incentives Act. The proposals in that legislation include a \n     tax credit for alternative fuel vehicles, a tax credit for \n     retail sales of alternative motor vehicle fuels, and an \n     extension of the deduction for certain refueling property. \n     The sponsors note the Committee has explored these incentives \n     in a hearing and will continue to seek to address these \n     proposals in appropriate legislation.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The credit is available for a hybrid vehicle placed in \n     service after December 31, 2003, and before January 1, 2005.\n\n                     VII. ADDITIONAL TAX PROVISIONS\n\n  A. Limitation on Use of Non-Accrual Experience Method of Accounting \n            (Sec. 701 of the Bill and Sec. 448 of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       An accrual method taxpayer generally must recognize income \n     when all the events have occurred that fix the right to \n     receive the income and the amount of the income can be \n     determined with reasonable accuracy. An accrual method \n     taxpayer may deduct the amount of any receivable that was \n     previously included in income that becomes worthless during \n     the year.\n       Accrual method taxpayers are not required to include in \n     income amounts to be received for the performance of services \n     which, on the basis of experience, will not be collected (the \n     ``non-accrual experience method''). The availability of this \n     method is conditioned on the taxpayer not charging interest \n     or a penalty for failure to timely pay the amount charged.\n       A cash method taxpayer is not required to include an amount \n     in income until it is received. A taxpayer generally may not \n     use the cash method if purchase, production, or sale of \n     merchandise is an income producing factor. Such taxpayers \n     generally are required to keep inventories and use an accrual \n     method of accounting. In addition, corporations (and \n     partnerships with corporate partners) generally may not use \n     the cash method of accounting if their average annual gross \n     receipts exceed $5 million. An exception to this $5 million \n     rule is provided for qualified personal service corporations. \n     A qualified personal service corporation is a corporation (1) \n     substantially all of whose activities involve the performance \n     of services in the fields of health, law, engineering, \n     architecture, accounting, actuarial science, performing arts \n     or consulting and (2) substantially all of the stock of which \n     is owned by current or former employees performing such \n     services, their estates or heirs. Qualified personal service \n     corporations are allowed to use the cash method without \n     regard to whether their average annual gross receipts exceed \n     $5 million.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision provides that the non-accrual experience \n     method of accounting will be available only for amounts to be \n     received for the performance of qualified personal services. \n     Amounts to be received for all other services will be subject \n     to the general rule regarding inclusion in income. Qualified \n     personal services are personal services in the fields of \n     health, law, engineering, architecture, accounting, actuarial \n     science, performing arts or consulting. As under present law, \n     the availability of this method is conditioned on the \n     taxpayer not charging interest or a penalty for failure to \n     timely pay the amount charged.\n       It is believed that the formula contained in Temp. Reg. \n     Section 1.448-2T does not clearly reflect the amount of \n     income that, based on experience, will not be collected for \n     many qualified personal services providers, especially for \n     those where significant time elapses between the rendering of \n     the service and a final determination that the account will \n     not be collected. Providers of qualified personal services \n     should not be subject to a formula that requires the \n     payment of taxes on receivables that will not be \n     collected. It is intended that the Secretary of the \n     Treasury be directed to amend the temporary regulations to \n     provide a more accurate determination for such qualified \n     personal service providers of amounts to be excluded from \n     income that, based on the taxpayer's experience, will not \n     be collected. In amending such regulations, the Secretary \n     of the Treasury should consider providing flexibility with \n     respect to any formula used to compute the amount of the \n     exclusion, to address the different factual situations of \n     taxpayers.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective for taxable years ending after \n     date of enactment. Any change in the taxpayer's method of \n     accounting necessitated as a result of the provision are \n     treated as a voluntary change initiated by the taxpayer with \n     the consent of the Secretary of the Treasury. Any required \n     section 481(a) adjustment is to be taken into account over a \n     period not to exceed four years under principles consistent \n     with those in Rev. Proc. 98-60.\n\n B. Repeal of Section 1706 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (Sec. 702 of \n                               the Bill)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Under present law, determination of whether a worker is an \n     employee or independent contractor is generally made under a \n     common-law test. Section 530 of the Revenue Act of 1978 \n     provides safe harbors under which a service recipient may \n     treat a worker as an independent contractor for employment \n     tax purposes (regardless of their status under the common-law \n     test) if certain requirements are satisfied. One of the \n     requirements of safe-harbor relief under section 530 is that \n     the taxpayer (or a predecessor) must not have treated any \n     worker holding a substantially similar position as an \n     employee for purposes of employment taxes for any period \n     after 1977. In determining whether workers hold substantially \n     similar positions, one of the factors that is to be taken \n     into account is the relationship of the parties, including \n     the degree of supervision and control of the worker by the \n     taxpayer.\n       Under section 1706 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, section \n     530 safe-harbor relief does not apply to certain technical \n     services personnel.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The bill repeals section 1706 of the Tax Reform Act of \n     1986. Thus, section 530 safe-harbor relief is available with \n     respect to workers covered by section 1706, if the \n     requirements of the safe harbor are otherwise satisfied. The \n     bill does not repeal the consistency requirement with respect \n     to workers covered by section 1706.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The bill is effective for periods beginning after the date \n     of enactment.\n\nC. Expansion of Exemption From Personal Holding Company Tax for Lending \nor Finance Business Companies (Sec. 703 of the Bill and Section 542 of \n                               the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Personal holding companies (``PHC'') are subject to a 39.6 \n     percent tax on undistributed PHC income. This tax can be \n     avoided by distributing the income to shareholders, who then \n     pay shareholder level tax. PHCs are closely held companies \n     with at least 60 percent ``personal holding company income'' \n     (``PHCI''). This is generally passive income, including \n     interest, dividends, and rents. Certain rent is excluded from \n     the definition, if rent is at least 50 percent of the \n     adjusted ordinary gross income of the company and\n\n[[Page S9745]]\n\n     other undistributed PHCI does not exceed 10 percent of the \n     adjusted ordinary gross income.\n       In the case of a group of corporations filing a \n     consolidated return, with certain exceptions, the application \n     of the PHC tax to the group and any member thereof is \n     generally determined on the basis of consolidated income and \n     consolidated PHCI. If any member of the group is excluded \n     from the definition of a PHC under certain provisions \n     (including one for certain lending or finance businesses), \n     then each other member of the group is tested separately for \n     PHC status.\n       A special rule of present law excludes a lending or finance \n     business from the definition of a PHC if certain requirements \n     are met. At least 60 percent of its income must come from the \n     active conduct of a lending or finance business, and no more \n     than 20 percent of its adjusted gross income may be from \n     certain other PHCI. A lending or finance business does not \n     include a business of making loans longer than 144 months (12 \n     years). Also, the deductions attributable to this active \n     lending or finance business (but not including interest \n     expense) must be at least 5 percent of income over $500,000 \n     (plus 15 percent of income under that amount).\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision modifies the personal holding company \n     exclusion for lending or finance companies to provide that, \n     in determining whether a member of an affiliated group (as \n     defined in section 1504(a)(1)) filing a consolidated return \n     is a lending or finance company, only corporations engaged in \n     a lending or finance business are taken into account, and all \n     such companies are aggregated for purposes of this \n     determination. The effect of this rule is to treat a \n     corporation as a lending or finance company if all companies \n     engaged in a lending or finance business in the affiliated \n     group, in the aggregate, satisfy the requirements of the \n     exclusion.\n       The provision also repeals the business expense requirement \n     and the limitation on the maturity of loans made by a lending \n     or finance business.\n       The provision also broadens the definition of a lending or \n     finance business to include providing financial or investment \n     advisory services, as well as engaging in leasing, including \n     entering into leases and/or purchasing, servicing, and/or \n     disposing of leases and leased assets.\n       Rents that are not derived from the active and regular \n     conduct of a lending or finance business would continue to be \n     treated under the present law personal holding company income \n     rules.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective for taxable years beginning \n     after December 31, 2000.\n\n D. Charitable Contribution Deduction for Certain Expenses Incurred in \nSupport of Native Alaskan Subsistence Whaling (Sec. 704 of the Bill and \n                         Sec. 170 of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       In computing taxable income, individuals who do not elect \n     the standard deduction may claim itemized deductions, \n     including a deduction (subject to certain limitations) for \n     charitable contributions or gifts made during the taxable \n     year to a qualified charitable organization or governmental \n     entity (sec. 170). Individuals who elect the standard \n     deduction may not claim a deduction for charitable \n     contributions made during the taxable year.\n       No charitable contribution deduction is allowed for a \n     contribution of services. However, unreimbursed expenditures \n     made incident to the rendition of services to an \n     organization, contributions to which are deductible, may \n     constitute a deductible contribution (Treas. Reg. sec. \n     1.170A-1(g)). Specifically, section 170(j) provides that no \n     charitable contribution deduction is allowed for traveling \n     expenses (including amounts expended for meals and lodging) \n     while away from home, whether paid directly or by \n     reimbursement, unless there is no significant element of \n     personal pleasure, recreation, or vacation in such travel.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The bill allows individuals to claim a deduction under \n     section 170 not exceeding $7,500 per taxable year for certain \n     expenses incurred in carrying out sanctioned whaling \n     activities. The deduction is available only to an individual \n     who is recognized by the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission as \n     a whaling captain charged with the responsibility of \n     maintaining and carrying out sanctioned whaling activities. \n     The deduction is available for reasonable and necessary \n     expenses paid by the taxpayer during the taxable year for (1) \n     the acquisition and maintenance of whaling boats, weapons, \n     and gear used in sanctioned whaling activities, (2) the \n     supplying of food for the crew and other provisions for \n     carrying out such activities, and (3) storage and \n     distribution of the catch from such activities.\n       For purposes of the provision, the term ``sanctioned \n     whaling activities'' means subsistence bowhead whale hunting \n     activities conducted pursuant to the management plan of the \n     Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective for taxable years ending after \n     December 31, 2000.\n\n  E. Treatment of Purchase of Structured Settlements (Sec. 705 of the \n                  Bill and New Sec. 5891 of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Present law provides tax-favored treatment for structured \n     settlement arrangements for the payment of damages on account \n     of personal injury or sickness.\n       Under present law, an exclusion from gross income is \n     provided for amounts received for agreeing to a qualified \n     assignment to the extent that the amount received does not \n     exceed the aggregate cost of any qualified funding asset \n     (sec. 130). A qualified assignment means any assignment of a \n     liability to make periodic payments as damages (whether by \n     suit or agreement) on account of a personal injury or \n     sickness (in a case involving physical injury or physical \n     sickness), provided the liability is assumed from a person \n     who is a party to the suit or agreement, and the terms of the \n     assignment satisfy certain requirements. Generally, these \n     requirements are that (1) the periodic payments are fixed as \n     to amount and time; (2) the payments cannot be accelerated, \n     deferred, increased, or decreased by the recipient; (3) the \n     assignee's obligation is no greater than that of the \n     assignor; and (4) the payments are excludable by the \n     recipient under section 104(a)(2) as damages on account of \n     personal injuries or sickness.\n       A qualified funding asset means an annuity contract issued \n     by an insurance company licensed in the U.S., or any \n     obligation of the United States, provided the annuity \n     contract or obligation meets statutory requirements. An \n     annuity that is a qualified funding asset is not subject to \n     the rule requiring current inclusion of the income on the \n     contract which generally applies to annuity contract holders \n     that are not natural persons (e.g., corporations) (sec. \n     72(u)(3)(C)). In addition, when the payments on the annuity \n     are received by the structured settlement company and \n     included in income, the company generally may deduct the \n     corresponding payments to the injured person, who, in turn, \n     excludes the payments from his or her income (sec. 104). \n     Thus, neither the amount received for agreeing to the \n     qualified assignment of the liability to pay damages, nor the \n     income on the annuity that funds the liability to pay \n     damages, generally is subject to tax.\n       The exclusion for recipients of the periodic payments \n     received under a structured settlement arrangement as damages \n     for personal physical injuries or physical sickness can be \n     contrasted with the treatment of investment earnings that are \n     not paid as damages. If a recipient of damages chooses to \n     receive a lump sum payment (excludable from income under sec. \n     104), and then to invest it himself, generally the earnings \n     on the investment are includable in income. For example, if \n     the recipient uses the lump sum to purchase an annuity \n     contract providing for periodic payments, then a portion of \n     each payment under the annuity contract is includable in \n     income, and the balance is excludable under present-law rules \n     based on the ratio of the individual's investment in the \n     contract to the expected return on the contract (sec. 72(b)).\n       Present law provides that the payments to the injured \n     person under the qualified assignment cannot be accelerated, \n     deferred, increased, or decreased by the recipient. \n     Consistent with these requirements, it is understood that \n     contracts under structured settlement arrangements generally \n     contain anti-assignment clauses. It is understood, however, \n     that injured persons may nonetheless be willing to accept \n     discounted lump sum payments from certain ``factoring'' \n     companies in exchange for their payment streams. The tax \n     effect on the parties of these transactions may not be \n     completely clear under present law.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision generally imposes an excise tax on any person \n     acquiring a payment stream under a structured settlement \n     arrangement. The amount of the excise tax is 40 percent of \n     the excess of (1) the undiscounted amount of the payment \n     stream acquired, over (2) the total amount actually paid.\n       The 40 percent excise tax does not apply, however, if the \n     transfer is approved in advance in a final court order (or \n     order of the responsible administrative authority) that \n     finds: (1) that the transaction does not contravene any \n     Federal or State statute or the order of any court or \n     responsible administrative authority; and (2) is in the best \n     interest of the payee, taking into account the welfare and \n     support of the payee's dependents. Rules are provided for \n     determining the applicable State statute.\n       The provision also provides that the acquisition \n     transaction does not affect the application of certain \n     present-law rules, if those rules were satisfied at the time \n     the structured settlement was entered into. The rules are \n     section 130 (relating to an exclusion from gross income for \n     personal injury liability assignments), section 72 (relating \n     to annuities), sections 104(a)(1) and (2) (relating to an \n     exclusion for amounts received under workers' compensation \n     acts and for damages on account of personal physical injuries \n     or physical sickness), and section 461(h) (relating to the \n     time of economic performance in determining the taxable year \n     of a deduction).\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision generally is effective for acquisition \n     transactions entered into on or after 30 days following \n     enactment. A transition rule applies during the period from \n     that date to July 1, 2002. If no applicable State law \n     (relating to the best interest of the payee) applies to a \n     transfer during that period, then the exception from the 40 \n     percent\n\n[[Page S9746]]\n\n     excise tax is available without the otherwise required court \n     (or administrative) order, provided certain disclosure \n     requirements are met. Under the transition rule, the person \n     acquiring the structured settlement payments is required to \n     disclose in advance to the payee: (1) the amounts and due \n     dates of the payments to be transferred; (2) the aggregate \n     amount to be transferred; (3) the consideration to be \n     received by the payee; (4) the discounted present value of \n     the transferred payments; and (5) the expenses to be paid by \n     the payee or deducted from the payee's proceeds.\n       The provision providing that the acquisition transaction \n     does not affect the application of certain present-law rules \n     is effective for transactions entered into before, on, or \n     after the 30th day following enactment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI:\n  S. 3153. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Air force to convey \ncertain excess personal property of the Air force to Roosevelt General \nHospital, Portales, New Mexico; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n    Conveyance of Air Force Property to Roosevelt General Hospital, \n                          Portales, New Mexico\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation of \nimportance to military members serving at Cannon Air Force Base and the \ncommunity serving that Air Force Base. This bill would allow the \nSecretary of the Air Force to convey hospital equipment from a closed \nhospital facility at Cannon to a new public hospital in Portales, New \nMexico.\n  This is another win-win possibility for the local Air Force personnel \nand the surrounding community. The hospital at Cannon Air Force Base \nwas closed several years ago. However, the equipment remains at that \nfacility and has been collecting dust since the facility's closure.\n  A new, state-of-the-art hospital is now being built to serve \nRoosevelt County citizens. While the County has taken tremendous \nstrides towards establishing a first-rate hospital, excess equipment \nfrom the Air Force Base would help ameliorate immediate costs of fully \nequipping the new hospital. In addition, service members and their \nfamilies who reside in Portales will certainly make use of the new \nhospital facility in their area.\n  The Wing Commander and Medical Commander at Cannon Air Force Base \nagree that this is a beneficial arrangement. They have met with local \ncommunity leaders and civilian hospital administrators to carefully \nreview what equipment from the closed Air Force facility should be \ntransferred to the new community hospital. Everyone agrees that this is \na positive action to strengthen relations and provide better medical \ncare for both civilian and military community members.\n  Mr. President, the Air Force is striving to explore novel, beneficial \narrangements with local civilian communities to provide medical care \nfor its personnel. This bill, which is entirely discretionary, but \nwould expedite the process, is an easy, common sense approach to \nachieving that goal. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3153\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CONVEYANCE OF AIR FORCE PROPERTY TO ROOSEVELT \n                   GENERAL HOSPITAL, PORTALES, NEW MEXICO.\n\n       (a) Authority.--The Secretary of the Air Force is \n     authorized to convey to the Roosevelt General Hospital, \n     Portales, New Mexico, without consideration, and without \n     regard to title II of the Federal Property and Administrative \n     Services Act of 1949, all right, title, and interest of the \n     United States in any personal property of the Air Force that \n     the Secretary determines--\n       (1) is appropriate for use by the Roosevelt General \n     Hospital in the operation of that hospital; and\n       (2) is excess to the needs of the Air Force.\n       (b) Additional Terms and Conditions.--The Secretary may \n     require any additional terms and conditions in connection \n     with any conveyance under subsection (a) that the Secretary \n     considers appropriate to protect the interests of the United \n     States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. MOYNIHAN (for himself and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 3154. A bill to establish the Erie Canalway National Heritage \nCorridor in the State of New York, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                 erie canal national heritage corridor\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, in April, 1808, Secretary of the \nTreasury Albert Gallatin proposed to the Senate a national system of \nroads and canals, an idea feasible because payment of the National debt \nwas within reach. It was a time for thinking big. A canal between the \nHudson River and Lake Erie was one of his recommendations. As \nassemblyman from Onondaga County, Joshua Forman, traveled to Washington \nto tell President Jefferson that New York was ready to proceed with a \ncanal 350 miles through the wilderness. Jefferson said ``. . . it is \nlittle short of madness to think of it at this day,'' and later wrote \nthat New York had anticipated by a full century the means to build such \na waterway.\n  New York proceeded on its own. Seventeen years and $7,143,789 later \nwe had our canal, the Erie Canal. Towns sprang up along the way, often \nat the locks, and prospered. Lockport, Spencerport, Fairport, Macedon, \nUtica, Canajoharie, Scotia. Then the railroads came, and some could not \nmaintain that prosperity. The canal was rebuilt and enlarged between \n1835 and 1862 to accommodate larger vessels. At the turn of the 20th \ncentury much of the original channel was abandoned and a new one was \ncreated by greatly altering natural waterways. This canal system \ncontinued to support considerable freight traffic until the opening of \nthe St. Lawrence Seaway in 1959.\n  Today many segments and fragments of the original canal still exist \nacross the state, as do examples of the first expansion in the 1830s. \nTogether they show us one of the first great public works projects in \nthis country, the means by which many thousands of settlers moved west \nand many tons of food and raw materials moved east. The Erie Canal \ncreated the first effective means of interstate commerce in the nation \nand realigned the relationship among regions. In conjunction with the \nHudson River it fueled the growth of New York City. Put simple, New \nYork would not have become the Empire State without it.\n  The canal today is primarily a recreational resource. Thanks to the \nGreat Lakes Water Quality Agreement of 1972, the water flowing out of \nLake Erie is much cleaner than it once was, making boating and \nrecreation along the canal much more enjoyable. Today my colleague \nSenator Schumer and I are introducing a bill that would establish the \nErie Canalway National Heritage Corridor. The National Park Service \nconducted a special resource study and found that the canal system \n``contains resources and represents themes that are of national \nsignificance.'' Moreover, ``no single unit (of the Park Service) now \nexists that can offer as complete a portrait of the development of the \nUnited States from the last part of the 18th through the early 20th \ncenturies.''\n  This designation would provide Park Service resources and some \nfunding that would help improve education, historic preservation, open \nspace protection, and trail development along the canal corridor. I \nbelieve it would be a great benefit for those cities, towns, and \nresidents along the canal system. I also believe no other corridor \ndeserves this designation as much. I ask my colleagues for their \nsupport, and I ask that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3154\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; DEFINITIONS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Erie \n     Canalway National Heritage Corridor Act of 2000''.\n       (b) Definitions.--For the purposes of this Act, the \n     following definitions shall apply:\n       (1) Erie canalway.--The term ``Erie Canalway'' shall mean \n     the 524 miles of navigable canal that comprise the New York \n     State Canal System, including the Erie, Cayuga and Seneca, \n     Oswego and Champlain canals, as well as, the historic \n     alignments of these canals including the cities of Albany and \n     Buffalo.\n       (2) Canalway plan.--The term ``Canalway Plan'' shall mean \n     the comprehensive preservation and management plan for the \n     Corridor required under section 6.\n       (3) Commission.--The term ``Commission'' shall mean the \n     Erie Canalway National Heritage Corridor Commission \n     established under section 4.\n       (4) Corridor.--The term ``Corridor'' shall mean the Erie \n     Canalway National Heritage Corridor established under section \n     3.\n\n[[Page S9747]]\n\n       (5) Governor.--The term ``Governor'' shall mean the \n     Governor of the State of New York.\n       (6) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' shall mean the \n     Secretary of the Interior.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the year 2000 marks the 175th Anniversary of New York \n     State's creation and stewardship of the Erie Canalway for \n     commerce, transportation and recreational purposes, \n     establishing the network which made New York the ``Empire \n     State'' and the Nation's premier commercial and financial \n     center;\n       (2) the canals and adjacent areas that comprise the Erie \n     Canalway are a nationally significant resource of historic \n     and recreational value, which merit Federal recognition and \n     assistance;\n       (3) the Erie Canalway was instrumental in the establishment \n     of strong political and cultural ties between New England, \n     upstate New York and the old Northwest and facilitated the \n     movement of ideas and people ensuring that social reforms \n     like the abolition of slavery and the women's rights movement \n     spread across upstate New York to the rest of the country;\n       (4) the construction of the Erie Canalway was considered a \n     supreme engineering feat, and most American canals were \n     modeled after New York State's canal;\n       (5) at the time of construction, the Erie Canalway was the \n     largest public works project ever undertaken by a state, \n     resulting in the creation of critical transportation and \n     commercial routes to transport passengers and goods;\n       (6) the Erie Canalway played a key role in turning New York \n     City into a major port and New York State into the preeminent \n     center for commerce, industry, and finance in North America \n     and provided a permanent commercial link between the Port of \n     New York and the cities of eastern Canada, a cornerstone of \n     the peaceful relationship between the two countries;\n       (7) the Erie Canalway proved the depth and force of \n     American ingenuity, solidified a national identity, and found \n     an enduring place in American legend, song, and art;\n       (8) there is national interest in the preservation and \n     interpretation of the Erie Canalway's important historical, \n     natural, cultural, and scenic resources; and\n       (9) partnerships among Federal, State, and local \n     governments and their regional entities, nonprofit \n     organizations, and the private sector offer the most \n     effective opportunities for the preservation and \n     interpretation of the Erie Canalway.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to designate the Erie Canalway National Heritage \n     Corridor;\n       (2) to provide for and assist in the identification, \n     preservation, promotion, maintenance and interpretation of \n     the historical, natural, cultural, scenic, and recreational \n     resources of the Erie Canalway in ways that reflect its \n     national significance for the benefit of current and future \n     generations;\n       (3) to promote and provide access to the Erie Canalway's \n     historical, natural, cultural, scenic and recreational \n     resources;\n       (4) to provide a framework to assist the State of New York, \n     its units of local government, and the communities within the \n     Erie Canalway in the development of integrated cultural, \n     historical, recreational, economic, and community development \n     programs in order to enhance and interpret the unique and \n     nationally significant resources of the Erie Canalway; and\n       (5) to authorize Federal financial and technical assistance \n     to the Commission to serve these purposes for the benefit of \n     the people of the State of New York and the nation.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to authorize the President to award a gold medal on \nbehalf of the Congress to Oskar Schindler and Varian Fry in recognition \nof their contributions to the Nation and humanity; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n honoring oskar schindler and varian fry with congressional gold medals\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am pleased to submit a resolution \nhonoring Oskar Schindler and Varian Fry, two individuals to whom \napproximately 3,200 individuals owe their lives and the world owes a \ntremendous debt of gratitude.\n  The tragedy of the Holocaust, which claimed the lives of more than 13 \nmillion people, will forever stand as a painful reminder of the frailty \nand value of human life. During this dark hour of history, two \nremarkable individuals among many other heroes, Oskar Schindler and \nVarian Fry, overcame difficult and dangerous circumstances and risked \ntheir lives to save their fellow human beings.\n  The deeds of Oskar Schindler, a German factory owner immortalized by \nsuch authors as Thomas Keneally and film maker Steven Spielberg, have \ninspired millions of people around the world. During the Nazi \noccupation of Poland, Mr. Schindler put his life on the line and \ndemonstrated that one person truly can make a world of difference. Mr. \nSchindler acquired an enamelware factory in Zablocie, on the outskirts \nof Krakow. The factory, which produced mess kits and field kitchenware \nfor the Nazi army, was staffed by Jews drawn from the Krakow ghetto. \nWhen the Jews of Krakow were transferred to the Plaszow concentration \ncamp, Schindler arranged for his workers to be housed at the factory. \nAfter the factory was disbanded and the workers sent to the camp, \nSchindler used his connections and personal fortune to secure their \nrelease and transfer.\n  Through his cunning and perseverance in the face of adversity, Oskar \nSchindler succeeded in saving the lives of over 1,200 Jews. One of the \nindividuals whom Schindler saved was Abraham Zuckerman, a constituent \nof mine and a great American in his own right. Mr. Zuckerman knows \nperhaps better than anyone else what a heroic individual Oskar \nSchindler was. As a builder, Mr. Zuckerman, along with other Schindler \nsurvivors, have honored Oskar Schindler with over 20 Schindler Courts, \nTerraces and Plazas throughout New Jersey.\n  Oskar Schindler was named a ``Righteous Gentile'' by Yad Vashem, the \nIsraeli Holocaust Remembrance Authority, on April 28, 1962. Today, over \n6,000 descendants of the Jews saved by Schindler live in the United \nStates and Europe. I think it is high time that the United States \ngovernment officially recognize Oskar Schindler's incredible \ncontribution to humanity. Awarding him the Congressional Gold Medal is \na fitting way to pay tribute to a man who touched the lives of so many \npeople from all over the world.\n  Another remarkable individual who overcame adversity and acted with \nextraordinary courage is Varian Fry, an American editor from New York. \nDuring World War II, Mr. Fry volunteered to travel to Nazi-occupied \nMarseilles, France, where he helped form the Emergency Rescue \nCommittee. Working with a small group of associates, Mr. Fry offered \nassistance to Jews and antifascist refugees threatened with extradition \nto Nazi Germany under the ``Surrender on Demand'' clause of the Franco-\nGerman Armistice.\n  Varian Fry was instrumental in the rescue of approximately 2,000 \nindividuals, including artists Marc Chaggal, Andre Breton and Max \nErnst. Mr. Fry was the first American to be awarded the ``Certificate \nof Honor'' and the ``Righteous among Nations'' medal by Yad Vashem in \n1996. The United States Holocaust Memorial Council honored Mr. Fry with \nits highest honor, the Eisenhower Liberation Medal in 1991. He has also \nbeen awarded France's top civilian honor, the ``Croix de Chevalier de \nla Legion d'Honneur.'' Yet sadly, Varian Fry's heroism and bravery have \nyet to be officially recognized by the American government.\n  Mr. President, the Talmud states that, ``Whoever saves a single life \nsaves the world entire.'' As we are left to wonder and mourn what the \nworld has lost in the lives of those who perished during the Holocaust, \nwe rejoice in the company and contributions of their survivors. We are \nenriched not only by the presence of the survivors, but by the example \nthat Oskar Schindler and Varian Fry set for all of Humanity. Their \nactions are a testament to the ability of all people to act righteously \nand courageously even under the worst of circumstances.\n  The heroic deeds of Oskar Schindler and Varian Fry are sterling \nexamples of heroism and humanitarianism. It is time the United States \ngovernment recognize and pay tribute to these men and the noble deeds \nthey performed. Oskar Schindler and Varian Fry are highly deserving of \nthe Congressional Gold Medal. I sincerely hope that the 106th Congress \nwill take up and pass this resolution.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3155\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) More than 13,000,000 people were killed during the \n     Holocaust, including Jews, Gypsies, Slavs (Poles, Ukrainians, \n     and Belorussians), homosexuals, and the disabled--each \n     exterminated because Adolf Hitler viewed them as ``subhuman'' \n     to the Aryan race.\n       (2) Nazi persecution, arrests, and deportations were \n     directed against all Jewish families, as well as many others, \n     without concern for age. Innocent men, women, and children \n     faced starvation, illness, brutal labor, and other \n     indignities until they were consigned to the gas chambers.\n       (3) When Germany invaded Poland in 1939, destruction began \n     immediately and in a merciless fashion. Jews were herded into \n     crowded ghettos, randomly beaten, humiliated, and \n     capriciously murdered. Jewish property and businesses were \n     summarily destroyed, or appropriated by the SS, and sold to \n     Nazi ``investors'', one of whom was Oskar Schindler.\n       (4) Oskar Schindler set up a business in an old enamel \n     works factory in Poland. His workforce consisted of enslaved \n     Jews from the Krakow Ghetto. Schindler learned of the \n     horrible atrocities committed by Hitler's regime as he got to \n     know some of the forced workers there. In response, he \n     managed to convince the Nazis that his factory, and more \n     importantly, its trained workers, were vital to the German \n     war effort, thus preventing their deportation to death camps.\n       (5) Oskar Schindler used all of the means at his disposal \n     to ensure the safety of those who worked in his factory. Even \n     his wife Emilie's jewels were sold, to buy food, clothes, and \n     medicine for the workers. A secret sanatorium was set up in \n     the factory\n\n[[Page S9750]]\n\n     with medical equipment purchased on the black market. There, \n     Emilie Schindler looked after the sick and wounded.\n       (6) Even though Oskar Schindler had a large mansion placed \n     at his disposal close to the factory, he spent every night in \n     his office so that he could intervene should the Gestapo pay \n     a visit. He was detained by the Gestapo twice, but used his \n     connections to get released.\n       (7) With his own life at stake, Schindler employed all his \n     powers of persuasion. He bribed, fought, and begged to save \n     Jewish men, women, and children from the gas chambers.\n       (8) Oskar Shindler saved the lives of 1,200 Jews from \n     deportation to Nazi death camps.\n       (9) On April 28, 1962, Oskar Schindler was named a \n     ``Righteous Gentile'' by Yad Vashem.\n       (10) Varian Fry, together with a small group of unlikely \n     associates, succeeded in assisting nearly 2,000 artists, \n     musicians, writers, scholars, politicians, labor leaders, and \n     their families to leave hostile territories in France, either \n     legally or illegally. This effort came to be called the \n     ``Emergency Rescue Committee''.\n       (11) Varian Fry offered aid and advice to Jews and \n     antifascist refugees who found themselves threatened with \n     extradition to Nazi Germany under Article 19 of the Franco-\n     German Armistice--the ``Surrender on Demand clause''.\n       (12) Though risking his personal security in the face of \n     both Gestapo and Vichy officials, Fry did what was necessary \n     to save as many of the refugees as possible.\n       (13) Varian Fry aided in the rescue of nearly 2,000 \n     individuals, including artists Marc Chaggall, Andre Breton, \n     and Max Ernst.\n       (14) The United States Holocaust Memorial Council awarded \n     Varian Fry its highest honor, the Eisenhower Liberation Medal \n     in 1991.\n       (15) In 1996, Yad Vashem posthumously honored Fry as the \n     first American ``Righteous Among the Nations'', and the \n     French government awarded him the Croix de Chevalier de la \n     Legion d'Honneur.\n       (16) The actions of Oskar Schindler and Varian Fry serve as \n     testimony to all people that even under the worst of \n     circumstances, the most ordinary of us can act courageously.\n       (17) Oskar Schindler and Varian Fry are true heroes and \n     humanitarians, deserving of honor by the United States \n     Government.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.\n\n       (a) Presentation Authorized.--The President is authorized--\n       (1) to award to Oskar Schindler, posthumously, on behalf of \n     Congress, a gold medal of appropriate design honoring Oskar \n     Schindler in recognition of his contributions to the Nation; \n     and\n       (2) to award to Varian Fry, posthumously, on behalf of \n     Congress, a gold medal of appropriate design honoring Varian \n     Fry in recognition of his contributions to the Nation.\n       (b) Design and Striking.--For purposes of the awards \n     referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury \n     (hereafter in this Act referred to as the ``Secretary'') \n     shall strike gold medals with suitable emblems, devices, and \n     inscriptions, to be determined by the Secretary.\n\n     SEC. 3. DUPLICATE MEDALS.\n\n       The Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze, of \n     the gold medals struck pursuant to section 2, under such \n     regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, and at a price \n     sufficient to cover the costs thereof, including labor, \n     materials, dies, use of machinery, overhead expenses, and the \n     cost of the gold medals.\n\n     SEC. 4. STATUS AS NATIONAL MEDALS.\n\n       The medals struck pursuant to this Act are national medals \n     for purposes of chapter 51 of title 31, United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 5. FUNDING.\n\n       (a) Authority To Use Fund Amounts.--There is authorized to \n     be charged against the United States Mint Public Enterprise \n     Fund an amount not to exceed $30,000 to pay for the cost of \n     the medals authorized by this Act.\n       (b) Proceeds of Sale.--Amounts received from the sale of \n     duplicate bronze medals under section 3 shall be deposited in \n     the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \n        Wellstone, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Kerry, Mr. \n        Torricelli, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Reid):\n  S. 3156. A bill to amend the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to ensure \nthe recovery of the declining biological diversity of the United \nStates, to reaffirm and strengthen the commitment of the United States \nto protect wildlife, to safeguard the economic and ecological future of \nchildren of the United States, and to provide certainty to local \ngovernments, communities, and individuals in their planning and \neconomic development efforts; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n\n\n                    endangered species recovery act\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Endangered \nSpecies Recovery Act. The bill will update the original Endangered \nSpecies Act, provide tax and other incentives for landowners, and help \nincrease the number of species that are recovered and taken off the \nprotected list. The bill has been endorsed by the 380 conservation, \nreligious, and scientific organizations that belong to the Endangered \nSpecies Coalition.\n  Public support for strong endangered species protection is high. \nAlso, a majority of the nation's biologists are convinced that a mass \nextinction of plants and animals is underway. Some believe this loss of \nbiological diversity will pose a major threat to humans in the coming \ncentury. At least one in 8 known plant species (which provide medical, \ncommercial, and agricultural benefits) is threatened with extinction.\n  The bill I introduce today includes provisions that will help both \nlandowners and the species themselves.\n  The bill incorporates tax proposals endorsed by both property-rights \nand conservation organizations. The bill establishes a tax exclusion \nfor cost-sharing payments under the Partners for Fish and Wildlife \nProgram, an enhanced deduction for the donation of a conservation \neasement, an exclusion from the estate tax for property subject to an \nEndangered Species Conservation Agreement, and an expansion of the \nestate tax exclusion for property subject to a conservation easement.\n  The bill significantly revises the Administration's current ``No \nSurprises'' policy, which allows private landowners to alter or destroy \nendangered species habitat under a long-term unmodifiable permit. The \nbill requires the best available science, invites more public \nparticipation, and requires adaptive management for development permit. \nThe developer files a performance bond to cover the costs of all \nreasonably foreseeable circumstances (such as wildfires, plant \ndiseases, and other natural events that can have devastating impacts on \nweakened populations of wildlife). Then a Habitat Conservation Plan \nTrust Fund is established to cover all other unforeseeable costs--a \nsafety net for landowners and species--while allowing changes to the \npermit when needed to protect species.\n  The bill also encourages ecosystem planning on a regional basis, \nthrough multi-species, multi-landowner plans, which is essential since \necosystems do not run along political boundaries. The bill encourages \ncooperation between various levels of government and different \njurisdictions, by allowing groups of private landowners to pool \nresources, and allowing local governments to administer habitat plans. \nThe bill streamlines the permit process and establishes an Office of \nTechnical Assistance. The bill also allows small landowners that have a \nminimal impact on endangered species to benefit from a quick and easy \npermit process and to receive planning assurances.\n  The bill clarifies the standards for approving federal actions that \nmay impact endangered or threatened species. Under the existing law, \npesticide application, river damming, forest clearcutting, and other \nhabitat destruction are judged by their impact on the survival of \nimperiled wildlife. The bill requires that taxpayer-funded activities \nmust not reduce the likelihood of recovery. In addition, the bill \nimproves the chances for recovery by identifying specific management \nactions and biological criteria in recovery plans, placing deadlines on \nfinal recovery plans, and encouraging federal agencies to take \npreventative measures before a species becomes endangered.\n  The bill implements recommendations from the National Academy of \nSciences on improving the scientific basis of important endangered \nspecies decisions. For unprotected species that means providing \nprotection before population numbers are too low to recover. For listed \nspecies that means using independent scientists to peer review large-\nscale, multi-species habitat conservation plans. It also means asking \nbiologists to set benchmarks and science-based conservation goals to \nbetter tell us what it will take to recover and eventually delist an \nimperiled species.\n  While federal actions already undergo review to ensure minimal \nimpacts on endangered species, the bill requires that federal agencies \nalso make efforts towards further recovery or to consider the \ncumulative impacts of their actions. The bill requires federal agencies \nto help plan for species recovery and\n\n[[Page S9751]]\n\nthen implement those plans within their jurisdictions. The bill also \nrequires agencies to consider the impacts of their actions on imperiled \nspecies in other nations.\n  The bill expands public participation by requiring public \nnotification when a federal activity may impact wildlife in a \ncommunity. The bill also requires public participation in large-scale \nregional habitat planning. Local citizens may participate in the first \nsteps of regional habitat planning, review relevant science, and work \nwith developers to achieve the best possible plans. If those plans are \nnot met, the bill allows citizens to require the government to take \naction.\n  The Endangered Species Recovery Act will protect the species and \nlandowners alike. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3156\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy \n     of this resolution to the Mayor of Sydney, New South Wales, \n     Australia, and to the United States Olympic Committee.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a Senate \nresolution commending Sydney, Australia on the success of the 2000 \nSummer Olympic Games and congratulating the U.S. Olympic Team on their \noutstanding performance.\n  Once every two years, we have the great opportunity to witness the \nworld's finest athletes display astonishing feats of speed, strength, \nflexibility and grace. There is no main event quite like the Olympics \nand the 2000 Summer Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia, left a \nremarkable impression on all of us over the past several weeks.\n\n[[Page S9760]]\n\n  On behalf of the United States Senate, I express deep appreciation to \nthe city and residents of Sydney, Australia, for being such superb \nhosts for the Summer Olympic Games. Planning and organizing such a two-\nweek, multi-venue event--which is immediately followed by the \nParalympic Games--is a daunting and monumental task. The Australians \ncan be extremely proud of their efforts, which, by all accounts, were \nextraordinary.\n  We in Salt Lake City will be striving to put on an Olympic Winter \nGames that equals Sydney in both efficiency and hospitality.\n  We can also be very proud of the U.S. Olympic Team's outstanding \naccomplishments. Our athletes turned in exciting and memorable \nperformances. All together, the U.S. Team earned 39 gold medals, 25 \nsilver medals, and 33 bronze medals--a total of 97 medals, which was \nthe most of any country! This demonstrates extraordinary commitment to \nexcellence. These athletes trained hard just to participate at this \nlevel of sport; many sacrificed other pursuits to attain the honor of \ncompeting in this premier sporting competition--the Olympic Games.\n\n  There were many ``Olympic moments'' during these Games. For instance, \nwho will ever forget Rulon Gardner, the Greco-Roman wrestler from \nWyoming, who realized his Olympic dream by defeating the one-time \ninvincible, and still great, Aleksandr Karelin, of Russia. Following \nthe match, Gardner said, ``all I could do was do my best.'' Isn't that \nthe beauty of the Olympic Games? Athletes all over the world giving it \ntheir all in competition against tremendous odds.\n  Who could forget Misty Hyman upsetting the world favorite Susie \nO'Neill in the 200 meter butterfly? Those of us watching on television \ncould plainly sense the sheer surprise and joy of this achievement.\n  And, the athletes from other national teams captured our attention as \nwell. Cathy Freeman of Australia, who stole the heart of her nation in \nthe 400 meter race. China's Fu Mingxia, who made an amazing comeback to \nwin gold in diving. And, Aleksei Nemov, who celebrated the birth of his \nchild by winning a gold medal in gymnastics.\n\n  I am very proud of the athletes from my home state of Utah, who \nrepresented our state with dignity and honor during the Olympic Games.\n  Marcus Jensen and Doug Mientkiewicz, both of the Utah Buzz, were \nmembers of the U.S. baseball team that defeated the heavily favored \nCuban baseball team--the first time in Olympic history that the Cuban \nteam did not win the gold medal in baseball.\n  Natalie Williams, also of Utah and a key player for the Utah Starzz, \nled the U.S. women's basketball team with 15 points in the Olympic \nbasketball final to help the U.S. win its fourth gold medal in women's \nbasketball since women's basketball became an Olympic sport in 1976.\n  But, the Olympics is not only about winning medals. Logan Tom, from \nSalt Lake City who now attends Stanford University, led the U.S. \nWomen's volleyball team to a terrific--and unexpected--fourth place \nfinish. None of the sports handicappers gave this team much of a \nchance. Yet, they fought their way to the semifinals and through a \ntough five-set match with Russia.\n  Utah is proud to be the host of the upcoming 2002 Winter Olympic \nGames in Salt Lake City. We hope to follow the example of the 2000 \nGames in Sydney, Australia, with the same enthusiasm and excitement and \nthe same devotion to the ideal of the Olympic movement, which is ``a \nbelief that sport can break down barriers of language, culture, \nnationality, age and sex and build bridges between people all over the \nworld as a means of promoting world peace.''\n  Some have derided the Olympic Games as nothing more than \ncommercialism run amok. They say that the news coverage is too \npositive. They say that the media glosses over the negative elements of \nthe Games--doping, for example. They claim that the only thing that \ndrives athletes is the prospect of product endorsements or professional \ncontracts.\n  Yes, Mr. President, these elements exist at the Games. It is sad that \nthey do. There were displays of poor sportsmanship. There were cases of \ndoping. There are, no doubt, those whose goals extend far beyond \nthe Olympics just concluded.\n\n  But, Mr. President, we can look at such incidents and say they taint \nthe Olympics as a whole endeavor. Or, we can brush them aside as few in \nnumber and unrepresentative of our athletes as a body. We can erase one \nembarrassing spectacle of bad manners with the sight of Dot Richardson \nembracing her Japanese opponent. We can remember Marion Jones \ngraciously congratulating the winner of the women's long jump, although \nMarion Jones is world class in every way.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I strongly believe that the people of \nSydney, New South Wales, Australia, deserve our official recognition. I \nknow what a monumental effort this was. And, let us commend our U.S. \nOlympic Team for their successes on the field as well as for their fine \nrepresentation of our country. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this Senate resolution.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be placed \non the Calendar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/03/senate-section/article/S9760-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9760-S9761]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 365--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING \n RECENT ELECTIONS IN THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA, AND FOR OTHER \n                                PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH (for himself, Mr. Biden, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Hagel, Mr. \nSmith of Oregon, Mr. Lautenberg, and Ms. Landrieu) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution today to congratulate the people of the Federal \nRepublic of Yugoslavia (FRY) for embracing democracy and the rule of \nlaw in the September 24, 2000 municipal, parliamentary and presidential \nelections. I am pleased to be joined by Senators Biden, Landrieu, \nLautenberg, Hagel, Lugar, and Gordon Smith in this bipartisan effort.\n  This resolution makes it clear that the Senate is eager to embrace a \ndemocratic government in Serbia that respects the rule of law, human \nrights, and a market economy. Milosevic's bloodletting, ethnic \ncleansing, and human rights violations have forced the international \ncommunity, including the United States, to impose a number of crippling \nsanctions on the FRY. In the wake of the courageous September 24 vote, \nit is important to send a clear message to the Serbian people that the \nSenate intends to assist a democratic government and reintegrate it \ninto the global marketplace. This resolution sends that message.\n  The historic friendship between the American and Serbian people have \nsuffered for too long. I look forward to continuing to work with my \ncolleagues in the Senate to reestablish this important relationship by \nassisting a new government in Serbia recover from the destruction of \nMilosevic's rule.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to join my friend from Ohio, \nSenator Voinovich, and other colleagues in co-sponsoring a Sense of the \nSenate Resolution regarding the recent elections in the Federal \nRepublic of Yugoslavia (FRY), including advocating the resumption of \neconomic assistance, once democracy is restored in that country.\n  The Voinovich-Biden resolution congratulates the people of the FRY \nfor their courage in participating in the September 24, 2000 elections; \napplauds the clear decision of the people of the FRY to embrace \ndemocracy, the rule of law, and integration into the international \ncommunity by rejecting dictatorship and isolationism; reasserts the \nstrong desire of the Senate to reestablish the historic friendship \nbetween the American and Serbian peoples; and expresses its intention \nto support a comprehensive assistance program for the FRY to speed its \neconomic recovery and European integration and access to international \nfinancial institutions, once a democratic government that respects the \nrule of law, human rights, and a market economy is established.\n  Slobodan Milosevic, one of the most despicable individuals I have \never met, is on the ropes. Even as we meet here today, tens of \nthousands of brave men and women are refusing to work and instead are \ndemonstrating in the streets of cities throughout Yugoslavia for \nMilosevic to honor the results of last month's elections. The \ndemocratic opposition has called for people to stage a massive rally in \nBelgrade on Thursday, October 5, in a final push to drive Milosevic \nfrom power.\n  The Voinovich-Biden resolution, Mr. President, puts the United States \nSenate on record on the side of the people of Yugoslavia and its \nlargest nationality, the Serbs, against Milosevic's tyranny.\n  As I have said several times on this floor, for the last decade our \nquarrel has never been with the Serbian people, who were allies of the \nUnited States in two world wars in the twentieth century. Vojislav \nKostunica, whose victory in last month's elections Milosevic and his \ncronies tried to steal and are now trying to deny, is an honest man who \nshould be given a chance to cooperate with the Western democracies.\n  The Voinovich-Biden resolution is a signal to all citizens of the \nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia that the path to their country's \nrejoining the international community, and thereby to restoring their \nshattered economy, is to honor the results of the elections by \nimmediately and formally installing Mr. Kostunica as President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/03/senate-section/article/S9761-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9761-S9768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             MICROENTERPRISE FOR SELF-RELIANCE ACT OF 1999\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        HELMS AMENDMENT NO. 4287\n\n  Mr. DeWINE (for Mr. Helms) proposed an amendment to bill (H.R. 1143) \nto establish a program to provide assistance for programs of credit and \nother financial services for microenterprises in developing countries, \nand for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS OF POLICY.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings and declarations:\n       (1) According to the World Bank, more than 1,200,000,000 \n     people in the developing world, or one-fifth of the world's \n     population, subsist on less than $1 a day.\n       (2) Over 32,000 of their children die each day from largely \n     preventable malnutrition and disease.\n       (3)(A) Women in poverty generally have larger work loads \n     and less access to educational and economic opportunities \n     than their male counterparts.\n       (B) Directly aiding the poorest of the poor, especially \n     women, in the developing world has a positive effect not only \n     on family incomes, but also on child nutrition, health and \n     education, as women in particular reinvest income in their \n     families.\n       (4)(A) The poor in the developing world, particularly \n     women, generally lack stable employment and social safety \n     nets.\n       (B) Many turn to self-employment to generate a substantial \n     portion of their livelihood. In Africa, over 80 percent of \n     employment is generated in the informal sector of the self-\n     employed poor.\n       (C) These poor entrepreneurs are often trapped in poverty \n     because they cannot obtain credit at reasonable rates to \n     build their asset base or expand their otherwise viable self-\n     employment activities.\n       (D) Many of the poor are forced to pay interest rates as \n     high as 10 percent per day to money lenders.\n\n[[Page S9762]]\n\n       (5)(A) The poor are able to expand their incomes and their \n     businesses dramatically when they can access loans at \n     reasonable interest rates.\n       (B) Through the development of self-sustaining microfinance \n     programs, poor people themselves can lead the fight against \n     hunger and poverty.\n       (6)(A) On February 2-4, 1997, a global Microcredit Summit \n     was held in Washington, District of Columbia, to launch a \n     plan to expand access to credit for self-employment and other \n     financial and business services to 100,000,000 of the world's \n     poorest families, especially the women of those families, by \n     2005. While this scale of outreach may not be achievable in \n     this short time-period, the realization of this goal could \n     dramatically alter the face of global poverty.\n       (B) With an average family size of five, achieving this \n     goal will mean that the benefits of microfinance will thereby \n     reach nearly half of the world's more than 1,000,000,000 \n     absolute poor people.\n       (7)(A) Nongovernmental organizations, such as those that \n     comprise the Microenterprise Coalition (such as the Grameen \n     Bank (Bangladesh,) K-REP (Kenya), and networks such as Accion \n     International, the Foundation for International Community \n     Assistance (FINCA), and the credit union movement) are \n     successful in lending directly to the very poor.\n       (B) Microfinance institutions such as BRAC (Bangladesh), \n     BancoSol (Bolivia), SEWA Bank (India), and ACEP (Senegal) are \n     regulated financial institutions that can raise funds \n     directly from the local and international capital markets.\n       (8)(A) Microenterprise institutions not only reduce \n     poverty, but also reduce the dependency on foreign \n     assistance.\n       (B) Interest income on the credit portfolio is used to pay \n     recurring institutional costs, assuring the long-term \n     sustainability of development assistance.\n       (9) Microfinance institutions leverage foreign assistance \n     resources because loans are recycled, generating new benefits \n     to program participants.\n       (10)(A) The development of sustainable microfinance \n     institutions that provide credit and training, and mobilize \n     domestic savings, is a critical component to a global \n     strategy of poverty reduction and broad-based economic \n     development.\n       (B) In the efforts of the United States to lead the \n     development of a new global financial architecture, \n     microenterprise should play a vital role. The recent shocks \n     to international financial markets demonstrate how the \n     financial sector can shape the destiny of nations. \n     Microfinance can serve as a powerful tool for building a more \n     inclusive financial sector which serves the broad majority of \n     the world's population including the very poor and women and \n     thus generate more social stability and prosperity.\n       (C) Over the last two decades, the United States has been a \n     global leader in promoting the global microenterprise sector, \n     primarily through its development assistance programs at the \n     United States Agency for International Development. \n     Additionally, the Department of the Treasury and the \n     Department of State have used their authority to promote \n     microenterprise in the development programs of international \n     financial institutions and the United Nations.\n       (11)(A) In 1994, the United States Agency for International \n     Development launched the ``Microenterprise Initiative'' in \n     partnership with the Congress.\n       (B) The initiative committed to expanding funding for the \n     microenterprise programs of the Agency, and set a goal that, \n     by the end of fiscal year 1996, one-half of all \n     microenterprise resources would support programs and \n     institutions that provide credit to the poorest, with loans \n     under $300.\n       (C) In order to achieve the goal of the microcredit summit, \n     increased investment in microfinance institutions serving the \n     poorest will be critical.\n       (12) Providing the United States share of the global \n     investment needed to achieve the goal of the microcredit \n     summit will require only a small increase in United States \n     funding for international microcredit programs, with an \n     increased focus on institutions serving the poorest.\n       (13)(A) In order to reach tens of millions of the poorest \n     with microcredit, it is crucial to expand and replicate \n     successful microfinance institutions.\n       (B) These institutions need assistance in developing their \n     institutional capacity to expand their services and tap \n     commercial sources of capital.\n       (14) Nongovernmental organizations have demonstrated \n     competence in developing networks of local microfinance \n     institutions and other assistance delivery mechanisms so that \n     they reach large numbers of the very poor, and achieve \n     financial sustainability.\n       (15) Recognizing that the United States Agency for \n     International Development has developed very effective \n     partnerships with nongovernmental organizations, and that the \n     Agency will have fewer missions overseas to carry out its \n     work, the Agency should place priority on investing in those \n     nongovernmental network institutions that meet performance \n     criteria through the central funding mechanisms of the \n     Agency.\n       (16) By expanding and replicating successful microfinance \n     institutions, it should be possible to create a global \n     infrastructure to provide financial services to the world's \n     poorest families.\n       (17)(A) The United States can provide leadership to other \n     bilateral and multilateral development agencies as such \n     agencies expand their support to the microenterprise sector.\n       (B) The United States should seek to improve coordination \n     among G-7 countries in the support of the microenterprise \n     sector in order to leverage the investment of the United \n     States with that of other donor nations.\n       (18) Through increased support for microenterprise, \n     especially credit for the poorest, the United States can \n     continue to play a leadership role in the global effort to \n     expand financial services and opportunity to 100,000,000 of \n     the poorest families on the planet.\n\n     SEC. 103. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to make microenterprise development an important \n     element of United States foreign economic policy and \n     assistance;\n       (2) to provide for the continuation and expansion of the \n     commitment of the United States Agency for International \n     Development to the development of microenterprise \n     institutions as outlined in its 1994 Microenterprise \n     Initiative;\n       (3) to support and develop the capacity of United States \n     and indigenous nongovernmental organization intermediaries to \n     provide credit, savings, training, technical assistance, and \n     business development services to microentrepreneurs;\n       (4) to emphasize financial services and substantially \n     increase the amount of assistance devoted to both financial \n     services and complementary business development services \n     designed to reach the poorest people in developing countries, \n     particularly women; and\n       (5) to encourage the United States Agency for International \n     Development to coordinate microfinance policy, in \n     consultation with the Department of the Treasury and the \n     Department of State, and to provide global leadership among \n     bilateral and multilateral donors in promoting \n     microenterprise for the poorest of the poor.\n\n     SEC. 104.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``International Anti-\n     Corruption and Good Governance Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 202. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n\n[[Page S9765]]\n\n       (1) Widespread corruption endangers the stability and \n     security of societies, undermines democracy, and jeopardizes \n     the social, political, and economic development of a society.\n       (2) Corruption facilitates criminal activities, such as \n     money laundering, hinders economic development, inflates the \n     costs of doing business, and undermines the legitimacy of the \n     government and public trust.\n       (3) In January 1997 the United Nations General Assembly \n     adopted a resolution urging member states to carefully \n     consider the problems posed by the international aspects of \n     corrupt practices and to study appropriate legislative and \n     regulatory measures to ensure the transparency and integrity \n     of financial systems.\n       (4) The United States was the first country to criminalize \n     international bribery through the enactment of the Foreign \n     Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and United States leadership \n     was instrumental in the passage of the Organization for \n     Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Convention on \n     Combatting Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in \n     International Business Transactions.\n       (5) The Vice President, at the Global Forum on Fighting \n     Corruption in 1999, declared corruption to be a direct threat \n     to the rule of law and the Secretary of State declared \n     corruption to be a matter of profound political and social \n     consequence for our efforts to strengthen democratic \n     governments.\n       (6) The Secretary of State, at the Inter-American \n     Development Bank's annual meeting in March 2000, declared \n     that despite certain economic achievements, democracy is \n     being threatened as citizens grow weary of the corruption and \n     favoritism of their official institutions and that efforts \n     must be made to improve governance if respect for democratic \n     institutions is to be regained.\n       (7) In May 1996 the Organization of American States (OAS) \n     adopted the Inter-American Convention Against Corruption \n     requiring countries to provide various forms of international \n     cooperation and assistance to facilitate the prevention, \n     investigation, and prosecution of acts of corruption.\n       (8) Independent media, committed to fighting corruption and \n     trained in investigative journalism techniques, can both \n     educate the public on the costs of corruption and act as a \n     deterrent against corrupt officials.\n       (9) Competent and independent judiciary, founded on a \n     merit-based selection process and trained to enforce \n     contracts and protect property rights, is critical for \n     creating a predictable and consistent environment for \n     transparency in legal procedures.\n       (10) Independent and accountable legislatures, responsive \n     political parties, and transparent electoral processes, in \n     conjunction with professional, accountable, and transparent \n     financial management and procurement policies and procedures, \n     are essential to the promotion of good governance and to the \n     combat of corruption.\n       (11) Transparent business frameworks, including modern \n     commercial codes and intellectual property rights, are vital \n     to enhancing economic growth and decreasing corruption at all \n     levels of society.\n       (12) The United States should attempt to improve \n     accountability in foreign countries, including by--\n       (A) promoting transparency and accountability through \n     support for independent media, promoting financial disclosure \n     by public officials, political parties, and candidates for \n     public office, open budgeting processes, adequate and \n     effective internal control systems, suitable financial \n     management systems, and financial and compliance reporting;\n       (B) supporting the establishment of audit offices, \n     inspectors general offices, third party monitoring of \n     government procurement processes, and anti-corruption \n     agencies;\n       (C) promoting responsive, transparent, and accountable \n     legislatures that ensure legislative oversight and whistle-\n     blower protection;\n       (D) promoting judicial reforms that criminalize corruption \n     and promoting law enforcement that prosecutes corruption;\n       (E) fostering business practices that promote transparent, \n     ethical, and competitive behavior in the private sector \n     through the development of an effective legal framework for \n     commerce, including anti-bribery laws, commercial codes that \n     incorporate international standards for business practices, \n     and protection of intellectual property rights; and\n       (F) promoting free and fair national, state, and local \n     elections.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to ensure that \n     United States assistance programs promote good governance by \n     assisting other countries to combat corruption throughout \n     society and to improve transparency and accountability at all \n     levels of government and throughout the private sector.\n\n     SEC. 203.

The successful transition of a developing \n     country is dependent upon the quality of its economic and \n     governance institutions. Rule of law, mechanisms of \n     accountability and transparency, security of person, \n     property, and investments, are but a few of the critical \n     governance and economic reforms that underpin the \n     sustainability of broad-based economic growth. Programs in \n     support of such reforms strengthen the capacity of people to \n     hold their governments accountable and to create economic \n     opportunity.''.\n\n     SEC. 204.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 762, S. 2412.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The clerk will report the bill by \ntitle.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2412) to amend title 49, United States Code, to \n     authorize appropriations for the National Transportation \n     Safety Board for fiscal years 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the full Senate will now consider S. 2412, \nthe National Transportation Safety Board Amendments Act of 2000.\n  The National Transportation Safety Board, NTSB, is one of our \nnation's most critical governmental agencies, charged with determining \nthe probable cause of transportation accidents and promoting \ntransportation safety. Among its many duties, the Board investigates \naccidents, conducts safety studies, and evaluates the effectiveness of \nother government agencies' programs for preventing transportation \naccidents. Since its inception in 1967, the NTSB has investigated more \nthan 110,000 aviation accidents, at least 10,000 other accidents in the \nsurface modes and issued more than 11,000 safety recommendations.\n  The Safety Board is currently experiencing a high level of major \naccident investigations, many of which are extremely complex. We must \nact to ensure the Board has the necessary personnel and resources to \ncomplete these challenging investigations and carry out its statutory \nmission.\n  Given the very limited time remaining during this Congress, the \nCommerce Committee has worked with the House Transportation and \nInfrastructure, T, Committee in an effort to develop legislation that \nboth Chambers could accept without modification. Both of our Committees \nwant to ensure the NTSB's authorizing legislation can be enacted as \nsoon as possible.\n  I want to commend Senator Hollings, the Ranking member of the Senate \nCommerce Committee and House T Chairman, Bud Shuster, and Ranking \nMember, Jim Oberstar for their assistance in developing the package I \nbring before the Senate today. The accompanying Manager's Amendment is \nthe product of our joint discussions and resolves the differences in \nthe House-passed and Commerce Committee-passed versions of the NTSB \nauthorizing legislation.\n\n[[Page S9769]]\n\n  S. 2412 authorizes funding for the Board through fiscal year 2003. \nThe bill also includes a number of provisions requested in the Board's \nreauthorization submission. These statutory changes include: (1) \nclarification of NTSB's jurisdiction over accidents on the territorial \nseas to the twelve-mile limit and its investigative authority over \naccidents that may have been the subject of intentional acts of \ndestruction; (2) permission to prescribe overtime pay rates for \naccident investigators; (3) authority to negotiate technical service \nagreements with foreign safety agencies or foreign governments; (4) \nauthority to collect reasonable fees for the reproduction and \ndistribution of Board products; and (5) permission to withhold voice \nand video recorder information from public disclosure.\n  In addition to the provisions requested by the Board, the legislation \nalso includes a number of other provisions intended to improve fiscal \naccountability at the NTSB. For example, the legislation would \nstatutorily establish a position of Chief Financial Officer, CFO, at \nthe Board. The CFO would report directly to the Chairman of the Board \non financial management matters and provide guidance on the \nimplementation of asset management systems. It also directs the Board \nto develop and implement comprehensive internal audit controls for its \nfinancial programs to address shortcomings identified recently by the \nDepartment of Transportation Inspector General.\n  Further, the legislation includes a provision intended to curb what I \nand others view as excessive member travel expenditures. According to \nNTSB travel documents, only 15 percent of Board Member travel has been \naccident-related in the past five years. Non-accident domestic and \nforeign travel accounts for 85 percent of the total travel \nexpenditures--with 51 percent for domestic travel and 34 percent for \nforeign travel. While I recognize a legitimate need may exist to \nparticipate in important seminars and to gain greater professional \nexpertise that may necessitate travel, this is simply excessive. \nTherefore, the bill directs the Chairman of the NTSB to establish \nannual travel budgets, to be approved by the Board, to govern Board \nMember non-accident travel.\n  Finally, the bill authorizes the Department of Transportation \nInspector General to review the business, financial, and property \nmanagement of the NTSB. Currently, the Board has no standing Inspector \nGeneral oversight. The bill ensures that necessary fiscal \naccountability oversight is provided, while prohibiting the Inspector \nGeneral from becoming involved in NTSB investigations and investigation \nprocedures.\n  The NTSB's authorization expired September 30, 1999. The NTSB faces \nbudget difficulties as it seeks to cover the costs of major accident \ninvestigations. Therefore, I hope we can move this legislation \nexpeditiously from the Floor and on to the House for its swift action, \nand then to the President's desk for signature.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4288\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS.

TECHNICAL AMENDMENT TO TITLE 49.\n\n       Section 106(p)(2) is amended by striking ``15'' and \n     inserting ``18''.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for \nthe Airport Security Improvement Act of 2000, S. 2440. This bill was \nintroduced in April by Senator Hutchison and cosponsored by several \nother Senators, including myself. In June, the Commerce Committee \nfavorably reported S. 2440, which was crafted to address several \nserious concerns associated with aviation security in this country.\n  The bill was introduced in the wake of an Aviation Subcommittee \nhearing chaired by Senator Hutchison on the current state of aviation \nsecurity. Prior to the hearing, the Federal Aviation Administration \n(FAA) and the General Accounting Office (GAO) conducted a closed \nbriefing with respect to some of the more sensitive information in this \narea. Given concerns raised by the GAO and the Department of \nTransportation's Inspector General, a consensus developed that \nlegislation was needed to address some of the more glaring deficiencies \nin the current system.\n  As reported by the committee, S. 2440 would do the following: require \ncriminal history records checks for all baggage and security checkpoint \nscreeners; expand the list of criminal convictions that disqualify an \nindividual from being employed as a security screener; increase the \namount of classroom and on-the-job training required of airline \nsecurity screeners; require the FAA to work with air carriers and \nairport operators to strengthen procedures to prevent unauthorized \naccess to aircraft; hold security personnel individually responsible \nfor security lapses through progressive disciplinary measures; require \nthe FAA to improve security at its own air traffic control facilities; \nand increase random screening of checked bags for explosives.\n  I believe these are all necessary steps for the improvement of \naviation security. No system can ever be perfect, but we must continue \nto strive for an air transportation system that is as secure as \nreasonably possible. On the whole, security at U.S. airports appears to \nbe good at this time. But, as I have said before, we cannot relax our \nefforts, especially given the significant growth in air travel. The \nthreats to our nation remain real, and the airline industry \nunfortunately remains an attractive target.\n  In closing, I commend Senator Hutchison for her hard work on this \nbill. She has done a fine job of taking the lead on this legislation.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, thank you for the opportunity to speak \ntoday about airport security, and in particular, S. 2440, the Airport \nSecurity Improvement Act of 2000.\n  Our aviation security system in the United States and abroad is of \nextreme importance in protecting the traveling\n\n[[Page S9772]]\n\npublic. Airport security is our first line of defense against terrorist \nattacks or other dangerous acts. We all know that our airport security \npersonnel are underpaid and overworked.\n  Congress sets minimum security standards for the airports and \nairlines to meet, but implementing the standards is not a government \nfunction--that part is left to the airlines, airports and security \npersonnel. We need to ensure, then, that the industry and security \nscreeners are better prepared and that higher training standards are \nimplemented. Security workers are characterized by a high rate of \nturnover. According to GAO's testimony in our April 6 hearing this year \non aviation security, from May 1998 through April 1999, turnover \naveraged 126 percent among screeners at 19 large airports, and the \naverage wage for screeners in the United States averages $5.75 per hour \nwith minimal benefits. We can't expect security personnel who are \nreceiving minimum-wage or near-minimum wage to realize just how \nimportant their jobs are to the overall security of the airport and to \nhave a commitment to their jobs. On the other hand, security personnel \nalso need to be held individually responsible for security lapses. \nPeoples' lives are at stake when there are security lapses. Employees \nwho fail to follow procedures should be suspended or terminated.\n  S. 2440 directs the FAA Administrator to prescribe minimum standards \nfor training security screeners that includes at least 40 hours of \nclassroom instruction and at least 40 hours of practical training \nbefore an individual is qualified to provide security screening \nservices at an airport. The FAA is committed to funding better, more \neffective equipment, but it was not going to finalize the regulation to \nimprove training requirements for screeners and certification for \nscreening companies until May 2001. With this legislation, improved \ntraining requirements will be implemented by September 30 of this year. \nS. 2440 also, among other things, requires airport operators and air \ncarriers to develop comprehensive and recurring training programs that \nteach employees their role in airport security and how performance will \nbe evaluated and treated.\n  Another major problem at airports is secured-area access control \nweaknesses. People are getting into secured areas by following airport \nemployees through security doors. This can be solved by employees \nsimply closing the door behind them after they enter a secured area. S. \n2440 requires airport operators and air carriers to develop programs \nthat foster and reward compliance with access control requirements, \ndiscourage and penalize noncompliance, and enforce individual \ncompliance requirements under FAA oversight.\n  I believe this bill is a step in the right direction. Security \npersonnel need to be aware of the importance of their job and they also \nneed to be provided with the proper training to carry out their \nfunctions. Many of the areas covered by this bill consist of actions \nnow being undertaken by the FAA. However, despite these actions, and \nconsistent with the needs of the traveling public, a number of \nmodifications will be debated with our House colleagues but I am \nconfident we can put together a final bill and send it to the President \nfor his signature.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nCommittee substitute be agreed to, the bill be read the third time and \npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any \nstatements relating to the bill be printed at this point in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 2440), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/03/senate-section/article/S9772-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9772]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REQUESTING THAT THE U.S. POSTAL SERVICE ISSUE A COMMEMORATIVE STAMP \n            HONORING NATIONAL VETERANS SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS.

Mr. President, today, with my dear friend and wonderful \ncolleague from Kansas, Senator Roberts, we come to the fifth and final \nin our series of floor discussions on the global role of the United \nStates. We will begin with consideration of the key instruments of \nnational security policy, and we will conclude this series with a \npresentation of what we have learned over the course of these dialogs.\n  The inspiration for the first of today's topics comes from a source \nwe have often cited in this series: The great 19th century military \nthinker, Karl von Clausewitz, who wrote in his seminal work on war \nthese words:\n\n       Its dominant tendencies always make war a paradoxical \n     trinity. The passions that are to be kindled in war must \n     already be inherent in the people. The scope which the play \n     of courage and talent will enjoy in the realm of probability \n     and chance depends on the particular character of the \n     commander and the army; but the political aims are the \n     business of government alone.\n       These three tendencies are like three different codes of \n     law, deep rooted in their subject and yet variable in their \n     relationship to one another. A theory that ignores any one of \n     them or seeks to fix an arbitrary relationship between them \n     would conflict with reality to such an extent that for this \n     reason alone, it would be totally useless.\n       Our task, therefore is to develop a theory that maintains a \n     balance between these three tendencies, like an object \n     suspended between three magnets.\n\n  Attempts to find the proper balance between the roles of the people, \nthe military and the government when America goes to war have been a \nmajor feature of the last 35 years, from the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, \nto Operation Desert Storm, to Operation Allied Force. In my opinion, it \nis an effort which has not been overly successful. Certainly in the \ncase of Vietnam, there was no real attempt to mobilize the American \npublic in support of the war effort, nor for the Executive Branch to \nseek or the Congress to demand that the Constitutional role of the \nCongress to legitimize the conduct of hostilities be exercised. But I \nwould also contend that much the same pattern is evident in more recent \nAmerican interventions in the Balkans, and to an only somewhat lesser \nextent in the Gulf War.\n  The fact that we have emerged from all of these military \ninterventions without major harm--though the negative impact from \nVietnam was far from negligible--is a tribute to the efforts of our \nservicemen and women, the capabilities of our weaponry, but also, I \nwould suggest, the fact that our vital national interests were never \nthreatened in these cases. Only the Cold War, which by and large was \nprosecuted effectively, both militarily and politically and on a \nbipartisan basis, and in which we achieved a decisive victory, posed \nsuch a threat in the last half century.\n  We have spent much of the time in previous dialogues in discussing \nthe proper ends of American national security policy in the post-Cold \nWar era, but if we don't fix the problems in this ``holy trinity'' of \nmeans--the roles of the public, the military and the government--we are \ngoing to be continually frustrated in our achievement of whatever \nobjectives we set.\n  Let's start with the first of Clausewitz' trinity: the people.\n  The post-Cold War world is not only producing changes abroad--changes \nwhich we have spoken of at some length in our previous global role \ndiscussions--but also a number of alterations here at home. Over the \npast decade or so, we have seen a democratization in terms of our \nforeign and defense policies in the sense that the American public is \nless and less disposed to leave these matters to the ``experts,'' and \nto trust the assurances of the ``Establishment'' with respect to the \nbenefits of internationalism.\n  While there is certainly nothing wrong with such skepticism, and \nindeed a demand for accountability is a healthy and appropriate \nattitude for the public to take, whether on national security or any \nother public policy, this democratization of national security policy \nhas been marked by widespread public disengagement from the details of \nthat policy:\n  For example, a 1997 Wall Street Journal/NBC News survey found that \nforeign policy and defense ranked last, at 9 percent, among issues \ncited by the public as the most important matters facing the country.\n  A 1997 Washington Post/Kaiser Foundation/Harvard poll discovered that \n64 percent of the American public thought that foreign aid was the \nlargest component of the federal budget, when in fact it is one of the \nsmallest at approximately 1 percent.\n  A 1999 Penn and Schoen survey discovered that nearly half--48 \npercent--of the American public felt that the U.S. was ``too engaged'' \nin international problems, while just 16 percent expressed the view \nthat we are ``not engaged enough.''\n  A 1999 poll for the Program on International Policy Attitudes found \nthat only 28 percent of the American people wanted the U.S. government \nto promote further globalization while 34 percent wanted our government \nto try to slow or reverse it, and another 33 percent preferred that we \nsimply allow it to continue at its own pace, as we are doing now.\n  Related to these results, I personally believe that the end of the \ndraft and the dramatic reductions in defense personnel levels in recent \nyears--since FY85 the size of our armed forces decreased by 30 \npercent--has produced a growing disconnect between the American public \nand the American military, with fewer and fewer people having relatives \nor friends in the military, or living in communities in which a \nmilitary base is a dominant feature of the local economy. This growing \nseparation between the military and civilian worlds has produced a \nprofound impact on the perspectives and performance of the U.S. \ngovernment when it comes to the use of force, and I will return to this \npoint later.\n  We can bemoan the public's skepticism and disengagement, and wish \nthat it didn't exist, but it is a fact which impacts on all major \nforeign and defense policy issues facing the Congress. We saw it in the \nNAFTA debate, and in the debates on Iraq, NATO and the Balkans.\n  Now, I believe that the critics of foreign trade and foreign \nengagement raise important and legitimate concerns which need to be \naddressed. I do not believe we can stand behind platitudes that \n``foreign trade is always good,'' or ``U.S. leadership is always \nessential.'' In my view, the burden is now on those who would urge \nengagement overseas, whether military, political or economic. As the \njust discussed public opinion data indicate, they have their work cut \nout for them, with widespread indifference, lack of knowledge and doubt \nabout the value of such engagement. However, it is a debate worth \nhaving, and indeed is essential if we are to achieve the kind of \nnational consensus we need in this post-Cold War era.\n  The second of the war-making trinity of Clausewitz is the military \nitself. Lets talk about the military. The subject of military reform is \na fascinating and important one in its own right, but is somewhat \nbeyond the scope of our dialogues on the U.S. global role. However, I \nwould like to touch on a few areas in which the specific needs of our \nArmed Forces, and the perspectives of and about the American military \nhave a direct bearing on our role as policy-makers.\n  As perhaps the leading military analyst of the Vietnam War, Colonel \nHarry Summers, wrote in his excellent book On Strategy: The Vietnam War \nin Context:\n\n       Prior to any future commitment of U.S. military forces our \n     military leaders must insist that the civilian leadership \n     provide tangible, obtainable political goals. The political \nobjective cannot merely be a platitude but must be stated in concrete \nterms. While such objectives may very well change during the course of \nthe war, it is essential that we begin with an understanding of where \nwe intend to go. I couldn't have said it better. As Clausewitz said, we \nshould not ``take the first step without considering the last . . .'' \nThere is an inherent contradiction between the military and its \ncivilian leaders on this issue. For both domestic and international \npolitical purposes the civilian leaders want maximum flexibility and \nmaneuverability and are hesitant to fix on firm objectives. The \nmilitary on the other hand\n\n[[Page S9775]]\n\nneed just such a firm objective as early as possible in order to plan \nand conduct military operations. That is according to Harry Summers.\n\n  Mr. President, I know all too well the kind of price that is paid by \nour men and women in uniform when our political leaders fail to lay out \nclear and specific objectives. More than thirty years ago, in Vietnam \nwe lacked clear and specific objectives. We attempted to use our \nmilitary to impose our will in a region far from our shores and, in my \nview, far from our vital national interests, and without ever fully \nengaging the Congress or the American people in the process. The result \nwas a conflict where the politicians failed to provide clear political \nobjectives and where our policy was never fully understood or fully \nsupported by the American people. From what I have seen since I came to \nthis distinguished body in 1997, we have made very little progress on \nany of these fronts in the years since that time when it comes to \nAmerica going to war.\n  The trend discussed earlier of a growing disconnect between the \nmilitary and civilians has been perhaps even more pronounced among \nnational foreign and defense policy-makers. A groundbreaking recent \nstudy, organized by the North Carolina Triangle Institute for Security \nStudies and entitled ``Project on the Gap Between Military and Civilian \nSociety,'' made a number of major findings relevant to our discussion \ntoday. Let me quote from the Project's Digest of Findings and Studies:\n\n       Americans in the national political elite are increasingly \n     losing a personal connection to the military. For the first \n     75 years of the 20th Century, there was a significant \n     ``veteran's advantage'' in American politics: always a higher \n     percentage of veterans in Congress than in the comparable age \n     cohort in the general population. This veteran's advantage \n     has eroded over the past twenty-five years in both chambers \n     of Congress and across both parties. Beginning in the mid-\n     1990s, there has been a lower percentage of veterans in the \n     Senate and the House of Representatives than in the \n     comparable cohort in the population at large . . . Compared \n     to historical trends, military veterans seem now to be under-\n     represented in the national political elite.\n\n  This particular growing disconnection is having a major impact on the \ncentral topic of our global role dialogues. To quote again from the \nTriangle Institute report:\n\n       The presence of veterans in the national political elite \n     has a profound effect on the use of force in American foreign \n     policy. At least since 1816, there has been a very durable \n     pattern in U.S. behavior: the more veterans in the national \n     political elite, the less likely the United States is to \n     initiate the use of force in the international arena. The \n     effect is statistically stronger than many other factors \n     known to influence the use of force . . . The trend of a \n     declining rate of veterans in the national political elite \n     may suggest a continued high rate of military involvement in \n     conflicts in the coming years.\n\n  I find that statistic astounding.\n  One part of the Triangle Institute study, titled ``The Civilian-\nMilitary Gap and the American Use of Force 1816-1992,'' found:\n\n       two broad clusters of opinion that track with military \n     experience, yielding what we call civilian hawks and military \n     doves.\n\n  Specifically, this particular survey discovered that civilian leaders \nare more willing to use force but more likely to want to impose \nrestrictions on the level of force to be used, and more supportive of \nhuman rights objectives, while military leaders are more reluctant to \nuse force but prefer fewer restrictions on what level of force to \nemploy, and tend to support more traditional ``Realpolitik'' objectives \nfor U.S. foreign policy. Fascinating. Interestingly, civilian leaders \nwith prior military experience were found to hold views closer to the \nmilitary rather than civilian leadership.\n  In other words, those who have seen the face of battle are more \nreticent about resorting to force than those who have not. This does \nnot mean they--I should say we--are necessarily right in any particular \ncase, but it should certainly give ``civilian hawks'' some pause in \nconsidering recourse to an instrument whose chief practitioners are \nwary of utilizing. Above all, as was the case with the government \nneeding to engage the public far more effectively on questions of \nforeign policy, so must the military and the government--including the \nCongress --more effectively engage each other if we are ever going to \nachieve the kind of balance which Clausewitz wrote of.\n  This leads me to the third and final piece of the Clausewitz trinity: \nthe government. As I noted earlier, Colonel Summers emphasized that \nmilitary leaders must insist that the civilian leadership provide \ntangible, obtainable political goals. In this country, that duty rests \nsquarely on the shoulders of the President and Congress when it comes \nto the business of war, as outlined by our Founding Fathers when they \ndrafted our Constitution.\n  Under the Constitution, war powers are divided. Article I, Section 8, \ngives Congress the power to declare war and raise and support the armed \nforces, while Article II, Section 2 declares the President to be \nCommander in Chief. With this division of authority there has also been \nconstant disagreement, not only between the executive and legislative \nbranches, but between individual members of Congress as well, as we \nhave seen in our most recent debates on authorizing the intervention in \nKosovo and on the Byrd-Warner amendment concerning current funding of \nthat very operation, dare I say war. Judging by the text of the \nConstitution and the debate that went into its drafting, however, \nmembers of Congress have a right, and I would say an obligation, to \nplay a key role in the making of war and in determination of the proper \nuse of our armed forces, which has brought Senator Pat Roberts and me \nto this floor, shoulder to shoulder, to see if we can't further \narticulate and work out a consensus on how do we commit American forces \nabroad.\n  It is generally agreed that the Commander in Chief role gives the \nPresident power to repel attacks against the United States and makes \nhim responsible for leading the armed forces. During the Korean and \nVietnam conflicts, however, this country found itself involved for many \nyears in undeclared wars. Many members of Congress became concerned \nwith the erosion of congressional authority to decide when the United \nStates should become involved in a war or should use our armed forces \nin situations that might lead to war.\n  On November 7, 1973, the Congress passed the War Powers Resolution \nover the veto of President Nixon. As Dante Fascell, former Chairman of \nthe House Committee on Foreign Affairs noted:\n\n       The importance of this law cannot be discounted. Simply \n     stated, the War Powers Resolution seeks to restore the \n     balance created in the Constitution between the President and \n     Congress on questions of peace and war. It stipulates the \n     constitutional directions that the President and Congress \n     should be partners in such vital questions--to act together, \n     not in separate ways.\n\n  The War Powers Resolution has two key requirements. Section 4(a) \nrequires the President to submit a report to Congress within forty-\neight hours whenever troops are introduced into hostilities or \nsituations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly \nindicated by the circumstances. Section 5(b) then stipulates that if \nU.S. armed forces have been sent into situations of actual or imminent \nhostilities the President must remove the troops within sixty days--\nninety days if he requests a delay--unless Congress declares war or \notherwise authorizes the use of force. The resolution also provides \nthat Congress can compel the President to withdraw the troops at any \ntime by passing a joint resolution. It is important to note, however, \nthat since the adoption of the War Powers Resolution, every President \nhas taken the position that it is an unconstitutional infringement by \nthe Congress on the President's authority as Commander-in-Chief, and \nthe courts have not directly addressed this vital question.\n  I would submit that although the Congress tried to reassert itself \nafter the Vietnam War with the enactment of the War Powers Resolution, \nwe have continued to be a timid, sometimes non-existent player in the \ngovernment that Clausewitz emphasized must play a vital role in \ncreating the balance necessary for an effective war-making effort. \nSince I came to the Senate, it has been my observation that the current \nsystem by which the Executive and Legislative Branches discharge their \nrespective Constitutional duties in committing American servicemen and \nwomen into harm's way has become inadequate. Congress continually lacks \nsufficient and timely information as to policy objectives and means \nprior to the commitment of American forces. And then, in my opinion, \nCongress largely abdicates its responsibilities\n\n[[Page S9776]]\n\nfor declaring war and controlling the purse with inadequate and ill-\ntimed consideration of operations.\n  Perhaps this failure has been a long time in the making. My dear \nfriend and colleague Senator Byrd so eloquently stated in an earlier \naddress to this body on the history of the Senate,\n\n       We remember December 7, 1941, as a day of infamy. We mourn \n     the hundreds of American servicemen who died at Pearl Harbor, \n     and the thousands who gave their lives in the war that \n     followed. We might also mourn the abrupt ending of the debate \n     over American foreign policy. While history proved President \n     Roosevelt and his followers more correct than their \n     isolationist opponents, it also buried for decades the \n     warnings of the isolationists that the United States should \n     not aspire to police the world, nor should it intervene at \n     will in the affairs of other nations in this hemisphere or \n     elsewhere.\n\n  A very wise statement by Senator Byrd.\n  Reasons for the failure of the War Powers Resolution and for our \ncurrent difficulties abound. I believe that part of our problem stems \nfrom the disputed and uncertain role of the War Powers Resolution of \n1973 in governing the conduct of the President, as well as the \nCongress, with respect to the introduction of American forces into \nhostile situations. Once again, these disputes continue to resound \nbetween both the branches and individual members of the legislative \nbranch.\n  In all honesty, however, the realities of our government highlight \nthe fact that while the legislature can urge, request, and demand that \nthe President consult with members of Congress on decisions to use \nforce, it cannot compel him to follow any of the advice that it might \ncare to offer. With that in mind, as an institution, Congress can do no \nmore than give or withhold its permission to use force. And while this \n``use it or lose it'' quality of congressional authorizations may make \nmany members leery about acting on a crisis too soon, delays will \nvirtually guarantee, as Senator Arthur Vandenberg once stated, that \ncrises will ``never reach Congress until they have developed to a point \nwhere congressional discretion is pathetically restricted.''\n\n  What a great quote. I felt that certainly as I tried to vote properly \nin this Chamber months ago in regard to Milosevic and his intervention \nin Kosovo.\n  Mr. President, I believe that in view of our obligations to the \nnational interest, to the Constitution and to the young American \nservicemen and women whose very lives are at stake whether it be a \n``contingency operation'' or a full-scale war, neither the executive or \nlegislative branches should be satisfied with the current situation \nwhich results in uncertain signals to the American people, to overseas \nfriends and foes, and to our armed forces personnel. In making our \ndecision to authorize military action, Congress should work to elicit \nall advice and information from the President on down to the \nbattlefield commanders, make a sound decision based on this \ninformation, and then leave battlefield management in the hands of \nthose competent and qualified to carry out such a task. Only then will \nthe proper roles and balance of the triad Clausewitz spoke of be \nobtained. And only then will our decisions to commit troops be based on \nthe principles we spoke of in our earlier dialogs: (1) a vital national \ninterest, (2) with clear national policy and objectives, and (3) with a \nwell-defined exit strategy. As Senator Mansfield once stressed,\n\n       In moments of crisis, at least, the President and the \n     Congress cannot be adversaries; they must be allies who \n     together, must delineate the path to guide the nation's \n     massive machinery of government in a fashion which serves the \n     interests of the people and is acceptable to the people.\n\n  Beautifully said.\n  In light of the problems and issues just discussed, I would like to \ntake a moment to discuss S. 2851, a bill I recently introduced with \nSenators Roberts and Jeffords, which seeks to find a more workable \nsystem for Presidential and congressional interaction on the commitment \nof American forces into combat situations. It is a bill derived from \nthe current system for Presidential approval and reporting to Congress \non covert operations, a system which was established by Public Law 102-\n88 in 1991. By most accounts, this system has been accepted by both \nbranches and has worked very well with respect to covert operations, \nproducing both better decisionmaking in the executive branch and \nimproved congressional input and oversight with respect to these \noperations. Since overt troop deployments into hostilities almost \ncertainly constitute a greater risk to American interests and to \nAmerican lives, I believe such a system represents the very least we \nshould do to improve the approval and oversight process with respect to \novert military operations. It does not bind or limit the executive \nbranch or military, but seeks to build upon the principles we have \ncovered throughout our global roles dialog.\n  Precisely because the United States is a democracy, it is important \nthat policy decisions be made democratically. As Michael Walzer \nobserves in his article ``Deterrence and Democracy'': ``The test of a \ndemocracy is not that the right side wins the political battle, but \nthat there is a political battle.'' Policies that pass through public \ndebate and inspection emerge all the stronger for it, because they \nenjoy greater respect both at home and abroad. Instead of seeing \nexecutive-legislative conflict over foreign policy as a cause for \ndismay, we should recognize that healthy democracies argue over the \nwisdom of policies. Debate is what, ultimately, produces better policy. \nAnd this is precisely the role of the government, both the President \nand Congress, in fulfilling our constitutional duties and achieving the \nproper balance of the Clausewitz trilogy.\n  I believe the case has clearly been made that the public, the \nmilitary, and the government--the three under-\npinnings of successful national security policy--are not now in proper \n``balance,'' to use Clausewitz' term. Each part of this trinity is \nskeptical and increasingly disengaged from the other two, with a number \nof significant and negative effects on our national interest which we \nhave discussed today and in previous dialogs: a widening divide between \nthe aspirations of American foreign policy-makers and the Congress' and \nthe public's willingness to finance the necessary means is one such \npoint; a military and civilian leadership which sees America's role in \nthe world and the means appropriate to secure those ends in vastly \ndifferent terms; a national government which is deeply divided along \npartisan lines and between the executive and legislative branches.\n\n  I suggest the chief responsibility for fixing this dysfunctional \nsystem lies squarely with us in the government. As Clausewitz said, \n``the political aims are the business of government alone,'' and it is \nthe political aims which drive, or at least should drive, both military \nrequirements and the public's engagement, or disengagement, from \nAmerican policy. We must find more and better ways of communicating \nwith our constituents on the realities of our national interests and \nthe real costs of securing them. We must find more and better ways to \nincrease the exchange of experiences and ideas between the government \nand the military. And we must find more and better ways of ensuring \nthat both the executive and legislative branches properly fulfill their \nconstitutional responsibilities in the arena of national security \npolicy.\n  Professor of Strategic Studies at Johns Hopkins University Eliot \nCohen closed his paper on ``The Unequal Dialogue: The Civil-Military \nGap and the Use of Force,'' which is a very interesting series of case \nstudies on effective, and ineffective, civilian and military \ninteraction during wartime, with these observations, which are \nextremely relevant to our discussion today:\n\n       (The lessons of serious conflict) are, above all, that \n     political leaders must immerse themselves in the conduct of \n     war no less than they do in great projects of domestic \n     legislation; that they must master their military briefs as \n     thoroughly as they do their civilian ones; that they must \n     demand and expect from their military subordinates a candor \n     as bruising as it is necessary; that both groups must expect \n     a running conversation in which, although civilian opinion \n     will not dictate, it must dominate; that that conversation \n     will include not only ends and policies, but ways and means.\n\n  In other words, we in Government, the constitutionally established \npolitical leaders, must step up to the plate and do our jobs when it \ncomes to national security policy--especially when it comes to making \nwar--with great humility as to our own limitations, with great care and \nforethought, but with diligence and determination.\n\n[[Page S9777]]\n\n  Mr. President, it is my honor and distinct personal privilege to \nyield to the distinguished Senator from Kansas, Mr. Roberts, for \nfurther remarks.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, before I begin, I would like to pay \ntribute and special thanks to Scott Kindsvater, who happens to come \nfrom my hometown of Dodge City, KS, who is a major in the U.S. Air \nForce and is a congressional fellow in my office. He is an F-15 pilot \nsecond to none. He is going to be assigned to the Pentagon. His tour of \nduty will end about the same time as the election. I thank him for all \nof his help, all of his homework, all of his study, and for gathering \ntogether the material that has been so helpful to me to take part in \nthis foreign policy dialog.\n  I thank my good friend and colleague, Senator Cleland. We again come \nto the floor of the Senate for what is our fifth dialog with regard to \nour Nation's role in global affairs and our vital national security \ninterests. This effort has been prompted by our conviction, as the \nSenator has said, that such a dialog, such a process is absolutely \nnecessary, if we are to arrive at a better bipartisan consensus on \nnational security policy, a consensus our Nation deserves and needs but \nhas been lacking since the end of the cold war.\n  Both Senator Cleland and I have the privilege of serving together on \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee. The distinguished Presiding \nOfficer also serves on that committee and provides very valuable \nservice. As a matter of fact, Senator Cleland and I sit directly \nopposite one another. During hearing after hearing on the leading \nnational security issues of the past 4 years, it became obvious that \nwhile we did not agree on each and every issue, we shared many similar \nviews and concerns. I call it ``the foreign policy and national \nsecurity eyebrow syndrome''; that is to say, when Max and I hear \ntestimony we think is off the mark, a little puzzling, or downright \nsilly, our eyebrows go up, and that is usually followed by a great deal \nof head shaking and commiserating.\n\n  The result has been a series of foreign policy dialogs: No. 1, what \nis the U.S. global role? No. 2, how do we define and defend U.S. vital \nnational security interests? No. 3, what is the role of multilateral \norganizations in the world today and our role within them? No. 4, when \nand how should U.S. military forces be deployed?\n  Today Senator Cleland has chosen a theme taken from the 19th century \nmilitary strategist, Gen. Karl von Clausewitz, called ``The Trinity of \nWar Making,'' or the role of government, the military, and the public \nin conducting and implementing our national security policy.\n  Finally, in closing these dialogs for this session of Congress by \nSenator Cleland, I have prepared a summary of agreed upon principles \nwhich we suggest to this body that both he and I believe represent a \nsuggested roadmap for the next administration and the Congress.\n  With regard to two of the Clausewitz so-called trinities, the need \nfor government to gain public support for national security policy, \nSenator Cleland already summarized our purpose very well when he said:\n\n       We must find more and better ways of communicating with our \n     constituents on the realities of our national interests and \n     the costs in securing them.\n\n  Senator Cleland went on to say:\n\n       We must find more and better ways to increase the exchange \n     of experiences and ideas between our Government and our \n     military.\n\n  Finally, Max said:\n\n       We must find more and better ways of ensuring that both the \n     executive and our legislative branches properly fulfill their \n     constitutional responsibilities in the arena of national \n     security policy.\n\n  In this regard, I will comment on the first of Senator Cleland's \npoints, the fact that our political leadership must make sure that the \npublic understands and supports the use of military force.\n  Former Joint Chief of Staff, Gen. Colin Powell asserted our troops \nmust go into battle with the support and understanding of the American \npeople. General Powell contended back in 1993 that the key to using \nforce is to first match the political expectations to military means in \na wholly realistic way and, second, to attain very decisive results. He \nsaid a decision to use force must be made with clear purpose in mind \nand added that if the purpose is too murky--and, goodness knows, we \nhave had a lot of that in recent years--our political leadership will \neventually have to find clarity.\n  As Senator Cleland has pointed out already, unfortunately, today it \nseems that national security and foreign policy issues represent little \nmore than a blip on the public's radar screen. Obviously, the public \nthis evening will be tuned to either the baseball playoffs or the \ndebate. He quoted news surveys and polls showing foreign policy and \ndefense ranking last among issues cited by the public as most important \nthat face the country. That is amazing to me.\n  A case in point: While we are all hopeful that the situation in the \nformer Yugoslavia will result in the end of the Slobodan Milosevic \nregime and the possible transition to a more democratic government, \nU.S. and NATO military intervention and continued presence in the \nBalkans lacks a clearly defined policy goal or any realistic timetable \nfor any conclusion. As a result, while most Americans may have really \nforgotten about or are not focused on Kosovo today, nevertheless, 6,000 \nAmerican troops still remain there and could remain there for another \ndecade. That is a difficult sell with regard to public understanding.\n\n  In that regard, as Senator Cleland has pointed out, Congress bears \npart of that responsibility. It is easy to criticize, but we bear part \nof that responsibility. Unclear political objectives do not allow our \nmilitary leaders to create clear, concise, and effective military \nstrategies to accomplish any specific goal. Unclear political goals \nlead to wars and involvement with no exit strategy.\n  A brief examination of the chain of events leading up to the use of \nforce in Kosovo certainly proves the point:\n  On March 23 of 1999, the Senate conducted minimal debate regarding \nthe use of force in Yugoslavia after troops had already been deployed. \nS. Con. Res. 21 passed, authorizing the President to conduct military \nair operations.\n  On March 24, one day later, combat air operations did begin.\n  On March 26, the President notified Congress, consistent with the War \nPowers Resolution, that operations began on March 24.\n  On March 27, after the fact, the House considered the use of force \nand failed to pass S. Con. Res. 21 on March 28.\n  On April 30, 18 Members of the House, having serious objection to \nthat policy, filed suit against the President for conducting military \nactivities without any authorization.\n  Then on May 20, 1999, the emergency supplemental appropriations bill \nfor fiscal year 1999 finally passed, and it provided funding for the \nongoing U.S. Kosovo operations.\n  On May 25, the 60-day deadline passed following Presidential \nnotification of military operations, and the President didn't seek a \n30-day extension, noting instead that the War Powers Resolution is \nconstitutionally defective.\n  Then on February 18, 2000, a Federal appeals court affirmed the \ndistrict court decision that the House of Representatives Members \nlacked standing to sue the President relative to the April 30 suit of \nthe previous year.\n  I might add at this juncture that Senators Cleland and Snowe, I, and \nothers had all previously successfully amended various appropriations \nmeasures mandating the administration report to the Congress specific \npolicy goals and military strategy objectives prior to the involvement \nof any U.S. troops.\n  Most, if not all, of those reports were late, were not specific or \npertinent to the fast changing situation in the Balkans. We at least \ntried.\n  And, Mr. President, I remember well the briefing by members of the \nAdministration with regard to why the ongoing military operation in \nKosovo was in our vital national interest. I still have my notebook and \nthe list:\n  The Balkans represent a strategic bridge to Europe and the Middle \nEast.\n  The current conflict could spin into Albania and include Macedonia, \nGreece and Turkey. After all World War I started in the same region.\n  We should act to prevent a humanitarian disaster and massacre of \nthousands of refugees.\n  If we do not act, it will endanger our progress in Bosnia.\n  The leadership and credibility of NATO into the next century is at \nstake.\n\n[[Page S9778]]\n\n  We must oppose Serb aggression.\n  With all due respect Mr. President, these arguments did not match the \nfast-changing conditions in the Balkans. 20-20 hindsight now tells us \nthe incremental bombing campaign and publicly ruling out the use of \nground troops exacerbated the refugee tragedy.\n  The present Presiding Officer serves with me on the Senate \nIntelligence Committee, and we had a hearing after part of these \nproblems developed. Somehow intelligence reports predicting the law of \nunintended effects went unheeded or were ignored.\n  And, in the end, U.S. stated goals changed when the original goals \nfell short. We were assured we were fighting, not for our national \ninterest but selflessly to save lives and promote democracy, fighting \nin behalf of humanity. Mr. President, in my view, neither the Senate, \nthe House or the administration can square these goals with what has \nactually taken place and is taking place in the Balkans. I don't \nquestion the intent.\n  The most optimistic lien today is that Kosovo is liberated after the \nmighty efforts of the U.S. led NATO coalition. Well, as described by \nJames Warren of the Chicago Tribune, it is a liberated total mess.\n  He quotes British academic and international relations analyst \nTimothy Garton Ash, a professor at St. Antony's College, Oxford, who \nreviewed six books on the conflict with unbiased perspective.\n  According to Warren, most Americans have forgotten about the war by \nnow, so they don't care much about the fact the so called winners are \ntotally unprepared for dealing with peace. Violence and chaos reign in \nKosovo. The victims and the ``good guys,'' the Kosovars have conducted \nreverse ethnic cleansing under the noses of U.S. and NATO troops.\n  We have, in fact, created a new Kosovo apartheid. Having failed to \nstop the killing, we are proving unable to win the peace or prevent \nrevenge inspired reverse ethnic cleansing.\n  Moreover, since the Balkan war, badly fought and with no clear end \ngame, other nations have increasingly been united in criticizing U.S. \nclout as we wield unparalleled power on the world stage and have \nreacted with what some refer to as a new arms race.\n  Since we can be sure there will be other calls for intervention in \nthe world, it is incumbent on us to ask whether a more effective \napproach exists.\n  President Clinton has, in fact, proclaimed to the world, that if a \nstate sought to wipe out large numbers of innocent civilians based on \ntheir race or religion, the United States should intervene in their \nbehalf. Stated such, a public support can be garnered for such a \npolicy.\n  But, as Kosovo has demonstrated, things are not that simple. As Adam \nWolfson pointed out in his article within Commentary magazine;\n  Certainly the vast majority of Kosovars were subjected to harassment \nand much worse and their crisis was as President Clinton described, a \nhumanitarian one. But, the Kosovars also had their political objectives \nand ambitions; an independent Kosovo ruled by themselves; a goal they \npress for today by political intimidation and violence.\n  The United States has, on the other hand, continued to oppose \nindependence and has supported a multicultural society for Kosovo. Vice \nPresident Gore has said that in Kosovo there must be a genuine \nrecognition and respect for difference and the creation of a tolerant \nand open society where everyone's rights are respected, regardless of \nethnic or religious background and where all groups can participate in \ngovernment, business, the arts and education.\n  These are fine and noble goals but they are ``ours'' not those of the \nKosovars. We have two choices. First, we can accept the political \nambitions for a mono-cultural and independent state purged of non \nAlbanians or second, we can attempt to stay in Kosovo until we can \nsomehow transform entrenched and long standing political and ethnic \nculture and teach the values of diversity and religious toleration. \nThis is on small task and in my view, It may not sustainable over the \nlong term both in terms of cost, benefit and public opinion.\n  Will the American people respond? Do they even care? In their book, \n``Misreading the Public, the Myth of a New Isolationism,'' Steven Kull \nand I.M. Destler of the Brookings Institution, make the case that the \nnotion that public attitudes are typified today by new isolationism, \ngreater parochialism and declining interest in the world is simply not \ntrue.\n  They argue most Americans do not believe we should disengage from the \nworld and support international engagement and for the United States to \nremain involved but with greater emphasis on cooperative and \nmultilateral involvement. They also argue that when presented with \nfacts, reasonable goals and alternatives, that public support can be \ngained.\n  That is the point, Mr. President. We have to do a better job. Member \nof the Senate need to participate in the daily grind of overseeing \nAdministration policies, passing judgment, and behaving as a co-equal \nbranch. When a majority, if a majority can be found, feels a President \noversteps constitutional barriers or threatens to do so, we should \nrespond with statutory checks, not floor speeches and sense-of-the-\nSenate resolutions.\n  In this regard Senator Cleland has done us a favor with his proposal \nderived from the current system for Presidential approval and reporting \nto Congress on covert operations. Senator Cleland has candidly pointed \nout his bill does not represent a consensus view and his introduction \nof the legislation is to stimulate further discussion. Let the \ndiscussion begin.\n  Mr. President, having spoken to the role of government and the public \nwith the specific example of Kosovo, let me turn to the third topic of \nthe ``Clausewitz Trinity'', the military.\n  Mr. President, I am sure that no General throughout history, be he \nClausewitz or Eisenhower would condone sending troops that are not \nready into battle. In the not-mincing-any-words department, I am \nconcerned and frustrated that our United States Military today is \nstressed, strained, and in too many cases hollow.\n\n  I often say in Kansas that our first obligation as Members of \nCongress is to make sure our national security capability is equal to \nour vital national security responsibilities. How do we do this?\n  One way is to do exactly what Senator Cleland and I try to do and \nthat is to personally visit our men and women in uniform stationed here \nat home and throughout the world. We, along with a majority of members \nof the Armed Services Committee, visit with and seek advice from the \nranks; our enlisted, our non-commissioned officers, officers and \ncommanders.\n  Mr. President, when doing that and when making remarks and \nobservations before many military groups; active duty, reserve and \nguard units, I always acknowledge those in the military must operate \nand perform their duties within the chain of command. But, I also ask \nthem for their candor and honesty.\n  And they have provide me and others that with spades.\n  Those in the Navy tell me the Navy cannot or soon will not be able to \nperform assigned duties with current force structure. The bottom line \nis there are not enough ships or submarines in the fleet and training \nand weapons inventories are inadequate.\n  Those in the Army tell me the training and doctrine command is almost \nbroken and peacekeeping operations are taking their toll on combat \nreadiness.\n  Those in the Air Force repeat what is common knowledge--pilot \nretention problems are legion. The Air Force is short about 1,200 \npilots today. Strategic lift in both air and sea is inadequate.\n  The Marines tell this former marine they have significant problems in \nthe operation and maintenance of their Harrier and helicopter fleet. \nThey tell me they are meeting their recruiting and retention challenges \nbut they are working harder and harder to achieve that goal.\n  Overall, those in command tell us--and the figures are plain to see--\nthat operation and maintenance accounts have been robbed for eight \nyears to pay for ever increasing peace keeping and now peace \nenforcement missions.\n  Spare parts are hard to come by, we are short of weapons both for \npractice and combat. Mission capable rates are consistently down. \nRecent press reports state 12 of 20 major Army training centers are \nrated C-4, the lowest\n\n[[Page S9779]]\n\nreadiness rating. A Navy Inspector General Report says Navy fliers are \nleaving port at a lower stage of readiness. The Air Force reports that \nits readiness rates for warplane squadrons continues to decline.\n  Many units are on frequent temporary duty assignments or are deployed \nmost of the year on missions that many believe are of questionable \nvalue. When the troops come home, their training is shortchanged based \non the lack of time available for training and lack of resources. \nMaintenance required for old equipment takes significant time away from \nother missions, from family and it is very costly.\n  There is another related problem and challenge, that of morale. There \nis a growing uneasiness with military men and women that \ntheir leadership either does not care or is out of touch with their \nproblems. By leadership, I am including the Congress of the United \nStates. Soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines tell me they are stressed \nout and dissatisfied and leaving.\n\n  This has been an anecdotal outpouring from military commanders in the \nfield simply fed up with current quality of life and readiness stress. \nPick up any service, military or defense publication or read any story \nin the press and what we have is equal opportunity frustration.\n  A February study by the Center for Strategic and International \nStudies warns us about ``stress on personnel and families, problems \nwith recruiting and retention, and for some, declining trust and \nconfidence in the military institution and its leaders.''\n  Half of the respondents in the survey said their unit did not have \nhigh morale and two thirds said stress was a problem. A recent Army \nstudy at Fort Leavenworth, the intellectual center of the Army, located \nin my homes state of Kansas, warned the number of lieutenants and \ncaptains leaving the Army is now over 60% compared to 48% a decade ago.\n  In a survey taken at Fort Benning, outgoing captains complained they \nwere disillusioned with the Army mission and lifestyle, struggling to \nmaintain a functional family life. The American soldier has gone from a \nhomeland protector of vital national interests to nomadic peace keeper. \nHis weapons, on the cutting edge, some complain are beginning to rust.\n  During this time there has been quite a transition period Mr. \nPresident. Stretching from the Reagan, Bush, and Clinton \nadministrations, military personnel levels declined by 40 percent, \nspending dropped 35 percent and meanwhile the number of U.S. forces \nstationed abroad increased and remains high.\n  Under Secretary for Defense for Acquisition and Technology, Jacques \nGansler recently stated:\n\n       We are trapped in a death spiral. The requirement to \n     maintain our aging equipment is costing us more each year in \n     repair costs, down time and maintenance tempo. But, we must \n     keep this equipment in repair to maintain readiness. It \n     drains our resources--resources we should apply to \n     modernization of the traditional systems and development of \n     new systems.\n       So we stretch out our replacement schedules to ridiculous \n     lengths and reduce the quantities of new equipment we \n     purchase, raising the cost and still durther delaying \n     modernization.\n\n  I am very concerned if what I have described is even close to \nfactual--and I am afraid it is based upon my own conversations with the \nmen and women of our military, that we are headed in a very dangerous \ndirection.\n  I realize the readiness of our military has become an issue in the \ncurrent presidential campaign. And, it is not my intent to take sides \nin that debate during this policy forum. I might add I think in some \nways this debate is long overdue.\n  Another way to determine our military readiness is to ask those in \ncharge. And, Senator Cleland and I, along with members of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee did just that last week. The joint chiefs of \nstaff came before the committee. Not without some not so subtle advice \nfrom on high.\n  Prior to the joint chiefs testimony, Administration spokesman Kenneth \nBacon said Defense Secretary Cohen told the Chiefs he expected them to \nplay straight on the readiness issue, to give the facts, not to ``beat \nthe drum with a tin cup'' but to talk honestly about the pressures they \nface from the operations their forces are undergoing.\n  Well, Mr. Bacon need not have worried. The Chiefs testified and shot \npretty straight. On an annual basis the Marines said they needed \napproximately $1.5 billion to be the fully modernized 911 force in \nreadiness we expect of them. The Air Force told us they needed $20 to \n$30 billion, the Navy some $17 billion and the Army $10 billion. That \ntotaled up to somewhere between $48 to $60 billion more the Chiefs feel \neach service needs to perform its mission.\n  Those figures, by the way, compare with a recent estimate by the \nCongressional Budget Office regarding the cost the CBO deems necessary \nto enable the services to meet their mission obligations.\n  Lord knows what the Chiefs would have requested if they had beat the \ndrum with a tin cup. And, I must admit I am disappointed by the \nsuggestion in Mr. Bacon's warning that the chiefs would ever provide \nanything but their honest testimony before the Congress, after all each \nof the Chiefs swore to provide their honest, candid assessment during \ntheir nomination hearings.\n  I always assume they do just that.\n  With all of the pressures of the current political season, perhaps \nMr. Bacon's concern was understandable, after all he is a spokesman.\n  I brought a tin cup to the hearings last week. The distinguished \nacting Presiding Officer looked with some shock and amazement as I had \na tin cup and poured water into it. I described all the missions that \nthe military had. Then I described what they had to work with. I said: \nKeep pouring the water and some water might come out. In other words, \nthe services can't carry all the water they were intended to carry. Of \ncourse, what I didn't say was that I had drilled a hole in the cup. Of \ncourse, some of the water was coming out. But it made a good \naudiovisual tool.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator for his help. I didn't bring one \nhere tonight. Don't worry. We are not going to get anybody wet.\n  To be fair, Mr. Bacon stated he believes our forces are well \nequipped, trained and led. I will acknowledge the ``led'' part. The \npoint is too much attention has been placed on the tip of the spear of \nU.S. military might.\n  Mr. Bacon is correct, the Secretary of Defense is correct, and others \nare correct. I think we all agree that the tip of the spear is ready. \nIt is tough and it is lethal.\n  But, just as important but not often discussed is the shaft of the \nspear. Range, sustainability, lethality, accuracy and the deterrence \ncapacity of the spear as a weapon is greatly reduced if the shaft is \nweak or damaged.\n  What comprises the shaft of our military readiness spear?\n  Let us try the adequacy of critical air and sea lift to sustain the \nforce or get the force to the fight in a timely manner.\n  Let us try the adequacy of the reserve of key repair parts and \nweapons inventory to sustain the battle.\n  Let us talk about the effectiveness and adequacy of training time and \nfunding.\n  We should mention the impact of quality of life from pay to health \ncare to housing on the warrior's willingness--and they are warriors--to \ncommit to a career in the military.\n  We should mention the impact of the significant operational tempo of \nthe military and the impact that has on the total military spear.\n  We should also mention the effect of mission quality and duration on \nreadiness to fight and win the nation's wars; and\n  The services' preparation for the future, joint battlefield in an \nenvironment where asymmetric warfare will be the norm and the \nbattlefield may be in an urban environment.\n  I do not mean to pick on Mr. Bacon, notwithstanding his comments, the \nprimary purpose of our military as defined from Clausewitz to Colin \nPowell is the readiness of the force to carry out the National \nStrategy. I have grave concerns that if we look behind the tip of the \nspear of U.S. military readiness, our forces are not ready. And, if \nthat is banging on our readiness capability with a tin cup, so be it.\n  The point is that we in the Congress have the obligation and \nresponsibility to provide the resources our Armed Forces need to \nprotect our vital national interests.\n\n[[Page S9780]]\n\n  There is the real debate that should take place. Our former NATO \nallied commander, Wes Clark recently asked the real pertinent question. \nHow should the armed services be used? If readiness is a priority, what \nis it we should be ready for? General Clark said it's high time we had \nthis debate and settled the issue.\n  While I am not sure we will ever settle the issue, it is time for the \ndebate and I have a suggestion, I even have a road map.\n  The Senator from Georgia has during our past dialogues referred to \nthe Commission on America's National Interests and the Commission's \nvaluable 1996 report. As a matter of fact, we have both referred to \nthis report and we found it most helpful.\n\n  The good news is that the commission has updated its findings for the \nyear 2000. I have it in my hand. It has set forth a clear and easy-to-\nunderstand list of recommendations that at least in part can answer the \nquestion posed by General Clark and many others: ``Ready for what?''\n  Senator Cleland referred to this challenge during his testimony with \nthe Joint Chiefs last week. He pointed out, as I have tried to do in \nsome respects, America is adrift, spending a great deal of time in what \nmay be important interests we all agree with but ignoring matters of \nvital national interest.\n  The authors have summarized the national interest by saying that we \nhave vital national interests: We have extremely important, we have \nimportant, and less important or secondary interests.\n  My dear friend knows we are spending an awful lot of time on \nimportant issues and less important or secondary issues--as far as I am \nconcerned, not enough time with extremely important and vital.\n  I commend this report to the attention of my colleagues and all \ninterested parties. The commission has identified six cardinal \nchallenges for our next President and the next Congress more along the \nlines of the principles that we have agreed to and we will recommended \nin just a moment.\n  I ask unanimous consent the executive summary from the report by the \nCommission on America's National Interests, which is much shorter than \nthe book, be printed in the Record following the conclusion of our \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I yield to my distinguished friend.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I thank Senator Roberts for that wonderful presentation.\n  We have reached several conclusions in this year-long dialog \nregarding America's global role. Before I get to some of the \nconclusions, may I say a special thank-you to my key staff members. Mr. \nBill Johnstone, who has been the absolute force behind my remarks and \nhas helped my thought process for a number of years as we have \ndiscussed American foreign policy issues, a special thanks goes to him. \nA special thanks also to Tricia Heller of my staff, and Andy \nVanlandingham; they have been invaluable in helping me form some of my \nconclusions about America's global role in the world.\n  I thank very much my dear friend from Kansas. It is an honor to be \nwith him, continuing our dialog on America's role in the world in the \n21st century, particularly in terms of military commitments, our \nfootprint around the world, so to speak, and its rationale. It is a \npleasure to stand shoulder to shoulder with him in a bipartisan way, to \nsee if we can't find a consensus that might lead us well into the 21st \ncentury in terms of our foreign policy.\n  Mr. President, when Senator Roberts and I embarked on this series of \nGlobal Role Dialogues back in February, we set as our goal the \ninitiation of a serious debate in this great institution of the United \nStates Senate on the proper role of our country in the post-cold war \nworld. We both believed--and continue to believe--that such a process \nis absolutely necessary if we are to arrive at the bipartisan consensus \non national security policy which our Nation so badly needs, but has \nbeen lacking since the fall of the Soviet Union. While the vagaries of \nSenators' schedules have unfortunately limited somewhat our ability to \ninvolve more Senators in this process, I want to thank Senators \nHutchison, Hagel, Lugar and Levin who all made important contributions \nto these discussions. Senator Roberts and I will be exploring ways in \nwhich we can broaden this dialogue in the next Congress.\n  When we began our discussions we also indicated that we had far more \nquestions than definitive answers. And while we cannot claim to have \nfound any magic solutions or panaceas for the challenges facing the \nUnited States on the global scene as we approach the end of the \nTwentieth Century, I believe I can speak for Senator Roberts when I say \nthat we believe we have learned much from the writings and statements \nof many, many others, in this country and abroad, who have thoughtfully \nconsidered these questions we have been examining.\n  We have drawn heavily on the work of such entities as the Commission \non America's National Interests--on which Senator Roberts serves with \ndistinction--, the U.S. Commission on National Security/21st Century, \nand the ODC's America's National Interests in Multilateral Engagement: \nA Bipartisan Dialogue. We have consulted the work of a large number of \nacademics, and governmental, military and opinion leaders from around \nthe world. And, for myself, I have certainly learned a great deal from \nmy friend and colleague, the distinguished Senator from Kansas.\n  While what we are about to say is far from complete and very much a \nwork in progress, we believe it is only fair to provide the Senate--\nwhich has indulged us with many hours of floor time to pursue this \nproject--and to those who have followed our efforts with interest and \nencouragement to lay out the lessons we have learned and some general \nprinciples which we believe should guide our national security policies \nin the years ahead.\n  At this point, I yield again to my partner in these dialogues, \nSenator Pat Roberts of Kansas, but first I want to thank him for all of \nhis help in this undertaking. His experience, his good humor and his \nwisdom have made our dialogues both instructive and extremely \nenjoyable. I yield to Senator Roberts.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, with all those accolades, the Senator \nmissed one--I had one other line in there.\n  I commend my good friend for his commonsense approach to our \ncountry's future. I thank him. I applaud him for his leadership. He has \nbegun what I think is a trail-blazing initiative. This has been, as he \nhas indicated, a year-long bipartisan foreign policy dialog endeavor. \nWe thank staff and various folks on the floor for their patience. I \nlearned a great deal from the distinguished Senator from Georgia. He \nsaid he learned from me. I learned from him.\n  As the Senator mentioned, we would now like to present our lessons \nlearned from our year-long dialogs, these dialogs that we began because \nwe both felt our foreign policy agenda had run aground. We wanted to \nstart a series of these dialogs, these debates or colloquys, in order \nto arrive at a consensus concerning the future of our Nation's foreign \nand defense policies.\n  We condensed our five dialogs into seven foreign policy principles. \nThese principles are not only a compilation of our dialogs, but also a \nsummary of the lessons learned from the various discussions with \ncolleagues, as the Senator has indicated, foreign policy elites, from \nacademia and the government, and from several consultations with many \nmilitary leaders. These seven foreign policy principles are simple. \nThey are realistic. They are sustainable. We believe they would support \nand secure our national interests. We strongly believe the following \nprinciples are a step in the right direction.\n  We urge the next administration of Congress and all of our colleagues \nin the Congress to begin the process of trying to articulate a coherent \nnational security strategy.\n  I again yield to the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, these are not the ``seven deadly sins,'' \nbut I think in many ways it is a sin if we violate these basic \nfundamental lessons that we have learned.\n  First and foremost, we believe as a nation--including government, \nmedia, academia, personalities, and other leaders--we need to engage in \na serious and sustained national dialog to do\n\n[[Page S9781]]\n\nseveral things: First, define our national interests and differentiate \nthe level of interest involved, spell out what we should be prepared to \ndo in defense of those interests; second, build a bipartisan consensus \nin support of the resulting set of interests and policies.\n  As a starting point, within the Senate, we would encourage the \nForeign Relations Committee and our own Armed Services Committee upon \nwhich we both sit to hold hearings on the finished products of the \nCommission on America's National Interests, the U.S. Commission on \nNational Security/21st Century and other relevant considerations of \nthese critical topics.\n  I yield to the Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Here is principle No. 2 that the distinguished Senator \nand I have agreed upon.\n  The President and the Congress need to, first, find more and better \nways to increase communications with the American public. We both have \ntalked about this at length in our previous discussion with the \nAmerican public on the realities of our international interests and the \ncosts of securing them.\n  I could go into a long speech on how I tried to convince the Kansas \nwheat farmer that first he must have security, then he must have \nstability, then he must have an economic future, then he may get $4 \nwheat at the country elevator, but it all starts with security.\n  Second, it finds more and better ways to increase the exchange of \nideas and experiences between government and the military to avoid the \nbroadening lack of military experience in the political elite. We must \nfind more and better ways of ensuring that both the executive and \nlegislative branches fulfill their constitutional responsibilities in \nnational security policy concerning military operations other than \ndeclared war.\n\n  And, as a result of our second principle, Senator Cleland sponsored \nthe bill of which I was proud to cosponsor, S. 2851, requiring the \nPresident to report on certain information before deployments of armed \nforces. This bill basically requires the President to report \ninformation of overt operations very similar to the law requiring the \nPresident to report certain information prior to covert operations. It \nmakes sense to me. I yield to the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Third, the President and the Congress need to urgently \naddress the mismatch between our foreign policy ends and means, and \nbetween commitments and forces by:\n  Determining the most appropriate instrument--diplomatic, military, or \nother--for securing policy objectives;\n  Reviewing carefully current American commitments--especially those \ninvolving troop deployments--including the clarity of objectives, and \nthe presence of an exit strategy; and\n\n  Increasing the relatively small amount of resources devoted to the \nkey instruments for securing our national interests--all of which can \nbe supported by the American public, as detailed in ``The Foreign \nPolicy Gap: How Policymakers Misread the Public'' from the University \nof Maryland's Center for International and Security Studies.\n  These include:\n  Armed Forces--which need to be reformed to meet the requirements of \nthe 21st Century;\n  Diplomatic Forces;\n  Foreign Assistance;\n  United Nations Peacekeeping Operations--which also need to be \nreformed to become much more effective;\n  Key Regional Organizations--including NATO, the Organization of \nAmerican States, the Organization for African Unity and the Association \nof South East Asian Nations.\n  I again yield to Senator Roberts.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Let's try principle No. 4. We are the only global \nsuperpower, and in order to avoid stimulating the creation of a hostile \ncoalition of other nations, the United States should, and can afford \nto, forego unilateralist actions, except where our vital national \ninterests are involved.\n  The U.S. should pay international debt.\n  The U.S. must continue to respect and honor international commitments \nand not abdicate our global role leadership.\n  Finally, the U.S. must avoid unilateral economic and trade sanctions. \nUnilateral sanctions simply don't work as a foreign policy tool. They \nput American businesses, workers, and farmers at a huge competitive \ndisadvantage. The U.S. needs to take a harder look at alternatives, \nsuch as multilateral pressure and more effective U.S. diplomacy.\n  I yield to the distinguished Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Fifth, with respect to multilateral organizations, the \nUnited States should:\n  More carefully consider NATO's new Strategic Concept, and the future \ndirection of this, our most important international commitment; Press \nfor reform of the UN's and Security Council's peacekeeping operations \nand decisionmaking processes; Fully support efforts to strengthen the \ncapabilities of regional organizations including the European Union, \nthe Organization of American States, the Organization for African \nUnity, and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations--to deal with \nthreats to regional security; and\n\n  Promote a thorough debate, at the UN and elsewhere, on proposed \nstandards for interventions within sovereign states.\n  I yield to the distinguished Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Principle No. 6: In the post-cold-war world, the U.S. \nshould adopt a policy of realistic restraint with respect to the use of \nU.S. military force in situations other than those involving the \ndefense of vital national interests. In all other situations, we must: \nInsist on well-defined political objectives; determine whether non-\nmilitary means will be effective, and if so, try them prior to any \nrecourse to military force. We should remember the quote from General \nShelton:\n\n       The military is the hammer in our foreign policy toolbox \n     but not every problem is a nail.\n\n  We should ascertain whether military means can achieve the political \nobjectives.\n  We should determine whether the benefits outweigh the costs \n(political, financial, military), and that we are prepared to bear \nthose costs.\n  We should determine the ``last step'' we are prepared to take if \nnecessary to achieve the objectives.\n  I wonder what that last step would be. It is one thing to have a \ncause to fight for. It is another thing to have a cause that you are \nwilling to die for. In too many cases today, it doesn't seem to me that \nwe have the willingness to enter into a cause in which we are ready to \ndie but it seems to me we are sure willing to risk the lives of others \nin regards to limited policy objectives. That's not part of the \nprinciple. That's just an observation in regard to the last step \nrecommendation.\n  We should insist that we have a clear, concise exit strategy, \nincluding sufficient consideration of the subsequent role of the United \nStates, regional parties, international organizations and other \nentities in securing the long-term success of the mission--Kosovo is a \ngreat example.\n  Finally, insist on Congressional approval of all deployments other \nthan those involving responses to emergency situations.\n  The Senator referred to the amendment introduced by the distinguished \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Warner, and that of \nSenator Byrd. I voted for that. I do not think it was an abdication of \nour responsibilities.\n  Again, those of us in Congress, the majority, should approve all \ndeployments other than those involving responses to emergency \nsituations.\n  I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Beautifully said. I could not have said it better, nor \nconcur more.\n  Finally, the United States can, and must, continue to exercise \ninternational leadership, while following a policy of realistic \nrestraint in the use of military forces in particular, by:\n  Pursuing policies that promote a strong and growing economy, which is \nthe essential underpinning of any nation's strength; maintaining \nsuperior, ready and mobile armed forces, capable of rapidly responding \nto threats to our national interests; strengthening the non-military \ntools discussed above for securing our national interests; and making a \nlong-term commitment to promoting democracy abroad via a comprehensive, \nsustained program which makes a realistic assessment of the \ncapabilities of such a program as described by Thomas Carothers in his\n\n[[Page S9782]]\n\nexcellent primer on ``Aiding Democracy Abroad: The Learning Curve''.\n  I hope it is very clear that Senator Roberts and I are not advocating \na retreat from America's global leadership role, and are not advocating \na new form of isolationism. We both believe our country has substantial \nand inescapable self-interests which necessitate our leadership. \nHowever, when it comes to the way we exercise that leadership, \nespecially when it involves military force, we do believe that our \nnational interests sometimes require that we use restraint. The \nalternatives--whether a unilateralism which imposes direct resource \ncosts far beyond what the Congress or the American people have shown a \nwillingness to finance or an isolationism which would fail to secure \nour national interests in this increasingly interconnected world--are, \nin our judgment, unacceptable.\n  Over the course of these dialogues, Senator Roberts and I have both \nturned to the following words from the editor of the publication \nNational Interest, Owen Harries:\n\n       I advocate restraint because every dominant power in the \n     last four centuries that has not practiced it--that has been \n     excessively intrusive and demanding--has ultimately been \n     confronted by a hostile coalition of other powers. Americans \n     may believe that their country, being exceptional, need have \n     no worries in this respect. I do not agree. It is not what \n     Americans think of the United States but what others think of \n     it that will decide the matter.\n\n  On his desk at the Pentagon when he was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff, Colin Powell kept a quote from the great Athenian historian \nThucydides:\n\n       Of all manifestations of power, restraint impresses men \n     most.\n\n  With great thanks to my distinguished colleague, Senator Roberts, and \nto the Senate, I conclude these dialogs on the global role of the \nUnited States. I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n     Commission on America's National Interests--Executive Summary\n\n       This report of the Commission on America's National \n     Interests focuses on one core issue: what are U.S. national \n     interests today? The U.S. enters a new century as the world's \n     most powerful nation, but too often seems uncertain of its \n     direction. We hope to encourage serious debate about what \n     must become an essential foundation for a successful American \n     foreign policy: America's interests. We have sought to \n     identify the central questions about American interests. \n     Presuming no monopoly of wisdom, we nevertheless state our \n     own best answers to these questions as clearly and precisely \n     as we can--not abstractly or diplomatically. Clear assertions \n     that some interests are more important than others will \n     unavoidably give offense. We persist--with apologies--since \n     our aim is to catalyze debate about the most important U.S. \n     national interests. Our six principal conclusions are these:\n       America advantaged.--Today the U.S. has greater power and \n     fewer adversaries than ever before in American history. \n     Relative to any potential competitor, the U.S. is more \n     powerful, more wealthy, and more influential than any nation \n     since the Roman empire. With these extraordinary advantages, \n     America today is uniquely positioned to shape the \n     international system to promote international peace and \n     prosperity for decades or even generations to come.\n       America adrift.--Great power implies great responsibility. \n     But in the wake of the Cold War, the U.S. has lost focus. \n     After four decades of unprecedented single-mindedness in \n     containing Soviet Communist expansion, the United States has \n     seen a decade of ad hoc fits and starts. A defining feature \n     of American engagement in recent years has been confusion. \n     The reasons why are not difficult to identify. From 1945 to \n     1989, containment of expansionist Soviet communism provided \n     the fixed point for the compass of American engagement in the \n     world. It concentrated minds in a deadly competition with the \n     Soviet Union in every region of the world; motivated and \n     sustained the build-up of large, standing military forces and \n     nuclear arsenals with tens of thousands of weapons; and \n     precluded the development of truly global systems and the \n     possibility of cooperation to address global challenges from \n     trade to environmental degradation. In 1989 the Cold War \n     ended in a stunning, almost unimaginable victory that \n     erased this fixed point from the globe. Most of the \n     coordinates by which Americans gained their bearings in \n     the world have now been consigned to history's dustbin: \n     the Berlin Wall, a divided Germany, the Iron Curtain, \n     captive nations of the Warsaw Pact, communism on the \n     march, and, finally, the Soviet Union. Absent a compelling \n     cause and understandable coordinates, America remains a \n     superpower adrift.\n       Opportunities missed and threats emerging.--Because of the \n     absence of coherent, consistent, purposive U.S. leadership in \n     the years since the Cold War, the U.S. is missing one-time-\n     only opportunities to advance American interests and values. \n     Fitful engagement actually invites the emergence of new \n     threats, from nuclear weapons-usable material unaccounted for \n     in Russia and assertive Chinese risk-taking, to the \n     proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and the \n     unexpectedly rapid emergence of ballistic missile threats.\n       The foundation for sustainable American foreign policy.--\n     The only sound foundation for a sustainable American foreign \n     policy is a clear sense of America's national interests. Only \n     a foreign policy grounded in America's national interests can \n     identify priorities for American engagement in the world. \n     Only such a policy will allow America's leaders to explain \n     persuasively how and why American citizens should support \n     expenditures of American treasure or blood.\n       The hierarchy of American national interests.--Clarity \n     about American national interests demands that the current \n     generation of American leaders think harder about \n     international affairs than they have ever been required to \n     do. During the Cold War we had clearer, simpler answers to \n     questions about American national interests. Today we must \n     confront again the central questions: Which regions and \n     issues should Americans care about--for example, Bosnia, \n     Rwanda, Russia, Mexico, Africa, East Asia, or the Persian \n     Gulf? Which issues matter most--for example, opening markets \n     for trade, investment opportunities, weapons of mass \n     destruction (WMD), international crime and drugs, the \n     environment, or human rights? Why should Americans care? How \n     much should citizens be prepared to pay to address these \n     threats or seize these opportunities?\n       The Commission has identified a hierarchy of U.S. national \n     interests: ``vital interests,'' ``extremely important \n     interests,'' ``important interests,'' and ``less important or \n     secondary interests.'' This Report states our own best \n     judgment about which specific American national interests are \n     vital, which are extremely important, and which are just \n     important. Readers will note a sharp contrast between the \n     expansive, vague assertions about vital interests in most \n     discussion today, and the Commission's sparse list. While \n     others have claimed that America has vital interests from \n     the Balkans and the Baltics to pandemics and Taiwan, the \n     Commission identifies only five vital U.S. national \n     interests today. These are (1) to prevent, deter, and \n     reduce the threat of nuclear, biological, and chemical \n     weapons attacks on the United States or its military \n     forces abroad; (2) to ensure U.S. allies' survival and \n     their active cooperation with the U.S. in shaping an \n     international system in which we can thrive; (3) to \n     prevent the emergence of hostile major powers or failed \n     states on U.S. borders; (4) to ensure the viability and \n     stability of major global systems (trade, financial \n     markets, supplies of energy, and the environment); and (5) \n     to establish productive relations, consistent with \n     American national interests, with nations that could \n     become strategic adversaries, China and Russia.\n       Challenges for the decade ahead.--Developments around the \n     world pose threats to U.S. interests and present \n     opportunities for advancing Americans' well-being. Because \n     the United States is so predominant in the economic, \n     technical, and military realms, many politicians and pundits \n     fall victim to a rhetoric of illusion. They imagine that as \n     the sole superpower, the U.S. can simply instruct other \n     nations to do this or stop that and expect them to do it. But \n     consider how many American presidents have come and gone \n     since President Kennedy consigned Fidel Castro to the dustbin \n     of history. Students of history will recognize a story-line \n     in which a powerful state emerges (even if accidentally), \n     engenders resentment (even when it acts benevolently), \n     succumbs to the arrogance of power, and thus provokes new \n     threats, from individual acts of terrorism to hostile \n     coalitions of states. Because America's resources are \n     limited, U.S. foreign policy must be selective in choosing \n     which issues to address seriously. The proper basis for \n     making such judgments is a lean, hierarchical conception of \n     what American national interests are and what they are not. \n     Media attention to foreign affairs reflects access to vivid, \n     compelling images on a screen, without much consideration of \n     the importance of the U.S. interest threatened. Graphic \n     international problems like Bosnia or Kosovo make consuming \n     claims on American foreign policy to the neglect of issues of \n     greater importance, like the rise of Chinese power, the \n     unprecedented risks of nuclear proliferation, the opportunity \n     to increase the openness of the international trading and \n     financial systems, or the future of Mexico.\n       Based on its assessment of specific threats to and \n     opportunities for U.S. national interests in the final years \n     of the century, the Commission has identified six cardinal \n     challenges for the next U.S. president:\n       Strengthen strategic partnerships with Japan and the \n     European allies despite the absence of an overwhelming, \n     immediate threat;\n       Facilitate China's entry onto the world stage without \n     disruption;\n       Prevent loss of control of nuclear weapons and nuclear \n     weapons-usable materials, and contain the proliferation of \n     biological and chemical weapons;\n       Prevent Russia's reversion to authoritarianism or \n     disintegration into chaos;\n       Maintain the United States' singular leadership, military, \n     and intelligence capabilities, and its international \n     credibility; and\n\n[[Page S9783]]\n\n       Marshal unprecedented economic, technological, military, \n     and political advantages to shape a twenty-first century \n     global system that promotes freedom, peace, and prosperity \n     for Americans, our allies, and the world.\n       For each of these challenges, and others, our stated \n     hierarchy of U.S. national interests provides coordinates by \n     which to navigate the uncertain, fast-changing international \n     terrain in the decade ahead.\n\n\n                   summary of u.s. national interests\n\n     Vital\n       Vital national interests are conditions that are strictly \n     necessary to safeguard and enhance Americans' survival and \n     well-being in a free and secure nation.\n       Vital U.S. national interests are to:\n       1.

The distinguished Senator from Alabama is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I have been fascinated and informed by \nthe colloquy that has been ongoing between the Senator from Kansas and \nthe Senator from Georgia. I have been honored to serve on the Armed \nServices Committee with the two of them. I know they take these issues \nseriously, and it is, indeed, appropriate we begin to think through \nclearly what the role of the United States is and what the role of \nCongress is in establishing U.S. policy.\n  I thank them for those observations. They are very valuable. I agree \nwith them that we need to involve the American people in this. The \ngreat American experiment that has guided us so far has allowed the \npeople to rule. We do not need to do it under the table without full \nand open debate.\n  I strongly believe we must not as a nation abdicate our ability to \nact unilaterally when our national interest is at stake, or else why \nhave we invested so greatly to establish this magnificent military? We \ncannot rely on a majority vote of the U.N. We cannot rely on the fact \nthat we may override or avoid a veto in the Security Council. We have \nto be prepared to take care of our own interests. I thank my colleagues \nfor the dialog.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/03/senate-section/article/S9783-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9783-S9785]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ENERGY\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, energy prices are going up; gasoline \nprices are up. I doubt there are many families who do not spend $60 a \nmonth on gasoline. Those who commute, those who have children with \nvehicles, a husband and wife working may have two or three vehicles per \nfamily and not be wealthy. They may be paying $100 a month or more for \ngasoline. If they were paying $60 a month for gasoline 18 months ago, \nthey are now paying over $90 a month. If they were paying $100 a month \nlast year, they are probably paying over $150 a month this year.\n  That is $50 a month or $30 a month, perhaps more in some families, \nwithdrawn from the usable income of that family, money with which they \nno longer can buy shoes, a new set of tires for their car, to go on a \nvacation with their children, take the kids to a ball game, buy shoes \nfor them to play soccer or basketball, baseball, or volley ball. That \nis $50 a month extra of aftertax money that American citizens had 15, \n18 months ago and no longer have today. That is because the price of \nenergy has gone up.\n  In addition, businesses are facing those same increases. I traveled a \ncouple of months ago with a full-time truck driver and his wife. I \ntraveled from north of Birmingham to Clanton to Montgomery and \ndiscussed with them the problems they are facing. They are paying up to \n$800 to $1,000 a month extra to operate their truck. They try to pass \nit on, which increases the costs down the road, but they are not able \nto pass it all on and it is reducing their standard of living. They \nhave, in fact, less money with which to go to the store and buy \nproducts.\n  What does that ultimately mean? It means there are going to be fewer \nwidgets bought, there are going to be fewer shoes bought, there are \ngoing to be fewer new cars bought, fewer new houses bought and many \nother things we would like to purchase. We will not be able to purchase \nthose items because OPEC, through its price-gouging cartel, has fixed \nthe oil and gas prices and driven them up to an extraordinary degree. \nAs a result, it is hurting us. We know this. We know the economy \nappears to have some slowing. We know that profit margins across the \nboard have been shrinking significantly, and we know that higher energy \ncosts are a big reason for that.\n\n  I say that because we are talking about some very big issues. If you \ndo not have money to purchase, let's say you purchase 8 things this \nmonth instead of what you would normally purchase, 10, there is \nsomebody who would have made those other 2 items, somebody who would \nhave sold those other 2 items; they may not be able to continue to do \nthat. What does that do to\n\n[[Page S9784]]\n\nthe producing business? It puts stress on them. It can cool off this \nrobust economy with which we have been blessed for quite a number of \nyears.\n  Kofi Annan, the Secretary General of the U.N., wrote an editorial \nrecently which I was pleased to read. He pointed out how it hurts poor \nnations more than wealthy nations, but it hurts wealthy nations, too. \nWealthy nations are hurt when poor nations do not have money to buy \nproducts from us. We sell all over the world. Whatever cools off the \nentire world economy cools off the American economy and jeopardizes \njobs.\n  What caused us to come to this point? I say with confidence that it \nis the Clinton-Gore policies, primarily Vice President Al Gore's energy \npolicies, that have been involved here. The simple fact is that those \npolicies are driven by and motivated at the deepest level by his \nadoption of a radical, no-growth agenda that is playing in his book. He \nset it out some years ago. People are astounded when they read that \nbook because he is deeply revealing of a philosophy that we ought to \nreduce spending on energy and that will somehow drive up costs and we \nwill use less oil, less gas, we will ride bicycles and use solar cells, \nand that is how we are going to meet our national energy policy.\n  The trouble is that solar cells cost 4, 5, 10 times as much as fossil \nfuels do to produce energy. Who is going to pay for that? Working \nAmericans are going to pay for that while some elite people think it is \na cool idea and for which they are not paying the price. They can \nafford to pay it perhaps. We are into that mood now. This radical \nagenda is demonstrated by the policies that have been carried out \nsystematically since this administration took office.\n  It has been steady, and it has been regular. They have not said our \npolicy is to raise prices. They are too clever for that. They are not \ngoing to allow that spin to get about. What have they done against the \nconsistent opposition of Members in this body who have warned over and \nover that reducing production of American fuels was going to lead us to \na crisis? What have they done? They have opposed drilling in the ANWR \nregion of Alaska which has huge reserves equal to 30 years of the \nproduction in Saudi Arabia. This one little area amounts to the size of \nDulles Airport. It is a very small area with huge reserves. They vetoed \nlegislation that would have allowed us to produce oil and gas to help \nmeet our needs. Over vigorous debate in this Senate and a strong \nmajority vote, it was vetoed by the Clinton-Gore administration.\n  What else? They steadfastly oppose nuclear power. France has gone \nfrom 60 percent of their power nuclear to 80 percent. Industrialized \nnations realize it is the cleanest, safest of all sources of energy \nwith unlimited capacity to produce electricity, with no air pollution--\nvirtually no air pollution, and only a small amount of waste that we \ncan easily store in the Nevada desert. Oh, no, President Clinton and \nVice President Gore vetoed the ability for us to store that waste in \nthe Nevada desert, therefore, helping shut down our nuclear energy. We \nhave not brought on a nuclear plant in over 20 years in this country.\n\n  We are denying ourselves that capacity to produce energy. There are \nhuge reserves of natural gas in the Rocky Mountain areas. Natural gas \nis the cleanest burning of all our fossil fuels. All our electric-\ngenerating plants today are natural gas plants. We are hitting a crisis \nin the production of natural gas. They refuse to allow those Federal \nlands in the Rocky Mountain areas, almost all of it owned by the \nFederal Government, to produce natural gas, which isn't a dangerous \nfuel to produce. It doesn't pour oil all out on the ground; it is an \nevaporative gas. It is safe to produce. Certainly we could do that.\n  They are opposed to drilling offshore. In fact, Vice President Gore, \nduring his campaigning in New Hampshire, promised not only to not \napprove any additional offshore drilling of natural gas but to consider \nrolling back existing leases that have already been issued.\n  How are we going to meet our energy needs for natural gas if we \ncannot produce it? There are many other areas where, through \nregulation, we basically shut off coal as a viable option for expanding \nour energy needs. In fact, even though we are much more efficient than \nwe have ever been with electric energy, we need more. The projections \nare that we will have a substantial increase in demand even though we \nare improving our efficiency steadily. So that is the problem we are \nfacing.\n  The problem is that when OPEC realized our demand was increasing, and \nthe world demand was increasing, and our own domestic production was \ndecreasing 14 percent, while demand was going up 18 to 20 percent, they \nwere able to reduce production, force the price up to exorbitant \nlevels, and make themselves rich. In fact, it was a political decision \nby governmental leaders to force up the price. It was not even a free \nmarket decision. It was a political decision by the leaders of these \noil-producing nations because of our failure to produce energy and \nbecause we have become dependent on their oil. So they have been able \nto demand what they want to in price. Our politicians lost to their \npoliticians. Their politicians beat our politicians.\n  And who is paying the price? The American citizen, when he goes to \nthe gas pump, when he buys his heating oil, when he goes and buys a \nproduct. It is more expensive today to buy that product than it was \nbefore because of increased gasoline prices in the whole production \nsystem. That is what has happened. We have been taken to the cleaners. \nTo me it is as if we put a tax on the gasoline, but instead of taxing \ngasoline 50, 60 cents a gallon extra where the revenue comes to \nWashington so it at least can be spent in the United States, it is, in \neffect, a 50-, 60-cent tax that goes to Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, and \nthe Middle East. The OPEC cartel gets our tax. They are taxing our \nwealth and sending it abroad.\n  This has the capacity to kill the economic growth this Nation has \nbeen experiencing. It has the capacity to drain our wealth to the \ndegree that this economy could slow down. It could even go into \nrecession because we have done nothing to deal with it. We have done \nnothing. The only thing, in the long run, that we can do is to make \nsure we produce what we have.\n  We have virtually unlimited reserves of natural gas and oil in the \nUnited States--certainly for decades to come. There are myths that we \ndo not have enough. We have large reserves. We should have been \nproducing those more effectively. But the policies of this \nadministration have been to reduce our production.\n  And as night follows day, the price is going to go up. It threatens \nnot only the pocketbook of a mother who is trying to now get by--she \nwas paying $100 a month for the family's gasoline; now she is paying \n$150 a month for the family's gasoline. She cannot buy things at the \nstore she used to buy. And the producers of those products are now \ngoing to have to lay off workers because people are not buying those \nproducts at the rate they were previously buying them.\n  This is not an itty-bitty issue. This is a tremendous issue for our \ncountry. I hope it will be discussed tonight in the debate. I hope it \nwill be made a part of this campaign. I believe, with an absolute \nconviction, that if we allow these international greedy producing \nnations to jerk us around, to take money from the average mother and \nfather and working American when they go to the gas pump, having their \nmoney sent to those nations, they can hurt us badly. It hurts a lot of \npeople.\n  I pumped gas a few months ago and washed people's windshields. I \ntalked to them about the costs they were facing. I talked to a young \nlady in her early twenties. She was going to college 3 days a week. The \ncollege she attended was 30 miles up the road. She talked about how \nmuch her gas bill was. She was trying to save money for tuition. Her \ncar was not a new car. She said she would like to have a new car, but \nshe could not afford it. That extra cost was coming out of her pocket.\n  This is a real issue. It hurts our families. They have less money in \ntheir pocket and in the family budget because it has to be spent on \ngasoline. It is hurting businesses. Their profits are down. Home \nbuilding is down.\n  What will happen in the future? I don't know. But if we do not get in \nthis ballgame, if we do not challenge OPEC and figure out a way to \nbreak that cartel, and if we do not increase our own production of \nenergy, we will have\n\n[[Page S9785]]\n\nwhat we have had numerous times before; and that is, a recession driven \nby increased energy costs. What a tragedy that will be. It should not \nhappen.\n  Our projections are and our needs as a nation are to continue this \nprosperity, to continue the surplus we have been able to generate in \nthis Government, and to pay down our debt and to be able to do some \nthings we wish we could have done before. This is a glorious time for \nus.\n  I believe we have to take strong action. I have been frustrated that \nthis administration remains steadfast in blocking, time and again, any \nstep to increase our production of energy. And that has no more \nconsequence but one: When you reduce production, it will drive up \ncosts.\n  I thank the Chair and, again, express my appreciation for his fine \nremarks on national defense.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/03/senate-section/article/S9785-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9785]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 4, 2000\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS.
