Mr. President, recently, I attended the Sixth Conference \nof the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange (COP-6) at The Hague, in the Netherlands. I went to observe \nUndersecretary of State Frank Loy and the rest of the U.S. negotiating \nteam confront the complex issues associated with the requirements of \nthe 1997 Kyoto Protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n  The experience brought into clearer focus for me some disturbing \nthemes that appear to be behind the intense international pressure \nbrought to bear on the United States to reach agreement on some \nprofound economic, social, and environmental issues.\n  At the outset, let me make clear that I did not arrive at The Hague \nwithout first studying the climate issue. For several years now, I have \nclosely followed the progress of the climate change debate.\n  I have sought the input of nationally recognized scientists \ncredentialed in the disciplines of atmospheric, ocean, and computer \nmodeling sciences. I have reviewed scientific reports, most notably the \ndocument entitled Research Pathways for the Next Decade, prepared by \nscientists affiliated with the National Academy of Sciences Board on \nAtmospheric Sciences and Climate.\n  In addition, I have traveled to institutions such as the Woods Hole \nOceanographic Institute in Massachusetts and met with ocean scientists \nwho are very involved in climate research.\n  All of these scientists have, for many years, studied and disagreed \non how much our planet is warming, and whether it was driven by natural \ncauses or by carbon dioxide emissions from industry, and other human \nactivities.\n  Scientists from around the world have had legitimate disagreements on \nhow drastic a problem global warming is likely to be in this century \nand beyond. The debate has been further complicated by politically \nmotivated ``junk science'' predictions of ``imminent'' environmental \ncatastrophes capitalizing on weather events that most scientists agree \nare not linked to current temperature increases.\n  The emotional intensity of this debate cautioned many policymakers \nnot to take sides early. However, as Republican Policy Committee \nChairman, I felt compelled to address the many valid concerns expressed \nabout this issue in a balanced way.\n  This led me to introduce with my colleagues, Senators Murkowski, \nHagel, and others, over a year ago, comprehensive legislation that I \nbelieved, and still believe, provides the framework for some \nresponsible and immediate consensus action on this issue.\n  A few days before leaving for The Hague, I met with the Director of \nthe National Research Council's Board on Atmospheric Sciences and \nClimate, and other scientists on the Board to discuss the status of the \nscientific research on climate change. Prior to that date, the NRC was \nreluctant to agree with earlier summary scientific assessments of the \nUnited Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that \nhumans were contributing to increasing temperatures recorded around the \nglobe--the so-called ``anthropogenic effect.''\n  Indeed, at a Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing \nheld just last Spring, Dr. Joe Friday, testifying on behalf of the NRC \nstated that the ``jury is still out'' on why global temperatures are \nrising. The NRC was clearly unable at that time to state on the record \nthat it had detected clear evidence of an anthropogenic fingerprint on \nthe warming trends of earth's climate.\n  At our meeting a few weeks ago, the NRC scientists were less \npassionate in their refusal to acknowledge the ``anthropogenic \neffect.'' I took from our discussion that day that there was increasing \nevidence that land-use practices and human emissions of greenhouse \ngases were having some contributing effect to the increased land \nsurface temperatures monitored around the globe.\n  To be sure, the scientists did not suggest or imply that temperatures \nwould reach dangerously high levels during the next 50 to 100 years. \nIndeed, the scientists offered their opinion that the rise in \ntemperature would more likely be closer to 1.5 degrees rather than the \n5 to 10 degree high range predicted for later this century by the IPCC.\n  Moreover, the NRC scientists underscored the uncertain nature of the \ncomputer modeling results on which most, if not all, predictions \ndepend. They cautioned against fully embracing any set of predictions \nbecause of the uncertain nature of input data and the ability of \ncomputers to fairly and adequately handle the many variables that are \nincluded in computer programs.\n  They further noted the need for continued technological advancement \nin super computer capability.\n  What was clear to me after that meeting was that the issue of human \ncontributions to increasing temperatures was reaching some consensus \nwithin the National Academy of Sciences.\n\n[[Page S11767]]\n\n  However, it was also clear to me from my discussions with those \nscientists that many other important scientific issues concerning the \nextent of the human contribution to warming trends, the extent to which \nthe earth will continue to warm, and perhaps, most important, the \nextent to which mankind can take actions that will effectively stop or \nslow climate change are far from settled and will likely take years to \ndetermine.\n  Indeed, the consensus that is forming among scientists working on \nthis issue for the National Research Council is that we need a plan to \nfocus more on climate change ``adaptation'' rather than climate change \n``mitigation.'' This thinking would have been considered radical a \nlittle over a year ago and today still may be anathema to many in the \nenvironmental community. Yet, a July, 2000, Atlantic Monthly article \nentitled ``Breaking the Global Warming Gridlock'' by Daniel Sarewitz \nand Roger Pielke, Jr. boldly and intelligently addresses this issue and \npersuasively makes the case for new thinking on what many of us would \nagree is one of the most important issues for this new century.\n\n  Instead of discussions at The Hague centering on ways to reach \nconsensus on actions that would reduce vulnerability to climate change \nsuch as encouraging democracy, raising standards of living, and \nimproving environmental quality in the developing world through the use \nof innovative American and other industrialized countries technology, \nmany discussions were consumed by scathing anti-American rhetoric.\n  Some non-governmental environmental organizations and some European \nEnvironmental Ministers were criticizing the United States for not \nwanting to surrender some of its sovereignty by allowing other nations \nto police American fuel use and economic expansion strategies.\n  Many in the developing world were brazenly demanding billions of \ndollars in ``pay-offs'' for the perceived harm that climate change--in \ntheir opinion, brought about by American greed--was causing developing \ncountries. Astonishingly, all of this pay-off money would be in \naddition to the large sums currently being sent to developing countries \nthrough AID and many other American taxpayer programs designed to help \ndeveloping nations reach better standards of living.\n  The motives of America's strongest critics at The Hague Climate \nConference appeared to be nothing more than transparent efforts to have \nwholesale redistribution of wealth to the developing world and to \nmaneuver our competitors in the global market place into stronger \ncompetitive positions.\n  Many in the non-governmental environmental community appeared to be \nmore interested in promoting non-growth and anti-population agendas \nthan taking actions that would offer the best prospects to reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions or helping vulnerable nations adapt to \ncapricious climate variations.\n  I believe America will responsibly move forward in addressing the \nclimate change issue whether or not Kyoto is ever ratified by the \nSenate. We should not, and the Senate will not allow the international \ncommunity or powerful non-governmental environmental organizations to \nforce our nation to accept a deal that will be economically threatening \nor scientifically ineffective.\n  Secretary Loy and his negotiating team at COP-6 should be commended \nfor their hard work and steadfastness in demanding from the \ninternational community solid proposals that fully recognize both \nAmerica's determination to defend its sovereignty and its unmatched \nability through its technological prowess to help the world deal with \nany potential calamities as a consequence of climate change.\n  Moreover, the United States won key concessions from international \nnegotiators at Kyoto that now appear to be at serious risk. Indeed, \nEuropean negotiators at The Hague, with strong pressure from some non-\ngovernmental environmental organizations, made aggressive attempts to \nrescind those concessions.\n  The flexible mechanisms provision and the sinks provision were \nelements of the Protocol that were prominently displayed to Congress by \nthe Clinton/Gore Administration when Congressional Oversight Committees \nquestioned the costs associated with the Protocol. Each time the \nAdministration responded to such queries, the Administration would \npoint to the carbon sink and flexible mechanism provisions to \nrationalize its assessment that compliance with the Protocol would be \ninexpensive.\n  Clearly, without those provisions, the Protocol's cost will be \nprohibitive and violate one of the critical tenets of Senate Resolution \n98--the Byrd/Hagel Resolution--which passed the Senate 95-0 in 1997.\n  I can only hope that the current Administration will do nothing to \ncompromise these principles in the coming weeks. To do so would be \nirresponsible and unproductive. Clearly, it would be politically \nineffective inasmuch as the Senate would not ratify such agreement.\n  Meanwhile, as scientists continue to research, discover, and even \ndisagree on the causes and effects of global warming, I will continue \nto work with my colleagues in Congress to aggressively establish a \nsystem of incentives that reduce the environmental impacts of human \nactivity, while preserving the freedoms and quality of life that make \nthe United States the greatest Nation on Earth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/14/senate-section/article/S11767-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11767-S11768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             BIPARTISANSHIP\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I was of course very disappointed in the \ndecision of the U.S. Supreme Court. I sat and listened to that \nargument. I think both lawyers Olson and Boies did an outstanding job. \nI was disappointed in the 5-4 decision. I think it was as a result of \nthe Supreme Court's decision that the vote did not go forward in the \nfirst place.\n  Having said that, I am an attorney. I have always believed we are a \nnation of laws and not of men. I said prior to the decision being \nrendered by the Supreme Court I would follow that decision; that I may \nnot like it, but I would do whatever I could to make sure it was \naccepted.\n  I think during this entire process we as a nation should be very \nproud. I repeat, I didn't like the way the election turned out. We have \na man, Vice President Gore, who won the national vote, a vote of the \npublic, by 250,000 votes over his opponent. If there had ever been a \ncount in Florida, he would have won that. But this country is a great \ncountry. Even though Al Gore won the election, he will not take office. \nThis country is amazing. In spite of that, there was not a single \narrest during any of these very bitter discussions regarding the vote. \nThere was not a single injury that I know of. It is something that is \npart of history. I am going to do everything I can to make sure that \nGeorge W. Bush's Presidency is as good as it can be.\n  I know he comes from a good family. I served in the Congress during \nthe tenure of his father. I liked his dad very much. He wrote me a \nnumber of personal letters on things that I did that he thought were \ngood. I have those letters and I treasure those letters. I was the \nfirst Democrat to speak openly for our incursions into Iraq. I think \nPresident Bush did the right thing. In short, I think George W. Bush \nhas the ability to be a good President. I am going to do everything I \ncan, as I said, to support President-elect Bush.\n  I think we have to recognize that what took place last night was \nmagnificent. Vice President Gore's speech was magnanimous, gracious. As \nwe indicated, he got more popular votes than even Ronald Reagan. Then \nthat was followed by a speech by President-elect Bush which was \noutstanding. I think the tone of his speech was good. I think the \nissues he talked about were issues we have talked about for some time \nhere on the Senate floor.\n  President-elect Bush is going to get all the advice and counsel he \nneeds, I am sure, and he does not need mine. I am confident that today \nhe is being briefed and briefed and briefed and told opinions of what \npeople think he should do. But, in spite of that, my advice to the \nPresident-elect is, if he wants to be bipartisan in action rather than \njust words, the first thing he should do is recognize we have a House \nof Representatives which is almost evenly divided. He has to recognize \nthat we have a Senate that is evenly divided. We have 50 Democrats; we \nhave 50 Republicans. Either by math\n\n[[Page S11768]]\n\nthat is taught at MIT or the so-called fuzzy math talked about during \nthe campaign, 50 and 50 are equal.\n  As a result of that, I recommend the President-elect interject \nhimself into what is going on here in the legislative branch of the \nGovernment. I think what he should do is say 50-50 is equal. I think \nthe Republicans should go along with the Democrats to have committees \nthat are even--that is, the same number of Democrats on the committee \nas Republicans. There should be equal funding. There should be equal \nstaffing. I think he should take a look at the committee chairmanship \nstructure. I think it would be a significant step if President-elect \nBush stepped forward and looked at what the future holds.\n\n  The future holds that, for example, if the Budget Committee is 10-\n10--one of the first things we are required by law to do is come \nforward with the budget--if the committee is 10-10, anything that comes \nbefore this Senate will be bipartisan in nature and I think will be \napproved quickly. It would be the same on other committees. I think one \nthing the American people have said is that we should work in a \nbipartisan basis, 50-50 in the Senate, 50-50, approximately, in the \nHouse.\n  We have a President who was elected with fewer votes than the his \nopponent. I just think this is a time that calls for bipartisanship. I \nthink we can do that. But I think it would set a very bad tone if the \nRepublicans, some of whom are in denial that the Senate is 50-50, would \nprevent the Senate from going forward by saying we are not going to \ngive you equality on the committees. If that happens, it is not the \nDemocrats who are holding up action in the Senate, it is the \nRepublicans--the Republicans who we no longer refer to as the majority \nbecause they are not the majority. It is the Republicans who will be \nholding up this Congress and this country from moving forward.\n  I also think it appropriate that President Bush follow the example we \nhave in the Cabinet today with Secretary Cohen. Secretary Cohen is a \nbona fide, card-carrying Republican from the State of Maine who did an \noutstanding job and is doing an outstanding job during his tenure as \nSecretary of Defense. I hope President-elect Bush will also look to \npeople of the other party, the Democratic Party, to fill spots in his \nCabinet. I am confident he will do that.\n  Again, I feel so good today about our country. We should all feel \ngood about our country. In spite of the closeness of the election, in \nspite of the more than 1 month since the election took place, we have \ntwo men who stepped forward last night; they stepped forward with \ncompassion, stepped forward with confidence--confidence at the \ngreatness of this country.\n  I have been through statewide recounts, two of them, one of which I \nlost by 524 votes; one of which I won by 428 votes. I know what close \nelections are all about. I know how difficult recounts are. I was very \nproud of both men and their families for what they put up with and how \nthey ended the election process last night. It speaks well of them and \nof our country.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, everyone has been focused on the \nPresidential election. It has been one of the most drawn out \nPresidential elections in U.S. history. Another election came to \nconclusion recently, and that was the Senate race in the State of \nWashington, one of the closest Senate races in many years. It took \nweeks to discern.\n  Our friend and colleague, Senator Slade Gorton, was defeated. I want \nto make a couple comments concerning our colleague, Senator Gorton.\n  I had hoped he would not lose this race because he is a friend of \nmine and, in my opinion, he is one of the most outstanding Senators we \nhave had.\n  By way of a little history, I was elected with Senator Gorton in \n1980. Both of us were freshman Senators. He was formerly an attorney \ngeneral. He gained some attention nationwide in that he and his family \nbicycled all the way across our country. It shows they are a close \nfamily and individuals with endurance and athletic talent.\n  He is an outstanding Senator. He lost reelection in 1986, \nunfortunately. A lot of people lost. It was a tough year. That was \ncertainly one of the toughest losses we had. I remember stating at that \ntime when Senator Gorton lost that he was a Senator's Senator. I hated \nto see him lose that race. He showed great endurance and came back in \n1988 and won and also won reelection in 1994. As I mentioned, he was \njust defeated in a very close race in 2000.\n  Senator Gorton has served 18 years in the Senate. In his last two \nconsecutive terms, he was chairman of the Interior Appropriations \nSubcommittee and worked on a couple of different Appropriations \nsubcommittees. He did an outstanding job with the Interior \nAppropriations Subcommittee which has enormous responsibility. He \nhandled that with great skill and in a bipartisan way.\n\n  People ask: Can the Senate function? Can we work in a bipartisan \nmanner? I look at Senator Gorton and his leadership on the Interior \nSubcommittee, working with Senator Byrd and Senator Reid. He has proven \nit can happen and has shown how it can happen and should happen.\n  He is an outstanding Senator. He has handled his defeat with great \nclass. There was a recount, and he congratulated Maria Cantwell as the \nvictor. We are proud to call him our colleague and our friend. \nCertainly he will be missed in this body; certainly his leadership will \nbe missed in the State of Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/14/senate-section/article/S11768-2", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SENATOR BOB KERREY\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, Senator Bob Kerrey from Nebraska, as most \npeople know, was a former Governor of Nebraska. He has completed two \nterms in the Senate. I, for one, hate to see him leave the Senate. I \nhave had the pleasure of working with Senator Kerrey on the Finance \nCommittee. He has shown great courage.\n  He is a person who has been willing to talk about difficult issues: \nCurbing the growth of entitlements, Medicare, and Medicaid. He worked \non the commission that was also chaired, I think, by Senators Breaux, \nFrist, and Thomas, and was an outstanding member in saying: Let's make \nsome of the tough choices; let's make some of those tough choices now.\n  He is a person who has been willing to reach out and work in a \nbipartisan fashion, such as on personal savings accounts for Social \nSecurity, reforming Social Security.\n  He has courage. He has conviction. He has shown it time and time \nagain with his service in the Senate, with his activities in the Senate \nand outside the Senate.\n  Everyone knows he is a Medal of Honor winner. I think of him as a \ncompetitor, as a friend, as a colleague. Some of us jog on occasion. \nSenator Kerrey jogs and jogs quite well. That is very inspirational \nbecause he also has an artificial leg.\n  He has a great personality. I think he has made a great contribution \nto the Senate. He has helped improve the quality of the Senate, and \ncertainly he will be missed. I think he has announced he is going to be \na university president. That will be very much to the gain of that \nuniversity. He will be sorely missed in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to take just a few minutes to \ncomment on one of our friends who is leaving the Senate.\n  We all, of course, feel strongly about the changes that take place in \nthis\n\n[[Page S11769]]\n\nbody and the people with whom we work closely, and even those with whom \nwe do not work closely, and certainly appreciate all the things they \nhave done while they have been here. Frankly, it is always a sad thing \nto have people with whom you work leave.\n  Of course, all Members have an impact in this body. All Members leave \nan imprint here and certainly in the areas they represent. Each of us \nhas different ideas. That is the basis for our system. We bring those \nideas here and seek to implement them, to the extent we can, by working \nwith others to cause them to be implemented. We have disagreements, as \nwe properly should have, and then we come to some decisions.\n  So I want to comment for a moment about my good friend Rod Grams who \nhas well represented the State of Minnesota in the Senate for 6 years \nduring the same period I have been here. He served in the House prior \nto that, during the same time I was there.\n  I think Rod has been one of the real good guys in terms of his \ndedication to doing the things he thought were best for the country, \nthings he believed were best for the people of Minnesota. He has been a \ngreat legislator and an important friend to many of us.\n  As I mentioned, Rod Grams was elected to the House in 1992. He served \nthere for one term and then was elected to the Senate in 1994. I \ncertainly have benefited from our association ever since. Rod is a \nproud conservative.\n  Rod is one who is dedicated to the notion that there ought to be \nbudget relief. He is dedicated to the notion that there ought to be \nSocial Security reform. He is a champion of the $500-per-child tax \ncredit and is the author of many successful tax measures. I think he \nhas made a real contribution to the direction we have taken.\n  Above all, however, I think that idea of having a philosophy, \nbelieving in some things that are good, and working for those things, \nbut working for them in a way where others can also work on them with \nyou, is really the greatest contribution any of us can make. I feel \nsure this institution will be poorer in the future because he is not \nhere. But he will continue to contribute to our country.\n  One of his legacies has been his determination; one of his legacies \nhas been getting results. That is really what it is all about--to cause \nthings to happen, to have legitimate debates and concerns about \nimportant issues.\n  I think Rod will be sorely missed in the Senate, not only as a friend \nbut as a driven legislator who has been a critical party to this idea \nof less government and more personal freedoms, which is a very \nimportant thing to most everyone.\n  He will continue, of course, to make contributions to our country. \nPrior to coming here, he worked in the media through TV and newspapers. \nI suspect we will hear much more from him.\n  I will not go on further, but I simply want to say I wish Rod great \nluck in whatever he does. I thank him for what he has done here. I just \nwanted to at least briefly recognize the contributions that have been \nmade by Senator Rod Grams to this institution and to this country.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/14/senate-section/article/S11769-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11769]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the American people last evening heard a \nconcession speech by Vice President Gore and a speech by Gov. George W. \nBush, who is now the President-elect.\n  I supported Vice President Gore. I wish the result had been different \nin this election. But we have a process for contesting elections, and \nthat process was finalized by the actions of the U.S. Supreme Court. I \naccept those actions, and we now have a new President-elect.\n  We went through some difficult times after the election day, and \nthose times inflamed the passions of many Americans. The fact is, the \nAmerican people created almost a dead even tie in casting votes for the \nPresidency. It wasn't just the Presidency. It was a 50-50 split in the \nmembership of the Senate, and nearly a 50-50 split in the House, and as \nI indicated, a near tie vote for the Presidency. That is not likely to \nhappen again in our lifetime. It is not unusual for the person on the \nlosing end to want to make certain that all the votes are counted and \ncounted correctly. So that is why we went through that process.\n  I know many passions were inflamed as a result of it. In fact, some \nof my colleagues--not so much in this body but in the other body--were \nusing words such as ``stealing elections,'' and so on. I regret that \nthose words were used. I don't think it contributes to what we ought to \nbe doing. That is all gone and done.\n  As of last evening, we have a President-elect who addressed this \ncountry, and we have a Vice President who conceded that election.\n  Despite the fact that Congress is divided almost evenly between the \nRepublicans and Democrats, all of us wish the new President-elect well.\n  It will behoove all of us to work together and extend ourselves to \neach other and try to create some unity, and move forward on things on \nwhich we can agree. There will still be policy differences, I might \nsay, and we should aggressively debate them. But I think the American \npeople want us to try to work together to find areas of bipartisanship, \nand we will do that. I, for one, am interested in seeing us make the \nprogress on important issues for our country.\n  Let me make this comment as well. We not only will now have a new \nPresident. This new President inherits an economy that is going through \nsome changes, some subtle and some not so subtle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/14/senate-section/article/S11769-2", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11769-S11771]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     INTEREST RATES AND THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Federal Reserve Board meets on Tuesday \nof next week. The Federal Reserve Board has increased interest rates \nsix times since June 1999 in search of inflation. They are terribly \nafraid that there is inflation either under the bed, or in the closet, \nor just around the corner, out in the garage, near the driveway, or \nsomewhere inflation exists. Of course, all the evidence suggests that \nthe core rate of inflation is very low--well within moderate levels. In \nfact, the Producer Price Index released this morning suggests that the \ncore rate did not increase at all in November. The Consumer Price Index \nwill be released tomorrow, and I suspect it will show something very \nsimilar.\n  Next week when the Federal Reserve Board meets, in my judgment, it \nwill behoove them to reduce the additional tax on money they have \nimposed with six increases in the Federal funds rate.\n  Let me describe why I think we ought to do that. This economy is \nslowing. After unprecedented economic growth in this country, this \neconomy is slowing. The evidence is all around us.\n  Manufacturing activity for the fourth straight month ending in \nNovember has declined. The National Association of Purchasing \nManagement recently reported that its purchasing index had dropped to \n47.7 percent from 48.3 percent.\n  Auto makers are idling plants. The real output of cars and trucks \nfell by some 20 percent over the second and third quarters. Car and \nlight truck sales have fallen for the past 6 months with the largest \ndrop in over 2 years in November.\n  The number of manufacturing jobs declined by 220,000 in the last 4 \nmonths. Factory orders are falling.\n  Factory orders plummeted 3.3 percent in October in its weakest \nshowing in 3 months.\n  Housing starts and sales are off. Retail sales are well off. \nYesterday, the Commerce Department reported retail sales fell by an \nunexpected 0.4 percent in November.\n  I will not go on at great length. But the evidence is all around us. \nThis economy is slowing.\n  The Federal Reserve Board says it wants to slow the economy. The \ndebate now is what kind of landing will occur--a ``soft'' or a ``hard'' \nlanding, in the lexicon or jargon of economists. Nobody knows.\n  I taught economics in college briefly, and I have said I overcame \nthat experience. The fact is that economists don't know what is going \nto happen in the future. The field of economics, as I have said \npreviously, is nothing more than psychology pumped up with a little \nhelium. They tell us what they think is going to happen in the future.\n  Prior to the last recession, 35 out of 40 leading economists in this \ncountry predicted that next year would be a\n\n[[Page S11770]]\n\nyear of continued economic growth. That is what the field of economics \nproduces.\n  What is going to happen in the future? I worry that this slowdown \ncould very easily move this country into a recession. We have to be \ncareful about that.\n  The Federal funds rate that the Fed has established is too high. It \nresults in a prime interest rate that is too high. It results in higher \ninterest rates paid by every American on their consumer debt, and on \ntheir real estate debt, and so on. That is higher than it should be. As \na result of the Fed's six interest rate increases, the average \nhousehold in this country pays about $1,700 a year more in interest \ncharges. If we were going to have a tax on the American people, we \nwould have great debate about it. This is a tax on money, and it is has \nrequired an average household to pay $1,700 a year more in interest \ncharges.\n  There is no debate on that. It is done behind the closed doors down \nat the Fed. They have their wish. The economy is slowing down.\n  The question is, Will they have the sense next week to decide to \nreverse course and understand two things? One, there isn't any real \ninflation problem; and, two, they are overcharging for money, and they \nought to begin reducing short-term interest rates because they have \nincreased them too much.\n  These are the folks who go behind closed doors and make these \ndecisions. There is no public discussion or debate here.\n  Here are the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and the presidents of \nthe regional Federal Reserve banks. They serve on a rotating basis as \npart of the Open Market Committee and as part of the decisionmaking \ndown at the Fed.\n  Next Tuesday they will close the door. The American public isn't \nallowed in. They will make decisions about what kind of tax we will \nhave on money. Six interest rate increases have been ordered by these \nfolks over the last year and a half. They have slowed down the American \neconomy.\n  Looking at housing starts, autos, and retail sales across the board \nin economic activity, in my judgment, they are tinkering with the \nnotion of allowing this country to experience the beginning of a \nrecession. That would be most unfortunate.\n  I want people to understand. Here are the names of the folks who are \nthere. Here is their education, background, and their salaries.\n  I think it is important for us to understand who is making public \npolicy behind locked doors. Next Tuesday, when they talk about monetary \npolicy, I think the American people ought to understand that the \nquestion of the interest rates and the amount of interest they pay on \ntheir credit cards, home equity loans and so on depend on what these \nfolks are doing with respect to the Federal funds rate. It is very \nimportant.\n  I worry very much that this economy may well head towards a recession \nunless we do something to reverse the course that the Fed has taken.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Of course, I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from North Dakota has been such a leader on \nthis issue dealing with the Federal Reserve. In fact, the Senator will \nrecall that the Senator from North Dakota and the Senator from Nevada \nordered a study of the Federal Reserve. We found, among other things, \nthat they have a slush fund of over $3 billion. It has been there for \n70 years, or thereabouts. They never use it.\n  I ask the Senator from North Dakota: Wouldn't it seem logical, as we \nare trying to do all of these things in the last few minutes of this \nsession, if that money were to be used to help farmers, or help with \nsome of the problems created by forest fires in the West? Wouldn't that \nbe a better place to use that money than to use it for the so-called \nrainy day fund? We have never had a rainy day in the Federal Reserve.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I agree with that. One could find important uses for it, \nor perhaps give it back to the taxpayers. But this is a circumstance \nwhere the Federal Reserve Board, according to the GAO investigation \nthat was done, has a rainy day fund. Can you imagine having a rainy day \nfund in a climate where it never rains? The Federal Reserve Board can \nnever lose money. It will never lose money, and has never lost money. \nThey accumulated a rainy day fund of some $3.7 billion. It is more now.\n  Here you have this last dinosaur on America's hill--the Federal \nReserve Board--that operates in secret behind closed doors that creates \nits own rainy day fund. The GAO says they don't need it. They shouldn't \nhave it. It ought to be given back.\n  Guess what. A couple of years after that study was complete, has that \nrainy day fund been divested by the Fed, and given back to the \ntaxpayers? The answer is no. Of course not. Why? Because this Congress \nusually won't touch the Fed with a 10-foot pole.\n  There is this language about monetary policy that prevents almost \nanybody from even talking about it. That is one of the reasons I wanted \nto talk today about what happens next Tuesday.\n  Our economy, in my judgment, is in some difficulty. It has gone down \ndramatically. We have a new President who will be sworn into office, \nand may well inherit an economy that is slowing down, and could even be \nheading towards a recession, at least in part, because the Fed has \ndecided they want to slow down the economy. Six times they increased \ninterest rates; they create a new tax on money, impose a new burden on \nevery American family, and nobody thinks much about it.\n\n  It is time to turn that around. The prime interest rate is too high \nby at least two percentage points, and as a result, all other interest \nrates in this country are too high. Why? Because the Fed has pegged the \nprice of money at an artificially high rate because they want to slow \nthe economy down. The fact is they run the risk of pushing this economy \noff the track of unprecedented long-term economic growth and into the \nditch of a slowdown into a potential recession and increased Federal \ndeficits.\n  I hope the Fed will think long and hard next Tuesday about this \nsubject and decide it is time to begin reducing interest rates \nfollowing the six rate increases they have imposed on the American \npeople.\n  I will speak more about this. My expectation is we will probably \nfinish this session this week, so I will not speak on the floor of the \nSenate next week. But before the Fed meets on Tuesday, I want to give \nmore advice on Monday. They seldom take my advice, but I think they \nwould be wise, if they want to ignore my advice, to at least listen to \nsome of the good economic thinkers around this country who worry a \ngreat deal that what is happening to our economy is it is slowing and \nthreatening to head into a very difficult period. Now is the time, not \nlater, to do something.\n  The Fed talks about preemptive strikes against inflation. My friends, \nthere is no inflation at this point. All the evidence suggests \ninflation is well under control. What about a preemptive strike by the \nFederal Reserve Board preventing the economy from heading toward a \nrecession? That would make sense next Tuesday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I applaud and congratulate the Senator from \nNorth Dakota. With this election having taken more than 30 days, and \nthe stock market, as a result of the turmoil of the election, having \ndropped significantly, there is a lot of uneasiness in the economy.\n  I hope the people who are cloistered in the Federal Reserve, hidden \naway from public view, have the opportunity to listen to what the \nSenator from North Dakota said. It is so important the people of the \nState of Nevada and this country be given a break at the beginning of \nthe year on interest rates. Construction is being hurt. Everything we \ndo is affected by the interest rates which as the Senator so \ngraphically illustrated, dictate our lives. I hope the Federal Reserve \nwould follow what the Senator from North Dakota has said. The Senator \nfrom North Dakota has had long experience working on financial matters, \nincluding the Ways and Means Committee in the House of Representatives, \nand in the Senate as head of the Policy Committee, and has given great \ndirection on fiscal matters.\n  I yield for a question.\n\n[[Page S11771]]\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I know that the Federal Reserve Board \nreads everything. They are voracious readers of the economists who \ngather this information, provide it to the Fed, and assimilate it and \nmake judgments.\n  Let me give a factoid for their consideration. I have no idea what it \nmeans. The Oscar Meyer Weinermobile, one of the vehicles that runs \naround the country, had an opening for a driver in the newspaper the \nother day. They were placing a help-wanted ad for a driver for the \nOscar Meyer Weinermobile. They got 800 college graduates applying. I \nhave no idea what that means.\n  It just occurred to me as the Fed looks at information about the \neconomy, they might look at interesting things about this economy: \nWhere it is headed, what is happening, who is employed, who isn't, and \nwhat might happen, 3, 6, and 12 months from now, and don't relent on \ninterest rates and steer us back toward a longer term economic growth \nprospect.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, I am sure of one thing it does mean \nregarding the statistic regarding the car that looks like a hot dog: \nThe fact that there are a lot of people with a college education who \ncan't find work.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New Mexico. I \nthank him for his customary graciousness. As I think about this year \nand look across the map of the United States and look at the results in \nthe various States, I have even greater love and affection for New \nMexico than I did before the year began.\n  Mr. President, have you noticed that many things in politics and \ngovernment seem to be taking longer than usual this year? It is \nDecember 14 and the 106th Congress is surprisingly still in session. \nBut happily that allows me to come to the Senate chamber--this great \nAmerican forum, which I love and respect so much--and reflect on the \nextraordinary opportunity Vice President Al Gore gave me to be his \nrunning mate this year.\n  When I accepted the Vice-Presidential nomination at the Democratic \nConvention in Los Angeles in August, I began by asking: ``Is America a \ngreat country or what?''\n  Last night, we ended that remarkable journey in a disappointing way. \nNevertheless, I want to answer my question this morning by declaring: \n``Yes, America is a great country!''\n  Let me offer to my colleagues a few reasons why I feel this way \ntoday. In selecting me, a Jewish American, to be his running mate, Vice \nPresident Gore did what no presidential candidate before him had done. \nThat required personal courage and confidence in the American people. \nToday we can look back and say that the Vice President's confidence was \ntotally justified.\n  The fact is that while my faith was the focus of the earliest \nreactions to my candidacy, it was not even mentioned at the end of the \ncampaign. That is the way we all hoped it would be. And that is good \nnews for all Americans--a fulfillment of the promise that America makes \nto its citizens that in this country no matter who you are or where you \nstart, you should be able to go as far as your God-given talents and \nindividual determination will take you.\n  The absence of bigotry in this campaign and the fact that the Vice \nPresident and I received the second highest number of votes in history \nof American national elections should encourage every parent in this \ncountry to dream the biggest dreams for each and every one of their \nchildren.\n  Anything is possible for anyone in America.\n  In the five weeks since election day--because this turned out to be \nthe closest election in American history--our nation's greatness was \ntested in a different way. But I am confident that in the end our \nelection process can only be made stronger by this experience.\n  For one thing, it opened our eyes to some long-overlooked problems \nwith our system of voting, to the disparities in technologies and \npractices that may be stopping large numbers of voters from having \ntheir votes counted and that in particular may be undermining the \nelectoral rights of many poor and minority citizens. These problems \ncall out for investigation and reform.\n  Whether you are happy or sad with the results of the 2000 election, I \ndo think every one of us should be grateful this morning that here in \nAmerica, we work out our differences not with civil wars but with \nspirited elections. We resolve our disputes not through acts of \nviolence but through the rule of law. And we preserve and protect our \nsystem of justice best when we accept its judgments that we disagree \nwith most.\n  This election is over. I congratulate Governor Bush and Secretary \nCheney and wish them well. Mr. President, I had the opportunity to do \nthat personally in a very cordial conversation this morning with the \nVice President-elect, Secretary Dick Cheney.\n  As Vice President Gore said eloquently last night, it is time now for \nall of us to come together in support of these United States and the \nshared values that have long sustained us. Governor Bush and Secretary \nCheney are in my prayers, and I know they are in the prayers of all \nAmericans, as they begin now to assume the awesome responsibilities \nthat go with leadership of this great country.\n  In the strong words and soft voices they both used last night, Vice \nPresident Gore and Governor Bush raised us all up and pointed America \ntoward the reconciliation that our history expects and that our \nnational interests now require.\n  As they both noted last night, this was the closest election we have \never experienced, with the vote for President essentially ending in a \ntie, the Senate split 50-50 and the House nearly even as well. That \nputs a special burden, not just on Governor Bush but on all of us in \nCongress to work on a bipartisan basis and in a cooperative spirit. As \nI have in the past, I fully intend to work with my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle and with President-elect Bush to find that \nconstructive consensus without which we will not help the American \npeople realize their potential.\n  For my family and me, this campaign has been a thrilling and joyful \nexperience. It has deepened the appreciation we have for the goodness \nof the American people and the love and loyalty we feel for this \ncountry. We could not have asked for a more warm, open, and accepting \nreception as we traveled around this blessed land. We could not have \nbeen more impressed with the common sense and strong values that unite \nour very diverse citizenry. From their Government, it became clear to \nme over and over again, most of them, most of the American people, want \nonly a little help every now and then as they work so hard to make \ntheir lives better. That is exactly what we, together, should do for \nthem.\n  The most powerful emotion that I feel on this morning after is \ngratitude. I am grateful to be an American, proud to be an American; \ngrateful to my wife Hadassah--my love and my partner--for the devoted \nsupport she gave me and the extraordinary way she reached out to \neveryone she met in this campaign; grateful to our dear children and \nmothers and sisters and brothers and relatives and friends whose help \nand love sustained us; grateful to Tipper and the Gore children for \nbeing such genuine and such generous friends, and\n\n[[Page S11772]]\n\nfor the skill and grace with which they conducted themselves in this \ncampaign; grateful to the Gore-Lieberman campaign staff, whose \nidealism, ability, and hard work make me optimistic about America's \nfuture; grateful to my Senate staff here in Washington and back home in \nHartford--they have served with me on behalf of the people of \nConnecticut for so many years, and continue to do so with such \ncommitment during this eventful and unusual year--grateful to the \npeople of Connecticut whose support over the past 30 years has put me \nin a position where Al Gore could give me the extraordinary opportunity \nhe did this year; and grateful to the people of Connecticut without \nwhose backing this year I would not now have the privilege of looking \nforward to 6 more years of service to them and with you, my colleagues, \nas a United States Senator.\n  My greatest gratitude is to Vice President Gore himself. He has been \nmy friend and colleague for 15 years now, but I have never been prouder \nof him than I was this year, and than I was last night. He conducted \nthe campaign with dignity. He presented his policies and programs with \nconviction. He spoke with a precision that showed respect for the \nAmerican people. He stuck to the record, and he worked hard, very hard. \nAl Gore ran this campaign as he lives his life: with honor, \nintelligence, and devotion.\n  Today, the Vice President can look back on 24 years of public service \nwith great pride in his accomplishments, and he can look forward to the \nyears ahead with great excitement about the unlimited opportunities \nthat await him. I wish him Godspeed, and I look forward to his \ncontinued friendship. The Vice President knows, as I do on this \nmorning, that Psalm 30 assures us that weeping may linger for the night \nbut in the morning there are shouts of joy.\n\n  So, today, as some of us weep for what could have been, we look to \nthe future with faith that on another morning joy will surely come.\n  I thank my colleagues in the Senate from both parties for their warm \npersonal wishes and support during the last 5 months. I look forward, \nnow, to returning to this Chamber in January and working with all of \nyou to help improve the lives of the American people and to help \nelevate their respect for the institutions of our great democracy.\n  Mr. President, I again thank my friend and colleague from New Mexico \nfor yielding me the time, I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are all very proud of the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I believe under the unanimous-consent agreement I am to \nspeak next, but I note the presence of the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee who would like to speak. I yield to him, and I \nask I follow him this morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard).

Mr. President, I am grateful to my friend from New \nMexico. I am here once again to talk about the last controversial \namendment in the appropriations bills for the fiscal year 2001. We have \ncompleted all work on these bills now except for one amendment and that \nis the amendment that pertains to the Steller sea lions. I am here \nbecause there seems to still be a misunderstanding about what we are \ntrying to do. The Congress has passed and the President has signed, as \na matter of fact, an extension of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, the act \nthat deals with the 200-mile limit off our shores. That act in its \noriginal form created the North Pacific Fisheries Council that has \njurisdiction under the law for the management plans that apply to \nfisheries off the shores of my State of Alaska.\n  In its recent action in issuing a biological opinion under the \nEndangered Species Act, the Department of Commerce saw fit to use the \nemergency portions of the Magnuson Act to issue a management plan for \npollack and for cod off the State of Alaska within what they call the \nRPAs, the reasonable prudent alternative areas, dealing with the \ndecline of the Steller sea lion.\n  There is no emergency provision in the Endangered Species Act. Under \nthe Magnuson Act, management plans are issued by the regional councils, \nnot by the Department of Commerce. There is an emergency clause, if the \nSecretary makes findings of problems with the fishery, that could \njustify the Secretary issuing a plan or a revision of the existing \nplan. That was not done. Instead, the Department of Commerce saw fit to \nuse the emergency clause of the Magnuson Act to once again seize total \ncontrol of the pollack and the cod fisheries off our shores within \nthe so-called RPAs. They amount to an area of 20 miles around every sea \nlion rookery. It is an area that extends from Kodiak, all the way out \nalong the Aleutian chain.\n\n  The National Marine Fisheries Service has told us there is no data to \nsupport the concept that there is a connection between the decline of \nthe sea lion and the harvest of pollack. There is no cause and effect \nrelationship scientifically that exists with regard to this decline. We \nare appalled by the decline of sea lions off our shores. We also know \nthat sea otters are steadily disappearing, as are fur seals and harbor \nseals. We believe the reason is the tremendous increase in the killer \nwhales. That is another subject.\n  Very clearly, what the Department has done now is to increase the \ndanger for fishermen who live in Alaska and fish in the areas off our \nshores. That fishing currently has the highest level of deaths per \ncapita of any industry in the United States. What this order has done, \nnow, is it has foreclosed the fishing by these small boats in the areas \nwhere the pollack is located except during the wintertime. This is a \nparticularly dangerous area. Winter storms increase the problems of \nfishing. What is more, if they follow the order and go beyond the 20 \nmiles, the further from shore they go on these small boats, even a \nminor injury becomes a life threatening injury, particularly in the \nstormy season. I have to report to the Senate that the Coast Guard \nvoted against following this biological opinion last Saturday, in my \nState, for safety reasons.\n  What the administration has done is they have restarted the race for \nthe fish. They have made it almost impossible for the enforcement of \nthis biological opinion. They have not consulted with the people who \nreally know the industry as they have issued this opinion. This opinion \nwill have a $500 million to $800 million impact on the industry, \naccording to figures that came from the Department itself.\n  Just think of this. The largest concentration of fish processors in \nthe United States is on Kodiak Island. I was informed yesterday that, \nas a result of this opinion, if it is enforced, Kodiak processors will \nbe able to operate for 2\\1/2\\ days. This opinion will create ghost \ntowns in my State along the shore from Kodiak all the way out along the \nAleutian chain. Primarily those are native villages. These are not \nenormous factory trawlers. They fish way offshore. These are people who \nlive in these small villages and harvest this fish--which is a unique \nfish, as I have told the Senate before. It is unique because it is a \nbiomass constantly growing. Because of the management schemes we have \nworked out under the Magnuson Act, that biomass has increased almost \nfive times since we started the Magnuson Act.\n  There is more pollack than ever before, but this is going to limit \nfishing for pollack in specific areas where the small boats fish.\n  There is just no way to justify this. Native Alaskans, as I say, are \ngoing to lose their jobs, lose their subsistence. About 1,000 boats \nthat otherwise would have gone to sea will not fish under this order. \nIt is just unconscionable.\n  I am not one who makes threats; I make statements. I have made the \nstatement that I will not sign this conference report if it does not \nadequately restore this fishery. I will oppose the bill on the floor, \nand I am hopeful my friends on this floor will understand why.\n  What this means is we cannot resolve this issue. My staff will meet--\nthanks to the good offices of the Democratic leader--with \nrepresentatives of the administration in just a few minutes, but if we \ncannot resolve this, my advice is make different reservations.\n  Understand, I cannot as a Senator allow an action that is not \nfollowing the law that I helped author put a considerable portion of \nthe people who\n\n[[Page S11773]]\n\nhave year-round jobs in my State out of work, and not just temporarily. \nThey have purported to create these areas around these rookeries \nforever without any consultation with the regional council that was \ncreated by the Magnuson Act, without any public hearings, based solely \nupon a lawsuit that was filed in a Federal court in Seattle and a \nfriendly suit to use that as a justification for taking back into the \nFederal Government the management of these two magnificent fisheries--\npollack and cod--off our State.\n  In my opinion, it is unconstitutional, but I know one thing--it is \nnot going to be approved by this Senate.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank my friend from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, when I yielded time to my good friend \nfrom Alaska, I did not think I would be hearing what I just heard. I am \npleased I was here when he discussed this issue of paramount importance \nto his State.\n  It is most interesting that a Senator can come to the floor of the \nSenate and tell us all something that is very important to his State, \neven though the State is a small State. It is great that our \nConstitution gives our States representation based upon statehood and \nnot upon population of the State. I trust the administration and others \nwill see fit to work with Senator Stevens so we will all be out of here \nbefore Christmas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/14/senate-section/article/S11773-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11773-S11774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         AMERICAN ENERGY CRISIS\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to talk \nabout a crisis that the leadership in America does not want to tell the \nAmerican people about, and certainly the leadership does not want to \ntry to solve this basic problem which is the most serious problem \nconfronting us now.\n  I thought it would be fair and right, since this is what I believe \nand this is what I understand and before we have a new President, for \nat least one Senator--and I hope there will be others--to remind the \nAmerican people that we are in the midst of an American energy crisis. \nUnless and until it becomes critical to millions of Americans in their \ndaily lives, it is very hard for Americans to think we have a crisis, \nbut there is a growing, creeping crisis of paralysis that will occur in \nAmerica because we do not have enough energy that is approved by the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency and that we can add to our inventories \nand resources.\n  The crisis is coming close. Californians may be asking some \nquestions. They ought to be. The media of the United States is not \nasking them yet. The great State of California, if you put that State \nalongside countries, is either the third or fourth largest economic \nunit in the world. In other words, in terms of gross domestic product, \nCalifornia is either third or fourth in the world.\n  There are brownouts happening in California, USA, which means there \nis not enough distributable electricity in the power lines, in the grid \nof California, to permit people to continue operating day by day as if \nthere is sufficient energy for anything and everything they choose to \ndo.\n  I hope some people start asking: Who did this to us? Why are we in \nthis condition? I predict this will creep across America, and I only \nhope we do not blame the next President for what has occurred before \nhis watch. We do not have anyone in a leadership position at the \nexecutive branch of America, from the President on down, who is telling \nthe American people that we have a big, big energy problem and that \nthere are solutions, but it will mean we have to make some tough \ndecisions.\n  I want to talk a moment about what energy means.\n  The reason the United States is powerful, the reason we can have a \nstrong military, the reason we have the best material things in our \ndaily lives--more houses, more cars, more refrigerators--and people can \ncontinue to aspire to be materially sound in America with our economy \ngrowing robustly, adding people to the payrolls and giving them more \nmoney per unit of time, giving them a better standard of living and a \nlife to lead, is because we have energy. Without energy, we cannot \ngrow, and I do not mean grow from the standpoint of adding a \nsubdivision; I mean grow from the standpoint of putting to work for us \nin our daily lives the kinds of things that use energy and give us \nproductivity, jobs, and economic growth. Without an energy supply, that \ncannot happen.\n  I want to talk a moment about our goals for the world.\n  We have used some really nice words--``globalization,'' for one. The \nway I see it, America would like poor countries to get rich. We would \nlike poor people in the world to have more, not fewer, material things. \nBelieve me, these poor nations are beginning to look at the world and \nask: How about us? Can't we grow? Can't we have prosperity?\n  Let me give an answer as I see it. If the world is expected to grow \nand prosper using current American restraints on energy sources, it is \nimpossible for us to grow and the poor to grow because they need huge \nquantities of energy to grow. Do we want to be part of that? If we do, \nhow can we hide our heads and not encourage that all sources of energy \nbe looked at from the standpoint of the benefits versus the costs--the \ncost to a country, to the environment.\n\n  Because of the inability to make hard decisions, we are just about to \nmake our country a natural gas environment. We have almost abandoned \ncoal. We have almost abandoned cleaning up coal so we can use it.\n  People are wondering what is happening to natural gas prices. When we \nsay to the American people that all you can use in new powerplants is \nnatural gas, all you can use for anything now because of environmental \nconcerns is natural gas, and then we say we cannot produce it on \nAmerican lands, on American property, on American public domain--I am \nlooking across the aisle at a Senator who is always talking about coal, \ncoal mining. Let me tell him, there is currently a study that says the \nUnited States of America has 200 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. We \nuse 20 a year. That is almost 10 years of total supply. We have it \nlocked up in American public domain, in American real estate that we \nown as a people, because we are frightened to make decisions about \nletting people explore for it or drill for it. In fact, we have case \nafter case where almost nonsensical restraints lock it up so we cannot \nuse it.\n  I submit that the challenge for the new President is to be courageous \nand for his Secretary of Energy to be courageous. First, we had better \ndefine the problem for the American people. A Senator this morning came \nto the floor and spoke about our growth. I say to my friend from \nColorado, we seem to be having a downward trend in our gross domestic \nproduct, and everybody wants to tell Alan Greenspan how to do his \nbusiness. That is OK. That is what Senators do. Everyone claims Alan \nGreenspan in the last decade did the best job of steering us in the \ndirection of sustained growth, high employment without inflation. I say \nto my friends, there can be no sustained growth at 2.7 per year or 3.3 \nper year, which gives us a lot of power in our economy, if we do not \nhave energy to use. We cannot do that with brownouts across America.\n  That, in and of itself, and the increased price will cause America's \neconomy to sputter and slow down, and somebody will be blamed. I \nsubmit, do not blame the new President and do not blame the new \nSecretary. They may have to tell us the truth. They may have to tell us \nwe cannot as a nation get by hiding our heads from new energy sources, \nsuch as advanced new technology in the nuclear area.\n  I think we are going to have to start talking about it realistically \nwith the American people.\n  Do you know in South Africa they are about to build a module--that \nmeans a small powerplant--with brand new nuclear technology that, \nnumber one, means the powerplant can never melt; it is passive; it will \nturn itself off at a certain temperature.\n  Do you know that powerplant they are trying to build will not use \nlight water? Their gas-cooled design may be much simpler, much safer, \nand produce less waste (but some) than light water systems.\n  We here in America are working on nuclear research and the like \nrelated to that kind of addition, but we are doing it in such a quiet \nway because we are fearful that some will rise up and get angry about \nit. Angry they may get, but the truth is, if the American people\n\n[[Page S11774]]\n\nunderstand that we can move in that direction--carefully, slowly--\nadding some diversity to our energy supply, we can also do a better job \nin cleaning up our coal and using some of it for electricity.\n  We can, indeed, open up our public lands to exploration instead of \nhiding them, as if drilling a well that produces huge amounts of \nnatural gas for Americans--and for whatever we need to grow and \nprosper--as if that is something terrible rather than something very \ngood. It is something where we ought to hold our heads up and say: We \nown it. It is American. If we produce it, it is ours. We do not have to \nbe dependent.\n  And, yes, there is no question that we ought to look at the refining \ncapacity of America. We have not built a new refinery in 16 years, I \nsay to the occupant of the chair.\n  What is that all about? It is because we have put environmental rules \nahead of America's energy needs. We refuse to look at real cost \nbenefits and reasonable mainstream protection rather than extraordinary \nprotection that in many instances is meaningless but costly and many \ntimes stops the production of things such as refineries, pipelines, and \nthe like.\n  I have much more that I will talk about from time to time on the \nfloor of the Senate, but I come today to say, I hope we do not have to \nturn off our Christmas trees in New Mexico during this Christmas \nseason, nor in the Senator's State of Colorado. I hope we can turn them \nback on in California.\n  Frankly, the only reason they cannot--and the only reason California \nsuffers--is because nobody will make tough decisions. We are sitting \nback suggesting that things are really going well; that we will fix the \nAmerican energy supply with windmills. I can deliver a specific talk on \nwhy that will not work for all our energy, but we ought to continue it. \nBut it will never give us the kind of energy supply we need as we look \nto the future.\n  Do you know that the underdeveloped countries of the world, which \nintend to grow--and we say to them: Grow, prosper--by 2020 will use as \nmuch energy as the United States of America? Where are they going to \nget it? What are they going to use? What are we going to suggest they \ndo?\n  Are we going to sit back and say America can grow but they can't? Are \nwe going to say they can use some new kind of energy source but we \nwon't?\n  So our leadership in the world, moving towards democratization and \ngrowth and prosperity for the poorest of nations, will come to a \ngrinding halt if, in fact, we cannot have energy supply in the world.\n  Why should we have an agreement to preserve ambient air qualities and \nin that report not mention nuclear power? Why should leaders do that? I \nhave had experts, physicists, who know what they are talking about, \nsaying that alone is enough to put that document over here on a table \nand declare that it is not real.\n  If you want clean air in the future, you cannot say we will do it by \nusing only natural gas, that we will not build any more coal burning \npowerplants, even though we could develop the technology to do that, \nthat we will not consider nuclear power, even though we have a nuclear \nNavy that since 1954 has gone all through the waters of the seas and \noceans of the world with it, with one or two powerplants right inside \nthe hull of the boat, with never an accident. Never has anything \nhappened, and we are so frightened we will not even talk about it.\n  I think we will talk about it. I think we will talk about opening up \nAmerican public domain for production. I think we will have a real \ndebate about ANWR, rather than an emotional debate, a real one about \nwhat we ought to do to relate our energy needs to that area of the \nworld, not just putting our hands up and saying it cannot be touched, \nthat you can do nothing.\n  So there is much to be talked about and much leadership needed. But \nthe point is, energy problems in America, without major changes, will \nget more pronounced. We will have more crises; the prices will go \nhigher, not lower across the board in America for gasoline and natural \ngas.\n  I am hopeful the new President will put somebody in the Department of \nEnergy who will help America address this issue with its eyes open, \nready to make some really tough decisions.\n  But the biggest thing I seek is to set the record straight. When that \noccurs, as the energy crisis creeps across America, I hope we will \nremember that the seeds have been sown before the swearing in of this \nPresident. They are there; the lack of doing the right thing in America \nis already in place.\n  This President and his Cabinet and his Secretary and his \nEnvironmental Protection Agency head are going to have to help solve a \ncrisis they did not create. We ought to know that, and we ought to set \nthe record straight that that is the case.\n  I want to close by saying there is plenty of blame to go around. But \nwe will not solve this problem without some leadership that is willing \nto tell us the truth and suggest that there is really no need for the \nState of California to be running out of electricity. It is because we \nhave been shortsighted, misled--and they have been in their State \nbecause there is the potential for plenty of energy to go around out \nthere. We just have to decide that America needs energy for its future, \nand that we cannot grow more dependent, that we ought to grow less \ndependent.\n  So rather than proceed with details about each of the sources of \nenergy which I had chosen to talk about today, I will do that on \nanother day. Suffice it to say, we will not continue to grow--the \nFederal Reserve Board notwithstanding--if we cannot solve the problem \nof how much energy we need and make sure we have it.\n  Some people thought that because of Silicon Valley, because it is so \nclean and because it is built around new technology and \ncomputerization, we would not need new energy sources. But it turns out \nthat if you want that kind of growth and that kind of productivity \nincrease, and if you want the future of our country to be built upon \nthe technology that evolved with the Silicon Valley in California and \nother mini ``silicon valleys,'' you need a lot of energy to create the \nnew productivity that that brings to America.\n\n  I want to also add that new technology, led by computerization, is \npart of the reason we have had the sustained growth; they added a \ndimension of productivity we did not even measure for many years. They \nadded growth to technology by way of productivity increases: The more \ncomputers you had, the more you got out of your personnel per unit of \nwork. You got more because of high technology. That has added immensely \nto our productivity and has permitted us to grow without inflation. \nThat is peaking out.\n  Surely, if we do not add more energy to the mix of the base, we will \nhave to start trading off one source of growth in America for another. \nI do not believe that is going to work, and somebody will be blamed, \nespecially since it does not have to happen.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today on what is a somewhat \nbittersweet occasion to reflect on my time in the Senate, and to look \nahead to the future.\n  Next to being a husband, a father, and a grandfather, these past 6 \nyears have provided without a doubt the most exciting and also the most \ninspiring moments in my life. To serve as a Member of the greatest \ndeliberative body in the world--entrusted with fulfilling the hopes and \nwishes of the people across the United States as well as the people of \nMinnesota--has been humbling beyond words. When your view out the front \nwindow is of the U.S. Capitol, and when your daily travels take you \ndown the same halls once walked by John Quincy Adams, Abraham Lincoln, \nand Daniel Webster, and you spend your hours working for people who ask \nnothing more of you than to make government work a little bit better, \nwell, going to the office to work each day is a real pleasure.\n\n[[Page S11775]]\n\n  I am going to miss the Senate, not at all because of the prestige it \nis said to represent, but because this relatively small group of people \nis instilled with the power to accomplish so much good. And every day \nin this Chamber, my colleagues plow their passions into doing that. \nYes, we routinely disagree. We have our partisan battles. And as men \nand women with strong ideas about what is right for America, we can be \nas stubborn as any creature God ever put onto this Earth. But there is \nnever any doubt that as Senators, my colleagues act out of a deeply \nheld belief that they are doing the right thing for the people who sent \nthem here.\n  I have had the opportunity to serve with many remarkable individuals. \nThey have taught me a great deal, not just about being a Senator, \nalthough there was certainly a major part of that, but they also helped \nme to recognize that compromise does not have to mean compromising \none's beliefs, that a small victory is often better than no victory at \nall, that ``obstacle'' is just another word for opportunity, and that \nsometimes the best way to get past a mountain is to go around it, and \nnot necessarily tunnel right through it.\n  The majority leader, Trent Lott, has been a good friend, and I have \nappreciated his counsel and his willingness to listen to even the most \njunior members of this chamber. I'll say the same of his predecessor, \nSenator Bob Dole, who was in so many ways a mentor to this Senator, and \nI truly admire him as a wonderful and caring leader and man. The \nassistant majority leader, Don Nickles, has been a tremendous example \nto my colleagues and me, and I want to thank him for his guidance and \nfriendship. I consider it my great fortune, and a great honor, to have \nbeen able to work closely with so many other good people on both sides \nof the aisle, such as Democrat Leader Tom Daschle and Assistant \nDemocratic Leader Harry Reid. I have learned from you daily; and, from \nour most senior and respected Members of this body, Senator Robert Byrd \nand Senator Strom Thurmond; my committee chairmen, Jesse Helms of \nForeign Relations, Phil Gramm of Banking, Pete Domenici of Budget, and \nFrank Murkowski of the Energy Committee.\n\n  Before I got to the Senate, I never would have guessed that every \nquestion would have exactly one hundred different answers. But each of \nour exchanges forced me to look at old ideas in new ways, and I'm a \nbetter person for every challenge you posed. These years with you have \nbeen like watching a history book come to life.\n\n  I want to recognize my colleagues who are also leaving the Senate at \nthe conclusion of this Congress. The distinguished chairman of the \nFinance Committee, Bill Roth, has been one of this Chamber's greatest \nchampions of the taxpayers, and a Senator of whom I have the highest \nregard. John Ashcroft and Spence Abraham continually set the highest \nstandard of public service; we came into the Senate together, and I was \nhonored to work closely with them during the past six years. Connie \nMack, a colleague on the Banking Committee, has served this Senate with \ngreat distinction, as has the Senator from Washington, Slade Gorton. On \nthe other side of the aisle, the Senate is losing one of its most \nrespected voices with the retirement of Daniel Patrick Moynihan. He \nrepresents to me the ideal of the character of a public servant. The \nsame can be said of Bob Kerrey. I also wish the very best to Richard \nBryan, Frank Lautenberg, and Chuck Robb, all of whom earned my \nadmiration.\n  As to the rest of my colleagues, I won't try to thank you \nindividually here, but I will do so privately, and know that you each \nhave my respect and my gratitude.\n  Not only have I served with exceptional colleagues, but I was elected \nto serve here during remarkable times. We've been confronted with \nmoments that tested America's resolve in the world, such as the war in \nthe Balkans and the bombings of our U.S. embassies abroad. Other \nevents, like the Oklahoma City tragedy and the recent uncertainty over \nthe presidential election, have tested us domestically. Despite a \nstrong economy, the challenges posed early on in my term by unending \ndeficits and high taxes threatened families and job creators. These \nhave been hard times in my home state as well, with problems on the \nfarm and a series of natural disasters that challenged our citizens \nwith floods and tornadoes.\n  We accepted these challenges because the American people expected us \nto, and at the end of the day, I'm proud to say that we've left things \na little better than we found them. Deficits are a thing of the past, \ntaxes are still a crushing blow for families, but a little less so, \nwelfare is no longer a prison sentence, and trade opportunities have \nopened up around the world for American products.\n  Is it enough? Of course not, because it's never enough. There's \nalways one more person needing a helping hand, one more bridge to build \nor road to pave, one more bill to introduce. But I'm confident that \nwe've made the government work a little better for the folks who sent \nus here, and for the moment, that's enough for this Senator. I leave \nhere with a few more wrinkles and maybe a gray hair or two, but no \nregrets.\n  I wish my colleagues the very best as you struggle with the \nchallenges that lie ahead.\n  With a fifty-fifty split between the parties come January, you'll \nundoubtedly be tested in ways you haven't imagined. The Senate will \nadapt, though, as the Senate always has throughout its history, because \nthe people will be counting on you. Senator-elect Dayton will be in my \nprayers, and I know the people of Minnesota will stand behind him as \nthey've stood behind me.\n  On every level, this Senate is a family, and it wouldn't feel right \nto leave here without expressing my thanks to not just my fellow \nSenators, but everyone who helps this body go about its daily work. \nWhether it's the food service workers, pages, officers of the Capitol \nPolice force, elevator operators, parliamentarians, and the others who \nhave become such familiar presences, I've enjoyed getting to know you \nand I appreciate your professionalism. The dedication to this \ninstitution extends far beyond those privileged to stand in the well of \nthe Senate to all of its employees.\n  In a Senate office, where the ink on the employee roster is barely \ndry before somebody leaves for a better opportunity and someone else \nsteps in to fill his or her place, I've been blessed to have as loyal \nand as caring a staff as any Senator could ask for. Going all the way \nback to my service in the U.S. House, they've stood by me through good \ntimes and the most difficult of days. As staffers do, they worked \nanonymously. They spent long hours at their jobs. They didn't come to \nwork for me expecting to get rich and besides, a paycheck cannot reward \nthat kind of loyalty. So all I can offer them today is my humble thanks \nand some well-deserved public recognition by inserting their names in \nthe Record.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent their names be printed in the \nRecord at an appropriate place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit I)\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, in conclusion, I appreciate their service \nto my office and to the people of Minnesota. I hope they understand \nthat they have all helped to make a difference.\n  Also, I return to Minnesota a little bit older, hopefully a little \nbit wiser, and feeling mightily blessed for all the opportunities that \nhave come my way. In conception and execution, the American \nGovernment--and the Senate in particular--is an institution that has \nnever been equaled anywhere else in the world. I have been honored to \nbe a part of it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit I\n\n\n                            minnesota staff\n\n       Erik Aamoth, Andrea Andrews, Donna Bauer, Maryann Carl, \n     Jennifer Casanova, Dave Chura, Karyn Diehl, Tim Engstrom, \n     Eric Felton, Josh Gackle, Joe Isaacs.\n       Pat Johnson, Jessica Knowles, Michelle Koke, Rich Kunst, \n     Dave Ladd, Kim Lichy, Jack Meeks, Mark Neuville, Mike Nikkel, \n     Annie Paruccini, Rob Patterson.\n       Merna Pease, Tara Pryde, Matt Quinn, Erik Rosedahl, Noah \n     Rouen, Barb Sykora, Jack Tomczak, Randy Wanke, Hayley Wesp, \n     Linda Westrom, Kurt Zellers.\n\n\n                            washington staff\n\n       Perry Aaness, Bertt Adams, Mike Amery, Steve Behm, Jeff \n     Bloemker, Eric Bearse, Dave Berson, Jami Bjorndahl, Brian \n     Bowman, Morgan Brown, Alan Brubaker, Krista Canty, Barbara \n     Cohen, Nicole Converse, Anne Crowther.\n\n[[Page S11776]]\n\n       Chris Cylke, Joseph Dworak, Jason Einertson, Erik \n     Einertson, Don Erickson, Pat Eveland, Jensine Frost, Chris \n     Gunhus, Lianchao Han, Elizabeth Heir, Peter Hong, Todd Hower, \n     Eric Huebeck, Jay Jackson, Dan Kauppi.\n       Jason Kelley, Pat Kenny, Anthony King, Adam Knapp, Ray \n     Livengood, Diane Lochner, Careen Martin, Darrell McKigney, \n     Andrea Miles, Brent Moore, Tim Morrison, Gretchen Muehlberg, \n     Vaughn Murphy, Joe Natalicchio, Amy Novak.\n       Matt O'Donnell, Mark Olson, Merna Pease, Linda Pope, Heidi \n     Rasmussen, Anthony Reed, John Revier, Jill Rode, Erik Rudeen, \n     Gary Russell, Fritz Schick, Mark Sherid, Maggie Smith, Tim \n     Stout, Michael Tavernier.\n       Braden Tempas, Herb Terry, Pam Thiessen, Joe Trauger, Kiel \n     Weaver, Jeffery Weekly, Linda Westrom, Krista Winter, Tom \n     Yedinak.\n\n\n                                interns\n\n       Jerry Aanerud, Brandon Adams, Margery Amundsen, Kent \n     Anderson, Gulzar Babaeva, Joel Brusewitz, Cheryl Budewitz, \n     Kate Busby, Steve Chappell, Cristi Cota, Amanda Daeges, Brad \n     Davis, Michelle Dhein, Ryan Ellis, Jenny Erickson, Julie \n     Fishman, Charlie Fox, Tom Goetz, Kristen Gross, Kevin \n     Gustafson.\n       Jennifer Halko, Chris Hansen, Nancy Hartwell, Elicia Heir, \n     Christian Heitzman, Dan Herrboldt, Jon Herzog, Michael \n     Hiltner, Kelly Huebner, Jessica Inda, Andy Irber, Tom \n     Johnson, Jay Johnston, Kari Klassen, Rob Kloek, Mark Knapp, \n     Jason Kohler, Tim Kohls, Joey Kramlinger.\n       Margo Larson, Brad Lein, Jeff Love, Melissa Maranda, Brian \n     McCarty, Jennifer McWilliams, Stephanie Moore, Ed Moreland, \n     Jon Nelson, Hue Nguyen, Loc Nguyen, Ben Nicka, Jared \n     Nordlund, Olga O'Hanlon, Gabe Perkins, Gretchen Printy, \n     Jessica Qually, Allison Rajala, Stephanie Richard, Oscar \n     Rodriguez.\n       Miranda Rollins, Julie Schellhase, Patrick Schott, Meghan \n     Shea, Anne Sigler, Valerie Sims, Matt Skaret, Tanetha Smith, \n     Pat Spieker, Andrea Staebler, Tom Starshak, Amy Thorson, \n     Kristian Vieru, Christine Vix, David Webb, Benjamen Wilson, \n     Kristy Wolske, Ryan Wood.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, our distinguished colleague, Senator \nGrams, will go on to, I hope, an even greater challenge.\n  What a privilege it has been for me and I think all in this Chamber \nto have had his service for a few years. I was particularly impressed \nby Senator Grams' willingness to take on assignments which others felt \nthey would rather not have because of the challenge--particularly on \nthe Foreign Relations Committee and those relating to Africa, those \nrelating to the United Nations, and issues which are very vital not \nonly to our Nation but to the whole world.\n  I wish to commend the Senator. I hope that he will continue to apply \nhis talents and his wisdom and energy to solving those difficult \nchallenges.\n  I recently visited the U.N. with Ambassador Holbrooke. Time and time \nagain, I was in consultation with him and other ambassadors from other \nnations in regard to the budget situation. Senator Grams was \ninstrumental in the landmark piece of legislation, Helms-Biden.\n  I hope he will continue to apply his talents.\n  I wish Senator Grams and his family well.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I thank very much the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMS. I graciously yield to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I asked the Senator to yield because I want \nto share in the good wishes that have been expressed by the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Virginia to the Senator who is about \nto depart from our midst.\n  Let me say that the Senator has always been nice to me. He is always \ncheerful and is always ready to reach out a welcoming hand. I \nappreciate that.\n  The Senator and I don't serve on any committees together. I am sorry \nI never had that opportunity or that pleasure.\n  But I shall miss the Senator. I shall miss his ready smile and his \nfirm hand claps.\n  I, too, wish him well in the days to come. Our Senate is better for \nhis having served here. My life is better for having known him and \nhaving had the opportunity to serve in this great body with him.\n  I hope he will come back to see us. I hope I shall get to see him \nagain. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. GRAMS.

Mr. President, one of the most significant bipartisan \nachievements by Congress and the Clinton Administration is the increase \nin the Low Income Housing Tax Credit that we should enact this week. \nHowever, I am concerned that the Internal Revenue Service is taking a \nposition in audits that may undermine the goal of the credit.\n  Last month, the IRS issued a series of five technical advice \nmemoranda, TAM, on the credit, in response to questions about an audit \nof a low-income housing developer earlier this year. The memoranda \ndescribed what may be included in the basis of a property to calculate \nthe amount of the credit that a state can allocate for a development.\n  The memoranda were requested and issued because no regulations \ncurrently exist to clearly define the eligible basis for determining \nthe credit. In the absence of regulations, this highly technical advice \nis all that taxpayers have available, but these specific instructions \nfor a single taxpayer should not necessarily be the final word on the \nwide variety of developments across the nation. Regulations would be \nmuch clearer and would be fully developed by the Treasury Department.\n  A further issue is that the memoranda are inconsistent with current \nindustry practice. The positions taken in the memoranda could lower the \neligible basis by over 15 percent, reducing available credits for a \nproject. I am concerned that such a sharp reduction in the credit would \nmean that many planned developments for affordable housing will no \nlonger be economically feasible, and will force developers to decide \nagainst building affordable units. It is also possible that this \nreduction in available credits for projects could be applied \nretroactively--nullifying credits that have already been allocated and \ndestroying confidence in this important program that Congress worked so \nhard to establish.\n  Since States are allocated a fixed number of credits based on \npopulation, the memoranda do not save the Treasury any revenues. They \nsimply limit the amount of credits available per project, making \nindividual projects less attractive to developers. The result is fewer \naffordable housing units at a time when housing prices have soared in \nmany communities across the country.\n  I am also concerned about the lack of opportunity for public comment \non this issue. Preparing regulations requires comment, but issuing such \nmemoranda does not. Many constituents--tenants as well as developers--\nhave strong concerns about the credit, and they should have the \nopportunity to express those concerns adequately. Developers and \nhousing advocates can provide valuable information on the application \nof these credits, and their views should be taken into consideration.\n  With the growing regional and national economy, housing prices are \nincreasing faster in Massachusetts than any other state. Many studies \nhave shown that we must increase production in new affordable housing \nunits throughout the state to meet the overwhelming demand for \naffordable housing. We must do all we can to see that the low income \nhousing tax credit is used effectively to meet this pressing need.\n  I urge the Treasury Department to begin the process of developing \nappropriate regulations on this important issue, including \nopportunities for detailed public comments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/14/senate-section/article/S11776-3", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11776-S11777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RETIREMENT OF SENATOR RICHARD H. BRYAN\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, when the 106th Congress finally adjourns \nsine die in the next several days, it will mark the end of the Senate \nservice of one of this body's most thoughtful and respected members, \nSenator Richard Bryan.\n  Dick Bryan came to the Senate having already distinguished himself as \na\n\n[[Page S11777]]\n\npopular attorney general for four years and governor for six years in \nNevada. In his two terms in the Senate, Dick has fought for the \nprotection of American consumers. His successful legislative battles \ninclude the requirement that automobiles sold in the U.S. be equipped \nwith air bags, fair credit reporting and toy labeling legislation. He \nhas been a pioneer in the area of internet privacy protection \nlegislation, including his bill, the Childrens' Online Privacy \nProtection Act, which passed last year by the Senate.\n  Dick Bryan has earned a reputation as a tenacious defender of the \ninterests of the people of Nevada. Whether attempting to block the \nstorage of federal waste at Yucca Mountain, attempting to ban internet \ngambling, or fighting for federal projects in Nevada, Dick Bryan has \ntime and again been a formidable advocate for his constituents.\n  Dick Bryan has also been a strong voice in the Senate for fiscal \nresponsibility. A critic of excessive ``pork-barrel'' spending and \nwasteful programs, he help lead the fight back to a balanced federal \nbudget.\n  I have served with Dick on the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence, on which he now serves as Vice-Chairman. On that \nCommittee, Dick has led the minority while steadfastly working toward a \nbipartisan approach to the Committee's critical oversight of the \nnation's intelligence community.\n  Mr. President, I know I speak not only for my wife, Barbara and \nmyself, but for all of us in the Senate family, when I say that we will \nprofoundly miss Dick and Bonnie Bryan. We wish them, their three \nchildren and three grandchildren a healthy and happy future. It was \nDick's love of family and his desire for quality time with them and his \ndesire for quality time in his beloved Nevada which takes him from us. \nWhile there will be a big hole in our Senate family with his departure, \nwe admire his reasons for leaving, just as we admire and celebrate his \ncontributions to the well being of our nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/14/senate-section/article/S11777-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11777-S11779]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              REPORT CARD OF THE 106TH CONGRESS ON PRIVACY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today, as Chairman of the Senate \nDemocratic Privacy Task Force, to speak about the privacy rights of all \nAmerican citizens and the failure of this Congress to address the \nimportant issues threatening these fundamental rights of the American \npeople.\n  When he announced the creation of the Democratic Privacy Task Force \nearlier this year, the Senate Democratic Leader, Senator Tom Daschle, \nsaid, ``The issue of privacy touches virtually every American, often in \nextremely personal ways. Whether it is bank records or medical files or \nInternet activities, Americans have a right to expect that personal \nmatters will be kept private.'' Yet, our laws have not kept pace with \nsweeping technological changes, putting at risk some of our most \nsensitive, private matters, which may be stored in computer databases \nthat are available for sale to the highest bidder. As Senator Daschle \nstated, ``That is wrong, it's dangerous, and it has to stop.''\n  In leading the Democratic Privacy Task Force, I took this charge to \nheart and determined that an important first step in formulating \nworkable and effective privacy safeguards was to make sure we \nunderstood the scope of the problem, both domestically and \ninternationally, the status of industry self-regulatory efforts and the \nneed for legislative solutions. At the announcement of the Privacy Task \nForce, I noted that we would focus on Internet, financial and medical \nrecords privacy, explaining that, ``It is important to come to grips \nwith the erosion of our privacy rights before it becomes too late to \nget them back. We need to consider a variety of solutions, including \ntechnological one, and we need to look at the appropriate roles for \nprivate as well as public policy answers.''\n  To this end, the Senate Democratic Privacy Task Force sponsored \nseveral member meetings and briefings on administrative steps underway \nin the Clinton-Gore Administration to protect people's privacy, \nindustry self-regulatory efforts, and other specific privacy issues. \nThese meetings included a discussion with White House privacy experts \nPeter Swire, Chief Counselor for Privacy at the Office of Management \nand Budget, and Sally Katzen, Counselor to the Director at the Office \nof Management and Budget, on the status of multilateral negotiations on \nimplementation of the EU Privacy Directive and the effects on U.S. \nbusiness. At another meeting, officials from OMB and the Department of \nTreasury described financial privacy issues. Yet another meeting \nprovided a public forum for industry executives representing various \nseal programs to describe the successes and pitfalls of internet \nprivacy self-regulatory activities. These task force meetings focused \non relevant and pressing issues affecting consumer privacy in this \ncountry, prompting many Democratic members to look at legislative \nsolutions.\n  Democrats have worked to enhance consumer privacy protections through \nthe introduction of several legislative proposals--some with bipartisan \nsupport-- regarding medical, financial, and online privacy and identity \ntheft. Democratic Senators who have sponsored privacy legislation this \nCongress include, Senators Boxer, Breaux, Bryan, Byrd, Cleland, \nDaschle, Dorgan, Dodd, Durbin, Edwards, Feinstein, Feingold, Harkin, \nHollings, Inouye, Johnson, Kennedy, Kerry, Kohl, Lautenberg, Mikulski, \nMurray, Robb, Rockefeller, Sarbanes, Schumer, Torricelli, and \nWellstone.\n  Despite the best efforts of Democratic Senators to heed the public \ncall for greater privacy protection and to bring privacy issues to the \nforefront of our legislative agenda, the Republican majority has failed \nto bring all sides and stakeholders together to craft workable and \neffective safeguards in any of the areas where privacy rights are most \nat risk, namely, for internet activities, medical records or financial \ninformation.\n  During this Congress, for example, instead of focusing on ways to \nenhance privacy safeguards, the largest number of hearings (thirteen) \nand innumerable briefings held by the Senate Judiciary Committee or its \nsubcommittees were directed at dissecting the manner in which the \nDepartment of Justice handled the investigation and prosecution of \ncertain cases involving national security-related information and \ncampaign financing. In the eyes of some members, the convictions \nobtained were proof of success, and in the eyes of others they were \nnot. In our next Congress, it is my hope that we will not be distracted \nby such partisan pursuits, but that our time will be better spent on \ncrafting privacy legislation that will make a real difference in the \nlives of every American. This is no easy task and will require both \nhard work and the commitment of member and staff time, but the next \nCongress should not shy away from this important issue, as has this \none.\n  The right to privacy is a personal and fundamental right protected by \nthe Constitution of the United States. The digitalization of \ninformation and the explosion in the growth of computing and electronic \nnetworking offer tremendous potential benefits to the way Americans \nlive, work, conduct commerce, and interact with their government. Yet, \nnew technologies, new communications media, and new business services \ncreated with the best of intentions and highest of expectations \nchallenge our ability to keep our lives to ourselves, and to live, work \nand think without having personal information about us collected and \ndisseminated without our knowledge or consent. Indeed, personal \ninformation has become a valuable and widely traded commodity by both \ngovernment and private sector entities, which may used the information \nfor purposes entirely unrelated to its initial collection. Moreover, \nthis information may be stolen, sold or mishandled and find its way \ninto the wrong hands with the push of a button or click of a mouse.\n  The American people are becoming more aware of this problem and are \ngrowing increasingly concerned with expanding encroachments on their \npersonal privacy. American consumers are demanding better privacy \nprotection and simply avoiding those markets perceived to pose the most \nrisk to privacy interests.\n  New technologies bring with them new opportunities, both for the \nbusinesses that develop and market them, and for consumers. It does not \ndo anyone any good for consumers to hesitate to use any particular \ntechnology because they have concerns over privacy.\n\n[[Page S11778]]\n\nThat is why I believe that good privacy policies make good business \npolicies. Consumer concerns can be a serious drag on the marketplace, \nand the Congress may help bolster consumer confidence by putting in \nplace the appropriate legislative privacy safeguards. Let me outline \nsome of the areas in which I have introduced privacy legislation and \nwill continue to work for constructive solutions.\n\n  While many emerging technologies challenge privacy protection, the \ngreatest modern threat may be found online. Concerns over the privacy \nof online interaction easily dominate both the media and the public. \nThe American public has a number of concerns when they go online. They \nworry whether their privacy will be protected, whether a damaging \ncomputer virus will attack their computer, whether a computer hacker \nwill steal their personal information, adopt their identity and wreak \nhavoc with their credit, whether their kids will meet a sexual predator \nand whether government or private sector entities are surreptitiously \nmonitoring their online activities and communications.\n  Unfortunately, these concerns are merited, and will continue to \nincrease as online technology evolves. As the recent popularity of \npeer-to-peer sharing software, used in the Napster service, \ndemonstrates, the way in which people use the personal computer is \nchanging. Increasingly, personal information, such as diaries, \nfinances, and schedules, will not be stored on hard drives, but instead \non Internet-based files. Combined with the reality that a substantial \namount of our information is being carried over the ``Wireless Web,'' \naccess to our personal information--by private and by public snoopers--\nis also growing exponentially.\n  I proposed S. 854, the Electronic Rights for the 21st Century Act or \nthe E-Rights bill, to address these concerns. This legislation would \nhave modified the blanket exception in current law allowing electronic \ncommunications service providers to disclose a record or other \ninformation pertaining to a subscriber to any non-governmental entity \nfor any purpose or use. Due to this exemption, ISPs and OSPs may sell \ntheir subscriber lists or track the online movements of their \nsubscribers and sell that information--all without the subscribers' \nknowledge or consent. The E-RIGHTS Act would have cut back on this \nexemption by requiring ISPs to give subscribers an opportunity to \nprohibit disclosure of their personal information and enumerating the \nsituation in which the information may be used or disclosed without \nsubscriber approval. Serious consideration of this proposal would have \nprovided a constructive basis for discussion of online privacy, a \ndiscussion that has been postponed until the next Congress.\n  Enhanced privacy protection for confidential information held by \nbankrupt firms is necessary. Internet users are often promised basic \nprivacy protection, only to have their expectations disappointed and \ntheir personal information put up for sale or disseminated in ways to \nwhich they never consented. Sadly, expectations and assumptions are not \nalways safe online. For example, Toysmart.com, an online toy store, \nrecently filed for bankruptcy and its databases and customer lists were \nput up for sale as part of the liquidation of the firm's assets. This \npersonal customer information was put on the auction block even though \nToysmart.com's privacy statement promised that ``[w]hen you register \nwith toysmart.com, you can rest assured that your information will \nnever be shared with a third party.''\n  The Toysmart.com situation exemplifies the need for our privacy laws \nto recognize the dangers online services pose and to keep pace with the \nInternet's increased usage and ever evolving technology. I introduced, \nalong with Senators Torricelli, Kohl and Durbin, S. 2758, ``The Privacy \nPolicy Enforcement in Bankruptcy Act of 2000'' specifically to address \nthe problems created by Toysmart.com. Currently, the customer databases \nof failed Internet firms can be sold during bankruptcy, even in \nviolation of the firm's stated privacy policy. This is unacceptable. \nThe Act would prohibit the sale of personally identifiable information \nheld by a failed business if the sale or disclosure of the personal \ninformation would violate the privacy policy of the debtor in effect \nwhen the personal information was collected, providing at least a \nmodicum of protection for privacy rights online. It was my hope that \nthe majority would support this legislation and effect swift passage so \nthat we could at least make some progress in the protection of \nimportant privacy rights. Unfortunately the majority has chosen to \nignore this legislation, along with other numerous privacy initiatives, \nwith the consequence that is has gone nowhere.\n  Enhanced privacy protection from unreasonable government searches and \nsurveillance is another area that requires attention. Internet users \nare concerned about whether their privacy rights are threatened by \nprodding surveillance technology, as demonstrated by the public outcry \nover the ``Carnivore'' program. Carnivore is used by the Federal Bureau \nof Investigation to monitor the Internet activity of suspected \ncriminals and is completely undetectable as it intercepts the suspect's \nemail, web, and chat-room activity. Fortunately, the ``Carnivore'' \nprogram is capable of filtering protected or unnecessary information \nfrom that which should be intercepted. Nevertheless, concerns persist \nover the capabilities represented by this electronic surveillance \ntechnology and its potential invasiveness.\n  The E-RIGHTS Act, S. 854, which I introduced in April, 1999, contains \na number of provisions designed to update our fourth amendment rights \nin the face of technological advances and new surveillance \ntechnologies. This legislation enhances privacy protections in several \nareas by strengthening procedures for law enforcement access to private \ninformation stored on Internet networks, location information for \ncellular telephones, decryption assistance for encrypted intercepted \ncommunications and stored data, communications occurring over \nconference calls when the target of a wiretap order has dropped off the \ncall, and information obtained under pen register and trap and trace \norders. Once again, no action was taken on this legislation despite my \ncontinued efforts to urge the Judiciary Committee to take it up.\n  Just as the widespread dissemination of personal information through \nonline services deserves Congressional attention, the rapid expansion \nof the financial services industry requires affirmative action to \nprotect private, financial information. In November 1999, President \nClinton signed into law the landmark Financial Modernization Act of \n1999, which updated our financial laws and opened up the financial \nservices industry to become more competitive, both at home and abroad. \nI supported this legislation because I believed it would benefit \nbusinesses and consumers. It makes it easier for banking, securities, \nand insurance firms to consolidate their services, cut expenses and \noffer more products at a lower cost to all. But it also raises new \nconcerns about our financial privacy.\n  In the financial services industry, conglomerates are offering a wide \nvariety of services, each of which requires a customer to provide \nfinancial, medical or other personal information. And nothing in the \nlaw prevents subsidiaries within the conglomerate from sharing this \ninformation for uses other than the use the customer thought he or she \nwas providing it for. In fact, under current Federal law, a financial \ninstitution can sell, share, or publish savings account balances, \ncertificates of deposit maturity dates and balances, stock and mutual \nfund purchases and sales, life insurance payouts and health insurance \nclaims.\n  As President Clinton recently warned: ``Although consumers put a \ngreat value on privacy of their financial records, our laws have not \ncaught up to technological developments that make it possible and \npotentially profitable for companies to share financial data in new \nways. Consumers who undergo physical exams to obtain insurance, for \nexample, should not have to fear the information will be used to lower \ntheir credit card limits or deny them mortgages.'' I strongly agree.\n  Senators Boxer, Bryan, Durbin, Feingold, Harkin, Mikulski and Robb, \nand I introduced the Financial Information Privacy and Security Act of \n1999, S. 1924, to give this Congress the historic opportunity to \nprovide for the privacy of every American's personal financial \ninformation in the wake of\n\n[[Page S11779]]\n\nenactment of the financial modernization legislation. Our legislation \nwas designed to protect the privacy of financial information by \ndirecting the Federal Reserve Board, Office of Thrift Supervision, \nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of the Comptroller of the \nCurrency, and the Securities and Exchange Commission to jointly \npromulgate rules requiring financial institutions they regulate to: (1) \ninform their customers what information is to be disclosed, and when, \nto whom and for what purposes the information is to be disclosed; (2) \nallow customers to review the information for accuracy; and (3) for new \ncustomers, obtain the customers' consent to disclosure, and for \nexisting customers, give the customers a reasonable opportunity to \nobject to disclosure. These financial institutions could use \nconfidential customer information from other entities only if the \nentities had given their customers similar privacy protections.\n  In addition, the bill would have provided individuals the civil right \nof action to enforce their financial privacy rights and to recover \npunitive damages, reasonable attorneys fees, and other litigation \ncosts. Privacy rights must be enforceable in a court of law to be truly \neffective.\n  I also joined with Senators Sarbanes, Bryan, Dodd, Durbin, Edwards, \nFeinstein, Harkin, Kerry and Robb to introduce the Financial \nInformation Privacy Protection Act of 2000, S. 2513. This bill was the \nClinton Administration's proposal to give consumers real control over \nthe use and disclosure of their financial and health-related \ninformation held by financial institutions.\n  I had hoped that these efforts would be just the beginning of this \nCongress's efforts to address the many financial privacy issues raised \nby ultra competitive marketplaces in the information age. It is clear \nthat Congress needs to update our privacy laws in the evolving \nfinancial services industry to protect the personal, confidential \nfinancial information of all American citizens.\n  Unfortunately, our Republican colleagues on the Senate Banking \nCommittee did not feel the same way. This important financial privacy \nprotection never saw the Senate floor, leaving confidential financial \ninformation disturbingly vulnerable.\n  Just as troubling as the rejection of financial information \nprotections is this Congress' failure to establish safeguards for the \nprivacy of medical records. Undoubtably, maintaining the \nconfidentiality of medical records is of the utmost importance. Medical \nrecords contain the most intimate, sensitive information about a \nperson. For the past three Congresses, I have introduced comprehensive \nmedical privacy legislation. In March 1999, I introduced S. 573, the \nMedical Information Privacy and Security Act, with Senators Kennedy, \nDaschle, Dorgan, Inouye, Johnson, Kerry and Wellstone, to establish the \nfirst comprehensive federal medical privacy law. This bill would close \nthe existing gaps in federal privacy laws to ensure the protection of \npersonally identifiable health information. Sadly, this legislation has \ngone nowhere, like all medical privacy legislation this Congress.\n  In fact, Congress gave itself three years to establish medical \nrecords privacy legislation, but by the August 21, 1999 deadline, \ncomprehensive medical records privacy rules did not exist. Instead the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, as directed by Congress, \ndrafted its own version. These placeholder privacy rules are better \nthan no rules at all, but in the long run, Congress--not a federal \nagency--should set the basic standards on medical privacy, so that \ndifferent administrations do not keep reducing the protections. I had \nhoped that the administrative rule-making process may finally prod \nCongress into action on a full-fledged policy, but as this Congress \nnears its conclusion, my optimism is waning.\n  Even this past summer, when the Senate had an opportunity to protect \nthe privacy of genetic information, it failed to do so. Senator Daschle \nintroduced an amendment, which I supported, to the FY 2001 Labor HHS \nAppropriations bill that would have protected private genetic \ninformation from insurance companies and employers using such \ninformation to discriminate against individuals or raise insurance \npremiums. The Senate failed to adopt the amendment and failed, once \nagain, to protect essential privacy rights.\n  Congress has spent too long defining the problem instead of fixing \nit. We have not moved tangibly toward solutions in the six years since \nI convened the first hearings on technology and medical records in \n1993. Since then a number of bills have been introduced--by myself and \nothers--but we have been unable to get the attention of the majority to \nmove this legislation.\n  In 1996 we tried to include medical privacy protections in the Health \nInsurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, HIPAA. Majority \nLeader Bob Dole at the time agreed with us that ``a compromise of \nprivacy'' that sends information about health and treatment to a \nnational data bank, without a person's approval, would be something \nthat none of us would accept. What we settled for in 1996 was a \nprovision requiring Congress to enact medical privacy legislation by \nAugust 21 of 1999. If the deadline was not met, which it was not, the \nAdministration then would be required to issue regulations by February \n21, 2000, to protect the privacy of electronic records, but not paper-\nbased medical records. This is the current, pitiful state of medical \nrecords privacy protection and it is clearly unacceptable.\n  The inexcusable failure to provide comprehensive medical records \nprivacy for three-years and the obstruction of the Financial \nInformation Privacy Act of 1999 are just two examples of this Congress' \nfailure to affirmatively and aggressively protect the fundamental \nprivacy rights of American citizens.\n  I regret that this Republican-led Congress has not chosen to act on \neven one of the multiple legislative proposals protecting consumer \nprivacy during the 106th Congress. It is my hope that we put partisan \npolitics aside in the 107th Congress and take a hard look at how we can \nand should protect the fundamental right of privacy in the 21st \nCentury. As each day passes, new financial services, new online \nservices, and new medical data bases are taking shape and institutional \npractices employing these new technologies are taking root. Unless we \ndecide that privacy is worth protecting--and soon--the erosion of our \nprivacy rights will become irreversible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/14/senate-section/article/S11779-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11779-S11780]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RETIREMENT OF SENATOR SPENCER ABRAHAM\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, when the 106th Congress adjourns, we will \nlose my colleague from Michigan, Senator Spencer Abraham. I want to pay \ntribute to Spence Abraham today.\n  Although we have divergent voting records on many national issues, \nwhen the interests of Michigan were at stake, we were usually able to \nwork together on behalf of our constituents. We and our staffs have \njoined forces on efforts to bring federal resources to Michigan for our \nhighways and transportation, to address agricultural emergencies, \neconomic development, airport modernization, the need for \ninfrastructure to protect the environment, particular issues affecting \nthe health of the Great Lakes and a broad array of other projects.\n  Spence Abraham served on the Senate Judiciary, Commerce, and Budget \nCommittees. In addition, we served together for the past six years on \nthe Small Business Committee where we worked together to support \nincreased funding for the Women's Business Centers program which helps \nentrepreneurs start and maintain successful businesses. There are three \nCenters in Michigan: the Center for Empowerment and Economic \nDevelopment, CEED, which houses the Women's Initiative for Self-\nEmployment, WISE, in Ann Arbor, the Grand Rapids Opportunities for \nWomen, GROW, in Grand Rapids, and The Detroit Entrepreneurship \nInstitute, Inc, DEO.\n  During this session of Congress, Spence and I worked together to get \n$2 million added to the Interior Appropriations bill to fund a \nsettlement between Michigan Indian tribes, the State of Michigan and \nthe federal government concerning fishing rights and, among other \nthings, the removal of tribal gill nets from the Great Lakes. At our \nurging, the FY 2001 Interior Appropriations Bill also contained report \nlanguage that directed the Bureau of Indian Affairs to include the \n``Great Lakes Fisheries Settlement agreement\n\n[[Page S11780]]\n\nin its fiscal year 2002 budget request.'' This amount should be $6.25 \nmillion for FY 2002.\n  We also successfully worked to continue the moratorium on unfair and \nineffective increases in CAFE standards and worked out a compromise in \nthe Senate to ensure that a National Academy of Sciences study of the \neffectiveness and impacts of CAFE standards will include the effect of \nthose standards on motor vehicle safety as well as discriminatory \nimpacts of those standards on the U.S. auto industry.\n  Also, since Spence served as Chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee's Subcommittee on Immigration, we worked together on amending \nSection 110 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nResponsibility Act of 1996 to ensure that Michiganders do not face \nmajor traffic delays at the Canadian border. The Immigration and \nNaturalization Service Data Management Improvement Act of 2000, which \nSpence Abraham introduced and I cosponsored, replaced the burdensome \nrequirements of Section 110 with a more manageable approach of \ncollecting data, one that would not result in border tie-ups or cause \nfinancial strain to Michigan jobs, exports, and tourism.\n  We worked together on behalf of Michigan veterans. Within the past \nyear, our staffs met with local officials to forge a successful \ncooperative effort to secure additional funding in Fiscal Year 2001 for \nthe planning and construction of a national cemetery in the Detroit \nMetropolitan area. Approximately 927,000 veterans live in Michigan, \n605,000 of whom reside in the Detroit metropolitan area and a national \ncemetery here is long overdue.\n  In his six years in the Senate, Spence Abraham earned a reputation as \na vigorous, perceptive and hard-working Member. He proudly holds the \nsecond longest record of consecutive votes cast among current Senators, \nhaving missed no votes in his term. He authored a number of pieces of \nlegislation, but I suspect none more important to him than the Hillory \nJ. Farias and Samantha Reid Date-Rape Drug Prohibition Act of 2000 \nnamed, in part, for Samantha Reid, a Rockwood, Michigan teenager who \ndied after drinking a soft drink she didn't know had been lace with a \nsubstance called GHB (Gamma Hydroxybutyric Acid). The Abraham law \namended the Controlled Substances Act of 1998 to add GHB, known as the \n``date rape drug'' to the list of Schedule One controlled substances.\n  Mr. President, as we note the contribution of Spence Abraham to our \nwork, my wife Barbara and I wish him, his wife Jane, their twin \ndaugthers, Julie and Betsy, and their son Spencer Robert well as they \nbegin the next chapter of their lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/14/senate-section/article/S11780-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11780]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, I want to pay tribute today to a retiring \ncolleague, my friend, Senator Frank Lautenberg.\n  I have served with Frank Lautenberg in the Senate for the past \neighteen years and watched him grow from a man of great accomplishment \nand success in the private sector to a highly effective and admired \npublic servant. Frank has left his mark of distinction on our nation's \nlaws in a number of areas reflecting his broad interests and expertise. \nHe has served as the Ranking Democrat on the Senate\n\n[[Page S11781]]\n\nBudget Committee, leading the Democrats in our efforts to fashion a \nfederal budget which meets our nation's priorities while working to pay \ndown the national debt. In addition, Frank is a leader on \ntransportation policy, gun safety, and environmental issues among \nothers.\n  Frank Lautenberg was the author of legislation which banned smoking \nAmerica's airlines, a wise action which all of us who fly appreciate \nmore and more each year as we learn about the effects of recirculated \ncigarette smoke. He wrote the bill which established the age of 21 as \nthe national legal drinking age, an action clearly responsible for the \nsaving of many American lives. And, he passed legislation to prohibit \nanyone convicted of domestic violence from owning a gun.\n  Senator Lautenberg, also led efforts in the Senate culminating in \npassage of the transportation bill and as the Ranking Member of the \nAppropriations Committee's Transportation Subcommittee, he has fought \nmany battles for sound investment in the nations' highways and as a \nparticular friend of mass transportation.\n  As the Ranking Democrat on the Senate's Budget Committee, Senator \nLautenberg has been a consistent voice in support of a balance budget, \npaying down the national debt, and investing in America's future. He \ncoauthored the historic Balance Budget Agreement of 1997.\n  Frank Lautenberg has served in the Senate since 1982. He is a friend \nand ally in many legislative battles whom I will miss deeply in the \nyears ahead. However, Frank is a man of tremendous energy and vision. \nThat energy and vision will continue to serve our nation because Frank \nLautenberg's love of this nation is so deep and abiding that as long as \nhe has breath he will be advancing its ideals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/14/senate-section/article/S11781-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  THE SUPREME COURT DECISION IN THE CASE OF BUSH VERSUS GORE AND ITS \n                               AFTERMATH\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am heartbroken that the Supreme Court \nhas issued an opinion that, to me, undermines a core democratic \nprinciple--that every vote counts and every vote must be counted.\n  I am also perplexed that the Court sent the case back to the Florida \nSupreme Court for further proceedings on the recount, since it did so \nwhile also suggesting that time had run out for the recount. That \nsuggestion is disingenuous, considering that the U.S. Supreme Court \nitself helped cause the clock to run out when it voted 5-4 to stop the \nrecount last Saturday by issuing a stay.\n  I want to compliment the four justices who voted against the stay \norder--Justices Stevens, Souter, Breyer and Ginsberg--two appointed by \nRepublican Presidents and two by a Democrat. While several of them \nrecognized constitutional problems in the way the recount was being \ncarried out, they clearly understood the overriding importance of \ncounting every legal vote.\n  In his dissenting opinion, Justice John Paul Stevens pointed out that \nthe Florida Supreme Court, in ordering the recount, merely ``. . . did \nwhat courts do--it decided the case before it in light of the \nlegislature's intent to leave no legally cast vote uncounted.''\n  He stated that in its action ``the majority effectively orders the \ndisenfranchisement of an unknown number of voters whose ballots reveal \ntheir intent--and are therefore legal votes under state law--but were \nfor some reason rejected by ballot-counting machines.''\n  The closing words of Justice Stevens, I believe, will go down in \nhistory as the thoughts of a great Supreme Court justice:\n\n       Although we may never know with complete certainty the \n     identity of the winner of this presidential election, the \n     identity of the loser is perfectly clear. It is the Nation's \n     confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of the rule \n     of law.\n\n  When the next President is sworn into office in January, I pledge to \ndo all that I can to help the country put this extraordinary and \nunsettling election behind us. I will do my best in the United States \nSenate to advance the interests of the people of California, who have \nso many needs and rights that remain to be addressed.\n  There are many lessons to be learned from these events. We need to \nchange our election procedures to make them uniformly as reliable and \naccurate as possible, so that we will never again be in this situation. \nAnd more Americans must now realize that their participation in the \npolitical process is vitally important. I will work on these challenges \nin the coming months, for the sake of Californians and for all \nAmericans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/14/senate-section/article/S11781-2", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11781-S11782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SENATOR CHUCK ROBB\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to my colleague on \nthe Armed Services and Intelligence Committees, Senator Chuck Robb. As \nhis career in the Senate comes to a close, Senator Robb leaves behind a \ncareer in public service that he and the Virginians he served so well \nshould be proud of.\n  Chuck Robb has served his nation as a United States Marine, as \nLieutenant Governor and Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia, and \nfor the last twelve years as a member of the United States Senate. \nChuck Robb has been a public servant in the truest sense. He has always \nput the nation's interest first, and self-interest last.\n  During the twelve years I have served with Senator Robb on the Armed \nServices Committee, he has proven himself to be a champion of a strong \nnational defense, of the men and women who wear our nation's uniform, \nand of his fellow veterans.\n  On the Armed Services Committee, he has been first and foremost a \ndevoted advocate of a strong Navy-Marine Corps team. While Senator Robb \nhas never been one to tout his own accomplishments, his pride in and \nlove for the United States Marine Corps is one thing he has never been \nable to hide.\n  Senator Robb has worked hard on military readiness, quality of life, \nand modernization. He sponsored the targeted recruiting and retention \nbonuses Congress enacted last year for critical skills where they would \nhave the most payoff for the military. He was a leader in providing \npromised health care benefits to military retirees. He has worked hard \nto get the Navy to develop a long term plan to fund enough ships to \nmaintain the Navy we need for the future, and on securing additional \nfunds to keep the ships we have today ready. And he has been a leading \nproponent of making our defense budget as efficient as possible and has \npushed the Defense Department to rigorously examine both their strategy \nand their organization.\n  Chuck Robb has devoted enormous time and energy to America's national \nsecurity. He is the only Senator ever to serve on the Armed Services, \nIntelligence, and Foreign Relations Committees simultaneously. On \ncountless occasions we have benefitted from having his voice of reason \nand experience at the table.\n  Chuck Robb has never forgotten America's POWs and MIAs and their \nfamilies. Both as a member of the Armed Services Committee and the \nSelect Committee on POW/MIA affairs, he has devoted himself to a full \naccounting for our soldiers who are still missing in action.\n  While Senator Robb is best known as a champion of a strong national \ndefense, he has been much more than that. During his Senate career he \nhas worked hard to make America stronger in every way. Senator Robb has \ndevoted himself to making the United States a more productive nation \nand, more importantly, a more just nation.\n  Both as Governor and as a Senator, Chuck Robb has been a strong voice \nfor protecting the environment, for civil rights, for improving \neducation for both students and teachers, and for putting new \ntechnology to work for our students, our military, and our nation.\n  Chuck Robb has been a leader in fighting discrimination against \nAfrican American farmers, in expanding opportunities for women and \nminorities at both the federal and state government levels, and in \nhonoring courageous civil rights leaders including Martin Luther King, \nJr.\n  He is also renowned for his steadfast devotion to fiscal discipline. \nChuck Robb has never been afraid to cast an unpopular vote to restrain \nspending or reject unwise or unaffordable tax cuts. Senator Robb was \nsteadfast in his belief that we have an obligation to pay for the \nprograms we enact rather than\n\n[[Page S11782]]\n\npassing the costs on to our children. I hope he will take pride in he \nrole he played during his twelve years in the Senate in turning record \ndeficits into a record surplus.\n  He displayed that same political courage on the Armed Services \nCommittee. Representing a state with numerous military installations, \nSenator Robb has nevertheless joined with Senator McCain and me in our \nefforts to allow the Defense Department to close excess military bases, \nbecause he knows it is the sensible thing to do. In his four years as \nthe Ranking Minority Member on the Readiness Subcommittee he has also \nbeen a strong advocate of our committee's policy of only funding those \nmilitary construction projects that have the highest priority in the \nmilitary's plans, even though that required him sometimes to say ``no'' \nto his colleagues.\n  I shall miss Chuck Robb more than these words will be able to \nexpress. He has personally inspired and supported me as ranking member \non the Senate Armed Services Committee.

Mr. President, as the Roman statesman, Cicero said \n``Memory is the treasury and guardian of all things.'' I believe we as \nhumans often take our ability to remember for granted. Throughout the \npast century, we have been blessed with many scientific innovations and \ndiscoveries. Large strides have been made in the medical area that have \nhelped to improve the quality of life for all the people of the world. \nMemory is an essential function of our human experience. The loss of \nmemory is certainly a tragedy. Thankfully, there are those who are \nconducting research who endeavor to understand the memory process and \nseek to solve memory disorders and loss. For instance, last year \nCongress appropriated $17.7 billion to the National Institutes of \nHealth to fund scientific research. A portion of that funding is used \nfor studies working to gain a better understanding of memory.\n  I have recently read an essay entitled ``Musings on Memory'' by Dr. \nMorris Martin and was intrigued by the author's insights on memory. \nThis essay was read before the Literary Club of Tucson, Arizona, on \nNovember 20, 2000. Dr. Martin is a professor of history having taught \nat Princeton University. He received his degrees from Oxford in \nEngland. His essay explores the many aspects of memory and the \nimportance it has played throughout the history of the world. I would \nlike to share his wisdom with my colleagues in the Senate and ask that \nthe article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows.\n\n                           Musings on Memory\n\n                           (By Morris Marton)\n\n       Elephants, they say, never forget, and maybe amoebas \n     remember in some amoebic fashion. But that, is beyond my \n     scope. Human history, personality, our rich individuality, \n     all derive in some measure from memory. The Greeks, as usual, \n     got it right. Certainly by the time of Hesiod around 700 B.C. \n     with that instinct for clarification that distinguishes them, \n     the Greeks had drawn up the family tree of Memory. Mnemosyne, \n     Memory, was the wife of Zeus and the mother of the Muses--\n     Poetry, Literature, Music, Dance, Tragedy, Comedy etc. all \n     nine of them, which of course, makes Memory the mother of \n     Culture. Being the wife of Zeus also made her respectable, an \n     Olympian goddess. But her origins go further back beyond the \n     Olympians, to her brother Kronos, the chief of the \n     disreputable Titans, whose very shady origins lie somewhere \n     among the very unGreek Hittites of Asia Minor. Her father was \n     Uranos (Heaven) and her mother was Gaia (Earth) and further \n     back than that no one can go. It was the Greek way of saying \n     what today's scientists say that Memory derives from the \n     neural connections that pass from the primitive limbic area \n     to the hippocampus via the amygdala. They use Greek words, \n     but the Greeks said the same thing more simply and much more \n     picturesquely.\n       Memory for them went back to the Earth Mother and was the \n     womb of Culture. It is the original collector and transmitter \n     of experience. Before writing culture depended on tremendous \n     memories. We know of the Bards who traveled from village to \n     village rewriting those tales of valor or of wondrous events, \n     which became the Iliad and the Odyssey. Milman Parry, the \n     American scholar, threw light on this when in the Thirties he \n     discovered the practice still alive in the Balkans among the \n     Serbian Muslims. Memory is still the backbone of tradition \n     among the Indian Brahmins who memorize tens of thousands of \n     lines of the Bhagavad Gita or the Ramayana, or of ribbis who \n     memorize the Torah.\n       Memory was Queen until Writing was invented. Again the \n     Greeks with uncanny precision traced writing back to Egypt, \n     though the Chaldeans of Ur anticipated the Egyptians in \n     making scratches on baked tablets. Plato in the person of \n     Socrates tells how Thoth, the Egyptian god who invented \n     writing, was reproached by Thamus, the king of Egypt, ``This \n     discovery of yours will create forgetfulness in he learners' \n     souls, because they will not use their memories; they will \n     trust to the external written characters and not remember of \n     themselves . . . They will be tiresome company, having the \n     show of wisdom without the reality.''\n       So fast forward to our own day. The written or printed word \n     has taken the place of memory for a majority of our needs. \n     The computer has added a further layer of incompetence to our \n     thinking. ``It's on the net, I don't have to remember it.'' \n     That is the mantra today of too often. It was the written \n     word that started mankind on the downward slope to Lethe or \n     Forgetfulness\n\n\n                personal memory; its length and validity\n\n       In terms of personal historical memory, how far back can we \n     moderns remember? We all have examples of this on which you \n     might ponder. For instance my father on his 90th birthday in \n     1962 gathered his four sons and their wives around him in his \n     much-loved garden in Kent and reminisced about his father and \n     grandfather. We were transported back to the Battle of \n     Waterloo in 1815, the funeral of the Duke of Wellington in \n     1851, tales of London life and family anecdotes which would \n     have perished with him a few years later, but for Cadmus' \n     invention and my wife's shorthand. Those memories are now \n     recorded and can be passed on to future generations. How far \n     back can such memories go? I remember meeting a delightful \n     old lady in the Forties who told me proudly that as a baby \n     she had been held in the arms of President Lincoln. Search \n     your own minds for the earliest event, which you can remember \n     in this way, personally or anecdotally. And remember that Roy \n     Drachman lunched with Wyatt Earp!\n       However, I think I can cap anything you may come up with. \n     In February of this year 2000 the London Times recorded the \n     following. It described a man now living who as a child made \n     a disparaging remark about Oliver Cromwell. A lady present \n     said firmly, ``Never speak ill of that great man. My \n     husband's first wide's first husband knew Oliver Cromwell and \n     liked him well.'' At the dawn of this new century someone \n     living today can recall a single matrimonial generation \n     linked directly with the mid-17th century. How can that be? \n     The remark was made in 1923 by a lady born in 1832. At the \n     age of 16 (i.e. in 1848) she had married an 80-year old man \n     named Henry. Sixty-four years earlier in 1784 young Henry had \n     married for reasons, which remain obscure, an 82-year old \n     woman. Her first marriage, in 1720 was to an 80-year-old who \n     had served Cromwell before his death in 1658. We have a \n     memory going back 342 years from the present day. It should \n     be a warning to us not to disregard oral traditions, which \n     can stretch over what appear to be impossibly long \n     generations.\n\n\n                              group memory\n\n       Communal or tribal memories can be even longer. Our common \n     law reflects a time when memory was the official legal \n     linkage of the centuries. Blackstone in his Commentaries \n     dealing with land tenure says that some claims can go post \n     hominum memoriam. Or ``Time whereof the memory of man runneth \n     not to the contrary.'' Tribal memories run very deep. They \n     became tradition. Then they can illuminate or bedevil the \n     present. They can make Fourth of July picnics or they can \n     raise the Confederate Flag. Irish Protestants refight the \n     Battle of the Boyne of 1690 each marching season to the \n     dismay of those who would build a new future for Ireland. \n     Serbs fight for Kosovo, recalling the battle in 1389 which \n     was actually a defeat but which has been transformed into a \n     victory in national memory. Sixhundred years later this \n     memory gave the emotional surge to the Serbian claim to the \n     Province of Kosovo which involved twenty nations in \n     contesting it. Sentiment in the heart often transforms memory \n     in the head. This year the British celebrated the 60th \n     anniversary of the ``Miracle of Dunkirk'' while the French \n     looked on with a jaundiced eye, as being in their memory the \n     betrayed of France by a retreating ally.\n       Now let us turn to the relation of Memory to the writing of \n     History.\n       History and historical writing begin as Memory plus \n     editorial slant. The good historian will do his best to be \n     aware of his bias. Herodotus is known as a father of History \n     since he collected the stories told him by all and sundry, \n     but often added a skeptical comment or two here and there to \n     the effect ``I find this hard to believe.'' Thucydides was\n\n[[Page S11783]]\n\n     the first scientific historian to evaluate memory. He wrote, \n     ``I have described nothing but what I either saw myself, or \n     learned from others of whom I made the most careful and \n     particular inquiry. The task was a laborious one as \n     eyewitnesses gave different accounts of the same occurrence, \n     as they remembered or were interested in the actions of one \n     side or another.'' Many centuries later the German historian \n     Ranke decided to write history ``wie es eigentlich geschah.'' \n     (As it actually happened). It turned out to have a very \n     Prussian tinge.\n       Judges know the unreliability of witnesses to the same \n     event. Each sees something; no one sees everything. Time \n     edits memory to fit bias. Selected past memories shape our \n     present thought and behavior. The generation of the \n     Depression of the Thirties switches off electric lights, \n     keeps its credit cards in balance, thinks waste is wicked--I \n     can hear my mother saying it--spends cautiously and generally \n     disapproves of the openhanded expenditure of today. And \n     believes it the one true way of life, so strong is the \n     imprinted record of the past on memory and behavior.\n       When historians turned from personal memory to contemporary \n     written records they felt they moved a large step nearer to \n     authenticity. I spent much time examining Greek inscriptions, \n     gravestones, temple financial records on almost illegible \n     pieces of marble, with the feeling that I was in touch with \n     historical facts. But I found they also needed a lot of \n     interpretation! In this connection and to show what original \n     and unusual truths we learn from ancient records, may I \n     recall, as I remember it, the earliest Egyptian papyrus. It \n     is said to read ``The times are very evil. Children no longer \n     obey their parents. And the price of wheat is outrageous.'' \n     Plus ca change, plus c'est la meme chose!\n\n\n                         memory and the senses\n\n       On the personal level the senses are often the emotional \n     adhesive that enables us to retain past events in our \n     consciousness. Our first paycheck. Our first baby. I remember \n     my first girl friend, though I cannot recall our first kiss. \n     Whenever I hear Bach's Mass in B Minor I experience again the \n     shiver of excitement that was mine when I first heard the \n     Sanctus in the old Queen's Hall in London. ``Music when soft \n     voices die, Vibrates in the memory'', says Shelley. ``Odours, \n     when sweet violets sicken. Live within the sense they \n     quicken.'' The smell of fresh bread recalls the French-Swiss \n     bakery where I bought our breakfast ``brotchen'' when I was \n     living in Bern. The smell of garbage brings back a picture of \n     the vast dump outside New York City as I passed it frequently \n     on the Turnpike driving in from Princeton. In the intricate \n     mechanism of memory all the senses play their part as glue \n     and as signals of familiarity. You will supply examples from \n     your own experience.\n\n\n                          photographic memory\n\n       Have you ever met anyone with a really photographic memory? \n     Thomas Babington Lord Macaulay, the Victorian historian, was \n     said to be able to read a page of print and to recall it \n     perfectly from one reading. Saint Augustine writes with \n     admiration of a friend who could recite the whole text of \n     Vergil--backwards! Not a very enlightening party trick. There \n     is a recent example in the story of The Professor and the \n     Madman. You remember Sir James Murray, the first editor and \n     father of the Oxford English Dictionary had a brilliant \n     reader who supplied him with examples of literary usage. It \n     was years before they met. Only then did Sir James find that \n     the reader was confined to a mental Hospital as a hopeless \n     schizophrenic but with a remarkable almost photographic \n     memory.\n       Such ability may well be a disadvantage. The capacity to \n     forget is almost as important as to remember. Otherwise we \n     would be cluttered with useless facts and unable to \n     distinguish significant from worthless. Simonides offered to \n     teach the statesman Themistocles the art of Memory, \n     Themistocles refused, ``Teach me not the art of remembering \n     but the art of forgetting'' was his reply. ``For I remember \n     things I do not wish to remember, but I cannot forget things \n     I wish to forget.'' William James, in more modern times said, \n     ``In the practical use of our intellect, forgetting is as \n     important a function as remembering.''\n\n\n                         how to improve memory\n\n       For those of us with lesser capacity, there have been \n     throughout history methods of strengthening and supporting \n     memory. Myself when young, and probably all of us, learnt our \n     multiplication tables by rote. I was also introduced to \n     English history by memorizing the Kings and Queens of England \n     in a rhyme:\n\n     ``William the Conqueror from Normandy came,\n     His son William Rufus while hunting was slain,\n     Henry the First was for wisdom renowned,\n     Stephen instead of Matilda was crowned * * *\n     The Magna Charta was signed by John,\n     Which Henry the Second put his seal upon etc. etc.\n\n       You I trust were brought up on\n\n     ``In 14 hundred and 92\n     Columbus sailed the ocean blue * * *.\n\n       I learnt my Greek irregular verbs by reciting them in \n     chorus with all the rest of the class at my London school. \n     Saturday mornings (we went to school on Saturdays in those \n     good old days) we were called on to recite a piece of great \n     verse which we had learnt the previous night and declaim it \n     in the almost empty Great Hall to our class mates. It was a \n     valuable lesson and I have portions of it still tucked \n     away on the dusty shelves of my memory.\n       Learning by rote has fallen out of favor as a pedagogic \n     tool in our sophisticated West, but not everywhere in the \n     world. On the island of Lamu off the coast of Kenya, I heard \n     a murmur of voices coming from a building and looked in to \n     find a school of very young boys chanting passages from the \n     Koran, which they had had to memorize. Memories of Greek \n     verbs came back and I wished them well.\n       In my youth I remember a card game called ``Pelmanism'' \n     which by memorizing and reidentifying like cards with like \n     was said to be highly effective. Association of the less \n     familiar with the more familiar is a method we all use. \n     Politicians have their tricks for remembering names and \n     winning votes. Cicero for the very practical purpose of being \n     a public orator considered Memory one of the five parts of \n     rhetoric, which was his profession. He embellished the \n     ``architectural'' art of memory invented by Quintillian. \n     Think of a large building with many rooms. Take each point of \n     your speech and connect it with an object--a spear, an \n     anchor, a picture--and put each mentally in a different room. \n     Then as you speak, mentally walk from room to room, the \n     object you have placed in each will recall the next point of \n     your speech. This system, refined, is still in use in \n     training memory. We all create mental pegs upon which to hang \n     data. B.F. Skinner, the psychologist, as a very old man did \n     this not metaphorically but literally. He would listen to the \n     weather forecast on the radio and should it be for rain, he \n     would immediately rise and hang his umbrella on the door \n     handle. The older we get, the more we need such association. \n     I find I frequently go through several steps of association \n     to recall names. I can forget John Schafer's name but as he \n     approaches, I look in the memory box named ``University''. \n     Smaller box labeled ``President.'' I mentally take out \n     Koffler, No, Harvil, No, Pacheco, No, Likens, No.'' There is \n     only one name left in the box. Of course that process, \n     accompanied by a blank look which changes to recognition, \n     used to be completed in an invisible flash. Now it takes two, \n     three or four flashes. Bear with me.\n       Nowadays, of course, a pill is recommended for \n     strengthening the memory. I received a pharmaceutical \n     suggestion of this sort this week, extensively illustrated \n     and expensively produced. I am skeptical of its potency.\n\n\n                         Memory and the Future\n\n       Memory we naturally assume deals only with the past. Lewis \n     Carroll's White Queen in Alice in Wonderland felt this was a \n     very limited idea. ``There's one great advantage to living \n     backwards, one's memory works both ways,'' she remarks.\n       ``I'm sure mine only works one way,'' says Alice. ``I can't \n     remember things before they happen.''\n       ``It's a poor sort of memory that only works backwards,'' \n     the Queen remarked.\n       ``What sort of things do you remember best'', asked Alice.\n       ``Oh, things that happened the week after next,'' said the \n     Queen.\n       Here, of course, Lewis Carroll is playing with the concept \n     of Time, as in ``Jam yesterday, jam tomorrow, but never jam \n     today.''\n       But there is something, which we might describe as a form \n     of memory of the future. We call it imagination, which \n     projects past data instead of merely collecting and \n     organizing it as does the memory.\n       Art draws on both imagination and memory. Think of the \n     combination of memorizing and recreating a great play that \n     goes into an actor's performance. Daniel Barenboim at the age \n     of seven began to memorize all Mozart's works. At eighteen he \n     had mastered the whole corpus. Constant practice fixes the \n     memory in the muscles. A wellknown pianist was suddenly \n     called on to play a certain concerto. He declined saying, ``I \n     have it in my head, but not yet in my fingers.'' When it is \n     in the fingers there is no effort to remember; the music can \n     be fully endowed with the feeling the artist desires.\n       Shakespeare asked the question ``Tell me where is fancy \n     bred? Or in the heart or in the head? How begot? How \n     nourished? Reply. Reply'' He replied ``It is engendered in \n     the eyes.'' He did not say ``In the hippocampus or the \n     amygdala?'' The mystery of artistic imagination and its \n     relation to memory still resists a mechanistic \n     interpretation.\n\n\n                          the future of memory\n\n       As far as information goes, so the experts inform me, \n     before long we shall all be able to have the Encyclopedia on \n     a chip along with the corpus of English literature, all the \n     mathematical formulae required to do advanced physics and all \n     the telephone numbers in the world. Anything you want can be \n     provided on a chip. All you have to do is click on and scroll \n     down. Since the amount of information is limited only by the \n     capacity of the chip--which I am told, will increase a \n     thousandfold or more in the next six months--it is likely it \n     can be carried in a wristwatch slightly smaller than a Rolex, \n     or, in time, implanted in the hippocampus or the amygdala or \n     any vacant spot in the brain. And Memory will have become a \n     vermiform appendix to the computer. I do not look forward to \n     that day. Princeton, I am distressed to learn has just spent \n     two million dollars on an MRI which they have enthroned in a \n     new Center for the Study of Brain, Mind and Behavior allied, \n     alas, to the Department of Humanities. The first area of\n\n[[Page S11784]]\n\n     research, according to the New York Times, is to be the brain \n     wave that normal people call ``Love''. Our world is convinced \n     that when we know the ``how'' of our psyche, we shall know \n     the ``what'' and the ``why''. I am not convinced. I hope and \n     trust that should the day come when we understand all \n     mechanisms, measure all wave-lengths, and plot all emotional \n     outcomes, we as individuals will still be the masters that \n     issue the commands that set in motion the neurological \n     synapses which capture memory, enlighten meaning and in \n     general make life human. May we continue to remember as much \n     as is necessary of what we need to remember and forget that \n     which is forgettable, and be kind to those whose advancing \n     years rob them, from time to time of your name, and even of \n     their own.\n       And may music still vibrate in the memory and William the \n     Conqueror still come from Normandy and Columbus in 1492 still \n     sail the ocean blue, and Greek verbs still be memorable and \n     may computers fail to find out how to be masters of our \n     consciousness.\n       We have had a pleasant half-hour wandering, somewhat \n     disjointedly, through the groves of Memory. Let me close with \n     a poem on the subject by a neglected Twentieth century poet. \n     It is appropriately called ``Memory.''\n\n     Wind, west wind, of an evening\n     Whispering through the tall trees,\n     Tell me tales I used to hear told\n     By the vagabond Sussex breeze,\n     Lifting the layers of silence,\n     And letting them softly lie,\n     Passing into the stillness that comes\n     When whispers softly die.\n     And I'll see the woods where we wandered\n     And wake with a lonely heart\n     As the wind of memory passes through\n     The tall trees of my heart.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/14/senate-section/article/S11784-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11784]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNIZING MICHAEL O'CONNOR\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to commend an \nindividual who has provided immeasurable service to the family farmers \nand ranchers in my home state of South Dakota over the past eight \nyears. Mr. Michael O'Connor has been the South Dakota State Executive \nDirector for the Farm Service Agency, FSA, of United States Department \nof Agriculture, USDA. He was originally named the South Dakota State \nExecutive Director of the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation \nService of USDA by President Clinton in 1993. His current \nresponsibilities include supervising activity in 60 county FSA field \noffices across the state.\n  As this Administration draws to a close, we sadly must say goodbye to \nsome experienced, tireless, and talented people who have dedicated \ntheir professional careers to public service. Mike is one of those \npublic servants, and so on behalf of the citizens of South Dakota, it \nis my honor to express our sincere gratitude to Mike O'Connor for his \ncountless contributions and achievements.\n  Throughout his career Mike has aggressively served the agricultural \ncommunity in South Dakota through positions of leadership in the South \nDakota Farmers Union, the Clay-Union Electric Board of Directors, the \nSouth Dakota Corn Utilization Council Board of Directors, and the Union \nCounty Pork Producers. He also served in as a representative in South \nDakota Legislature from 1987-1993.\n  Moreover, Mike, his wife Janelle, and their family have devoted their \nlives to production agriculture, operating a diversified grain and \nlivestock farm for over 30 years near Alcester, South Dakota.\n  Mike has been a valuable resource for me and a determined advocate of \nfamily farmers as we developed and implemented farm programs. He is \nconstantly trying to improve the delivery system with the interests of \nfamily farmers close to his heart, always searching for ways to \nimplement programs that are fair and equitable to all. Mike exhibits \nthe courage to take on the status quo, and demonstrates a will to \nensure integrity in program delivery for agricultural producers.\n  Mike has guided innumerable disaster and assistance programs from the \nfederal level to local disbursement in South Dakota. He and his top-\nnotch staff have been asked to implement these ad hoc disaster programs \nin addition to the day-to-day administrative requirements of current \nfarm and conservation programs. From marketing loans and loan \ndeficiency payments to production flexibility contract payments and \nmarket loss payments, to loan and conservation programs, to crop loss \ndisaster payments, Mike has seen it all. He has worked with his \nstatewide staff to administer these programs and distribute payments in \nan effective, timely fashion to South Dakota farmers. In this last \nfiscal year alone, the South Dakota FSA, under Mike's direction, has \ndelivered over $750 million to farm program participants in South \nDakota. Mere words cannot describe everything that Mike has done to \nserve the farmers and ranchers in South Dakota through such an awful \nperiod of economic distress. Mike is as respected in Washington, D.C. \nas he is in South Dakota, and his working knowledge of the intricacies \nof farm bill will be missed.\n  Therefore, it is with a sense of pride and yet, regret, that I wish \nMike well in his future endeavors.\n  Mr. President, I thank you and wish Mike, Janelle, and their family \nsuccess in their future plans. I know that we will continue to work \ntogether, as Mike will continue to provide a respected opinion that I \nwill seek out during the upcoming Congressional farm bill debate. On \nbehalf of the people of South Dakota, I want to thank Mike for being a \ntrue public servant who has helped improve the quality of life for \nfarmers and ranchers all across South Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/14/senate-section/article/S11784-2", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11784]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    A TRIBUTE TO DANIEL GREELEY III\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to Daniel Greeley III, of Peterborough, New Hampshire. A Navy \nPetty Officer 3rd Class Division who was serving on the U.S.S. Cole \nwhen it was attacked on October 12th, 2000. Daniel is in his 1st year \nof a six-year enlistment, after having served three years in the United \nStates Coast Guard.\n  Daniel was one of the engine room mechanics on shift when the attack \nhappened. Even though he was on the other side of the ship, the blast \nwaves hit him hard. He suffered cuts and bruises, but nothing nearly as \nserious as his friends and shipmates. Four of Daniel Greeley's closest \nfriends were killed by the blast. Even after the blast had left a hole \nmeasuring 40 feet wide, and 40 feet high, Daniel as well as the other \nsailors of the U.S.S Cole pushed on.\n  After the blast, the sailors worked frantically to keep the ship \nafloat until it could be brought to safety. As one of the engine room \nmechanics, Daniel was forced to push on through the crisis to keep \ngenerators running and the boat from going under. He had the lives of \nmore than 200 sailors depending on his skills as an engine room \nmechanic. Daniel persevered well through the night and into the early \nmorning, facing adversity head on and pushing through.\n  Daniel's actions and bravery speak volumes of his character. Not only \nhas he elected to serve our country, but has done so in a noble manner. \nHe is a true inspiration to the people of New Hampshire. He can hold \nhis head high, knowing he has done his wife Mary, and 14-month-old \ndaughter Angelina proud. As Daniel continues his service, I wish him \ncontinued success. He will begin his ACNR schooling in January, an \nundoubtedly will continue to serve his country with honor and grace. As \na fellow sailor, I salute Daniel Greeley III. It is an honor to \nrepresent him in the United States Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/14/senate-section/article/S11784-3", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11784-S11785]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO BRIAN KUEHL\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to bid farewell to a \nkey member of my staff, Brian Kuehl. I will deeply miss Brian, both \nprofessionally and personally.\n  Brian has worked for me for four years, most recently as my \nLegislative Director, and before that as Acting Chief of Staff and as a \nsenior Legislative Assistant. He gave his heart and soul to me, to his \ncolleagues, and, most importantly, to the people of Montana. During \nthis time, he has proven himself to be a consensus builder--a tireless \nprofessional who brings together people with diverse points of view and \nwho solves problems in innovative ways. He is fair-minded, balanced, \ncreative, and a leader in every sense of the word.\n  Wallace Stegner defined himself as a citizen of the West. Brian fits \nthat mold. Brian came to me from Bozeman, Montana. He attended law \nschool in Colorado and has family roots in Utah and throughout the \nnorthwest. His wife is a fifth generation Wyoming native\n\n[[Page S11785]]\n\nand daughter of former Governor Mike Sullivan. In fact, they are moving \nto Sheridan, Wyoming, where they will soon have their first child.\n  As a citizen of the West, Brian has chosen to tackle those issues \nthat most often divide westerners--natural resources, energy, and the \nenvironment. Time and again, his ability to bring people together has \ndemonstrated that the West need not be divided on these issues--that we \ncan and must work together if we are to build a sustainable region with \na society as inspiring as our landscape.\n  Let me mention a few examples of the significant solutions that Brian \nhas helped forge over the last four years.\n  When Brian joined me in the spring of 1997, he had just helped broker \na compromise among the White House, regional conservation \norganizations, and a large mining company, Battle Mountain Gold, that \nwould conserve an area next to Cooke City, Montana, right on the \ndoorstep of Yellowstone National Park. The proposed New World gold mine \nhad been immensely controversial, with the project expected to generate \nmillions of tons of acidic mine waste. Across the West, controversies \nsuch as this usually drag on endlessly, dividing communities and \ndraining resources.\n  Brian had worked closely with all the actors while he was in the non-\nprofit sector. His first task in my office was to help secure approval \nof this agreement in the Congress. In the end, Congress funded the \npublic commitment and also agreed to invest funds to rehabilitate the \nGoing-to-the-Sun Road to compensate local communities for lost economic \nopportunities.\n  What a great start to Brian's tenure here.\n  In 1997 and 1998, Brian helped me pass legislation to complete the \nfinal phase of the Gallatin II Land Exchange--one of the most complex \nand multifaceted land exchanges ever completed by the Forest Service. \nBrian worked tirelessly with all of the interests in this exchange--\nsportsmen, conservationists, the snowmobile community, the timber \nindustry, local ranchers, and local homeowners. Ultimately, the \nGallatin II Land Exchange became law. We secured a tremendous resource \nfor our children and grandchildren. And every interest concerned \nsupported the compromises that Brian helped forge.\n  In 1998, Brian helped me with legislation on another series of land \nexchanges near Helena, Montana, at the Canyon Ferry Reservoir. Working \nwith the cabin owners and local sportsmen, Brian helped me create a \nnovel arrangement that was supported by everyone involved.\n  These are just a few illustrations of the many significant \ncontributions Brian Kuehl has made to me and to the people of Montana. \nI thank Brian for those contributions. I thank him for serving as role \nmodel for the younger staff in my office. I thank him for his service \nas a key advisor to me.\n  Albert Einstein once said, ``Try not to become a man of success, but \nrather try to become a man of value.'' Well, Brian has demonstrated \nboth success and value over the past four years. I wish the best for \nBrian, his wife Michelle, and their soon to be born child.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/14/senate-section/article/S11785-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11785]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         RECOGNITION OF THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF COMMUNITY BANK\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I stand here today to recognize \nan institution that has remained a staple in Carmichaels and the \nSouthwestern Corner of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for the past \none hundred years. Community Bank, N.A. has persevered through \nrecessions, depressions, World Wars, other failed financial \ninstitutions, bank foreclosures, market chaos, and mergers and \nacquisitions without ever having to close its doors. Community Bank, \nN.A. remains a consistent financial force to its community by providing \nsound, uninterrupted service to its customers for one hundred years. I \nwould like to warmly congratulate this financial institution for its \nsolid judgement and thoughtful service to the people of Southwestern \nPennsylvania. Community Bank is not only a reliable bank, but is a \nfriendly neighbor and has truly contributed to the history and hometown \natmosphere of Carmichaels and other communities in which the bank \nserves.\n  When The First National Bank of Carmichaels opened its doors for \nbusiness on July 1, 1901, Frank Mitchener was elected president of the \nBoard of Directors, and J. Ewing Baily was its first vice president. \nStephen A. Burtner served as treasurer and the remainder of the \noriginal board was comprised of Samuel Bunting, Isaac B. Patterson, \nGeorge W. Strawn, N.H. Biddle and Oscar Hartley. Mr. Dowlin drove a \nbuckboard to the Farmer's and Drovers Bank in Waynesburg to get the \ncash for opening day. Forty-one original stockholders combined to give \nthe bank a capital stock of $25,000.\n  Richard L. Baily, kin of one of the original founders, and former \nbank president and Chairman of the Board for over 70 years, is known in \nSouthwestern Pennsylvania for his selfless service to the communities \nin which the bank serves. Baily tells the story of a lady who once came \nto the bank to borrow money to buy shoes so her children could go to \nschool. Her husband was unemployed and they lived in a rented house, \nbut she had heard the bank loaned money for worthwhile causes. ``I \ndidn't think I needed to review her assets, and I'm sure she would not \n[have understood] the term, collateral,'' Baily said. He loaned her the \nmoney, and the woman, like most other townsfolk, has remained loyal to \nthe hometown bank that has been loyal to them, in good economic times \nand bad. The tradition of local loyalty and service continued through \nCharles R. Baily (son of Richard) whom also formerly served as a \ndirector and chairman of the bank's board. ``Community bank is a local \nlandmark that provides financial direction and services to our \ncommunity friends and neighbors. Hometown commitment has been our \nbank's pledge for the past 100 years, and that's what it will continue \nto be,'' says Community Bank Chairman/CEO Ralph J. Sommers, Jr.\n  Known as Community Bank, N.A. since September 1987 (a change in name \nonly to better reflect its larger community growth), the locally-owned \nand operated financial institution has had a consistent growth in \nassets, staff, geographic market area, and the numbers of civic and \ncommunity organizations to which it has contributed.\n  Today, Community Bank, N.A. has some $220 million in assets, is \npublicly traded as CMYC, boasts 10 branches in Greene and Washington \nCounties, employs about 100 people in satisfying jobs, and contributes \nthousands of dollars and many people-hours to scores of local civic, \ncharitable, and philanthropic organizations.\n  The bank's growth is largely attributed to sound management \npractices, investments in technology, and community commitment at every \nlevel. Local deposits remain in the communities the bank serves in an \neffort to better improve the economic vibrancy of local businesses and \nthe quality of life of residents. Unquestionably, the bank's most \nvaluable assets--its customers, employees, and shareholders--\ncollectively play an integral role in the prosperity of the bank and \nthe communities it serves. The pioneering spirit of that first group of \nfounders in Carmichaels continues in those who have followed, with \nunparalleled customer service and a community commitment of an \nincalculable life expectancy.\n  From this amount of information, you can see what a huge role that \nCommunity Bank has played in the establishment of the economy and \nhistory in Greene and Washington Counties. They are not just a \nfinancial institution, but a reliable and friendly staple to the people \nof the area. I enthusiastically ask my colleagues to join me in \ncommending Community Bank as they celebrate their Centennial.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/14/senate-section/article/S11785-2", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11785-S11786]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IN RECOGNITION OF CAROLE ANDERSON GRAVES\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize \nCarole Anderson Graves, as she is honored by the Beta Alpha Omega \nChapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority in cooperation with the New \nJersey Performing Arts Center during the 3rd Annual Kwanza Festival \nhonoring the community elders of Newark, New Jersey.\n  Our cities and towns are constantly in need of individuals willing to \ngive of themselves for the benefit of the community at-large. The \nindividuals who fulfill this need are the volunteers and the public \nservants who improve the\n\n[[Page S11786]]\n\nworld around us in ways that often go unseen. It therefore fitting that \nfrom time to time we take a moment to recognize their efforts.\n  Carole Anderson Graves has an extensive record of service to the \nNewark community. Since 1995, she has served as the Essex County \nRegister of Deeds and Mortgages. In that capacity, Mrs. Graves has \noverseen the recording, filing and preserving of all property \ntransactions within the 22 municipalities of Essex County.\n  Mrs. Graves also has given great deal to the furtherance of education \nin the Newark area. For nine years, Mrs. Graves was employed as a \nSpecial Education teacher at the Dayton Street School and spent twenty-\nseven years as the full-time President of the Newark Teachers Union. \nShe is also an adjunct professor/lecturer of Labor Relations at Essex \nCounty Community College and Rutgers Institute of Labor and Management \nRelations.\n  The city of Newark has been truly fortunate to have someone of the \ntalents and dedication of Mrs. Graves within the community. It is an \nhonor to be able to recognize her on this special occasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/14/senate-section/article/S11786-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11786]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IN MEMORY OF GREGORY W.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Dallas \nTonsager for his years of extraordinary public service as South \nDakota's State Director of the United States Department of \nAgriculture's, USDA, Rural Development, RD, office. Dallas has been a \ntireless advocate on behalf of rural communities and area residents. \nHis commitment and dedication to ensure the long-term viability of \nrural communities will continue to cultivate opportunities for rural \ngrowth and prosperity for many years to come. Dallas has earned the \nrespect and friendship of those who know him in South Dakota, \nWashington, D.C. and around the country. On behalf of the citizens of \nSouth Dakota, it is my honor to express our sincere gratitude to Dallas \nTonsager for his countless contributions and achievements.\n  In 1993, President Clinton asked Dallas to bring his talent, \nintegrity, ingenuity, and initiative to federal service to help the \nAdministration address the concerns of Rural America. Dallas accepted \nthe challenge and was appointed director of the former South Dakota \nFarmers Home Administration by President Clinton. Currently he oversees \napproximately 80 employees across the state in several Rural \nDevelopment offices. Prior to his USDA service, Dallas was a two-term \nSouth Dakota Farmers Union President, first elected in 1987. Dallas, \nhis wife Sharon, and their family continue to actively participate in a \ndiversified family farm partnership near Oldham, South Dakota. It is \nclear that from his roots on the family farm, to his service for South \nDakota Farmers Union and USDA, Dallas has always had the perspective of \nthe hard working, rural, South Dakota citizen close to his heart. \nIndeed, he is respected by his colleagues across the country and was \npresented with the ``Hammer Award,'' by Vice-President Gore in 1995. In \n1999, Dallas was recognized as one of two Outstanding Rural Development \nState Directors in the entire nation by USDA Rural Development Under \nSecretary Jill Long Thompson.\n  Rural Development takes a comprehensive approach towards economic \ndevelopment in rural areas, offering loans, grants, and other resources \nto rural citizens, communities, and Indian reservations. Dallas truly \nserved as a partner in helping the people of rural South Dakota develop \nsustainable communities. He and his RD staff targeted financial and \ntechnical resources to areas of great need throughout the state in \norder to improve the quality of life. In his Rural Development tenure, \nDallas has overseen the distribution of over $578 million in grants, \nloans and loan guarantees over the past six years in South Dakota. As \nsuch, the South Dakota RD office has been a central figure in the \ncreation of many successful economic development projects in our state.\n  For instance, the South Dakota Rural Development office was \nresponsible for helping to create one of the first Enterprise \nCommunities in the country--the Beadle and Spink Enterprise Community, \nBASEC. Additionally, RD assisted in developing the very first American \nIndian Empowerment Zone in the United States at the Pine Ridge Indian \nReservation. Under the leadership of Dallas, Rural Development helped \nestablish the South Dakota Value Added Agriculture Development Center , \nwhich now creates opportunities for farmers and ranchers to add value \nto the raw commodities produced on their operations, and capture the \nprofits from these value-added products. Dallas is one of South \nDakota's leading advocates of farmer-owned value-added cooperatives in \nSouth Dakota.\n  Through the Rural Housing Service, South Dakota Rural Development has \ndisbursed $320 million since 1995, which has benefitted nearly 6,000 \nfamilies in our state. Moreover, RD has distributed $173 million in \nfunding under the Rural Business Cooperative Service program, which has \nsaved 2,001 and created another 1,414 jobs in South Dakota since 1995.\n  Finally, Dallas and his family have always been dedicated to public \nservice, and I know he will continue to contribute to our state and \nit's citizens in the future. Therefore, I wish him all the best and I \nwill continue to rely upon his valuable insight on the economic \ndevelopment needs in South Dakota. On behalf of the people of South \nDakota, I want to thank Dallas for being a true public servant who has \nhelped improve the quality of life for thousands of people all across \nSouth Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/14/senate-section/article/S11786-3", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11786-S11787]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CLOUDCROFT, NEW MEXICO\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, recently the city of Cloudcroft, \nNew Mexico was named one of the world's ``10 Overlooked and Underrated \nWinter Destinations,'' by the editors of Fodor's Travel Publications.\n  Cloudcroft hasn't changed much over the years. There are more summer \nhomes than before, but the permanent population has not grown \nsubstantially, and the Village still maintains a small-town atmosphere \nthat is so appealing to the tourists who come from every state in the \nUnion and many foreign countries. They appreciate the attitude of the \nlocals and the laid-back feeling of the community as contrasted to the \nhigh-speed life in the big cities.\n  Cloudcroft is located in the southeastern area of New Mexico. A small \nmountain village located in the heart of the Lincoln National Forest. \nIt is a great travel location for both the outdoors and indoors \nvisitors. For individuals who enjoy the outdoors, it offers year-round \nhiking, mountain biking, skiing, golfing and other activities. For the \nindoors visitors it offers a variety of unique shops, restaurants, and \nmuseums.\n  Cloudcroft is not commonly known for its glitzy ski resorts like \nother cities in New Mexico but rather as a perfect location for \nfamilies learning the ropes. It offers a number of great inns and the \ndistinction of having no stoplights. A great place for families to take \ntheir vacations. Children can play outside and adults can enjoy the \nquietness of the village.\n  Cloudcroft offers several festive events such as the New Year's Eve \nTorchlight Parade down the Cloudcroft mountain, caroling in the Clouds \nand Currier & Ives Candelit Christmas in December, or the full-moon \nice-skating in February.\n  When visiting Cloudcroft, one must not miss the opportunity to go \nsledding on the dunes of White Sands National Monument or visit the \nSunspot National Solar Observatory. No matter\n\n[[Page S11787]]\n\nwhat your preference, Cloudcroft has an activity for you.\n  Many of us share a passion for travel, but often times finding a good \nlocation is not always easy. However, Cloudcroft truly is a city often \noverlooked by most. With its great weather, shopping and mountains, I \nam proud to say Cloudcroft is a part of New Mexico.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/14/senate-section/article/S11787-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11787]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  Under authority of the order of the Senate of December 11, 2000, the \nSecretary of the Senate, on December 11, 2000, during the recess of the \nSenate, received a message from the House of Representatives announcing \nthat the House has passed the following joint resolution, in which it \nrequests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.J.

This legislation, the ``Energy Efficient Cost Savings Improvement \nAct of 2001'' will improve the current law by enhancing and extending \nthe authority relating to energy savings performance contracts of the \nFederal Government. The benefit to the taxpayer will be not only the \nrealization of greater cost savings as they pertain to older, \ninefficient Federal buildings but, more importantly, the reduction in \nthe waste of monies spent trying to improve these buildings when other, \nmore cost effective alternatives are available.\n  The National Energy Conservation Policy Act, as amended by the Energy \nPolicy Act of 1992, established a mandate for energy savings in Federal \nbuildings and facilities. Aggressive energy conservation goals were \nsubsequently established by Executive Order 12902, stating that, by \n2005, Federal agencies must reduce their energy consumption in their \nbuildings by 30 percent per square foot when compared to 1985 levels. \nExecutive Order 13123 increased this goal to 35 percent by 2010.\n  To help attain these objectives, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 \ncreated Energy Savings Performance Contracting, ESPC, which offered a \nmeans of achieving this energy reduction goal at no capital cost to the \ngovernment. That's right--no capital cost to the government, since ESPC \nis an alternative to the traditional method of Federal appropriations \nto finance these types of improvements in Federal buildings. Under the \nESPC authority, Federal agencies contract with energy service \ncompanies, ESCO, which pay all the up-front costs. These costs relate \nto evaluation, design, financing, acquisition, installation, and \nmaintenance of energy efficient equipment; altered operation and \nmaintenance improvements; and technical services. The ESCO guarantees a \nfixed amount of energy cost savings throughout the life of the contract \nand is paid directly from those cost savings. Agencies retain the \nremainder of the cost savings for themselves and, at the end of the \ncontract, ownership of all property, along with the additional cost \nsavings, reverts to the Federal government. Currently, contracts may \nrange up to 25 years. Over the entire contract period, Federal monies \nare neither required nor appropriated for the improvements.\n  But, as innovative as the ESPC alternative may be, there is one area \nin which it falls short--and that is, how to avoid wasting valuable \nfunds improving energy efficiency in a building that has long since \npassed its useful life. How do you justify energy conservation measures \nin buildings that are in constant need of maintenance or repair? \nFacilities that, no matter how much money is invested for renovation, \nwill never meet existing building code requirements? You may save money \nby improving energy efficiency, but then turn around and reinvest even \nlarger amounts in operating and maintaining a very old facility. \nSomewhere there has to be a point where we decide there must be other \nalternatives--and that is exactly what my legislation offers.\n  The most important element of my legislation is in the way it \nproposes to fund the construction of replacement Federal facilities. \nThe legislation builds upon the existing Energy Savings Performance \nContracting and takes it one logical step further--to include savings \nanticipated from operation and maintenance efficiencies of a new \nreplacement Federal building. Perhaps the easiest way to explain the \nbenefits of this change is by citing an example. In my home state of \nNew Mexico, the Department of Energy Albuquerque Operations office \nresides in a complex of buildings constructed originally as Army \nbarracks during the Korean War. Although these facilities have been \nrenovated and modified throughout the years, they remain energy \ninefficient and require high maintenance and operation costs when \ncompared to more contemporary buildings. What's more, over the next \nseven years, the Operations office will institute additional \nmodifications to meet compliance requirements for seismic, energy \nsavings, and other facility infrastructure concerns (maintenance, \nenvironmental, safety and health, etc.) at a cost of $34.2 million. \nEven with these modifications, we end up with a modernized 50-year-old \nbuilding that will continue to require expensive maintenance dollars. \nThe estimate to replace the office complex with a new facility, by the \nway, is $35.3 million. While Congress cannot afford to appropriate \nfunds to build a new facility, we're willing to spend--no, we're forced \nto waste--almost as much in maintaining an old one.\n  As requested by the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2000, \nthe Department of Energy conducted a feasibility study for replacing \nthe Albuquerque Operations office using an ESPC. The results of the \nstudy are enlightening, for it demonstrated that by using anticipated \nenergy, operations, and maintenance efficiencies of a new\n\n[[Page S11790]]\n\nreplacement building over the old one, the cost savings alone pay for \nthe new facility. What's more, the analysis forecasts that after the \nannual ESPC loan payment is made to the contractor, there is a $1 \nmillion per year surplus. Over a 25-year contract, the savings to the \ntaxpayer is $25 million.\n  Finally, I want to draw your attention to the broader implications \nthat this legislation has for Federal agencies and taxpayers alike. The \napplication of authority created by this legislation in the replacement \nof other Federal buildings could result in billions of dollars of \navoided waste. Simply by considering operation and maintenance cost \nsavings, we would reap a double benefit of newer facilities and much \nneeded improvements to the Federal infrastructure at a fraction of the \ncost. And, since ESCOs typically use local companies to provide \nconstruction services, this type of program would have a very \nbeneficial effect on local economies.\n  There is certainly enough work within the Federal government to move \nforward on this ESPC legislation. To this end, I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 3278. A bill to authorize funding for nanoscale science and \nengineering research and development at the Department of Energy for \nfiscal years 2002 through 2006; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n       department of energy nanoscale science and engineering act\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill \nauthorizing the Secretary of Energy to provide for a long term \ncommitment in its Office of Science to the area of nanoscience and \nnanoengineering. This new area is of fundamental importance for \nmaintaining our global economic leadership in energy technology as well \nin areas such as microchip design, space and transportation, medicines \nand biomedical devices. The fields of nanoscience and nanoengineering \nare so new and broad in their reach that no one industry can support \nthem. They are a perfect example how we in Congress can make a \ndifference to support our nation's technological leadership, a key \nelement of the 21st century global economy.\n  The fields of nanoscience and engineering encompass the ability to \ncreate new states of matter by prepositioning the atoms that make up \ntheir structure. The physical features that nanoscale R will develop \nare on the order of about 10 nanometers or 1000 times smaller than the \ndiameter of a human hair. What we are talking about is making materials \nand devices not by miniaturization, which is a top down approach. \nNanoscience is the bottom up fabrication of materials, atom by atom. \nWhen you build materials at this level, amazing things begin to happen. \nWe are talking about microchips whose features will shrink by a factor \nof 100 below where industry projects they will be in the year 2010. \nThese chip features will lead to radical breakthroughs in speed, cost \nand density of information storage. In the field of medicine and \nhealth, we are talking about drugs whose routes of delivery are \nliterally at the molecular level. It will be possible to custom build \nproteins and other biological materials for future biomedical devices. \nIn the field of energy efficiency, batteries and fuel cells can be \nbuilt with storage capacities far exceeding our current state of the \nart. In the transportation industry, it will be possible to make ultra \nstrong and light materials reducing the weight in airplanes, cars and \nspace vehicles. All these breakthroughs in the diverse industries I \nhave discussed will keep the United States' as a global leader in the \n21st century economy.\n  The Department of Energy and its Office of Science are uniquely \nsuited to support this critical research. The Office of Science has \nbeen at the forefront of conducting nanotechnology research for the \npast decade through its broad array of materials, physics, chemistry \nand biology programs. This authorization bill will carry forth four \nbroad objectives of the Office of Science's existing nanotechnology \neffort, (1) attain a fundamental understanding of nanoscale phenomena, \n(2) achieve the ability to design bulk materials with desired \nproperties using nanoscale manipulation, (3) study how living organisms \nproduce materials naturally by arranging their atomic structure and \nimplement it into the design process for nanomaterials, (4) develop \nexperimental and computer tools with a national infrastructure to carry \nout nanoscience. Let me briefly comment on the fourth area in this \nlist. The Office of Science is the nation's leader in developing and \nmanaging national user facilities across the broad range of physical \nsciences. It would be a natural progression for the Office of Science \nto develop similar user facilities to advance nanoscience. These \nfacilities, located across the United States, will contain unique \nequipment and computers which will be accessible to individuals as well \nas multi-disciplinary teams. In the past, Office of Science national \nuser facilities have served as crossing points between the transition \nfrom fundamental science to industrial capability. I expect that these \nnanoscience user facilities will serve as a similar transition point \nfrom long term fundamental research into applied industrial know-how. \nAccordingly, in this authorization bill I have allotted portions of the \nyearly budget towards developing these unique user facilities.\n  This bill is an important first step in a combined national \nnanoscience effort which will help to maintain the technological edge \nof our U.S. industry. I hope that the other federal R agencies will \nmake similar commitments in their areas of expertise. Maintaining this \nedge, by promoting these long term and high risk investigations is \nsomething which we cannot expect in the short time frame world of \ntoday's industry. It is critical that our U.S. government step into \nthis void, particularly in the area of nanoscience, and provide the \nnecessary intellectual capital to propel our national economy as a \nleader in the 21st century.\n  I ask for unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3278\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Department of Energy \n     Nanoscale Science and Engineering Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The emerging fields of nanoscience and nanoengineering \n     address the ability to create materials with fundamentally \n     new compositions by prepositioning atoms within an overall \n     molecular composition.\n       (2) The ability of the United States to respond to the \n     energy and economic challenges of the 21st century will be \n     driven by science and technology. Nanoscience and \n     nanoengineering will enable the United States to develop new \n     technologies for energy exploration and production, for \n     monitoring energy infrastructure, for increasing energy \n     efficiency in end-use application, and for developing new \n     technologies applicable to other Department of Energy \n     statutory missions. These advances will also enhance the \n     strength of U.S. science, technology, and medicine generally.\n       (3) The fundamental intellectual challenges inherent in \n     nanoscience and nanoengineering are considerable, and require \n     public support for basic and applied research and \n     development. Significant advances in areas such as the self-\n     assembly of atom clusters will be required before nanoscience \n     or nanoengineering will be useful to the energy or \n     manufacturing industries.\n       (4) The development of new scientific instruments will also \n     be required to advance nanoscience and nanoengineering. Such \n     instruments are likely to be large and costly. Specialized \n     facilities are also likely to be required in order to advance \n     the field and to realize its promise. Such facilities will be \n     sufficiently expensive that they will have to be located and \n     constructed on a centralized basis, similar to a number of \n     unique facilities already managed by the Department of \n     Energy.\n       (5) Contributions from individual researchers as well as \n     multidisciplinary research teams will be required to advance \n     nanoscience and nanoengineering.\n       (6) The Department of Energy's Office of Science is well \n     suited to manage nanoscience and nanoengineering research and \n     development for the Department. Through its support of \n     research and development pursuant to the Department's \n     statutory authorities, the Office of Science is the principal \n     federal supporter of the research and development in the \n     physical and computational sciences. The Office is also a \n     significant source of federal support for research in \n     genomics and the life sciences. The Office supports \n     research and development by individual investigators and \n     multidisciplinary teams, and manages special user \n     facilities that serve investigators in both university and \n     industry.\n\n[[Page S11791]]\n\n     SEC. 3.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The World Health Organization estimates that there are \n     300,000,000 to 500,000,000 cases of malaria each year.\n       (2) According to the World Health Organization, more than \n     1,000,000 persons are estimated to die due to malaria each \n     year.\n       (3) According to the National Institutes of Health, about \n     40 percent of the world's population is at risk of becoming \n     infected.\n       (4) About half of those who die each year from malaria are \n     children under 9 years of age.\n       (5) Malaria kills one child each 30 seconds.\n       (6) Although malaria is a public health problem in more \n     than 90 countries, more than 90 percent of all malaria cases \n     are in sub-Saharan Africa.\n       (7) In addition to Africa, large areas of Central and South \n     America, Haiti and the Dominican Republic, the Indian \n     subcontinent, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East are high \n     risk malaria areas.\n       (8) These high risk areas represent many of the world's \n     poorest nations.\n       (9) Malaria is particularly dangerous during pregnancy. The \n     disease causes severe anemia and is a major factor \n     contributing to maternal deaths in malaria endemic regions.\n       (10) ``Airport malaria'', the importing of malaria by \n     international aircraft and other conveyances, is becoming \n     more common, and the United Kingdom reported 2,364 cases of \n     malaria in 1997, all of them imported by travelers.\n       (11) In the United States, of the 1,400 cases of malaria \n     reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in \n     1998, the vast majority were imported.\n       (12) Between 1970 and 1997, the malaria infection rate in \n     the United States increased by about 40 percent.\n       (13) Malaria is caused by a single-cell parasite that is \n     spread to humans by mosquitoes.\n       (14) No vaccine is available and treatment is hampered by \n     development of drug-resistant parasites and insecticide-\n     resistant mosquitoes.\n\n     SEC. 103. ASSISTANCE FOR MALARIA PREVENTION, TREATMENT, \n                   CONTROL, AND ELIMINATION.\n\n       (a) Assistance.--\n       (1) In general.--The Administrator of the United States \n     Agency for International Development, in coordination with \n     the heads of other appropriate Federal agencies and \n     nongovernmental organizations, shall provide assistance for \n     the establishment and conduct of activities designed to \n     prevent, treat, control, and eliminate malaria in countries \n     with a high percentage of malaria cases.\n       (2) Consideration of interaction among epidemics.--In \n     providing assistance pursuant to paragraph (1), the \n     Administrator should consider the interaction among the \n     epidemics of HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis.\n       (3) Dissemination of information requirement.--Activities \n     referred to in paragraph (1) shall include the dissemination \n     of information relating to the development of vaccines and \n     therapeutic agents for the prevention of malaria (including \n     information relating to participation in, and the results of, \n     clinical trials for such vaccines and agents conducted by \n     United States Government agencies) to appropriate officials \n     in such countries.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--\n       (1) In general.--There are authorized to be appropriated to \n     carry out subsection (a) $50,000,000 for each of the fiscal \n     years 2001 and 2002.\n       (2) Availability.--Amounts appropriated pursuant to the \n     authorization of appropriations under paragraph (1) are \n     authorized to remain available until expended.\n\n      TITLE II--POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES WITH RESPECT TO MACAU\n\n     SEC. 201. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``United States-Macau Policy \n     Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 202. FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Findings and Declarations.--Congress makes the \n     following findings and declarations:\n       (1) The continued economic prosperity of Macau furthers \n     United States interests in the People's Republic of China and \n     Asia.\n       (2) Support for democratization is a fundamental principle \n     of United States foreign policy, and as such, that principle \n     naturally applies to United States policy toward Macau.\n       (3) The human rights of the people of Macau are of great \n     importance to the United States and are directly relevant to \n     United States interests in Macau.\n       (4) A fully successful transition in the exercise of \n     sovereignty over Macau must continue to safeguard human \n     rights in and of themselves.\n       (5) Human rights also serve as a basis for Macau's \n     continued economic prosperity, and Congress takes note of \n     Macau's adherence to the International Covenant on Civil and \n     Political Rights and the International Convention on \n     Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the United States should play an active role in \n     maintaining Macau's confidence and prosperity, Macau's unique \n     cultural heritage, and the mutually beneficial ties between \n     the people of the United States and the people of Macau;\n       (2) through its policies, the United States should \n     contribute to Macau's ability to maintain a high degree of \n     autonomy in matters other than defense and foreign affairs as \n     promised by the People's Republic of China and the Republic \n     of Portugal in the Joint Declaration, particularly with \n     respect to such matters as trade, commerce, law enforcement, \n     finance, monetary policy, aviation, shipping, communications, \n     tourism, cultural affairs, sports, and participation in \n     international organizations, consistent with the national \n     security and other interests of the United States; and\n       (3) the United States should actively seek to establish and \n     expand direct bilateral ties and agreements with Macau in \n     economic, trade, financial, monetary, mutual legal \n     assistance, law enforcement, communication, transportation, \n     and other appropriate areas.\n\n     SEC. 203. CONTINUED APPLICATION OF UNITED STATES LAW.\n\n       (a) Continued Application.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any change in the exercise \n     of sovereignty over Macau, and subject to subsections (b) and \n     (c), the laws of the United States shall continue to apply \n     with respect to Macau in the same manner as the laws of the \n     United States were applied with respect to Macau before \n     December 20, 1999, unless otherwise expressly provided by law \n     or by Executive order issued pursuant to paragraph (2).\n       (2) Exception.--Whenever the President determines that \n     Macau is not sufficiently autonomous to justify treatment \n     under a particular law of the United States, or any provision \n     thereof, different from that accorded the People's Republic \n     of China, the President may issue an Executive order \n     suspending the application of paragraph (1) to such law or \n     provision of law. The President shall promptly notify the \n     Committee on International Relations of the House of \n     Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the \n     Senate concerning any such determination and shall publish \n     the Executive order in the Federal Register.\n       (b) Export Controls.--\n       (1) In general.--The export control laws, regulations, and \n     practices of the United States shall apply to Macau in the \n     same manner and to the same extent that such laws, \n     regulations, and practices apply to the People's Republic of \n     China, and in no case shall such laws, regulations, and \n     practices be applied less restrictively to exports to Macau \n     than to exports to the People's Republic of China.\n       (2) Rule of construction.--Paragraph (1) shall not be \n     construed as prohibiting the provision of export control \n     assistance to Macau.\n       (c) International Agreements.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to subsection (b) and paragraph \n     (2), for all purposes, including actions in any court of the \n     United States, Congress approves of the continuation in force \n     after December 20, 1999, of all treaties and other \n     international agreements, including multilateral conventions, \n     entered into before such date between the United States and \n     Macau, or entered into force before such date between the \n     United States and the Republic of Portugal and applied to \n     Macau, unless or until terminated in accordance with law.\n       (2) Exception.--If, in carrying out this subsection, the \n     President determines that Macau is not legally competent to \n     carry out its obligations under any such treaty or other \n     international agreement, or that the continuation of Macau's \n     obligations or rights under any such treaty or other \n     international agreement is not appropriate under the \n     circumstances, the President shall take appropriate action to \n     modify or terminate such treaty or other international \n     agreement. The President shall promptly notify the Committee \n     on International Relations of the House of Representatives \n     and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate \n     concerning such determination.\n\n     SEC. 204. REPORTING REQUIREMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, and not later than March 31 of \n     each of the years 2001, 2002, and 2003, the Secretary of \n     State shall transmit to the Committee on International \n     Relations of the House of Representatives and the Committee \n     on Foreign\n\n[[Page S11793]]\n\n     Relations of the Senate a report on conditions in Macau of \n     interest to the United States. The report shall describe--\n       (1) significant developments in United States relations \n     with Macau, including any determination made under section \n     203;\n       (2) significant developments related to the change in the \n     exercise of sovereignty over Macau affecting United States \n     interests in Macau or United States relations with Macau and \n     the People's Republic of China;\n       (3) the development of democratic institutions in Macau;\n       (4) compliance by the Government of the People's Republic \n     of China and the Government of the Republic of Portugal with \n     their obligations under the Joint Declaration; and\n       (5) the nature and extent of Macau's participation in \n     multilateral forums.\n       (b) Separate Part of Country Reports.--Whenever a report is \n     transmitted to Congress on a country-by-country basis, there \n     shall be included in such report, where applicable, a \n     separate subreport on Macau under the heading of the country \n     that exercises sovereignty over Macau.\n\n     SEC. 205. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this title:\n       (1) Joint declaration.--The term ``Joint Declaration'' \n     means the Joint Declaration of the Government of the People's \n     Republic of China and the Government of the Republic of \n     Portugal on the Question of Macau, dated April 13, 1987.\n       (2) Macau.--The term ``Macau'' means the territory that \n     prior to December 20, 1999, was the Portuguese Dependent \n     Territory of Macau and after December 20, 1999, became the \n     Macau Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic \n     of China.\n\n         TITLE III--UNITED STATES-CANADA ALASKA RAIL COMMISSION\n\n     SEC. 301. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Rails to Resources Act of \n     2000''.\n\n     SEC. 302. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) rail transportation is an essential component of the \n     North American intermodal transportation system;\n       (2) the development of economically strong and socially \n     stable communities in the western United States and Canada \n     was encouraged significantly by government policies promoting \n     the development of integrated transcontinental, interstate \n     and interprovincial rail systems in the states, territories \n     and provinces of the two countries;\n       (3) United States and Canadian federal support for the \n     completion of new elements of the transcontinental, \n     interstate and interprovincial rail systems was halted before \n     rail connections were established to the State of Alaska and \n     the Yukon Territory;\n       (4) rail transportation in otherwise isolated areas \n     facilitates controlled access and may reduce overall impact \n     to environmentally sensitive areas;\n       (5) the extension of the continental rail system through \n     northern British Columbia and the Yukon Territory to the \n     current terminus of the Alaska Railroad would significantly \n     benefit the United States and Canadian visitor industries by \n     facilitating the comfortable movement of passengers over long \n     distances while minimizing effects on the surrounding areas; \n     and\n       (6) ongoing research and development efforts in the rail \n     industry continue to increase the efficiency of rail \n     transportation, ensure safety, and decrease the impact of \n     rail service on the environment.\n\n     SEC. 303. AGREEMENT FOR A UNITED STATES-CANADA BILATERAL \n                   COMMISSION.\n\n       The President is authorized and urged to enter into an \n     agreement with the Government of Canada to establish an \n     independent joint commission to study the feasibility and \n     advisability of linking the rail system in Alaska to the \n     nearest appropriate point on the North American continental \n     rail system.\n\n     SEC. 304.

In the case of any contract for the \n     services of an individual, funds made available for the \n     Commission by the United States may not be used to pay for \n     the services of the individual at a rate that exceeds the \n     daily equivalent of the annual rate of basic pay prescribed \n     for level V of the Executive Schedule under section 5316 of \n     title 5, United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 306.

Coverdell's foresight and leadership. In the words of one \n     World Wise Schools teacher, ``It's a teacher's job to touch \n     the future of a child; it's the Peace Corps' job to touch the \n     future of the world. What more perfect partnership.''.\n       (7) Paul D. Coverdell served in the United States Senate \n     from the State of Georgia from 1993 until his sudden death on \n     July 18, 2000.\n       (8) Senator Paul D.

Not only \nthat, but we Senators should learn as well how to handle these matters. \nIt does me good to see a Chair who is alert and a Parliamentarian who \nis alert.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/14/senate-section/article/S11800-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11800]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               LISA TUITE\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, once in a while an individual comes along \nwho shines with such a special light that it illuminates the darkness \nfor others. I have been fortunate to employ one such individual on my \nstaff for the last 8 years: Lisa Tuite, Lisa achieved her master of \narts degree in national security studies from Georgetown University in \n1990 and her bachelor of arts degree in foreign affairs from the \nUniversity of Virginia. She came to my office as a legislative fellow \nfrom the National Photographic Interpretation Center. I soon recognized \nher talent. Lisa was employed in my office to serve as a legislative \nassistant for defense and foreign affairs and to assist me on the Armed \nServices Committee. She has done all of these things and done them \nwell. Eventually she rose through the ranks to become my administrative \nassistant.\n  Multitalented, thoughtful, with an encyclopedic grasp of detail, Lisa \nTuite has been an inspiration to my staff and she has been an \ninspiration to me.\n  I have been here on Jenkins Hill for 48 years, longer than anybody \nelse who is in the Congress today in either body. John Dingell is the \ndean of the House of Representatives. I served with John Dingell's \nfather in the House. I speak of John Dingell in a very admiring \nfashion. He is a man of tremendous talent, a fine, fine Member of the \nHouse. But I have been around quite a while, and I have seen a lot of \npeople come and go in the Chamber here, as well in my employment, as \none can imagine--48 years, starting out in the House of Representatives \nwith five persons on my staff a long time ago.\n  I have seen Senators come and go. I have seen our staffs at the front \ndesk come and go. But this particular individual, of whom I speak \ntoday, merits my highest compliments. I have rarely employed anyone \nwith her patience, her writing ability, her organizational instincts or \nher boundless energy. She is that rare breed of Senate staffer, \nseemingly born for the job and eager to do it. Moreover, as anyone who \nknows Lisa can attest, she is resolute, unflappable, and unfailingly \ncheerful. I have seldom seen her discouraged, and there is literally no \ntask that she will not assume with relish, and always unfailing in her \ncourtesy. I shall miss her.\n  She has the soul of a gardener. It is a hobby at which she excels. \nShe is a cultivator of beauty and a nurturer of growth. I am speaking \nnot only with respect to plants and flowers and, yes, crops; but I am \nspeaking also with reference to other individuals. For my other \nemployees, she has been an inspiration as well. The young staffers whom \nshe has so carefully tended and so artfully encouraged have blossomed, \nblossomed like the daffodils, blossomed under Lisa's tutelage. She has \ngraciously focused her sunshine upon them all, upon all who work with \nher.\n  Alas, as all good things come to an end, at least all things that are \nmortal, Lisa will be leaving my staff to spend more time with her \nhusband Jim, her mother and father, and her adorable daughter Rachel. \nAnd I am the loser. I am saddened to lose her, but I know that she will \ngrace whatever she puts her heart and hand to in the future years as \nshe has done in my office for the too brief time that she worked among \nus and with us and lent us her gracious smile and her scintillating \npersonality, her wit, her good sense, her good judgment, her \ndedication, her loyalty.\n\n  So to Lisa, my staff and I say:\n\n       The hours are like a string of pearls,\n       The days like diamonds rare,\n       The moments are the threads of gold,\n       That bind them for our wear,\n       So may the years that come to you,\n       Such health and good contain,\n       That every moment, hour, and day,\n       Be like a golden chain.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/14/senate-section/article/S11800-2", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11800-S11801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            NEVER FORGOTTEN\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, soon, the 106th Congress will draw to a \nclose, and with that final bell, the Senate careers of a number of very \nfine Members will also, suddenly, draw to a close. Such are the wages \nof service in this Republic. Senator Robb, Senator Gorton, Senator \nGrams, Senator Ashcroft, Senator Abraham will have answered their final \nrollcall. They will have waited through their final quorum calls and \nthey will have left the Senate floor, as a Member of this body, for a \nfinal time. Oh, they may be back to visit, and I hope they will come \nback to visit. They will always be welcome here. But I am sure that the \nSenate floor is not quite the same when one is not allowed to vote or \nto make a statement.\n  However, these distinguished Members will always be a unique part of \nthe Senate family and of the Senate's history. In the history of this \ngreat Republic--I do not speak of it as a democracy, I speak of it as a \nRepublic; as a representative democracy, yes--in the history of this \ngreat Republic, there have only been 1,853 men and women who have \nserved here since April 6 of 1789. In January 2001, that number will \nrise to 1,864. These names can be found listed in rank order, a list \nthat is immutable and irreplaceable.\n\n  More than that, each Senator becomes a part of the institution of the \nSenate. Each Member's actions help to shape the precedents and the \npractices of the Senate, just as a Member's amendments, bills, and \nvotes shape the legislative history of the land. The singular honor of \nserving in the United States Senate leaves its mark on each Member. I \nam tempted to say that each Member leaves his or her mark on the \nSenate, but that would not be accurate. Few Senators perhaps leave \ntheir mark on the Senate, but the Senate leaves its mark, unblemished, \nunstained, on the life of every Member.\n  I wish today to speak of two of these departing Senators with whom I \nhave worked closely over the years: Senator Charles ``Chuck'' Robb and \nSenator Slade Gorton. Senator Gorton's number among the roll of \nSenators is 1,752. Senator Robb's number is 1,788. They are listed on \nthe roll of Members of the United States Senate. Senator Robb, Senator \nGorton, and the other departing Members, will carry the badge of Senate \nservice with them. It is a badge of honor that they will carry with \nthem.\n  These men are much more than a name or a number, of course. Senator \nRobb has been a dedicated public servant. He has served his country in \nmany ways. I have served with him on the Senate Committee on Armed \nServices where he was most recently the ranking member of the \nSubcommittee on Readiness and Management Support. He was also a member \nof the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and he was for many \nyears a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  As a former marine, as well as a representative of a Commonwealth \nwith a very large military presence, Senator Robb was a tireless \nadvocate for the men and the women who labor in uniform and in other \nintelligence and supporting roles to protect our great Nation. Senator \nRobb has also sought to protect and further the economic health of the \nNation.\n  He has served this Nation in many ways, from active duty as a United \nStates Marine to Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia to United \nStates Senator. To his service here, he has brought a conscience. He \ncharted his own course, made his own votes and his decisions using his \nmoral compass rather than polls or media campaigns.\n  I will always remember Senator Robb for his gentle courtesy, his calm \nand even manner, his soft-spoken ways. Though passionate in his \nbeliefs, he worked quietly and steadily in a bipartisan spirit to \nachieve his goals. The State of Virginia is better off today for his \nefforts in the Senate, and the Senate has been the better for his \npresence. Now, to Senator Gorton.\n  Senator Slade Gorton knows something about leaving the Senate, having \nleft once before in 1987, only to return 2 years later to serve from \n1989 through the end of the 106th Congress. I have been his ranking \nmember on the Senate Committee on Appropriations. I am here to say that \nI could not have had a better partner than the distinguished\n\n[[Page S11801]]\n\nSenator from Washington. Of course, I have said that many times before. \nIn these past years, he has been the wheel horse of our team, putting \nhis shoulder to the wheel and pulling the heavy load of \nputting together the complex Interior appropriations bill. He has shown \nhimself to be a master of the appropriations process, and no one, I \nventure to say, knows the Interior appropriations bill and the programs \nit funds better than Slade Gorton does. Senator Gorton has a truly \nimpressive grasp of detail, and yet he never lets minutiae cloud his \nvision of the overall picture. I could not have asked for a more \ncongenial, collegial, commonsense colleague, and I will truly miss my \nfriend, Slade Gorton, on the committee.\n\n  I know that the rest of the Senate will miss our colleague from \nWashington as well. He is well liked on both sides of the aisle as \ngracious, polite, soft spoken. He never rebukes a colleague. Rather, he \nwill look up, blink in polite astonishment, and with a gentle question \npoint out the error of one's ways.\n  Senator Gorton is another example of a Member who makes the Senate \nwork by focusing on the needs of his constituents. Besides his work on \nthe Interior Appropriations Subcommittee and throughout the entire \nappropriations process, Senator Gorton looked after the interests of \nWashington State from his seat on the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation where he chaired the Subcommittee on Aviation and \nalso served on the Subcommittee on Oceans and Fisheries, both important \nto a coastal State that is home to Boeing Aviation.\n  He also served as the vice chair, the vice chairman--Mr. President, I \nbreak my sentence. I do not believe in this nonsense. I do not believe \nin this nonsense called political correctness. I have no use for it \nwhatsoever. There is a chair right there across the aisle; here is a \nchair beside me. There is a difference between a chairman and a chair. \nI do not subscribe to the word ``chair'' except where it is appropriate \nto use it, and I never refer to a human being as a ``chair.'' I do not \nwant anyone referring to me as a ``chair.''\n  Senator Gorton also served as the vice chairman of the Subcommittee \non Water and Power on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee--again \ntopics of interest to his State with significant hydropower concerns. \nAnd if these duties did not keep him busy enough, Senator Gorton also \nserved on the Senate Budget Committee.\n  Senator Gorton's focus serves the Senate well. In defending the \ndifferent perspectives of States large and small, populous or not, \nrural or urban, individual Senators act as the kind of internal checks \nand balances that the framers envisioned, keeping the tyranny of a \nmajority from putting other groups and interests at a disadvantage.\n  The Senate is designed to give States an equal voice and equal \nstanding, despite differences among the States with respect to \npopulation.\n  I shall especially miss Senator Gorton because we worked very closely \ntogether on the Appropriations Committee. It was a very busy \nsubcommittee. It is a westerner's subcommittee, in fact. That is the \nway I have always looked upon it, although I have found it to be very \nimportant, as well, to States of the East and South and North.\n  I wish him well. I will miss him. As an able and talented man, he \nwill soon find new venues in which to continue serving the public \ninterest.\n  He traveled all across this country, he and his family, on bicycles \nupon one occasion some years ago, from the west coast to the east \ncoast, the whole family, on bicycles. So one might easily imagine what \nkind of adventurer Slade Gorton is. That takes a lot of courage, a lot \nof determination. But wherever he goes, and wherever Senator Robb goes, \nwherever these other Senators whose names I have mentioned go, they \nwill always be called ``Senator.'' Majorian, in 457 A.D., when he was \nmade emperor of the West, referred to himself as ``a prince who still \nglories in the name of Senator.''\n  Mr. President, I close with a few lines from a poem by Ralph Waldo \nEmerson. It is a fitting tribute to the fine, lasting work performed in \nthis mighty Senate by these departing Members: Senator Robb, Senator \nGorton, Senator Grams, Senator Ashcroft, and Senator Abraham. I am \nspeaking of these Senators. There are other Senators who are departing \nand about whom I have spoken previously. Senators whose names I have \nmentioned today are Senators who were in the most recent election, who \nfought nobly and well, and who lost.\n\n  What makes a nation's pillars high\n  And its foundations strong?\n  What makes it mighty to defy\n  The foes that round it throng?\n\n  It is not gold. Its kingdoms grand\n  Go down in battle shock;\n  Its shafts are laid on sinking sand,\n  Not on abiding rock.\n\n  Is it the sword? Ask the red dust\n  Of empires passed away;\n  The blood has turned their stones to rust,\n  Their glory to decay.\n\n  And is it pride? Ah, that bright crown\n  Has seemed to nations sweet;\n  But God has struck its luster down\n  In ashes at His feet.\n\n  Not gold but only men can make\n  A people great and strong;\n  Men who for truth and honor's sake\n  Stand fast and suffer long.\n\n  Brave men who work while others sleep,\n  Who dare while others fly--\n  They build a nation's pillars deep\n  And lift them to the sky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/14/senate-section/article/S11801-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE NEW MILLENNIUM\n\n  Mr. BYRD.

It will begin, \nand so will the third millennium.

Mr. President, each day the Senate is in session the \nChaplain leads us in prayer. From time to time, we have a guest \nChaplain, a guest Chaplain perhaps coming from one or the other of the \nStates. I am always awed to stand in this Chamber and hear the Chaplain \ndeliver the prayer. As long as this Republic stands, I am confident \nthat the Senate and the House will be opened with prayer.\n  In West Virginia, anytime there is a public ceremony of any kind, \nthere is sure to be a prayer, just as surely as we have the Pledge of \nAllegiance.\n  The Chaplain is always here. He ministers to us, not just by way of a \ndaily prayer here, but if we are ill, in the hospital, or if a family \nmember is in the hospital, if we lose a loved one, the Chaplain is \nthere. He is there to console and to comfort us and to pray with us.\n  I feel that we should take note of this as we prepare to close out \nour session. ``More things are wrought by prayer than this world dreams \nof. . . .'' Tennyson said that. I just remembered it.\n  So I thank our Chaplain on behalf of all of us--on behalf of the \nMembers, on behalf of the officers of the Senate, on behalf of the \nemployees of the Senate. We do appreciate the pastorship that he \nperforms. He shepherds the flock. We are part of his flock.\n  I want to pay my respects to him, and let him know that his efforts, \nhis work, his prayers, even when we do not hear them, do not go \nunnoticed.\n  Often he sees me and says: I prayed for you yesterday. I was praying \nfor you this morning. We certainly need it. I cherish those prayers.\n  ``Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord.''\n  I thank him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/14/senate-section/article/S11801-3", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11801-S11802]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THANKING THE PRESIDING OFFICER\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, that completes my remarks for today. I thank \nthe Chair for his patience. In this instance, I refer to ``the Chair.'' \nI thank the Chair for his patience. The present occupant is a fine \nSenator. He pays attention. He does not sit up at the desk and read \nnewspapers or sign his mail.\n\n[[Page S11802]]\n\n  There used to be a phone at that desk. And Senators who presided \nwould use that telephone. When I became majority leader, I had the \ntelephone removed because I thought that a Presiding Officer should pay \nattention to what was going on on the floor.\n  I always say to new Senators: Pay attention while presiding. Don't \nsign your mail while presiding. If you feel you have to sign mail in \nthe chair, tell the leadership that you have business to take care of \nin your office. Let someone else preside.\n  There are a few Senators who have listened to me and who carry that \nadmonition with them. Pat Roberts is one such Senator. He sits up there \nand is very alert. He never signs his mail while presiding. He never \nreads a magazine or a newspaper. He is alert, and he watches the Senate \nproceedings. Why shouldn't he? This is the premier upper house in the \nworld today, and it should set the example for members of the state \nlegislatures. I was once a member of the West Virginia House of \nDelegates. I was once a member of the West Virginia Senate.\n  I like to believe that when legislators throughout the 50 States of \nthis country look at the Presiding Officer of the U.S. Senate on \ntelevision, they see someone who is alert, someone who is paying \nattention, someone who is ready to make the ruling, someone who is \nready to answer the parliamentary inquiry, someone who is alert to the \nneed for order in the Senate Chamber and for order in the Galleries. \nThey shouldn't see someone presiding who is signing mail and paying no \nattention to what is transpiring in the Chamber. That is not a very \ngood example for other legislators in the country to see.\n  This young Senator, Senator Fitzgerald from Illinois, who is now \npresiding, pays close attention to the floor debate.\n  In some ways, it is kind of a thankless task. I have taken my share. \nUsually it is the new Members who take their turn at presiding. \nSomebody has to preside. I sat in that chair in one sitting for 22 \nhours. I have had my share. For 22 hours I sat during a civil rights \nfilibuster--almost all of one day and one night. Vice President Nixon \ncame the next morning to preside. But I know what it is to sit in the \nchair for hours at a time.\n  I compliment all those who take their turn at presiding. They can \nlearn a good many things about the Senate when they preside and preside \nwell.\n  Presiding Officers should maintain order in the Senate. That gavel is \nnot easy to break. In my time here and in all of the history of this \ninstitution, which goes back 212 years now, I believe, there has been \nonly one gavel broken. That gavel was replaced by the country of India \nand is in use now. If I am not mistaken and if my memory serves me \nwell, it is the gavel that was presented to the Senate when Richard \nNixon was Vice President. It will not crack easily.\n  I urge, for the record, the Presiding Officers to use it. Don't \nhesitate to hit the desk hard. It won't crack.\n  As we come into the Chamber during rollcall votes, we see other \nSenators with whom we would like to talk a few minutes. In doing so, we \nmake a lot of noise. I know the Chair is hesitant sometimes to call \nsenior Members of this body to order. But the Chair should have no \nhesitation. Every Senator, no matter how senior he is, should respect \nthat Chair. As a matter of fact, the more senior the Senator is, the \nmore he should respect the Chair because he has been here longer.\n  I say to this Chair and, through him, to all the other Senators who \npreside, stay alert, keep your eye on the Senate, and maintain order. \nAnd when you ask for order, get it. Don't stop until you do get it. We \nall owe that respect to the Chair.\n  I thank all employees for their patience.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/14/senate-section/article/S11802-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11802]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECORD TO REMAIN OPEN UNTIL 1:30 P.M.\n\n  Mr. BYRD.

Mr. President, I ask the Chair lay before the Senate a \nmessage from the House of Representatives on the bill (S. 2943).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the House of Representatives:\n\n       Resolved, That the bill from the Senate (S. 2943) entitled \n     ``An Act to authorize additional assistance for international \n     malaria control, and to provide for coordination and \n     consultation in providing assistance under the Foreign \n     Assistance Act of 1961 with respect to malaria, HIV, and \n     tuberculosis'', do pass with the following amendments:\n       Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert:\n\n         TITLE I--ASSISTANCE FOR INTERNATIONAL MALARIA CONTROL\n\n     SECTION 101. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``International Malaria \n     Control Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 102. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The World Health Organization estimates that there are \n     300,000,000 to 500,000,000 cases of malaria each year.\n       (2) According to the World Health Organization, more than \n     1,000,000 persons are estimated to die due to malaria each \n     year.\n       (3) According to the National Institutes of Health, about \n     40 percent of the world's population is at risk of becoming \n     infected.\n       (4) About half of those who die each year from malaria are \n     children under 9 years of age.\n       (5) Malaria kills one child each 30 seconds.\n       (6) Although malaria is a public health problem in more \n     than 90 countries, more than 90 percent of all malaria cases \n     are in sub-Saharan Africa.\n       (7) In addition to Africa, large areas of Central and South \n     America, Haiti and the Dominican Republic, the Indian \n     subcontinent, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East are high \n     risk malaria areas.\n       (8) These high risk areas represent many of the world's \n     poorest nations.\n       (9) Malaria is particularly dangerous during pregnancy. The \n     disease causes severe anemia and is a major factor \n     contributing to maternal deaths in malaria endemic regions.\n       (10) ``Airport malaria'', the importing of malaria by \n     international aircraft and other conveyances, is becoming \n     more common, and the United Kingdom reported 2,364 cases of \n     malaria in 1997, all of them imported by travelers.\n       (11) In the United States, of the 1,400 cases of malaria \n     reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in \n     1998, the vast majority were imported.\n       (12) Between 1970 and 1997, the malaria infection rate in \n     the United States increased by about 40 percent.\n       (13) Malaria is caused by a single-cell parasite that is \n     spread to humans by mosquitoes.\n       (14) No vaccine is available and treatment is hampered by \n     development of drug-resistant parasites and insecticide-\n     resistant mosquitoes.\n\n     SEC. 103.

FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS; SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Findings and Declarations.--The Congress makes the \n     following findings and declarations:\n       (1) The continued economic prosperity of Macau furthers \n     United States interests in the People's Republic of China and \n     Asia.\n       (2) Support for democratization is a fundamental principle \n     of United States foreign policy, and as such, that principle \n     naturally applies to United States policy toward Macau.\n       (3) The human rights of the people of Macau are of great \n     importance to the United States and are directly relevant to \n     United States interests in Macau.\n       (4) A fully successful transition in the exercise of \n     sovereignty over Macau must continue to safeguard human \n     rights in and of themselves.\n\n[[Page S11803]]\n\n       (5) Human rights also serve as a basis for Macau's \n     continued economic prosperity, and the Congress takes note of \n     Macau's adherence to the International Covenant on Civil and \n     Political Rights and the International Convention on \n     Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights.\n       (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that--\n       (1) the United States should play an active role in \n     maintaining Macau's confidence and prosperity, Macau's unique \n     cultural heritage, and the mutually beneficial ties between \n     the people of the United States and the people of Macau;\n       (2) through its policies, the United States should \n     contribute to Macau's ability to maintain a high degree of \n     autonomy in matters other than defense and foreign affairs as \n     promised by the People's Republic of China and the Republic \n     of Portugal in the Joint Declaration, particularly with \n     respect to such matters as trade, commerce, law enforcement, \n     finance, monetary policy, aviation, shipping, communications, \n     tourism, cultural affairs, sports, and participation in \n     international organizations, consistent with the national \n     security and other interests of the United States; and\n       (3) the United States should actively seek to establish and \n     expand direct bilateral ties and agreements with Macau in \n     economic, trade, financial, monetary, mutual legal \n     assistance, law enforcement, communication, transportation, \n     and other appropriate areas.\n\n     SEC. 203. CONTINUED APPLICATION OF UNITED STATES LAW.\n\n       (a) Continued Application.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any change in the exercise \n     of sovereignty over Macau, and subject to subsections (b) and \n     (c), the laws of the United States shall continue to apply \n     with respect to Macau in the same manner as the laws of the \n     United States were applied with respect to Macau before \n     December 20, 1999, unless otherwise expressly provided by law \n     or by Executive order issued pursuant to paragraph (2).\n       (2) Exception.--Whenever the President determines that \n     Macau is not sufficiently autonomous to justify treatment \n     under a particular law of the United States, or any provision \n     thereof, different from that accorded the People's Republic \n     of China, the President may issue an Executive order \n     suspending the application of paragraph (1) to such law or \n     provision of law. The President shall promptly notify the \n     Committee on International Relations of the House of \n     Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the \n     Senate concerning any such determination and shall publish \n     the Executive order in the Federal Register.\n       (b) Export Controls.--\n       (1) In general.--The export control laws, regulations, and \n     practices of the United States shall apply to Macau in the \n     same manner and to the same extent that such laws, \n     regulations, and practices apply to the People's Republic of \n     China, and in no case shall such laws, regulations, and \n     practices be applied less restrictively to exports to Macau \n     than to exports to the People's Republic of China.\n       (2) Rule of construction.--Paragraph (1) shall not be \n     construed as prohibiting the provision of export control \n     assistance to Macau.\n       (c) International Agreements.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to subsection (b) and paragraph \n     (2), for all purposes, including actions in any court of the \n     United States, the Congress approves of the continuation in \n     force after December 20, 1999, of all treaties and other \n     international agreements, including multilateral conventions, \n     entered into before such date between the United States and \n     Macau, or entered into force before such date between the \n     United States and the Republic of Portugal and applied to \n     Macau, unless or until terminated in accordance with law.\n       (2) Exception.--If, in carrying out this subsection, the \n     President determines that Macau is not legally competent to \n     carry out its obligations under any such treaty or other \n     international agreement, or that the continuation of Macau's \n     obligations or rights under any such treaty or other \n     international agreement is not appropriate under the \n     circumstances, the President shall take appropriate action to \n     modify or terminate such treaty or other international \n     agreement. The President shall promptly notify the Committee \n     on International Relations of the House of Representatives \n     and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate \n     concerning such determination.\n\n     SEC. 204 REPORTING REQUIREMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, and not later than March 31 of \n     each of the years 2001, 2002, and 2003, the Secretary of \n     State shall transmit to the Committee on International \n     Relations of the House of Representatives and the Committee \n     on Foreign Relations of the Senate a report on conditions in \n     Macau of interest to the United States. The report shall \n     describe--\n       (1) significant developments in United States relations \n     with Macau, including any determination made under section \n     203;\n       (2) significant developments related to the change in the \n     exercise of sovereignty over Macau affecting United States \n     interests in Macau or United States relations with Macau and \n     the People's Republic of China;\n       (3) the development of democratic institutions in Macau;\n       (4) compliance by the Government of the People's Republic \n     of China and the Government of the Republic of Portugal with \n     their obligations under the Joint Declaration; and\n       (5) the nature and extent of Macau's participation in \n     multilateral forums.\n       (b) Separate Part of Country Reports.--Whenever a report is \n     transmitted to the Congress on a country-by-country basis, \n     there shall be included in such report, where applicable, a \n     separate subreport on Macau under the heading of the country \n     that exercises sovereignty over Macau.\n\n     SEC. 205. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this title:\n       (1) Macau.--The term ``Macau'' means the territory that \n     prior to December 20, 1999, was the Portuguese Dependent \n     Territory of Macau and after December 20, 1999, became the \n     Macau Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic \n     of China.\n       (2) Joint declaration.--The term ``Joint Declaration'' \n     means the Joint Declaration of the Government of the People's \n     Republic of China and the Government of the Republic of \n     Portugal on the Question of Macau, dated April 13, 1987.\n\n         TITLE III--UNITED STATES-CANADA ALASKA RAIL COMMISSION\n\n     SECTION 301.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) rail transportation is an essential component of the \n     North American intermodal transportation system;\n       (2) the development of economically strong and socially \n     stable communities in the western United States and Canada \n     was encouraged significantly by government policies promoting \n     the development of integrated transcontinental, interstate \n     and interprovincial rail systems in the states, territories \n     and provinces of the two countries;\n       (3) United States and Canadian federal support for the \n     completion of new elements of the transcontinental, \n     interstate and interprovincial rail systems was halted before \n     rail connections were established to the State of Alaska and \n     the Yukon Territory;\n       (4) rail transportation in otherwise isolated areas \n     facilitates controlled access and may reduce overall impact \n     to environmentally sensitive areas;\n       (5) the extension of the continental rail system through \n     northern British Columbia and the Yukon Territory to the \n     current terminus of the Alaska Railroad would significantly \n     benefit the United States and Canadian visitor industries by \n     facilitating the comfortable movement of passengers over long \n     distances while minimizing effects on the surrounding areas; \n     and\n       (6) ongoing research and development efforts in the rail \n     industry continue to increase the efficiency of rail \n     transportation, ensure safety, and decrease the impact of \n     rail service on the environment.\n\n     SEC. 303.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Paul D. Coverdell World \n     Wise Schools Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 502. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Paul D. Coverdell was elected to the Georgia State \n     Senate in 1970 and later became Minority Leader of the \n     Georgia State Senate, a post he held for 15 years.\n       (2) As the 11th Director of the Peace Corps from 1989 to \n     1991, Paul Coverdell's dedication to the ideals of peace and \n     understanding helped to shape today's Peace Corps.\n       (3) Paul D. Coverdell believed that Peace Corps volunteers \n     could not only make a difference in the countries where they \n     served but that the greatest benefit could be felt at home.\n       (4) In 1989, Paul D. Coverdell founded the Peace Corps \n     World Wise Schools Program to help fulfill the Third Goal of \n     the Peace Corps, ``to promote a better understanding of the \n     people served among people of the United States''.\n       (5) The World Wise Schools Program is an innovative \n     education program that seeks to engage learners in an inquiry \n     about the world, themselves, and others in order to broaden \n     perspectives; promote cultural awareness; appreciate global \n     connections; and encourage service.\n       (6) In a world that is increasingly interdependent and ever \n     changing, the World Wise Schools Program pays tribute to Paul \n     D. Coverdell's foresight and leadership. In the words of one \n     World Wise Schools teacher, ``It's a teacher's job to touch \n     the future of a child; it's the Peace Corps' job to touch the \n     future of the world. What more perfect partnership.''.\n       (7) Paul D. Coverdell served in the United States Senate \n     from the State of Georgia from 1993 until his sudden death on \n     July 18, 2000.\n       (8) Senator Paul D. Coverdell was beloved by his colleagues \n     for his civility, bipartisan efforts, and his dedication to \n     public service.\n\n     SEC. 503. DESIGNATION OF PAUL D.
