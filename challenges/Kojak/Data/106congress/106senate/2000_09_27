Mr. President, it is my intention this morning to talk \nabout natural gas and alert the American people to the crisis we have \nbefore us relative to this very important source of clean energy.\n  Over the last several days, I have talked about our energy policy, \nthe fact that, to a large degree, our energy policy is determined by \nenvironmental groups, environmental pressures, and the Environmental \nProtection Agency, as opposed to a balance which suggests, indeed, we \nneed to face the realization that we need all our energy sources coming \ntogether to meet the crisis we have today, as we find ourselves 58-\npercent dependent on imported oil.\n  I will also speak on the dangers of Iraq and the realization that we \nare now 750,000-barrels-a-day dependent on Iraqi oil. The interesting \nthing is that Iraq has a production of nearly 2.5 million barrels a \nday, a kind of leverage on the world's supply of oil. What I mean is \nthat the capacity of the world to produce oil and the demand of the \nworld to use that oil is very close. We are somewhere in the area of \nroughly 1 million barrels a day of excess capacity over demand. With \nIraq producing better than 2 million barrels a day, one can clearly see \nthe leverage Iraq has should they choose to reduce production.\n  I have also talked about the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and the \nmerits of pulling down 30 million barrels, which sounds like a \nsignificant relief, if indeed we can turn that into heating oil, but \nthe reality is that we are going to get 3 to 4 million barrels out of \nthat 30 million barrels in heating oil which amounts to a 2- or 3-day \nsupply.\n  I do not want to mislead anybody. It is simply my attempt to alert \nthe\n\n[[Page S9332]]\n\nAmerican people; there is no panacea. We are going to need all our \nsources of oil. To blame big oil on profiteering is really \nshortsighted, and the American people are too smart to believe some of \nthe rhetoric out there.\n  Just look at where we were a year ago with the price of oil at $10 a \nbarrel. Were the oil companies so benevolent then or was it supply and \ndemand? Of course.\n  Who sets the price of oil? We had a hearing yesterday. Secretary \nRichardson was there. I think we all agreed that the price of oil, \nwithout question, is being set by those who supply oil, who have an \nabundance of oil, and that is primarily OPEC, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, \nand Mexico. They have it for sale, and the price currently is somewhere \nin the area of $33 to $34. Last week, we had an all-time high in over \n10 years of about $37.86.\n  Tomorrow I am going to talk about ANWR. I know something about ANWR. \nThat is the narrow area in the coastal plain of Alaska. It is that \nsmall area that has been set aside out of the whole area of ANWR. Few \npeople really understand the merits and the magnitude of the land mass \nand what we have done with it by congressional action.\n  There are 19 million acres up there. That is about the size of the \nState of South Carolina. We have taken 8.5 million acres and put them \nin a permanent wilderness. We have taken another 9 million acres and \nput them in a refuge, leaving 1.5 million acres of the so-called 1002 \narea to the determination of Congress as to whether or not we can open \nit up safely. Industry says, if the oil is there in the abundance it \nwould have to be, the footprint would be about 2,000 acres. So I think \nwe ought to keep this discussion in perspective.\n\n  I am pleased to say, one of the Presidential candidates supports \nopening it, recognizing that we have the technology, we can do it \ncorrectly, we can make the footprint small. If the oil is there, we \ncould very well produce another million barrels a day. We have the \npipeline capacity. One can certainly imagine what kind of message that \nwould send to OPEC. You would see the price of oil drop dramatically. \nAlso, as we look at the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, it certainly makes \nsense to know whether we have one sitting up in the arctic area \nadjacent to Prudhoe Bay.\n  Today, I am going to talk about the natural gas crisis in America \nbecause that crisis is here today. To give you some idea, yesterday we \nwere quoting gas prices for delivery in October at $5.34 per 1,000 \ncubic feet. How does that compare with 9 months ago? Nine months ago, \nit was $2.16 per thousand cubic feet. What is it for November of this \nyear? The November figures are out. It is $5.45 for delivery in \nNovember.\n  The significance of that can probably be reflected on who uses gas. \nThe American public out there knows who uses gas. Fifty percent of our \nhomes in this country rely on natural gas for heating. Natural gas \nprovides 15 percent of our Nation's electrical power, and it is \ngrowing.\n  The reality is, we are not going to have any new supply in place \nbefore this winter. The reality is, the administration isn't going to \nbe able to go into a strategic natural gas reserve, because there isn't \nany.\n  So what are we going to do? The projections are very clear. We are \nusing about 22 trillion cubic feet of gas now. It is estimated we will \nbe somewhere between 32 and 34 trillion cubic feet by the year 2010.\n  This is going to be primarily the result of the utility industry in \nthis country--an industry we take for granted because the lights \nusually work. We are an electronic society. We depend on computers, e-\nmail. This power has to come from somewhere. You have your air-\nconditioners, your heating. The demand is up.\n  It is going to cost the industry somewhere in the area of $1.5 \nbillion to put in more infrastructure. We are concerned about pipeline \nsafety. As more gas is utilized, we are putting more pressure on our \npipelines. This is a multiplier of demand, of price increases. The \nreason so much pressure is on natural gas is we do not have a policy on \noil. Our policy is to import more oil. Before the 1973 Arab Oil \nEmbargo, after which we created SPR, we were 37-percent dependent on \nimported oil. To give you some idea of where we are going in that \nregard, today we are 58-percent dependent on imported oil.\n  The administration has always favored clean gas as the alternative. \nBut now we are using our gas reserves faster than we are finding new \nreserves. When you are in business, and you are selling your inventory \nfaster than you are replacing it, you have a problem. This is an alert \nto the American people and, hopefully, my colleagues because we are \nfacing a train wreck. It is coming. The signs are here. The \nadministration has yet to address what they are going to do about it.\n  Certainly releasing the crude oil in SPR isn't going to help the gas \nsituation because the demand is there. The reason the demand is there \nis quite simple. I have indicated oil is not the answer, simply because \nwe become more dependent on imports.\n  So let's move to hydro. What do they want to do? They want to take \ndown hydroelectric dams. The tradeoff of that, of course, is putting \nthe barge traffic on the highways.\n  Coal: We have an abundance of coal. We have clean coal technology. \nBut you have not seen a new coal plant built in this country in the \nlast several years. I think the last one was back in the mid-1990s. You \ncan't get permits.\n  Nuclear: Twenty percent of our power comes from nuclear energy. Have \nwe built a new plant in this last decade or the last two decades? No \none in their right mind would build a nuclear plant because the \nGovernment will not fulfill its contractual commitments to take the \nwaste that it agreed to do and the ratepayers have been paying for the \nlast two decades.\n  So everywhere we look--everywhere we look--we are check-mated. We \ncan't find an alternative source other than gas. That is why American \nconsumers should care.\n  According to the Energy Information Administration, Midwestern \nfamilies will spend as much as 40 percent more on heating this winter \nbecause of higher natural gas prices; that is, expecting a typical \nwinter. A real cold spike could cause some real problems. I am not \nsuggesting you go out and sharpen your saw or put gasoline in your \nchain saw, but it isn't a bad idea. I know that is being done in the \nNortheast Corridor.\n  So we have an increased demand, no new supply, and this adds up to \nhigher gas prices for the American people this winter, make no mistake \nabout it.\n  What has the administration done about it? As I have said, it used to \nbe that natural gas was kind of a seasonal fuel, stored underground in \nthe summer, drawn down for winter use. But we now have a large summer \ndemand for natural gas because more and more electric powerplants rely \non natural gas. Here is the figure: Over 96 percent of all the new \nplants will be gas fired. If they all come on line, we simply do not \nhave the gas supply.\n  Again, permits are obtainable for gas, unlike coal and fossil fuel. \nWe can't get enough natural gas from existing wells to fuel these new \npowerplants if they all go on line. I had one CEO of a major oil and \ngas company tell me: We are virtually out of natural gas. We can no \nlonger store gas in the summer. Our winter stocks are low. With a cold \nwinter, prices are going to go up. Reserves are not adequate to buffer \nsurges in consumer demand.\n  As I have stated, even if this winter is normal, we will still face \nnatural gas prices--we know it already--they are going to be over 50 \npercent higher than last year--$2.16--and I indicated earlier they are \ncurrently $5.45 for November delivery. The simple reason is, the demand \nis strong and supply is not keeping pace. The market responds with \nwhat? Higher prices. It is supply and demand.\n  The administration touts natural gas as its ``bridge to the energy \nfuture'': Our cleanest fossil fuel, fewer emissions; efficient end use; \nno need to depend on imports. Yet as they express this and encourage \nyou to use gas, their actions simply do not match the rhetoric. Rather \nthan encourage new supplies, they stifle supplies.\n  Proof: This administration has placed Federal lands off limits to new \nnatural gas exploration and production. They have taken the Rocky \nMountain overthrust belt--that is Wyoming, Colorado, Montana--these \nStates have a tremendous capability for producing oil and gas. Well \nmore\n\n[[Page S9333]]\n\nthan 50 percent--about 56 percent--of the public land in those areas, \nthe overthrust belt, have been taken off from any exploration or \ndevelopment for oil and gas.\n  Now the Forest Service comes along with a roadless policy to lock up \n40 million acres of national forest, eliminating any exploration for \noil and gas. We have a moratorium on OCS leasing and drilling until \n2012.\n  The Vice President would even cancel existing leases. He made a \nstatement in Rye, NH, on October 21, 1999:\n\n       I will make sure that there is no new oil leasing off the \n     coasts of California and Florida. And then I will go much \n     further: I will do everything in my power to make sure that \n     there is no new drilling off these sensitive areas--even in \n     areas already leased by previous administrations.\n\n  I do not know what that means to you, Mr. President, but it means to \nme that he is not going to support OCS activities of any consequence, \nand he is even going to attempt to cancel and negate some of the \nexisting leases.\n  Where is it going to come from? He conveniently ducks that issue. Al \nGore claims to have invented the Internet, but he refuses to provide \nnatural gas that is needed to provide electricity to power it.\n  We use more electricity today. We are an energy consuming country--e-\nmails, electronics, computers. Even if we had access to more natural \ngas, regulation after regulation inhibits construction of new pipelines \nto get gas to the consumer.\n  The Northeast Corridor: There have been nothing but delays--3 years \nof delay. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC, that \nregulates and has to approve it, has been sitting on it. This would \nhave given the Northeast Corridor a clean source of fuel. Most of this \nis Canadian gas. It has taken forever.\n  This administration wants you to use more natural gas, but at the \nsame time they make sure you can't get it. That sounds like a recipe \nfor higher prices, if you ask me, higher home electric costs, heating \ncosts. Then what happens to the problem? It is going to get worse. The \ndemand is expected to grow from 22 trillion cubic feet to over 35 \ntrillion cubic feet by the year 2010. Without new exploration and new \nproduction, natural gas prices are going to go even higher. We are \ngoing to pay more to heat our homes, run our businesses.\n  When higher heating bills arrive this winter, we will want to thank \nthe President and Vice President Gore for causing a natural gas crisis \nin America, one that was predictable, one that we knew was coming.\n  We have been asleep. The train wreck is coming. The solution is \nobvious: increase domestic supply of gas. Increased domestic supply \nwill obviously lower prices, reduce volatility, and ensure a safe and \nsecure energy supply.\n  I am all for alternative energy. I am all for conservation. But the \nreality is, transportation does not move on hot air. Members of this \nbody don't go home on an airplane that flies on hot air. It flies on \nfuel. Our homes are not heated by hot air from Washington. They are \nheated by natural gas, 50 percent of all homes. That is 56 million \nhomes in this country.\n  We found 36 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in the Prudhoe Bay oil \nfield while searching for oil. We never looked for gas. Now there is a \npossibility the economics will favor bringing that gas down from Alaska \nfor distribution in the lower 48 States, but don't think it is going to \nbe cheap gas. You have to amortize the cost of a pipeline that is going \nto run some 1,600 miles down through Alaska, follow the Alcan Highway, \ngoing through Canada and into the Canadian prebuilt system for \ndistribution into the U.S.\n  The fact is, we have proven gas, but the market has never been able \nto sustain the cost. At this range, the feasibility of that project is \nvery costly. The most important thing we can do, however, is to \nincrease access to proven natural gas that is likely to be found on \nFederal lands. We need to depend on all sources of energy--oil, gas, \nclean coal, hydro, and nuclear--and we need to conserve.\n  That is why Senator Lott and others have introduced the National \nEnergy Security Act of 2000, S. 2557. Briefly, it would increase the \ndomestic gas supply by allowing frontier royalty relief; improving \nFederal gas lease management; providing tax incentives for production; \nand assuring price certainty for small producers. It would require the \nadministration to develop a comprehensive strategy to ensure that \nnatural gas remains affordable and available to American consumers. It \nwould allow new exploration for natural gas in America's Arctic as well \nas the Rocky Mountain States and along the OCS areas.\n  As I have indicated, we have substantial potential for new reserves, \nbut if you don't have access to the areas, you might as well leave it \nin the ground because it will never be developed. We want to remove the \ndisincentives for utilities to use natural gas, protect consumers \nagainst seasonal price spikes, especially with regard to Northeast \nheating oil use, and increase funding for energy efficiency and \nweatherization assistance to reduce winter heating bills.\n  A noted economist, Daniel Yergin, stated that this current energy \n``shock'' could turn into a world crisis--that is paraphrasing the \nexposure that we have today. You can ask Tony Blair from Great Britain \nabout the price of energy that is threatening his Government. Unless we \ntake the kinds of actions outlined in this policy plan of the \nRepublicans that we have submitted before this body, as represented in \nthe legislation, S. 2557, the National Energy Security Act, we very \nwell will face a current energy shock that could turn into a world \ncrisis. Just look at the stock market this morning; it is pretty shaky.\n  There is probably more to come because of the uncertainty over where \nwe are with regard to energy and the spiraling costs. It is referenced \nin a taxi ride to Capitol Hill; there is a surcharge. It is referenced \nin your airplane ticket now. You can't figure out the airplane tickets \nanyway; they are so confusing whether you fly on Thursday, Friday, or \nSunday, or before a.m. or p.m. It is in there, all your truckers, all \nyour delivery systems. Everybody is now facing the reality that energy \ncosts are higher. It is going to have an effect.\n  Finally, thanks to the failed energy policies of Clinton-Gore, we are \ngoing to pay more for gas this winter. We must increase domestic supply \nof natural gas to meet demand. This administration continues to make \nnew exploration and production not just difficult but almost \nimpossible. We pay the price.\n  This GOP energy plan encourages short-term efforts to minimize spike \nhikes this winter and increase supply in the long term.\n  Tomorrow, I hope to talk a little bit about where the oil and gas is \nlikely to be found.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/27/senate-section/article/S9333-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9333-S9334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT AND NOMINATION OF BONNIE CAMPBELL\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss my disappointment that \nthe Republican leadership in the Senate seems to have better things to \ndo than to pass a bill reauthorizing one of our most effective laws to \ncombat domestic violence. I am talking about the Violence Against Women \nAct.\n  Since it became law in 1994, it has provided money to State and local \nprograms to help women obtain restraining orders and to arrest those \nwho are abusing women. The numbers show that the Violence Against Women \nAct is working.\n  A recent Justice Department report found that domestic violence \nagainst women decreased by 21 percent between 1993 and 1998. That is \ngood news, but we still have a long way to go.\n  In 1998, American women were the victims of 876,340 acts of domestic \nviolence. Between 1993 and 1998, domestic violence accounted for 22 \npercent of the violent crimes against women. And during those same \nyears, children under the age of 12 lived in 43 percent of the \nhouseholds where domestic violence occurred. This is generational. The \nkids see it, they grow up, they become abusive parents themselves.\n  In Iowa and all across America, law enforcement officers and \nprosecutors and victims service organizations are fighting back, but \nthey need help. The help they need is to make sure we reauthorize the \nViolence Against Women Act, to make sure it is funded, to keep the \ngreat job going that it has been doing over the last 5 years.\n\n[[Page S9334]]\n\n  There is other help that we need to cut down on domestic violence and \nviolence against women; that is, to make sure that we have judges on \nour courts who understand this law, who know what is happening out \nthere and can make sure the law is applied fairly and is upheld in the \ncourts around the country.\n  To that end, it is again disappointing that the Republican Senate is \nholding up the nomination of one person uniquely qualified to ensure \nthat the Violence Against Women Act is enforced in our courts around \nthe country.\n  Since the beginning of the Violence Against Women Office that was \ncreated under the Justice Department in 1995, the person who has been \nat the head of that office is the former attorney general of the State \nof Iowa, Bonnie Campbell. Earlier this year, the President nominated \nher for a vacancy on the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. She has had \nher hearing on the Judiciary Committee. She is broadly supported on \nboth sides of the aisle, strongly supported in her home State of Iowa \nwhere, as I said, she served with distinction as attorney general. Yet \nfor some reason, the Judiciary Committee is holding up her nomination.\n  I have heard a couple of reasons: It is too late in the year; this is \nan election year; they want to hold on, maybe Bush will be elected and \nthey can get their people in.\n  So, that makes me feel the need to take a look at the history of our \njudicial nominations. In 1992, when there was a Republican in the White \nHouse and the Democrats controlled the Senate. But in 1992, from July \nthrough October, the Democratically controlled Senate confirmed nine \ncircuit court judges. This year, with a Democratic President but a \nRepublican-controlled Senate, we have only gotten one confirmed since \nJuly. We have some pending who could be reported out, one of whom is \nBonnie Campbell. But we see no action and time is running out.\n  And everything I have heard from the Judiciary Committee is that they \nwill not report her name out. The other thing I heard was, she was \nnominated too late. I also heard from some people on the committee--\nthat she was only nominated earlier this year. I shouldn't expect her \nto be reported out.\n  Well, again, let's take a look at the record books. In 1992, when \nthere was a Republican President and a Democratic Senate, nine circuit \nnominees were nominated and confirmed that same year. Let me say that \nagain. They were nominated in 1992 and acted on in 1992. Yet this year, \nwe are told that the Republican-controlled Senate cannot move circuit \ncourt judges out because it is an election year. Yet when the Democrats \nwere in charge in 1992, as I said, nine were nominated and nine were \nacted upon by the Democratic Senate.\n  Let's jump back to this year. Seven people this year were nominated \nto sit on the judicial circuit. Only 1 of those seven has been \nconfirmed and that was in July.\n  I want to focus on Bonnie Campbell. A hearing was held in May. All \nthe paperwork is done. She is widely supported. If there are people \nhere who would like to vote against her, at least bring her nomination \nto the floor; and if they want to vote against her, for whatever \nreason, let them do so. But I have not had one person on the Republican \nside or the Democratic side come to this Senator and say that Bonnie \nCampbell is not qualified to be a circuit court judge--not one. She is \neminently well qualified and everyone knows it.\n  Here is this person who has headed the Office of Violence Against \nWomen in the Department of Justice since it started. She has run it for \n5 years. The House of Representatives, yesterday, reauthorized the \nViolence Against Women Act, with 415 votes for it. I ask, do you think \n415 Members of the House, Republicans and Democrats, would have voted \nthat overwhelmingly to reauthorize the bill if the person who had been \nrunning that office had not done an exemplary job? I think by the very \nfact that 415 Members of the House, from every end of the ideological \nspectrum, voted to reauthorize that bill, what they are saying is that \nBonnie Campbell gets an A-plus on running that office, implementing the \nVAWA provisions and enforcing the law. Yet this Republican Senate will \nnot report her name out on the floor to be confirmed, or at least to \nvote on her to be a circuit court judge.\n  Well, I tell you, talk about a split personality. The Republicans in \nthis Senate can talk all they want to about violence against women and \nthat they are going to bring the bill up and we are going to pass it \nbefore the end of the year; but if this Republican-controlled Senate \nholds Bonnie Campbell's name and won't let her come out for a vote, \nthey are saying: We will pass the Violence Against Women Act, but we \ndon't want judges on our courts who are going to enforce it. I say that \nbecause nobody is more qualified to enforce it than Bonnie Campbell.\n  The Judiciary Committee, I am told, is going to meet tomorrow. I am \nhopeful that tomorrow they will report Bonnie Campbell's name out for \naction by the full Senate.\n  (Mr. L. CHAFEE assumed the chair.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/27/senate-section/article/S9334-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9334-S9335]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROPOSAL\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, it is time to shed some light on the \nMedicare prescription drug proposal advanced by some of my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle and by their nominee for President, Gov. \nGeorge Bush.\n  Unfortunately, there is a big TV ad campaign being waged across the \ncountry to deceive and frighten seniors about the Medicare prescription \ndrug benefit proposed by Vice President Al Gore and the Democrats in \nthe Senate. So I want to set the facts straight.\n  First, let's examine Bush's ``immediate helping hand.'' That is what \nGovernor Bush calls his Medicare proposal. Quite simply, it is not \nimmediate and it doesn't give much help. Will it be immediate? The \nanswer is no. His plan for Medicare would require all 50 States to pass \nenabling or modifying legislation. Right now, only 16 States have any \nkind of drug benefit for seniors. Each State will have a different \napproach. Many State legislatures only meet once every 2 years. So for \nBush's plan to go into effect, the State has to pass some kind of \nenabling legislation.\n\n  Well, our most recent experience with something like this was the \nCHIP program, the State Children's Health Insurance Program, which \nCongress passed in 1997. It took Governor Bush's home State of Texas \nover 2 years to implement the CHIP program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent to continue for 10 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. THOMAS. I object. We have a time agreement and I think we ought \nto stick with it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Parliamentary inquiry. What is the time allotment for the \nremainder of morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Robb is to be recognized for 5 \nminutes, Senator Leahy has 15 minutes, and Senator Thomas has 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Repeat that, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Thomas has 10 minutes, Senator Robb \nhas 5, and Senator Leahy has 15.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, who is next in order to be recognized?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is nobody.\n  Mr. THOMAS. If the time has been divided on both sides and if the \nSenator wants to use some of his associate's time, I have no objection.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will check on that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I may take Senator Robb's 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as I said, most State legislatures meet \nevery 2 years. Governor Bush's own State didn't even implement the CHIP \nprogram for over 2 years. In addition, the States don't even want this \nblock grant. In February of this year, the Governors rejected Bush's \nproposal. They said:\n\n       If Congress decides to expand prescription drug coverage \n     for seniors, it should not shift that responsibility or its \n     costs to the States.\n\n  That was the National Governors' Association. Republicans and \nDemocrats said Bush's proposal won't work. So that won't be immediate. \nBush's proposal takes years to get any effect for people.\n\n[[Page S9335]]\n\n  Will it give a helping hand? Well, Bush's plan only covers low-income \nseniors. Middle-class seniors are told they don't need to apply. That \nis what Bush's plan is. It only helps low-income. For example, if you \nare a senior and your income is over $14,600 a year, you get zero, zip, \nno help at all, from Bush's Medicare proposal.\n  A recent analysis shows that the Bush plan would only cover 625,000 \nseniors, or less than 5 percent of those who need help. So his plan is \nnot adequate and it is not Medicare. Seniors want Medicare, not \nwelfare.\n  The other thing is that under the Bush proposal for Federal care, for \nhis prescription drug program, seniors would probably have to go to the \nState welfare office to apply for it. Why is that? Because there is an \nincome cutoff. The agencies in the States that are set up to determine \nwhether or not you meet income guidelines for programs are welfare \nagencies. So that means that under the Bush program, every senior, to \nget prescription drugs, has to go down to the welfare agency and show \nthat they don't make over $14,600 a year. That is the first 4 years. \nBush's program is for 4 years. States have not acted. As I pointed out, \nsome State legislatures don't even meet except once every 2 years.\n\n  They have to go down to the welfare office. It only helps those below \n$14,000 a year.\n  Then what happens after 4 years? After 4 years, Governor Bush's plan \nbecomes even worse because his long-term plan, after 4 years, involves \nprivatizing Medicare. It would raise premiums and force seniors to join \nHMOs.\n  The Bush plan is the fulfillment of what Newt Gingrich once said when \nhe wanted Medicare to ``wither on the vine.'' Bush's plan after 4 years \nwill begin withering Medicare on the vine because after 4 years, \nGovernor Bush's program leaves seniors who need drug coverage at the \nmercy of HMOs.\n  Under his plan, they don't get a guaranteed benefit package. The \npremium would be chosen by the HMOs, and the copayment would be chosen \nby the HMO. The deductible would be chosen by the HMO. The drug you \nget, again, is chosen by the HMO--not by your doctor, and not by your \npharmacist, but by the HMO.\n  Even worse, the Bush plan would leave rural Americans in the cold. \nAbout 30 percent of seniors live in areas with no HMOs. In Iowa, we \nhave no Medicare HMOs. There are only eight seniors in the entire State \nof Iowa who happen to live near Sioux Falls, SD, who belong to a plan \nwith a prescription drug benefit--eight out of the entire State of \nIowa.\n  HMOs are dropping like flies out of rural areas. Almost 1 million \nMedicare beneficiaries lost their HMO coverage just this year.\n  Under the Bush plan, first of all, it is not immediate. States would \nhave to enact these plans. The Governors say they don't even want to do \nit.\n  Under the Bush plan, Medicare would ``wither on the vine.'' Premiums \nfor regular Medicare would increase 25 percent to 47 percent in the \nfirst year alone, and seniors would be forced to join HMOs to receive \naffordable benefits.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, will my friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Certainly, I will yield for a question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. It is just a very brief question. I thank my friend. I \nthink that is the clearest explanation I have ever heard of the Bush \nplan. It is very clear.\n  Something that I read yesterday reminded me of the days when Newt \nGingrich was in control, and as the Senator well remembers, in 1995 it \nled to a Government shutdown. They wanted to cut $207 billion out of \nMedicare over 10 years. And we said that is the end of Medicare. It \nturns out that Governor Bush in those years said that Gingrich and the \nRepublicans were courageous to do this, and he lauded it. I think if \nyou take that statement and mesh it with what the Senator from Iowa \njust taught us about his plan, it all adds up now. It is the end of \nMedicare.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Here is basically the thing.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask that my friend get an additional 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator's time has \nexpired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I want to again say that we have divided \nthis time, and I expect to live within the divisions that we have \nagreed to and, therefore, we will try to do that.\n  Mr. HARKIN. It works both ways.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Certainly, it works both ways. We have divided the time, \nand that is the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/27/senate-section/article/S9335-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9335-S9336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ENERGY POLICY\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I want to go back a little bit to one of \nthe issues that is before us that has to do with energy and energy \npolicy.\n  Certainly, we are faced at the moment with some real difficulties in \nterms of winter use of heating oil.\n  There are differences of view as to what we do with the strategic \nstorage. I understand that.\n  But aside from that, I think in one way or another we certainly need \nto help those people who will need help this winter in terms of price \nand in terms of availability.\n  We had a hearing yesterday with the Secretary of Energy. Quite \nfrankly, I didn't get any feel for where we are going in the long term. \nWhat we have done here, of course, over the last number of years with \nthe fact that this administration has had an energy policy--some have \naccused them of having no policy; I suggest there has been a policy--is \nto basically not do anything to encourage, and, in fact, discourage, \ndomestic production. The result of that, of course, has been that since \n1992, U.S. oil production is down 17 percent and consumption is up 14 \npercent. We have had a reduction since 1990 in U.S. jobs producing and \nexploring for oil. At that point, we had over 400,000 workers. Now to \ndo the same thing, the number is down 27 percent.\n  We have had a policy that despite the increased use of energy, which \nis not to be unexpected in this kind of a prosperous time, we have \nsought to reduce exploration, and we have become more dependent on \nforeign oil. We are now nearly 57-percent dependent on OPEC for \nproviding our energy sources.\n  There are a number of things we could be doing that would certainly \nhelp alleviate that problem.\n  One is access to public lands in the West. Of course, in Wyoming 50 \npercent of the land belongs to the Federal Government. In some States, \nit is as much as 85 percent.\n  As we make it more difficult for our oil exploration and production \nto show up on Federal lands with multiple use, then we see that \nproduction go down.\n  As we put more and more regulations on refiners and have reformulated \ngasoline, it makes it more difficult. Older refineries have to go out \nof business. We then find it more difficult to be able to process the \noil that we indeed have which is there to be used.\n  We also, of course, have an opportunity in many ways to produce \nenergy. We could have a very healthy nuclear energy system if we could \ngo ahead and move forward with storage out at Yucca Mountain in Nevada. \nWe have not been able to do that.\n  We could certainly use more low-sulfur coal.\n  But we continue to put regulations on the production of those things.\n  One of the things that seemed fairly clear yesterday was that the \nDepartment of Energy has relatively little to do with energy policy, \neven if they choose to. The policy is being made by the Environmental \nPolicy Council in the White House. It is being made by EPA. It is being \nmade by these other kinds of regulatory agencies. Obviously, all of us \nwant to continue to work to have clean air. Air is much cleaner than it \nwas.\n  I think what we need to recognize is one of the things that came out \nagain yesterday. Vice President Gore announced some time ago that there \nwould be no more drilling. That is the kind of policy that has been \ndeveloped.\n  What we ought to be doing is taking a longer look at where we are \ngoing with energy and have some idea of what we will do over the years. \nIt is one thing to be able to work in the next 2 or 3 months and argue \nabout how you do that. But the real issue is where we are in the next \nyear and the year after in those areas where energy is such an \nimportant part of our economy.\n\n[[Page S9336]]\n\n  I am hopeful that the outcome of what we have here with this current \ndilemma with respect to energy will result in a real, honest-to-\ngoodness debate, discussion, and decision with respect to long-term \nenergy policy and increased access to public lands for potential oil \nand gas in the Rocky Mountains, offshore, and in Alaska, and at the \nsame time develop techniques where we can do it and also take care of \nthe environment. It is not a choice between the two things.\n  We should develop tax incentives to try to encourage increases in oil \nand gas production, particularly in stripper wells. In old production \nwells, it really hasn't been economic to do that.\n  We can do some things with respect, of course, to research. We have \nbeen working now for a couple of years on a mineral management group to \nbe able to clarify how those charges are made, and we have been unable \nto do that over a period of time.\n  There are a number of things: The Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, \nwe now have in my State a real activity going on with methane gas \nproduction--gas production that we need now under the Clean Water Act. \nSome Senators are pushing against insertions of fracture used to help \nwith that production. These things are all, of course, inconsistent \nwith some kind of policy which will, indeed, move us forward in terms \nof energy development.\n\n  Refineries are already up to 95 percent of capacity or more. So to \nactually take oil out of the reserve, if there isn't a refinery \ncapacity, makes it very difficult. Everyone recognizes the difficulty \nin the Northeast, the major user of oil for heating in the wintertime. \nThat has traditionally been important. We do need to do some things \nthere. We need to provide more fuel. We need also, I am sure, to do \nsomething about low-income users.\n  There are a number of things we need to do. I hope we don't totally \nget involved in making this a political issue. Rather than trying now \nto point out what everyone has done or hasn't done, we ought to say, \nall right, here is where we are; now what do we do? How much can we do \nto develop domestic production? What are the best ways to do that? How \ncan we move in that direction? How soon can we move forward with that?\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, yesterday I was amazed when I checked my \ncomputer, as I do during the day, to see what the latest news items \nwere in our country and around the world. I learned of another tragic \nincident of school violence in a middle school in New Orleans. Just \nbefore noon yesterday, two teenaged boys, age 13 and 15, shot each \nother with the same gun during a fight just outside the cafeteria at \nthe Carter G. Woodson Middle School. Hundreds of students were inside \neating lunch. Both boys are in critical condition.\n  The growing list of schoolyard violence by children in Arkansas, \nWashington, Oregon, Tennessee, California, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, \nMississippi, Colorado, Georgia, Michigan, Florida, and now Louisiana is \nsimply unacceptable and intolerable.\n  Over a year ago, May 20, 1999, this Senate passed the Hatch-Leahy \njuvenile crime bill by a vote of 73-25. It had a number of things that \nwould address school violence, a number of things that would help with \nthe problems of teenage violence, that would create everything from \nmentoring programs to the prosecution of juvenile delinquents, and it \npassed overwhelmingly, with Republicans and Democrats alike voting for \nit.\n  But we never had a real conference on it. It was stalled. Why? \nBecause the gun lobbies told the Republican leadership that there was \none minor problem, one minor bit of gun control--closing the gun show \nloophole, something that allows people to sell firearms to felons out \nof the back of a pickup truck at a flea market. One would think \neveryone would want to close that gun loophole and say everyone will \nabide by the same rules that the regular gun shops in Vermont or \nanywhere else have to follow; but, instead, because the gun lobby \ndoesn't want that simple loophole closed, we haven't gone forward with \na vote on this juvenile justice bill that goes into so many other \nareas--helping troubled teens, helping prosecutors, courts, and others \nwith teenage violence.\n  How many shootings do we have to have before the leadership, the \nRepublican leadership, says we will stand up to the gun lobby and \nactually have a vote? If this Senate wants to vote against it, let it \nvote against it. I don't know why the Republicans are so concerned. \nThey have a majority. They can vote against this bill if they want. But \nvote. Vote ``aye'' or vote ``nay.'' We are not paid to vote ``maybe.'' \nWe are paid to vote up or down. We should do it. It has been more than \n15 months since the Senate acted. It has been more than a year since \nthe only meeting of the House-Senate conference committee on the Hatch-\nLeahy juvenile crime bill. It was on August 5, 1999 that Chairman Hatch \nconvened the conference for the limited purpose of opening statements. \nI am disappointed that the Republican majority continues to refuse to \nreconvene the conference and that for a over a year this Congress has \nfailed to respond to issues of youth violence, school violence and \ncrime prevention.\n\n  It has been 17 months since the tragedy at Columbine High School in \nLittleton, Colorado, where 14 students and a teacher lost their lives. \nSenate and House Democrats have been ready for more than a year to \nreconvene the juvenile justice conference and work with Republicans to \ncraft an effective juvenile justice conference report, but the \nRepublican majority has adamantly refused to act.\n  On October 20, 1999, all the House and Senate Democratic conferees \nwrote to Senator Hatch who serves as the Chairman of the juvenile \njustice conference, and Congressman Hyde, the Chairman of the House \nJudiciary Committee, to reconvene the conference immediately.\n  In April of this year, Congressman Hyde joined our call for the \njuvenile justice conference to meet as soon as possible in a letter to \nSenator Hatch, which was also signed by Congressman Conyers.\n  Last March, the President invited House and Senate leaders of the \nconference to the White House to implore us to proceed to the \nconference and to final enactment of legislation before the anniversary \nof the Columbine tragedy.\n  This effort to jump-start the stalled conference could not break \nthrough the majority's intransigent inaction. That anniversary, like so \nmany others tragic anniversaries has come and gone. We have seen more \nincidents but no action by the Republican Congress.\n  The Republican majority has rejected the President's pleas for action \nas they have those of the American people. Every parent, teacher and \nstudent in this country is concerned about school violence over the \nlast few years and worried about when the next shooting may occur. They \nonly hope it does not happen at their school or involve their children.\n  We all recognize that there is no single cause and no single \nlegislative solution that will cure the ill of youth violence in our \nschools or in our streets. But we have had an opportunity before us to \ndo our part and the Republican majority has chosen to squander it. We \nshould have seized this opportunity to act on balanced, effective \njuvenile justice legislation.\n  I regret that this Republican Congress has failed to do its work and \nprovide the additional resources and reforms that would have been \nhelpful and reassuring to our children, parents, grandparents, teachers \nand schools.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, my main reason for coming to the floor \ntoday is to introduce the Windfall Oil Profits for Heating Assistance \nAct of 2000.\n\n[[Page S9337]]\n\n  (The remarks of Mr. Leahy pertaining to the introduction of S. 3118 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I appreciate very much the willingness on \nthe part of the Senator from Iowa to give me an opportunity to make \nsome remarks with regard to where we are on the legislation.\n  Yesterday's vote demonstrates clearly that there is strong bipartisan \nsupport in the Senate for increasing the number of visas for high-\nskilled workers. On that point, Democrats and Republicans agree, but \nthere is a stark disagreement between our parties on the issue of \nfairness to immigrants.\n  Republicans do not want to acknowledge this; they do not want to \nadmit that they oppose the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act. That is \nwhy they have gone to such extraordinary lengths to try to avoid having \nto take a public position on it. There is an election coming up, and \nthey do not want to have to explain to Latino and immigrant groups why \nthey told thousands of hard-working immigrants who are in this country \ndoing essential jobs: Go home. Republicans would rather risk not \ndelaying the passage of the H-1B visa bill than vote for the Latino and \nImmigrant Fairness Act or risk the political consequences of voting \nagainst it.\n  There is really no reason we cannot pass both a strong H-1B bill and \nthe Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act.\n  We are in the longest period of economic expansion in our Nation's \nhistory. We all know that now. The census numbers which were released \nyesterday confirm once again the remarkable progress we have made in \nrecent years.\n  In the last 7 years, we have seen 20 million new jobs. Unemployment \nis lower now than it has been in 30 years. In my State of South Dakota, \nthe jobless rate is between 2 and 3 percent.\n  Ten years ago, many companies could not expand because they could not \nget the capital. Today they can get the capital, but they cannot get \nthe workers.\n  Clearly, one of the industries hardest hit by today's skilled-worker \nshortage is the information technology industry. According to a recent \nsurvey of almost 900 IT executives, nearly 10 percent of IT service and \nsupport positions in this country--268,740 jobs--are unfilled today \nbecause there are not enough skilled workers in this country to fill \nthem.\n  The H-1B visa program was supposed to prevent such shortages, but it \ncannot because it has not kept pace with the growth in our economy. \nThis year, in fact, the H-1B program reached its ceiling of 115,000 \nvisas in less than 6 months. That is why my colleagues and I support \nsubstantially increasing the number of visas available under the H-1B \nprogram.\n  The high-tech industry, however, is not the only industry struggling \nwith worker shortages. The Federal Reserve Board has said repeatedly \nthat there are widespread shortages of essential workers all through \nthe United States. All across America, restaurants, hotels, and nursing \nhomes are in desperate need of help. Widespread labor shortages in \nthese industries also pose a very significant threat to our economy. \nThat is one reason my colleagues and I introduced the Latino and \nImmigrant Fairness Act earlier this year and why we wanted to offer \nthat legislation as an amendment to this measure.\n  The changes in our proposal are pro-business and certainly pro-\nfamily. They are modest, and they are long overdue. We have talked \nabout them before, but let me just, again for the Record, make sure \npeople are clear as to what it is we want to do.\n  First, we want to establish legal parity for all Central American and \nCaribbean refugees. That is not too much to ask. Why is it we treat \nrefugees from some countries differently from refugees from other \ncountries? All we are asking for is parity.\n\n  Second, we want to update the registry so that immigrants who have \nbeen in this country since before 1986, who have worked hard and played \nby the rules, will remain here permanently and will have the ability to \nremain here legally.\n  We want to restore section 245(i) of the Immigration Act so that a \nperson who is in this country and on the verge of becoming a legal \nresident can remain here while he or she completes the process. Why \nwould we want to send somebody back to the country they fled--someone \nwho is eligible to be a legal resident--just so they can come back here \nagain? If we do not change the law, that is exactly what will happen, \nforcing these immigrants to pay thousands of dollars, disrupt their \nlives, and maybe imperil their opportunity to come back at all.\n  Finally, we want to adjust the status of the Liberians who fled to \nAmerica when Liberia was plunged into a horrific civil war. Thousands \nof them live in the State of the current Presiding Officer. Our Nation \ngave these families protected immigrant status which allowed them to \nstay in the United States but preempted their asylum claims. Instead of \nforcing them to return to Liberia, a nation our Government warns \nAmericans to avoid because it is so dangerous even today, our bill will \ngive them the opportunity to become legal residents. That is all it \nwould do.\n  Earlier this month, a coalition of 31 associations--the U.S. Chamber \nof Commerce, the American Health Care Association, the National \nRestaurant Association, the National Retail Federation, and about 28 \nmore--all came together and said: If there is something you do before \nthe end of this year, now that we have PNTR finished, we hope you can \npass the restoration of Section 245(i) and these other reasonable \nimmigration provisions.\n  It is the only fair thing to do, and it is good business. We need \nthis done. That is the message from the Chamber of Commerce and the \nAmerican Retail Federation sent. The American economy is growing not in \nspite of immigrant workers, but with their help. That is one reason we \nshould pass the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act now.\n\n[[Page S9338]]\n\n  There is another reason. President Roosevelt once said: ``We are a \nnation of immigrants.'' We are also a nation that values families. This \nprinciple is not relegated to one ethnic group. Whether you are African \nAmerican, European American, Latino American, or Asian American, we \nvalue family. That is important to us. If we do not pass the provisions \nin our proposal, thousands of immigrant parents of American-born \nchildren will face an excruciating choice. If they are told to leave \nthis country, should they defy the law so that they can remain with \ntheir American-citizen children or should they leave their children \nhere in the hope that others will care for them? Forcing choices like \nthis is simply antithetical to our commitment to family values.\n  I have heard all the speeches in the Senate Chamber about protecting \nfamily, doing what is best for family, trying to ensure that families \nstay together. We are concerned about what children watch on \ntelevision. But for Heaven's sake, if we care what they watch on \ntelevision, we ought to decide right now where we want them to watch \ntelevision. Children ought to be watching television here with their \nfamilies.\n  That is the choice: Should they leave their children here and hope \nthat others care for them, or should they take their children back to \nnations that are mired in poverty and torn by violence or both?\n  Surely, those are not the kinds of choices we should force on people \nwho have lived in this country and played by the rules for years. That \nis not the way we should treat people who have done the essential jobs \nthat others did not want, particularly today when we need their labor \nso desperately.\n  My colleagues and I strongly support the H-1B visa bill. On that \nthere can be no doubt, especially after yesterday's vote. But we are \ndeeply disturbed and disappointed that the majority has refused to \nallow us to offer the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act or any other \namendment on this bill. Once again we have been refused the right to \noffer even one amendment to the bill.\n  I have offered the majority leader many opportunities. I suggested \nfive and five. I suggested that they have five amendments, that we have \nfive amendments, that we limit them in terms of time and second degree \namendments because we wanted to get this bill done. I heard the \nallegation that: No, Democrats just want to slow down the process, the \ndeliberation, the consideration of the H-1B bill; they don't want it to \npass.\n  Our answer to that, you saw yesterday. We want it to pass. That is \nwhy I offered a limit on amendments, why I offered a limit on time, why \nI offered almost any formula you could come up with so that we could \naccommodate both.\n  Let's pass H-1B, but for Heaven's sake, with 2 weeks left, let's pass \nthe Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act as well. Once again we have been \nrefused the right to offer even one amendment to the bill. Once again \nwe are told: Do it our way, or we are not going to do it at all. This \nis not how this body should operate. Offering amendments and voting on \nthem does not kill bills, it strengthens them, and it strengthens this \nSenate.\n  Why are our Republican colleagues so determined not even to let us \ndiscuss our amendment? They are the majority. If they believe our \nproposal is misguided, they can vote it down, they can table it. They \ncan do anything they want to. They have the votes. Why won't they allow \nthat vote? What are they so afraid of?\n  We are pleased we are finally on the verge of passing this \nlegislation and increasing the number of H-1B visas. But we are \ndisappointed by the disdain the majority has shown for this Senate and \nits tradition of fair and open debate. We are even more disturbed by \nthe indifference they are showing to thousands--tens of thousands--of \ndecent, hard-working families who are looking forward to the time when \nthey can live here in freedom and peace, and with confidence that their \nfamilies can stay together.\n  I am disappointed. I am frustrated, once again, that we have not had \nan opportunity to have the voice, to have the input, to have the \nopportunity that any Senator should count as his right or her right to \nparticipate fully in debate. But we have been precluded by the rules of \nthe Senate imposed upon us in this case by the majority.\n  The rules in the Senate, of course, allow for free and open debate, \nallow for amendment, allow for unlimited debate and discussion. The \nmajority continues to insist on bending the rules so that they can \nconstrain the way we pass legislation and which issues will be heard, \nwithout regard to the rights of all Senators to have their voices \nheard.\n\n\n                      Motion To Suspend Rule XXII\n\n  So, Mr. President, as my statement in yesterday's Record indicated, I \nnow move to suspend rule XXII to permit the consideration of amendment \nNo. 4184.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is debatable.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I appreciate the Democratic leader's \ncomments and the sincerity of those comments. But I think a few points \nshould be made in response to them. Then I will make a unanimous \nconsent request relative to the motion which has been put forward by \nthe Democratic leader.\n  The first point is that the rules of the Senate are being followed. \nThe Democratic leader knows the rules a great deal better than I do. \nBut the vote on cloture yesterday, to which the Democratic leader on a \nnumber of occasions has alluded to represent the Democratic leader's \ncommitment to the H-1B proposal, is the vote which puts the Democratic \nleader in the position that he is in now, which is that the amendment \nhe is offering is not relevant and not germane to the underlying bill. \nSo, as a practical matter, for him to first claim that, with great \nenthusiasm, they voted for cloture but now they are being foreclosed \nunder the rules of the Senate from doing what they want to do is, I \nthink, crocodile tears.\n  Secondly, it appears at about this time every election cycle we see a \nmovement that occurs from this administration which involves bypassing \nthe usual and legal procedures for obtaining citizenship.\n  Citizenship is the most sacred item of trust that we can impart as a \nnation to someone who wishes to come to our shores and live. The \ngranting of citizenship is an extraordinary action because it gives a \nperson the right to live in our Nation--the greatest nation on Earth--\nand the capacity to vote and participate as a full citizen and to raise \na family here as a citizen. So it is something where we have set up a \nfairly significant and intricate set of laws in order to develop a \nprocess so there is fairness in how we apply citizenship.\n  Yet every election year, during this administration, or at least for \nthe last two major election years--especially Presidential election \nyears--we have seen an attempt, basically, to set aside the law as it \nis structured for purposes of obtaining citizenship, and to create a \nnew class of citizens independent of what is present law.\n  To say that people shall be given the imprimatur of citizenship just \nbefore the election, ironically--and the last time this occurred under \nCitizenship USA, which was the title given to it, a title which was \ntruly inappropriate because it ended up being ``Felony USA,'' thousands \nof people were given citizenship outside of the usual course. They did \nnot have to go through the usual process, in a rush to complete \ncitizenship prior to the election, which led to literally thousands of \npeople who ended up being felons and criminals receiving citizenship. \nWe are still trying to track down many of the felons who received \ncitizenship under Citizenship USA, which was the last aggressive \nattempt to bypass the citizenship laws of this country during an \nelection year.\n  I think we should have learned our lesson from that little exercise, \nthat attempt at political initiative for the purposes of political \ngain, which ended up costing us literally millions of dollars to try to \ncorrect and leave us with, fortunately, a number of good citizens but, \nunfortunately, a number of people who should never have gotten \ncitizenship who are literally felons and who have committed serious \ncrimes.\n  So this attempt to bypass the citizenship process must be looked at \nwith a certain jaundiced eye in light of the fact it is an election \nyear because there is a history which asserts that it\n\n[[Page S9339]]\n\nshould be viewed with a jaundiced eye, because the Citizen USA was such \na debacle and so grossly political and ended up costing our Nation so \ndearly, by giving the sacred right of citizenship to people who are \ncriminals and who committed lawless acts against other citizens.\n  So that is why we are in this position today.\n  The Democratic leadership claims that they strongly support H-1B and \nso they voted for cloture. Then they come forward and claim: But the \nrules are limiting us.\n  They were the ones who voted for the rule that happens to be limiting \nthem. They can't have it both ways, but they appear to want to. It is, \nas I said, crocodile tears on their part, in my opinion. However, the \nDemocratic leader has the right to make this request. He has positioned \nhimself procedurally in that order.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that a vote occur on the pending \nmotion to suspend the rules, that the vote occur today at 4 o'clock, \nand that the time between the two sides until 4 o'clock be equally \ndivided in the usual form.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I was \ndiverted by talking to someone else. Will the Senator restate the \nunanimous consent request?\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that a vote occur today on the \npending motion to suspend the rule at 4 o'clock and that the time \nbetween now and 4 o'clock be equally divided in the usual form.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. GREGG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield whatever time I have remaining \nunder cloture on the bill to the minority leader, Senator Daschle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I regret how little progress we were able \nto make yesterday on legislation to increase the number of H-1B visas. \nThis legislation was reported from the Judiciary Committee more than a \nhalf a year ago. I have advocated that it receive a fair hearing and \nthat the Senate vote to increase the number of H-1B visas.\n  I have also said we should take up other important immigration \nmatters that have been neglected for too long in this body. But those \nrequests have fallen on deaf ears, as yesterday once again \ndemonstrated. Senators Daschle and Reid have offered to spend only 10 \nminutes debating immigration amendments. Under those terms, we could \ncomplete action on this bill in well under a day. But the majority \napparently would rather see this process continue to drag on than take \na simple up-or-down vote on matters of critical importance to the \nLatino community and other immigrant groups. Indeed, this bill has been \nmore strictly controlled than any bill during this Congress. At a \ncertain point one cannot help but ask: What is the majority afraid of?\n  We ought to vote up or down on the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act. \nI don't say this from any parochial interest. We do not have any \nsignificant minority ethnic group in Vermont. We are sort of unique in \nthat regard. But all Vermonters, Republican and Democrat alike, believe \nin fairness. It is a matter of fairness to have the Latino and \nImmigrant Fairness Act voted on. Let us vote it up or vote it down. I \nwill vote for it. I am a cosponsor of it. I strongly support it.\n  The chairman of the Judiciary Committee complained yesterday that the \nLatino and Immigrant Fairness Act was not introduced until July, and \nthat the Democrats were pressing for action on the bill even though it \nhad no hearings. As the chairman must know, the Latino and Immigrant \nFairness Act brings together a number of proposals that have been \ntalked about since the very beginning of this Congress, and in some \ncases for years before that. Indeed, the current proposal is drawn from \nS. 1552, S. 1592, and S. 2668. And as the chairman also must recognize, \nthese proposals have been denied hearings in the Judiciary Committee he \nchairs and the Immigration subcommittee that Senator Abraham chairs. \nFor the chairman to point to the lack of hearings on these proposals as \nan excuse to derail them reminds me of the person on trial for killing \nhis parents who throws himself on the mercy of the court as an orphan.\n  Meanwhile, I am encouraged by the majority leader's conciliatory \nwords on the substance of the LIFA proposals. According to today's \nCongress Daily, the majority leader has said that he thought the \nproposals ``could be wrapped in such a way that I could be for it.'' I \nhope this signals that he will work with us to find a way to have a \nvote on these issues.\n  Let me be clear: I support increasing the number of H-1B visas and \nvoted for S. 2045 in the Judiciary Committee. I have hoped that our \nconsideration of this bill would allow us to achieve other crucially \nimportant immigration goals that have been neglected by the majority \nthroughout this Congress. I have hoped that the majority could agree to \nat least vote on--if not vote for--limited proposals designed to \nprotect Latino families and other immigrant families. I have hoped that \nthe majority would consider proposals to restore the due process that \nwas taken away from immigrants by the immigration legislation Congress \npassed in 1996. In short, I thought we could work together to restore \nsome of America's lost luster on immigration issues. Since the majority \nhas thus far been unwilling to do that, pro-immigration Senators have \nbeen faced with a choice between achieving one of our many goals or \nachieving nothing at all.\n  Like most of my Democratic colleagues, I agree that we need to \nincrease the number of H-1B visas. The stunning economic growth we have \nexperienced in the past eight years has led to worker shortages in \ncertain key areas of our economy. Allowing workers with specialized \nskills to come to the United States and work for a 6-year period--as an \nH-1B visa does--helps to alleviate those shortages. In the current \nfiscal year, 115,000 H-1B visas were available. These visas ran out \nwell before the fiscal year ended. If we do not change the law, there \nwill actually be fewer visas available next year, as the cap drops to \n107,500. This will simply be insufficient to allow America's \nemployers--particularly in the information technology industry--to \nmaintain their current rates of growth. As such, I think that we need \nto increase the number of available visas dramatically. I think that S. \n2045 is a valuable starting point, although it can and should be \nimproved through the amendment process.\n  I have been involved in helping to ease America's labor shortage for \nsome time. Last year, I cosponsored the HITEC Act, S. 1645, legislation \nthat Senator Robb has introduced that would create a new visa that \nwould be available to companies looking to hire recent foreign \ngraduates of U.S. master's and doctoral programs in math, science, \nengineering, or computer science. I believe that keeping such bright, \nyoung graduates in the United States should be the primary purpose of \nany H-1B legislation we pass. By concentrating on such workers, we can \naddress employers' needs for highly-skilled workers, while also \nlimiting the number of visas that go to foreign workers with less \nspecialized skills.\n  Of course, H-1B visas are not a long-term answer to the current \nmismatch between the demands of the high-tech industry and the supply \nof workers with technical skills. Although I believe that there is a \nlabor shortage in certain areas of our economy, I do not\n\n[[Page S9340]]\n\nbelieve that we should accept that circumstance as an unchangeable fact \nof life. We need to make a greater effort to give our children the \neducation they need to compete in an increasingly technology-oriented \neconomy, and offer our adults the training they need to refashion their \ncareers to suit the changes in our economy. This bill goes part of the \nway toward improving our education and training programs, but could do \nbetter.\n  Although I have said that this is not a perfect bill, there are a few \nprovisions within it that should be retained in any final version. I \nstrongly support the increased portability this legislation offers for \nvisa holders, making it easier for them to change jobs within the \nUnited States. And the legislation extends the labor attestation \nrequirements in the bill--which force employers to certify that they \nwere unable to find qualified Americans to do a job that they have \nhired a visa recipient to fill--as well as the Labor Department's \nauthority to investigate possible H-1B violations.\n  It is regrettable that it has taken so long for us to turn our \nattention to the H-1B issue. The Judiciary Committee reported S. 2045 \nmore than six months ago. It has taken us a very long time to get from \npoint A to point B, and it has often appeared that the majority has \nbeen more interested in gaining partisan advantage from a delay than in \nactually making this bill law.\n  The Democratic leader has said month after month that we would be \nwilling to accept very strict time limits on debating amendments, and \nwould be willing to conduct the entire debate on S. 2045 in less than a \nday. Our leader has also consistently said that it is critical that the \nSenate should take up proposals to provide parity for refugees from \nright-wing regimes in Central America and to address an issue that has \nbeen ignored for far too long--how we should treat undocumented aliens \nwho have lived here for decades, paying taxes and contributing to our \neconomy. These provisions are both contained in the Latino and \nImmigrant Fairness Act. I joined in the call for action on H-1B and \nother critical immigration issues, but our efforts were rebuffed by the \nmajority.\n  Indeed, months went by in which the majority made no attempt to \nnegotiate these differences, time which many members of the majority \ninstead spent trying to blame Democrats for the delay in their bringing \nthis legislation to the floor. At many times, it seemed that the \nmajority was more interested in casting blame upon Democrats than in \nactually passing legislation. Instead of working in good faith with the \nminority to bring this bill to the floor, the majority spent its time \ntrying to convince leaders in the information technology industry that \nthe Democratic Party is hostile to this bill and that only Republicans \nare interested in solving the legitimate employment shortages faced by \nmany sectors of American industry. Considering that three-quarters of \nthe Democrats on the Judiciary Committee voted for this bill, and that \nthe bill has numerous Democratic cosponsors, including Senator \nLieberman, this partisan appeal was not only inappropriate but absurd \non its face.\n  Finally, a few weeks ago, the majority made a counteroffer that did \nnot provide as many amendments as we would like, but which did allow \namendments related to immigration generally. We responded \nenthusiastically to this proposal, but individual members of the \nmajority objected, and there is still no agreement to allow general \nimmigration amendments. At least some members of the majority are \napparently unwilling even to vote on issues that are critical to \nmembers of the Latino community. This is deeply unfortunate, and leaves \nthose of us who are concerned about humanitarian immigration issues \nwith an uncomfortable choice. We can either address the legitimate \nneeds of the high-tech industry in the vacuum that the majority has \nimposed, or we can refuse to proceed on this bill until the majority \naffords us the opportunity to address other important immigration \nneeds. I still hope that an agreement can be reached with the majority \nthat will allow votes on other important immigration matters as part of \nour consideration of this bill, but I have little confidence that this \nwill happen.\n  I regret that we will likely be unable to offer other important \namendments to this bill. For much of the summer, the majority implied \nthat we were simply using the concerns of Latino voters as a \nsmokescreen to avoid considering S. 2045. Speaking for myself, although \nI have had reservations about certain aspects of S. 2045, I voted to \nreport it from the Judiciary Committee so that we could move forward in \nour discussions of the bill. I did not seek to offer immigration \namendments on the Senate floor because I wanted to derail S. 2045. Nor \ndid the White House urge Congress to consider other immigration issues \nas part of the H-1B debate because the President wanted to play \npolitics with this issue, as the distinguished chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee suggested on the floor a few weeks ago. Rather, the \nmajority's inaction on a range of immigration measures in this Congress \nforced those of us who were concerned about immigration issues to \nattempt to raise those issues. Under our current leadership, the \nopportunity to enact needed change in our immigration laws does not \ncome around very often, to put it mildly.\n  It is a disturbing but increasingly undeniable fact that the interest \nof the business community has become a prerequisite for immigration \nbills to receive attention on the Senate floor. In fact, we are now in \nthe week before we are scheduled to adjourn, and this is the first \nimmigration bill to be debated on the floor in this Congress. Even \nhumanitarian bills with bipartisan backing have been ignored in this \nCongress, both in the Judiciary Committee and on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  It is particularly upsetting that the majority refuses to vote on the \nLatino and Immigrant Fairness Act. This is a bill that I have \ncosponsored and that offers help to hardworking families who pay taxes \nand help keep our economy going strong. On two occasions, including \nlast Friday, the minority has moved to proceed to this bill, and the \nmajority has twice objected. In our negotiations with the majority \nabout how S. 2045 would be brought to the floor, we have consistently \npressed for the opportunity to vote on the proposals contained within \nit. But the majority has turned its back on the concerns of Latinos and \nother immigrants who are treated unfairly by our current immigration \nlaws.\n  The majority has shown a similar lack of concern for proposals by \nnumerous Democratic Senators to restore the due process protections \nthat were removed by the passage of the Antiterrorism and Effective \nDeath Penalty Act and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nResponsibility Act 4 years ago. There are still many aspects of those \nlaws that merit our careful review and rethinking, including the \ninhumane use of expedited removal, which would be sharply limited by \nthe Refugee Protection Act (S. 1940) that I have introduced with \nSenator Brownback.\n  As important as H-1B visas are for our economy and our Nation's \nemployers, it is not the only immigration issue that faces our Nation. \nAnd the legislation we are concerned with today does not test our \ncommitment to the ideals of opportunity and freedom that America has \nrepresented at its best. Those tests will apparently be left for \nanother day, or another Congress.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to answer some of the comments made \nby our colleagues from the other side yesterday and today.\n  We have been on the floor this week supposedly debating the H-1B \nbill. That is S. 2045. This bill is an extremely important measure. It \nis aimed at alleviating both short- and long-term problems in the \ninadequate supply of a highly skilled worker force in our dynamic and \nexpanding high-tech economy.\n  The debate has turned into quite a different matter. My colleagues on \nthe other side stood on the floor yesterday talking about the so-called \nLatino fairness legislation and insisting, time and time again, for a \nvote on this unrelated measure.\n\n[[Page S9341]]\n\n  Let's review where we are. The high-tech community wants this H-1B \nbill without amendment. My colleagues on both sides voted \noverwhelmingly for cloture; meaning, ending the debate. Cloture would \nknock out nongermane amendments which, of course, would knock out the \nso-called Latino fairness amendment as well.\n  The last time I looked, a vote in support of cloture meant that we \nsupport consideration of legislation without--I emphasize that word \n``without''--unrelated, nongermane amendments, such as the so-called \nLatino fairness bill. This bill, by the way, was only filed on July 25 \nof this year. If it was so important, why was it filed so late in the \nsession, without the opportunity for hearings or committee \nconsideration?\n  Talk about trying to have it both ways. I guess this is a brilliant \npolitical move if you don't think about it too closely, the ultimate \neffort to try to have it both ways: Give the high-tech community a \ncloture vote and at the same time continue to maneuver to get around \nwhat that cloture vote means.\n  So there we have it. I don't recall seeing a spectacle of this sort \nin all of my years in the Senate.\n  Having said that, let me now join my colleagues in this discussion on \nthe so-called Latino fairness legislation. There was a great deal of \ntalk yesterday. Some of it was shameless. The talk was about due \nprocess, about the need for more unskilled workers in this country, and \nabout the hardship of the parents of American-citizen children. Much of \nthe rhetoric does not meet reality.\n  My colleagues on the other side argue that they want to vote on S. \n2912, the so-called Latino fairness act. I really wonder if most in the \nSenate understand and appreciate what is involved in this costly, far-\nreaching bill that has never had a day of hearings.\n  This is no limited measure, to undo a previous wrong to a limited \nclass of immigrants who otherwise might have been eligible for amnesty \nunder the 1986 act. Rather, this is a major new amnesty program, \nwithout 1 day of hearings, with a price tag of almost $1.4 billion, \nwith major implications for our national policy on immigration.\n  For years, as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I have watched the \nImmigration Subcommittee, and I have helped to steer through and \nmonitor and help make immigration policy in this country. That policy \nworks well, to a large degree, but there are certainly areas that we \ncan improve. I can tell you that some are trying to turn this \nbipartisan policy upside down.\n  I will begin by saying that I have been a long-time supporter of \nlegal immigration. That is what has built this country. It has made \nthis country the greatest country in the world.\n  I believe in legal immigration. In connection with the 1996 \nimmigration reform legislation, I fought long and hard against those \nwho wanted to cut legal family immigration and other categories. At \nthat and other times, it has been my view that our emphasis ought to be \non combating illegal, not legal, immigration.\n  The bill before us, however, while termed ``Latino fairness,'' does \nnothing to increase or preserve the categories of legal immigrants \nallowed in this country on an annual basis. It does nothing to shorten \nthe long waiting period or the hurdles that persons waiting years to \ncome to this country--people who play by the rules and wait their \nturn--have to go through.\n  In contrast, what we hear now is an urgent call to grant broad \namnesty to what could be up to 2 million illegal aliens. Let's be clear \nabout what is at issue here. Some refer to the fact that a certain \nclass of persons who may have been entitled to amnesty in 1986 have \nbeen unfairly treated and should therefore be granted amnesty now. That \nis one issue--and I am certainly prepared to discuss that issue in our \ncommittee, with full hearings, and resolve any inequities that exist. I \nam certainly prepared to discuss that, but only outside the context of \nS. 2045, a bill that virtually everybody in this body wants because it \nwill allow us to stay in the forefront of our global, high-tech \neconomy.\n  Again, I am prepared to discuss, outside of this bill, what we might \nbe able to do to help that so-called 1982 class of immigrants. But that \nis not really what S. 2912 is about. This bill that some now want to \nattach to the H-1B bill, would ensure its death in the House of \nRepresentatives; it would never see the light of day. The fact is--this \nbill also covers that 1982 class, but also hundreds of thousands, if \nnot millions, of illegal aliens who were never eligible for amnesty \nunder the 1986 act.\n  This is a difficult issue and one with major policy implications for \nthe future. When we supported amnesty in 1986--and I believe there were \nseveral million people granted amnesty at that time--it was not with \nthe assumption that this was going to be a continuous process.\n  What kind of signal does this type of ``urgency'' send? On one hand, \nthe Government spends millions each year to combat illegal immigration \nand deports thousands of persons each year who are here illegally. But \nif an illegal alien can manage to escape law enforcement for long \nenough, we reward that person with citizenship, or at least permanent \nresident status, followed by the right to apply for citizenship after 5 \nyears of living here.\n  That is a slap in the face to all of those who have abided by the \nrules and who have been here legally. If there are inequities, I am \nwilling to work them out, but let's do it through hearings, through a \nthorough examination. Let's not do it through a political sham that has \nbeen thrust upon us on the floor for no other reason than because they \nare worried on the other side that George Bush appeals to the Hispanic \ncommunity. We know he gets about 50 percent of the Hispanic vote in \nTexas, and there is good reason for it.\n  Hispanic children are now reading at better levels. The Hispanic \npeople have been helped greatly in Texas by the Bush administration. \nOur colleagues on the other side are deathly afraid that if he \ncontinues to do that, the Hispanic vote--which they just take for \ngranted--is going to suddenly go to George Bush and the Republicans. \nWell, I don't blame them for that, because I think that is what is \ngoing to happen.\n\n  As chairman of the Republican Senatorial Hispanic Task Force, which I \nhelped to start years ago, I know that the Hispanics are out there \nwatching both parties and seeing who really has their interests at \nheart. We have done more with that task force--not just by throwing \nmoney at problems--than the other side ever dreamed of.\n  Further, I hope my colleagues are aware of the cost of this bill to \nAmerican taxpayers. I don't mind the costs if we are doing something \nthat is absolutely right. As I said, I am willing to go through the \nappropriate hearing process. I do that every day in my work as a \nSenator in solving immigration problems--as a lot of Senators do. But \nwe ought to take into consideration the costs of this to the American \ntaxpayers--giving amnesty to up to 2 million illegal aliens.\n  Specifically, a draft and preliminary CBO estimate indicates this \nbill comes with a price tag just short of $1.4 billion over 10 years. \nBut that is a conservative estimate because the amendment actually \nfiled yesterday goes way beyond S. 2912 on amnesty. Not only was S. \n2912, the so-called the Latino Fairness Act, filed on July 25, but the \namendment filed yesterday goes even beyond what their original bill. \nThe amendment's proponents argue that it just consists of a simple due \nprocess restoration. But, in fact, it not only gives hundreds of \nthousands, if not millions, additional illegal immigrants amnesty who \nhave been here since 1986, it appears to be a rolling amnesty measure!\n  In this highly charged political area, we ought to try and get \ntogether in a bipartisan manner. But some of my friends on the other \nside seem to want to play politics with this issue. They try to act as \nif they are for Hispanics. But what they are in fact doing is ignoring \nthose who play by the rules, who are here legally, in favor of those \nwho are here illegally and who have broken the rules. It is a slap in \nthe face to all of those who have played by the rules.\n  What do I mean by a rolling amnesty measure? It means the amnesty \nprovision continues and expands for the next 6 years. That is right, \nMr. President. If illegal aliens can manage to avoid authorities until \n2006--if they can avoid authorities for that long--they automatically \nget amnesty, and that is a stepping stone to citizenship for people who \nhave violated our laws and are\n\n[[Page S9342]]\n\nhere illegally. Again, if there are people who are being injured who \nshould not be, people who really have due process rights, or who ought \nto have consideration, I am willing to work on that with my colleagues \non the other side in a bipartisan way to do something that really \nworks. We do that regularly anyway. But to just throw this open on a \nrolling amnesty basis for 6 solid years is not the way to go; we are \ntalking about millions of people who are here illegally being \nautomatically given the right to apply for citizenship in a few years.\n  Mr. President, what are we doing here? We devote hundreds of millions \nof dollars each year to try and control illegal immigration. What does \nthis so-called fairness bill do? It rewards persons for their illegal \nactivity. It says let's keep fighting illegal immigration, but if \ncertain persons succeed in evading the law for long enough, they get \nrewarded by being allowed to stay, get permanent resident status, and 5 \nyears later can apply for citizenship, in contrast to all of those \nmillions who have legally come into this country under legal \nimmigration rules and regulations, who have abided by the law, and who \nbasically have paid the appropriate price to get here.\n\n  We have also heard about the need for more workers. I agree with \nthat. Why don't we address and examine this need, however, in the right \nway? Why don't we examine increasing the number of legal immigrants \nallowed to come here? Why don't we consider lifting certain of those \ncaps? I don't see anyone on the other side of the aisle arguing for \nthat. It would seem to me if they want to argue for having more \nimmigrants in this country--and I might go along with this--that we \nought to lift the caps. I have to admit that there are those in this \nbody who do not want to lift those caps--but at least in the other body \nfor sure. That is the appropriate way to do that.\n  During our debate in the 1996 act, the Democrats offered, and the \ncommittee unanimously agreed, to curb the number of legal, unskilled \nworkers coming to this country. Why did they do that? Because their No. \n1 supporters in the country--the trade union movement in this country--\nbelieve that they would take jobs; that if we lifted the caps there \nwould be more legal immigrants coming into this country that would take \njobs away from American workers.\n  It is amazing to me that they wouldn't allow the caps lifted then for \nthat reason, and now they want the broad amnesty. They want to allow up \nto 2 million illegal immigrants in here because everybody realizes \nthere is a shortage of workers right now.\n  I am willing to consider lifting those caps, and do it legally and do \nit the right way. I would be willing to do that. But without hearings, \nand without a really thorough examination of this, I am not willing to \njust wholesale have a rolling amnesty provision that would allow \nmillions of illegal aliens who haven't played by the rules to have a \nwide open street to citizenship while many people who are applying \nlegally can't get in and who really need to get in.\n  I agree with the need to reexamine our position on lifting the caps \non legal immigration. Let's do that. I am willing to hold hearings, or \nmake sure the subcommittee holds the hearings on that. By the way, they \nhave held some hearings.\n  I have to say that generally the two leaders on the Subcommittee on \nImmigration, Senator Abraham from Michigan and Senator Kennedy from \nMassachusetts, have worked well together. But all of a sudden, there's \na chance to score political points, they think. I don't think they are \ngetting political points. If I was a legal Hispanic, or a legal \nChinese, or a legal person from any other country, I would resent \nknowing how difficult it was for me to become a legal immigrant while \npeople who are trying to make it possible for those who are illegally \nhere to be able to become citizens without obeying the same rules. I \nsuspect there is going to be a lot of resentment, if people really \nunderstand this.\n  While we are at it, why don't we do something to get the INS to move \nmore swiftly--the Immigration and Naturalization Service--to move more \nswiftly on applications for legal immigrants? That would be real Latino \nfairness. That is what we ought to be doing on the floor.\n  There isn't a person in this body who cares more for family \nunification than I do. There are some who are certainly my equal here. \nBut nobody exceeds my desire to bring families together, a point \nbrought out yesterday. I fought for years on this issue. Every day we \nare working on immigration problems to try to solve the problem of \nbringing families together in my offices in Utah and here.\n  If we really care about family reunification, why don't we do \nsomething about the Immigration and Naturalization Service? Why should \nparents, children, and spouses have to stay on a waiting list for \nyears? I would like to hear more comments from the other side on that. \nBut every time you try to lift the caps, their friends in the union \nmovement come in and say: You can't do that. You might take jobs away \nfrom union workers.\n\n  Under the H-1B bill, we are not taking jobs away from union workers \nor from anyone else. We are trying to maintain our dominant status \nthroughout the world in the high-tech world. We are trying to make sure \nwe keep the people here who can really help us do that. That bill \nprovides that those who are highly educated in our universities have a \nright to stay here and work. This is the bill we are talking about. It \nis a step in the right direction to get us there.\n  What does this so-called Latino fairness amendment, or bill, that \nthey filed so late in this Presidential year say to families who played \nby the rules? It doesn't say obey the laws and wait your turn. It says \nwe are going to make special favors for those of you who are here \nillegally, and we are going to do it on a rolling amnesty basis over \nthe next 6 years. They are just going to have the right to become \ncitizens, while others have had to abide by the rules--rules that have \nbeen set over decades and decades.\n  I challenge anybody on the other side to work with me in helping to \nresolve these problems. I am willing to do that. I don't need a lecture \nfrom people on the other side about families who have been split up. I \nthink it is abysmal to have families split up. I am willing to work to \ntry and solve that problem, but it takes both sides to do it.\n  Last but not least, it is no secret that our committee handles \nintellectual property in many of the high-tech issues in this country. \nLast year we passed one of the most important bills in patent changes \nin the history of the country--certainly in the last 50 years. We \npassed a number of other high-tech bills to make a real difference.\n  We have done an awful lot to make sure our high-tech world in this \ncountry stays at the top of the ladder.\n  I just came from the Finance Committee upon which I sit where I made \na principal argument that we need to get this new bill through that \nChairman Roth is working on with the ranking member, Senator Moynihan, \nto have a broadband tax credit which we need now.\n  S. 2045 is one of the most important high-tech bills in this \nCongress. Everybody here, except for about three people, believes it \nshould pass. Almost everybody on both sides of the floor has said it \nshould pass. Everybody says it is a very important bill.\n  The fact is, there are people in this body who are scared to death \nthat Republicans might make inroads with the Hispanic community. I know \nthat because I am chairman of the Republican Senatorial Standing Task \nForce. We have been working for better than 10 years on Hispanic \naffairs.\n  We don't care whether Democrats, Independents, or Republicans are on \nour task force. In fact, we have all three there. We don't care if they \nare Conservatives, Liberals, or Independents. They are all there. I \nhave to tell you that we have been working hard on every Hispanic issue \nthat this country has. There is basically no end to what we will all \ntry to do, to help assimilate the Hispanic people who are immigrants in \nthis country into every aspect of opportunity that this country has to \noffer.\n  To be honest with you, our country is the No. 1 high-tech country in \nthe world. The reason we are is because we have worked together in many \nrespects to get some of these high-tech bills through that make a \ndifference.\n  I prefer to see my colleagues on the other side work with us rather \nthan\n\n[[Page S9343]]\n\nagainst us, as they are doing right now. I don't want to pull this bill \ndown, but it is coming down if we can't get this bill passed in a \nrelatively short period of time. By tomorrow, there will be three \ncloture votes overwhelmingly for this bill. If Democrats don't want \nthis bill, why are they voting for cloture? If they want to vote \nagainst cloture tomorrow, I can live with that. We will pull the \ndoggone bill down and say to the high-tech community, we are not going \nto support you this year because we can't get enough support from our \nfriends on the other side. That is exactly what I will tell them, and \nit won't be one inch far from the truth.\n  The fact is, everyone on the other side knows that this is a critical \nbill. It has taken bipartisan support to get it this far. It has great \nhope for the high-tech industry in this country. It will provide more \nhigh-tech workers and more high-tech jobs. Now, we may have some \ndifficulty getting the House to go along with everything we are doing \nhere.\n  If we keep playing around with this and delaying it beyond this week, \nit will make impossible to pass it in the end.\n  I know how important this legislation is. I have worked on high-tech \nissues for all of my Senate career, and have worked patent, copyright, \nand trademark laws throughout the country. I don't think anyone can say \nI haven't made a strong bipartisan effort to make sure we stay at the \ntop of the high-tech world. The best way we can do it right now is to \npass broadband tax credit and to pass this H-1B legislation and get the \nHouse to go along with it. It is the best thing we can do.\n  We are in an inane battle on the floor because some people want to \nscore some political points. I was almost embarrassed by some of the \ncomments yesterday--not almost, I was embarrassed for some of these \npeople. Is there no length to which they will go at the end of this \nsession to score political points? I don't like it on my side, and I \ncertainly don't like it on the other side. This is a time for \ncooperation, to help our country get through this year, and to \nhopefully spur us into the next year, whoever is President. I intend to \ndo that. I want to have some bipartisan support in getting it done.\n  I suppose we will have to go through another cloture vote tomorrow--\nthree cloture votes on one bill that almost everybody is for.\n  I think it is time to quit scoring political points and get the job \ndone. This H-1B bill is a critical bill for America. It is a critical \nbill for American children and American workers. It contains critical \nbipartisan training and education provisions to equip our workforce for \nthe 21st century. Those are provisions we worked out with the other \nside in order to get this bill, something I agree with 100 percent, \nthat I will fight for in Congress.\n  One would think they would want to do this and quit playing around \nwith the bill. The longer we go on this bill, if we go beyond this \nweek, it seems to me it makes it more problematic whether we can ever \npass an H-1B piece of legislation with these wonderful, critical \nprovisions to help train our children for the future workforce, for the \nhigh-tech world they are going to enter.\n  I have met with people today who are prescient with regard to the \nfuture. We have been talking broadband all morning. We have been \ntalking about wireless. We have been talking about cable. We have been \ntalking about the critical infrastructure industries. We have been \ntalking about software. Almost all of it is dependent upon whether we \npass an H-1B bill.\n  The rest of the world isn't standing still while we are sitting here \ntreading water week after week, debating whether we will allow an H-1B \nfinal vote. If this were the final vote to pass this bill, I could wait \nanother few days. But we still have to deal with the House. We are \ngoing to have to work that out. That will take some time. We don't have \na lot of time.\n  It seems to me we ought to get rid of politics. I hope people \nwatching this will listen to the other side and realize how political \nthey have been. Yesterday it was almost shameful--no, it wasn't; it was \nshameful--the arguments made on the floor. It is all done just for \npolitical advantage. Frankly, I don't think they get any advantage.\n  I believe the millions of legal immigrants with green cards might \nresent rolling amnesty for 6 years to millions of illegal immigrants \nwho don't abide by the rules.\n  This is an important bill. We can no longer afford to play the \npolitical games that were played yesterday and apparently will be \nplayed through a cloture vote tomorrow. I think the other side ought to \nallow the vote or just admit they really aren't for this bill in spite \nof the overwhelming cloture votes we have had so far. I would like to \nsee that in this body, especially at the end of this year.\n  There are those on our side who really would like to work with our \ncolleagues on the other side in a bipartisan manner. I know the \nPresiding Officer is one, and I believe there are a lot of others who \nwant to see that done.\n  There is a strong suspicion among many in the media and many on our \nside that there is a deliberate slowdown, with filibusters, even \nmotions to proceed, for no other reason than a political advantage. It \nreally gets old.\n  I think once in a while we really ought to put the best interests of \nour country ahead of everything else. This is a bill where we ought to \ndo that. We have so much support for this bill, if it is allowed to be \nvoted upon. Supporters ought to be allowed to express themselves in a \nvote for or against this bill. This is one bill where we can be \ntogether. We had 94 votes on this bill, in essence, yesterday; only 3 \nagainst. I suspect if we got the other 3, they would be for it, too, so \nit would be 97 with, 3 against; if they were against, it would be 94-6.\n  But, no. Steady delay. Day in, day out, steady filibusters. Now they \nwill say they are not filibustering. Then why are they forcing a \ncloture vote every day?--to have cloture votes on a bill that virtually \neverybody admits is a good bi-partisan bill.\n  By the way, I want to thank Senators Feinstein, Kennedy, Lieberman, \nand of course Senator Abraham. We have all worked together on this \nbill. We have accommodated Democrats. We have shown good faith. I thank \nthem for helping. I think it is time to end this charade, end the \npolitical posturing we have had. Let's pass this bill.\n  Start doing what is right. Live up to what everybody in this body, \nexcept for the three, I suppose, has told the high-tech world--we are \ngoing to get H-1B passed. But I tell you we are not going to get it \npassed if this kind of charade continues because I myself will bring \nthis bill down and then we will start over again next year and \nhopefully we will have a more bipartisan approach towards it. I would \nhate to do that; I sure would, after all the work we put in trying to \nget this bill passed when I know that could delay it 6 to 9 months \nbefore we really are helping our people in the high-tech world who \ndrastically need help.\n  I have been there. I have been out there. I know the people, the top \npeople, the top CEOs in almost all of these companies. I have been \nmeeting with a bunch of them this morning, everybody from ATT, \nMicrosoft, Sun Microsystems, Oracle, Novell--you name it. I know them \nall. I don't think they are partisan. I think they like both parties, \nand I think they help both parties, and I think they deserve our help.\n  Frankly, to put us through another cloture vote--it seems to me to be \ninane. I do not want to accuse anybody of lacking good faith, but I \nwill tell you after what I heard yesterday, I say, my gosh, how can \nthey stand there and make those kinds of comments, when you know if you \nwant to really help get jobs and get people in here to take jobs, let's \nlift the caps on legal immigration but not change the laws with one \nstroke of the pen, without 1 day of hearings, and allow up to 2 million \npeople on a rolling amnesty over a 6-year period to really become \ncitizens, flashing in the face of everybody who paid the price to abide \nby the rules, it is just not right.\n  Frankly, I am getting tired of it. That is why I have gone on and on \ntoday, because I am tired of it. I think it is time for us to do \nsomething good for a change, to work together and get it done. I am \ngoing to be here to try to get it done in the next day or so. If we do \nnot, then we will pull the bill down. Then we will just throw our hands \nin the air and say it is too political a Congress to do something \nworthwhile for our country.\n\n[[Page S9344]]\n\n  Everybody on my side is going to vote for this bill--they have been \nthere from day 1--at least I believe everybody, certainly the vast \nmajority, are going to vote for this bill in the end because they \nbelieve our future depends on being able to solve some of these \nproblems that this bill will solve.\n  I believe we will have a tremendous number of votes on the Democratic \nside because we have some of the top leaders in this area on this bill. \nI mentioned some of them a few minutes ago. We have accommodated them \nin language in this bill that makes sense. I am saying on the floor of \nthe Senate that I would fight for that language because of our Democrat \nfriends who have worked with us to put that good language together. I \nwill do it in a bipartisan way.\n  But the high-tech companies are not the primary beneficiaries. They \nare beneficiaries, no question about it. The primary beneficiaries are \nthe children who will benefit from the education proposals here and the \nAmerican workers who will benefit from the critical training provisions \nthat we have in this bill. Let's pass this bill for them. I have to \nadmit the high-tech industry will benefit tremendously, too.\n  What the Daschle motion says is let's ignore the rules of the Senate. \nLet's take the easy route. Their Latino fairness bill says let's ignore \nall these immigration laws we have all fought over in a bipartisan way \nfor years--and many us on this side have helped those on the other \nside. Let's ignore those immigration laws. Let's take the easy route.\n  There is a similar theme here. Some want to have it both ways. This \nsort of double-speak is why so many Americans have grown tired of \nWashington politics as usual. I hope I have at least made the case we \non this side stand ready to pass this bill a minute from now if the \nother side will allow a vote up and down on this bill. If they do not, \nwe will go to cloture again, and then we will see what we can do \npostcloture to get this thing brought to a close where people can vote \nfor it.\n\n  Then, assuming we will pass this bill, we will go to work with the \nHouse and see if they will take this bill. If they will not take this \nbill, we will go to conference and fight very hard with everything I \nhave to make sure there are these provisions in this bill; that we have \n195,000 high-tech workers allowed into this country and that we have \nthe right for those who are highly educated, in American institutions, \nto stay here to work in our high-tech world, and that we have these \nprovisions to help train our children.\n  Those are pretty important provisions. This is a very important bill. \nTo stand here and say everybody in business and all these companies \nwant all these illegal immigrants to be naturalized--so what? We ought \nto abide by the law. That is why we have immigration laws. Where there \nare inequities, we ought to work to resolve them. I promise you, I will \nwork to resolve them. I have been doing it for my whole 24 years in the \nSenate, and I am not going to stop now. We can resolve them if we work \ntogether. If we do not work together, we cannot.\n  I hope both sides will get serious about this bill. I hope we can \npass this bill. I hope we can get this matter resolved. I would like to \ndo it today, if we can, but certainly by tomorrow. We will look at it \nand see if we have to pull it down if we can't get this resolved.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time of \nthe Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer, under the postcloture \nproceedings, be in the control of the Senator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, my good friend from Utah, for whom I have \nthe greatest respect got a little carried away this morning. I don't \nthink he would purposely call me or my colleagues incompetent--but he \ndid. I don't think he would call us silly or stupid, but he did. The \nword ``inane,'' in a dictionary, means silly or stupid.\n  We have a philosophical difference in what we are doing here. The \nfact that we disagree with the chairman of the Judiciary Committee does \nnot mean we are incompetent. It doesn't mean we are stupid. It just \ndemonstrates that we have a basic disagreement.\n  Mr. President, I want to go back and start where the majority started \nthis morning, with the chairman of the Appropriations Committee on \nCommerce-State-Justice. Among other things, he said we were crying \ncrocodile tears over here, and that this piece of legislation only \ndealt with criminals. I am paraphrasing what the other side said, but \nnot too much. In actuality they said was that ``criminals were coming \nin, and attempting to do an end run to get citizenship.''\n  The fact is, I take great exception to that. The Democratic proposal \nwould not allow criminals to become citizens. First, this legislation \nis not offering citizenship. We are offering longtime residents, people \nwho are already in this country, the ability to apply for permanent \nresidency and then perhaps apply for citizenship. Second, anyone \napplying for residency must have good moral character. They also must \nshow they have good moral character, which means that anyone with a \ncriminal record--not criminals, of course wouldn't qualify, anyone with \na criminal record would not qualify for permanent residency.\n  These people are people who are already in the country. They are \nworking, they are paying taxes, they work hard. In many instances, in \nfact most instances, others won't take their jobs.\n  I think my friend from New Hampshire, for whom I have the greatest \nrespect--he has a record which is outstanding; he served in the House \nof Representatives, was the Governor of the State of New Hampshire, is \nnow a Member of the Senate--I do not think he is suggesting that the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce, who supports the Latino Fairness Act \nwholeheartedly, is suggesting the U.S. Chamber of Commerce wants \ncitizenship for criminals. I don't think the American Health Care \nAssociation is suggesting we want citizenship for criminals. I know \nthat the American Hotel and Motel Association is not saying we should \ncome here and give a blanket citizenship to criminals. I don't think \nthe Resort, Recreation and Tourism organization is suggesting that \ncriminals be given citizenship.\n  We have a list. We talked about it yesterday: The National Retail \nAssociation--dozens and dozens of organizations and companies believe \nwe must do something, not only to protect the people who we are going \nto give the right to come to this country, under H-1B. In fact, we have \ngiven almost a half a million people the right to come to this country \nunder H-1B.\n  We are going to increase it this year up to almost 200,000. I have a \ncouple of different lists, and I could go to another chart. These \ncompanies and organizations believe that people who are already in the \ncountry also deserve the right to apply for permanent residency and \nsomeday apply for citizenship.\n  This is nothing but a typical red herring. In fact, the Republicans, \nthe majority, are saying: How could you have this bill without even \nhaving a hearing? That will bring a smile to your face. The legislation \npending before the Senate, the energy bill, S. 2557, was brought to the \nfloor by the majority leader and it has had no hearings.\n  To say we did not introduce this legislation until July 25, we may \nnot have introduced specifically the legislation, but I wrote a letter \nto the majority leader in May outlining the legislation. There have \nbeen long-time discussions.\n  In fact, we were denied a hearing in the House. We tried to have a \nhearing in the House last year on this legislation, but we could not. \nThe chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee refused to give us a \nhearing, so Sheila Jackson-Lee and I had an informal hearing in the \nHouse. We could not do it because the chairman of the subcommittee \nwould not let us have a hearing.\n  The parity legislation was introduced 3 years ago. That is no \nsurprise to anyone. The registry has been in our law since 1929. I \nintroduced the same legislation last year. We reintroduced it, of \ncourse, but it was introduced last year. We had, as I indicated, an \ninformal hearing because we were denied a formal hearing.\n  The chairman of the Judiciary Committee said: What about the July 25 \nintroduction? In his words, ``Is this incompetence?'' The Latino and \nImmigrant Fairness Act contains multiple provisions, all of which were \nintroduced well before July 2000. We combined a number of pieces of \nlegislation\n\n[[Page S9345]]\n\nthat have been around for a long time. Central American parity was \nintroduced on September 15 of last year; date of registry was \nintroduced on August 5, 1999. These have bill numbers. Section 245(i) \nwas introduced May 25, 2000. Also, the one my friend from Rhode Island, \nMr. Reed, cares so much about, was introduced in March of 1999. These \nproposals have been denied hearings in the Judiciary Committee that my \nfriend from Utah chairs and the Immigration Subcommittee which Senator \nAbraham chairs. There have been no hearings because the majority has \nrefused to allow us to have hearings.\n  Let's boil this down to where we really understand what is going on \naround here. There are threats to pull down the H-1B legislation. I \ndare them to pull the bill down. I dare them because it would be on \ntheir conscience. We have said we will vote on H-1B--what time is it \nnow? Five to 12. We will vote at 12 o'clock. We can have a unanimous \nconsent agreement that the vote can start in 5 minutes on H-1B. As soon \nas that 15-minute vote, which around here takes 40 minutes, is \nfinished, we will have another 15-minute vote on our Latino and \nImmigrant Fairness Act. We can complete it all in just a few minutes.\n  If people do not like our legislation, vote against it. There is a \nunanimous consent request kicking around here someplace which we hope \nto have approved soon that we vote at 4:30 on Senator Daschle's motion \nto suspend the rules so we can vote on this. Keep in mind, so everyone \nunderstands, you can disguise it any way you want, but this is a vote \non our amendment, the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act.\n  There has been a lot of talk about the registry provision that this \nis something new and unique, changing 1982 and 1986. This same thing \nhas been going on since 1929.\n  The registry provision originated in 1929. The registry provision has \nbeen amended many times since 1929. In 1940, the registry date was \nchanged to July 1, 1924, and in 1958, the date was changed to June 28, \n1940. Subsequently, the date was changed to June 30, 1948, then January \n1, 1972, then, of course, we changed it to 1982, giving people 1 year \nto apply. That is what we are talking about, 1 year to apply. Some \npeople did not file within that 1 year, even though they qualified. \nPeople who are here who deserve to qualify under the same law that has \nbeen changed since 1929 deserve a fair hearing.\n\n  What happened? What happened is there was sneaked into a bill a \nprovision that said these people would not be entitled to a due process \nhearing, a fair hearing. So hundreds of thousands of people who could \nhave qualified under the 1982 cutoff date were denied that privilege, \nand we are saying that is wrong. That is one of the most important \nparts of our legislation.\n  We are not ignoring the law with this legislation. We are correcting \nflaws in current immigration policy that have denied people the \nopportunity to have legal immigrant status.\n  My friend from Utah has disparaged a number of people, in addition to \ncalling us incompetent, silly, and stupid. He also said that because \ntrade unions oppose some legislation, that it is necessarily bad. Let's \ntalk about trade unions.\n  Let's see here. We have carpenters. Carpenters: What is wrong with \ncarpenters? We have nurses. I wonder what is wrong with nurses opposing \nlegislation, or I wonder what is wrong with having people who work as \nelectricians opposing legislation? What is wrong with trade unions \nopposing legislation? Is that any worse than the Chamber of Commerce \nsupporting or opposing legislation? There has been a lot of name-\ncalling that has been unnecessary.\n  We are playing around with this bill: If allowing people who have \nbeen here for many years to apply for permanent residency is playing \naround with legislation, then we are playing around with legislation. \nThe playing around is going to stop because we are going to have this \nlegislation passed. The President of the United States has said this \nwill be in a bill, and if it is not, he will veto the bill. He has also \ngone so far as to say: I would like some support from the Congress \nbefore I do that. He has it. He has more than enough to sustain a veto \nin a letter to him from the House and from the Senate.\n  Our legislation is going to come to be, and people might just as well \nrealize that. What Senators from the majority should also understand is \nthat we are going to vote on our measure. We are going to vote for H-\n1B. We support it, but in addition to H-1B, we also believe, without \nany question, that we need to vote on our legislation. We need \nindividuals who fill a critical shortage of high-tech workers in this \ncountry. We support that. We also need essential workers, skilled, and \nsemi-skilled workers to fill jobs, as indicated by the scores of \norganizations and companies that support our amendment, our \nlegislation.\n  I hope the majority understands they are the ones holding up this \nlegislation, not us. They can file 15 more motions to invoke cloture, \nand we are still going to have a vote on our amendment. One of the \nvotes is going to occur this afternoon if the unanimous consent request \nis brought forward. If not, it will occur some other time.\n  We believe that the vote which is going to occur at 4:30 this \nafternoon is the first test to finding out how people really feel about \nsupporting this legislation--not holding hearings in the future, not \nsaying we want to increase the caps on legal immigration. I do not want \nto do that. We need to deal with it now.\n  I think what we need to do is not talk about the future; let's talk \nabout today, what we are going to do to make sure these people in Las \nVegas--20,000 people in Nevada; most of them in Las Vegas--who have had \ntheir work cards pulled, who have lost their jobs, who have had their \nmortgages foreclosed on their homes, who have had their cars \nrepossessed, who have had their credit cards pulled from them, who \ndeserve the basic protections that we have in this country in something \ncalled due process that has been denied--we want to have a due process \nhearing for these people who have children who are American citizens, \nwives and husbands who are American citizens.\n  Today is the day we are going to determine if my constituents in \nNevada are going to be given what every American, every person within \nthe boundaries of our country, has a right to, and that is due process.\n  What we have is a piece of legislation that seeks to provide \npermanent and legally defined groups of immigrants who are already \nhere, already working, already contributing to the tax base and social \nfabric of our country, with a way to gain U.S. permanent residency and \nhopefully someday citizenship.\n  I repeat, 5 minutes from now we would agree to vote on H-1B. Five \nminutes after that vote is completed, we will agree to vote on the \nLatino and Immigrant Fairness Act.\n  I also say, if that process is not allowed, then we are going to \ncontinue here in the Senate to keep working until people are called \nupon to account for how they feel about this legislation. There comes a \ntime when you have to fess up, you have to vote for or against a piece \nof legislation. That is what we are asking for here--a vote for or \nagainst this legislation.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. REID. If my friend would withhold, there is a unanimous consent \nrequest that I understand----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, to hasten the moment of this all-important \nvote, I ask unanimous consent that a vote occur on the pending Daschle \nmotion to suspend the rules at 4:30 p.m. today, and the time between \nnow and 4:30 p.m. be equally divided in the usual form.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent, \nnotwithstanding rule XXII, that following that vote, the pending \namendments Nos. 4201 and 4183 be considered adopted, and the vote then \noccur immediately on the second-degree amendment No. 4178, without any \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, in light of this agreement, Members can \nexpect two back-to-back votes at 4:30 p.m. today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me begin by talking about immigration. \nI\n\n[[Page S9346]]\n\nam a strong supporter of immigration. I am proud that my grandfather \ncame to this country right before the turn of the 20th century. I am \nproud that my wife's grandfather came to America as an indentured \nlaborer to work in the sugar cane fields in Hawaii. In fact, this \nsummer, I had the very happy experience of our family donating to the \nInstitute of Texan Cultures in San Antonio a photograph of my wife's \ngrandmother that was a picture in a picture book that men went through \nto pick out what was called a ``picture- book bride'' to send for her \nto come to America.\n  This pioneer came to America to marry a man she had never met in a \nstrange country whose language she did not speak; she came seeking \nopportunity and freedom, and found both.\n  That is a story of America in action. Her granddaughter, under \nPresidents Reagan and Bush, became Chairman of the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission, where she oversaw the trading of all futures, \nincluding futures on the same cane sugar that her grandfather came to \nAmerica to cut by hand.\n\n  I am as strongly committed to immigration as you can be committed to \nimmigration.\n  I also remind my colleagues that the bill before the Senate was co-\nauthored by Senator Abraham, by the distinguished chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, and by myself.\n  This bill seeks to allow highly skilled people--many of them in \ngraduate school in America--to stay in our country, to help us be \ncompetitive in the world market, to help us dominate the information \nage, and to help us create more jobs for our own people.\n  I challenge anyone to point to a more committed position in favor of \nimmigration than I have taken as a Member of the Senate.\n  In fact, our Presiding Officer may remember a speech I gave once \nabout a young man who worked for me on my staff named Rohit Kumar. I \nwas debating, I believe, Senator Kennedy at the time. I took this young \nman's family--his father is a research physician; his mother is a \ndoctor; his uncle is an engineer--and I simply went through a list of \nKumars in America--his parents had come here as immigrants. And I \ntalked about the contributions they made and the taxes they paid. The \nconclusion of my speech was this: America needs more Kumars. By the \nway, lest anyone be confused by what has now become an American name, \nthe Kumars came from India.\n  Why do I say all this? To make it clear that America is not full. I \nbelieve there is still room in America for people who come and bring \nnew genius and new energy and new creativity. But I draw a bright \nline--it is as bright as the morning Sun--and it is on one issue: \nPeople should come to America legally. People should come to America to \nbe part of the American dream. In coming to America, people should not \nviolate the laws of our country.\n  Apparently, our Democrat colleagues feel so comfortable that it is a \nsalable political position to take that they want to change the law to \nsay that people who violated the laws of our country are welcome to \nAmerica. I reject that. I reject it because it is patently unfair.\n  Our Democrat colleagues even have the arrogance to call this the \n``Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act,'' as if the label would make it \nso. I wonder how many people who are waiting in line to come to \nAmerica--the several million people who have applied to come legally; \npeople whose spouses have applied to come--I wonder how fair they think \nit is that they are going to bed every night dreaming of coming to \nAmerica, and we are going to put somebody who violated the laws of the \ncountry in front of them.\n  I do not call that fair. Quite frankly, I am happy to label the idea \noutrageous and condescending, that if someone is a Latino that they \nmust therefore favor changing the laws to allow people who violated the \nimmigration laws to come and to stay and to invite others to do the \nsame.\n  I remind my colleagues that in 1986 we passed a landmark immigration \nbill. The fundamental tenets of that bill were, one, we were going to \nenforce employer sanctions--we have not done that, as everybody who \nlives in America knows--and two, that if you came before 1982 and you \nwere in good standing, you could apply and become a permanent resident \nalien and eventually you could become a citizen. But if you came \nafterward, the commitment of that bill was that was the last general \namnesty we were ever going to provide.\n  Now our Democrat colleagues obviously think it is good politics that \nwe should go back on the commitments we made in that bill. Hence, we \nhave the bill that is before us.\n  Let me explain the issue of how we came to be here, then the \nprocedure that is being used. Finally, I will talk about this threat by \nPresident Clinton that if we don't adopt a bill legalizing illegal \nacts, he is going to shut down the FBI and the Justice Department by \nnot funding their appropriations.\n  Let me begin by explaining that we have before us a bill called the \nH-1B program. Most Americans, I am sure, don't know what H-1B is, but \nbasically this is a procedure in immigration law that allows us to \nemploy uniquely skilled, high-income workers, principally, as it has \nturned out, in this new area of high technology and computer science--\nmany of these people are actually graduate students in our country; \nhalf of the students in the high-tech areas at American universities \nare foreign born, as I am sure many people know. Because we have such \ncritical shortages in this area, this provision allows these people to \nstay in America and work and help us create jobs for people who are \nalready here.\n  Our Democrat colleagues claim they are for this bill. The problem is, \nthey won't let us vote on it. But when it gets right down to it, they \nwant to be paid tribute. The tribute they are seeking is passage of \nanother bill that would let people who violated the law to stay in our \ncountry.\n  Now we have made it very clear that we are not going to pay tribute. \nTheir problem is, they have gone to Silicon Valley, they have gone to \nAustin, TX, they have gone to the high-tech centers of America, and \nthey have told people in the high-tech industry: We are with you; the \nDemocrat Party is with you; we are for the H-1B program. The problem \nthey have is, their actions do not comport with their words. And that \nis why we are here simply saying, if you are for the H-1B program, pass \nit.\n  I have believed for a couple of days that we are coming to the end of \nthis charade. I don't believe our Democrat colleagues can sustain the \nAmerican public--that is, the relatively small number of people who are \ninterested in this bill--watching Democrats every day delay a bill \nwhich they are out trumpeting their support. You can confuse some of \nthe people some of the time, but people cannot be confused under these \ncircumstances.\n  Meanwhile, our Democrat colleagues are on the verge of throwing in \nthe towel on H-1B by saying, well, we want another bill on another \nissue. To that end, they have adopted a very unusual procedure of \ntrying to change the rules of the Senate in order to accomplish what \nthey want, and we are going to vote on that at 4:30. That is going to \nbe defeated, soundly defeated.\n  Let me turn to President Clinton. I wonder if, in these waning hours \nof the Clinton administration, our President has not become so deluded \nby his power and the semblance of power he has exercised in the last 8 \nyears in beating Congress into submission. I wonder if the President \nhas not started to believe he is King, that somehow he can say to us, \nif you don't pass a law legalizing illegal activities in America, I \nwill shut down the FBI and the Justice Department.\n  That is what the threat is. The threat is, if we don't pass a bill \nthat says people who violated the law in coming to America can stay \nhere, he will veto an appropriations bill that funds the FBI, the DEA, \nthe Justice Department, and the Federal prison system. It seems to me \nthose aren't the words of a President, those are the words of a King.\n\n  Does he believe we are so weak in our commitment to the \nconstitutional principle? The Congress is given the power under article \nI of the Constitution to appropriate money, not the President.\n  I will say to the President, if he wants to veto the Commerce-State-\nJustice appropriations bill--I know the bill well because I once had \nthe privilege of chairing that subcommittee --if he wants to veto that \nbill and risk shutting down the FBI and the Justice\n\n[[Page S9347]]\n\nDepartment and the DEA because we are not going to pass a bill that has \nnothing to do with those appropriations but simply a bill that \nlegalizes illegal activity, then I would have to say to the President \nhe had better get his pen out and he had better be sure it has ink in \nit.\n  You never know what is going to happen around here, but let me tell \nyou, from one Senator's point of view, a private in the Army, as long \nas there is any possibility of resisting this I am never, ever going to \nsit by without using every right I have as a Senator to stop that from \nhappening.\n  What an outrageous, deeply offensive threat. Are none of our Democrat \ncolleagues offended? I will be interested to see how the sage of the \nSenate, our colleague from West Virginia, ranking member of the \nAppropriations Committee, former majority leader, former chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee, how he feels about a President who has \nbecome so deluded about his powers that he believes he is King and that \nhe can say to us, you either legalize illegal acts in America or I will \nshut down the FBI and the DEA and the Justice Department.\n  I understand we are simple people here in the Senate. We have \ndemonstrated over and over that we don't have President Clinton's \nability to communicate with the public. We don't have the ability to \nstand for one thing one day and the next day do a 180-degree reversal \nand everybody thinks it is great.\n  But if we don't have the ability to stand up to a President in \ntelling us that unless we pass legislation legalizing illegal activity, \nhe is going to shut down the FBI and the DEA and the Justice Department \nand the prison system by vetoing an appropriations bill forum--if we \ncan't stand up and debate that, we might as well eliminate Congress and \njust let Bill Clinton rule.\n  I don't intend to see that happen. It may be we will get run over \nhere, but we are not going to get run over without one great fight. I \nam going to be surprised in the end if there is not at least one \nDemocrat who is going to join us in this fight.\n  Now, let me turn to the heart and soul of this issue, the belief by \nour Democrat colleagues that it is good politics to make it legal for \npeople to engage in illegal activity in coming to America. Our Democrat \ncolleagues believe they are going to gain votes in this election by \nsaying that if you violated the law in coming to America, if you jumped \nin line in front of the several million people who have applied to come \nlegally, don't worry because we intend to legalize what you did. And \ndon't worry about the spouses of people who are already here, who are \nwaiting and praying for the day they can come to America legally, just \njump ahead of them, violate the law, come to America, because once you \nget here, we will embrace you and legalize your actions.\n  I know our Democrat colleagues believe this is good politics. I know \nour Democrat colleagues believe, because of the way they named this \nbill, that every immigrant and especially Latinos support illegal \nimmigration. What an outrageous, offensive name for this bill, the \n``Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act.'' What is fair about a bill that \nsanctions illegal activities? What is fair about saying to several \nmillion people--more of them Latinos than any other ethnic extraction \nor origin--that it is fair for somebody to violate the law and come to \nAmerica ahead of you, but it is fair to make you wait month after \nmonth, year after year, to join the people you love? That is the \nDemocrats idea of fairness? What is fair about that?\n  I think immigrants--and, quite frankly, I still consider myself one--\nI don't think most people who are immigrants to America believe this is \nabout fairness. They believe this is a raw political act, and they are \nright. This is putting politics ahead of people. This is about trying \nto single out a group of people, as if every Hispanic in my State \nbelieves that it is OK to let someone violate the law.\n  I reject that. That is not the way Texans feel, no matter what their \nethic origin. I think when people really look at this, they are going \nto see that this for what it is, an outrageous political act.\n  Since I am going to stand for reelection in a State where many \nHispanics are going to vote--and I am proud of the fact that when I ran \nin 1990, I got about half of the Hispanic vote in my State--I, \nobviously, do not believe that this is the great political ploy that \nour Democrat colleagues believe it to be.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. CRAIG. The Senator makes a point that I hope echoes across this \ncountry, which is that you cannot honor, recognize, or enhance the \nconcept of breaking the law or acting illegally and therefore be \nrewarded for it. We are struggling mightily on the floor to address a \nneed in this country; it is called an employment need--H-1B workers \nprimarily for the high-tech industry.\n  The Senator knows I have worked on H-2A, the issue of primarily \nHispanic workforces but migrant labor coming to this country to work in \nagriculture. We have a very real need there, but we are trying to \nadjust a law so that it accommodates a citizenry, treats them in a \nhumane way, but stays within the law because we have to control our \nborders.\n  It is critically necessary that as a nation we control our borders. \nWhat you are suggesting--and this is my question--if you can make it \nacross the border illegally, and if you can stay here long enough and \nraise your issue through an interest group long enough, or with a \npolitical party, you may be rewarded for having broken the law by \ngetting someone to do something for you.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Basically, what their bill is, is that you will be \nrewarded by being put in front of the 7 million people who have applied \nto come to America legally because they weren't willing to violate \nAmerica's laws to become Americans and you were. If I may say this, and \nI then will yield the floor------\n  Mr. CRAIG. May I ask one more question?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Yes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Under current law as to the Immigration and Naturalization \nService, people who seek either status in this country as a legal \nresident but not a citizen, apply and basically line up on a list and \nwait for the process to move them through; is that how it works? You \nare saying we would jump millions ahead of that?\n  Mr. GRAMM. We would jump millions ahead of those who are currently in \nother countries, some of them spouses of people who live in America who \napplied to come here legally. Basically, what the Democrats' bill says \nis, look, the people who violate the law will be rewarded. I don't \nbelieve you promote a respect for law by rewarding people who violate \nthe law, and I don't know a single Texan who believes that, either.\n  Let me make this clear. I am not saying that there are not some \nspecial cases where people, because of bureaucracies--and we all know \nbureaucracies and how they work or don't work--I am not saying there \nare not thousands, maybe tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands \nof people who have a good case against the bureaucracy and they should \nhave an opportunity to make their case. Whatever we can do to speed the \nbureaucratic process and give people justice, I am for. I am sure our \ncolleagues, at some point in the debate, will hold up some case of a \nperson who has not gotten due process from the Clinton administration's \nImmigration and Naturalization Service. But the solution to that is not \nto throw out the law book; the solution is to install new leadership, \nto fix the INS bureaucracy and to deal with people's problems \neffectively and on an individual basis.\n  So let me conclude with the following highlights: No. 1, I am for \nlegal immigration because I think it enriches America. As some of my \ncolleagues know, I was once chairman of the National Republican \nSenatorial Committee. We were having an event and a very sweet little \nold lady from Florida stood up and said, ``Senator Gramm, why does \neverybody at this meeting talk funny?'' Well, we had a lot of people \nwho I guess you would call ``ethnics'' there, and everybody sort of \ngasped and wondered what I might say and not hurt anybody's feelings, \nincluding this lady's feelings. So I said the first thing that occurred \nto me: ``Ma'am, I guess people talk funny because this is America.''\n  I want immigrants to come to America. I want them to join in the \nAmerican dream, as my family and my\n\n[[Page S9348]]\n\nwife's family have been blessed to join in. I want them to come \nlegally, and I draw the line on that. I am willing to face every voter \nin Texas on that.\n  Our Democrat colleagues are really hoping today that the voters are \nnot paying attention. They are hoping some of these radical groups \nwanting to change America's law to forgive the fact that their members \nhave violated the law are watching this debate on television. But they \nhope that the working men and women of America are not paying attention \nto this issue. They want credit for saying they will reward you for \nviolating the law, but I don't think they are going to want the \nAmerican people to know the political game they are engaged in with \nputting politics before people.\n  Let me say that I am happy to debate this issue. I don't have any \nfear about this issue whatsoever--none. Anybody who wants to come to \nTexas and debate this issue will have a grand opportunity to do that \nwhen I am running, and I look forward to them coming. Texans, including \nHispanics, do not believe that those who violate the law should be \ntreated better than people who abide by the law.\n  I think our Democrat colleagues have misjudged this issue if they \nthink hard-working Hispanics in this country believe we ought to allow \npeople to break the law and be rewarded for it. I reject that, I will \nbe happy to debate it, and I am going to be eager to vote on it at \n4:30.\n  Finally, to repeat, in case anybody missed it, President Clinton \nthreatened to veto the funding measure for the FBI, the DEA, the \nJustice Department, and the prison system unless we legalize illegal \nactivity--something that is not only bad policy and that the American \npeople are against, but that has nothing to do with funding Commerce-\nState-Justice. If the President really believes that is going to work, \nhe believes he has become a King. I think the time has come to show him \nthat he can veto a good bill, but he cannot make us pass this bad law \nthat would legalize and reward lawlessness in America.\n  You can put a pretty face on this. You can sugarcoat it all you want. \nBut what we are seeing is a blatant political act that is before the \nSenate in an effort to appeal to voters who believe that somehow it is \ngood policy in America to legalize illegal actions and to reward people \nwho have violated the law. Maybe I misjudge America. Maybe I don't \nunderstand this issue. But I don't think so.\n  I want everybody to know about this issue. I want to be sure \neverybody hears about this issue. I would be willing to let this \nelection and every election from now until the end of time be \ndetermined by the issue of refusing to legalize illegal activity for \npolitical gain.\n  Our Democrat colleagues have chosen poorly, in my opinion. We are not \ngoing to be stampeded by President Clinton into passing this bill.\n  I can't prevent it from being put into some bill. I can resist and \nwill resist, and maybe I can be run over as part of some backroom deal. \nBut as a freestanding measure, this bill will never pass as a \nfreestanding measure as long as I am in the Senate.\n  I thank the Chair for allowing me to speak this long. This is an \nimportant issue and I feel strongly about it. I want people to know \nabout it.\n  If our colleagues are ready to debate this issue, to quote a famous \nShakespeare play:\n\n     Lay on, Macduff,\n     And damn'd be he that first cries, ``Hold, enough!''\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we have colleagues on the floor who are \nwaiting to speak. I apologize to them for breaking in ahead of them. I \nappreciate their kindness in allowing me to respond briefly to the \ncomments of the Senator from Texas.\n  I can't believe what I have just heard, frankly. I am really amazed, \nand I may take a longer time at a later date to respond. I do not even \nknow where to begin. But let me make four points very quickly.\n  First, to the point made by the Senator from Texas that somehow we \nare holding up the H-1B bill, that could not be further off the mark. \nThat is not true.\n  I have suggested to Senator Lott and to others that we would be \nwilling to take a very short time agreement, period; it is over; let's \nhave the vote.\n  I think what he said was we are trying to hijack the bill. What is it \nabout offering an amendment that hijacks a piece of legislation? We are \nnot hijacking anything. We are simply asking that we use the regular \norder here. Let's have the vote. Let's have the vote. We can do it this \nafternoon.\n  Second, with regard to this notion that somehow we are making illegal \nactivity legal, I wonder if the Senator from Texas has looked at the \nStatute of Liberty recently--the Statue of Liberty welcoming those \noppressed from around the world.\n  What is wrong with granting fairness to all immigrants regardless of \ncircumstance? Why do we draw a distinction?\n  That is all we are suggesting--that we not draw any distinctions \nhere; that if you come from El Salvador or Haiti that you ought to have \nthe same rights as if you came from Cuba. We are simply saying we want \nsome basic fairness. We are not condoning any illegal activity. He \nknows that.\n  Third, I must say that it seems that it is the Senator from Texas who \nis shedding crocodile tears--in his case, for people who have been \nwaiting in a long line to become American citizens. I am sympathetic to \nthese people too. But, with the passage of the H-1B bill that I know \nthe Senator from Texas will vote for, we are going to allow 600,000 \npeople--over three years--to go to the front of the line. We are going \nto put them at the front of the line. Never mind those 7 million people \nhe just said were waiting. We are going to put them at the front of the \nline because they are filling high-paying, high-skilled jobs. Never \nmind the individuals who fill the thousands of available low-paying, \nlow-skilled jobs. It is only the high-skilled workers we are interested \nin? To them, we say go to the front of the line. But if you work in a \nnursing home, if you work in a restaurant, if you work for the minimum \nwage, we say get back to the end of the line.\n  Fourth, let me correct this notion that somehow Democratic Senators \nare out of sync. This isn't our legislation. This is the legislation \nthat virtually the entire Hispanic community has said they need. I \ndidn't draft it. We worked with the Hispanic community to draft it. A \nlarge number of those people who the distinguished Senator from Texas \nsaid voted for him in the last election were the ones who came to this \nSenate, and said: Fix this problem. Fix it.\n  We are not out of sync. We are trying to respond, as we all must do, \nto legitimate problems in the Latino community, and the Liberian \ncommunity. Fairness is what we are asking for.\n  We are not alone. It is the other side that is out there all by \nthemselves. I know the distinguished Senator from Nevada, the Assistant \nDemocratic Leader, has a list that Senator Kennedy initially \nconstructed, of 31 national organizations, including the National \nRestaurant Association, the Chamber of Commerce, and the National \nRetail Federation, that all believe we should pass these immigration \nreforms.\n  These organizations are not supporting sanctifying or somehow \njustifying illegal activity. How does the Senator from Texas possibly \nexplain to the Chamber of Commerce that they are condoning illegal \nactivity? For Heaven's sake.\n\n  That is why I say I don't believe what I just heard. I can't believe \nanybody would come to the floor and say those things. But they were \nsaid. They deserve a response, and I hope our colleagues will keep them \nin perspective.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I yield such time as I may consume from the \nDemocratic time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, there has been much discussion about the Latino and \nImmigrant Fairness Act. I think it is useful and appropriate to focus \non precisely what this act does.\n  First, in 1997 Congress passed the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central \nAmerican Relief Act. Essentially, this bill granted permanent residency \nto\n\n[[Page S9349]]\n\nNicaraguans and Cubans who had fled oppressive governments. But we also \nrecognize that there were thousands of other individuals from Central \nAmerica who were fleeing the same type of repression, the same type of \nuncertainty in their lives, and violence in their lives. Yet these \nindividuals were not covered by this legislation.\n  One of the major provisions of the bill we are discussing is to \nrecognize these individuals who also have been residing in the United \nStates, who have been working in the United States, and who have been \ncontributing to our communities. This is not at all some act of \ncondoning illegality.\n  Frankly, in 1997, we recognized that simple justice demanded that we \nallow individuals who are living in this country to adjust to permanent \nresidency. We now want to expand that principle of fairness and decency \nto the others from that region.\n  In addition, there are other areas of the world which have the same \ntypes of violence, chaos, and turmoil. Principally I have been active \non behalf of the Liberians who are here--many since the early 1990s \ncivil war in their country.\n  This is not about condoning or recognizing lawlessness. It is about \nfairness.\n  In fact, our immigration policy is such that we certainly recognize \nand extend extraordinary opportunities to Cubans who flee their country \nwithout documentation, simply by arriving on the shore, have argument \nor the opportunity to make the case to stay here. If we can do that for \none particular group, I think in the context of the turmoil and chaos \nwe have seen in Central America, we can do it for other groups. That is \nat the core of this legislation.\n\n  Second, we have, since 1929, established a principle that if one \nenters this country and stays long enough and contributes to the \ncommunities in which he or she lives, they will be allowed to adjust to \npermanent status--this notion, called the registry date, is the idea \nthat if you can document your presence in the United States for a long \nenough period of time, we will allow you to become a permanent resident \nand part of the citizenry.\n  Another part of the legislation moves the day of registry from 1972 \nto 1986. I think that recognizes that periodically throughout our \nhistory we face the reality that people have come here and established \nthemselves, and it would be unfair to send them to their native lands. \nWe are simply updating that particular date to allow people who have \nbeen residing in this country since 1986 to become permanent residents.\n  Finally, we would extend provision 245(i) which allows a person who \nqualified for a green card or work authorization to obtain a visa \nwithout first leaving the country. One of the changes we made recently \nin the immigration law was to require people physically to leave the \nUnited States to apply for a visa to come back in. That is not only an \nundue burden, but it complicates infinitely the lives of people who are \nworking here, living here, and want to become permanent residents.\n  This is not legislation that condones lawlessness, it is legislation \nthat is consistent with many legislative acts we have adopted beginning \nin the 1920s. It is legislation that recognizes if we are extending \nspecial opportunities to some people in a region, we should also, in \nfairness, extend it to others in that same region. This is legislation \nthat is not particularly novel, but it is eminently and inherently just \nand fair and should be before the Senate.\n  But because of the parliamentary maneuvering and devices used, this \nlegislation has not been offered in a way we can vote directly on it. \nOur plea has been, for months and months and months, to allow an up-or-\ndown vote. There are serious policy issues regarding this legislation. \nPeople of good conscience can disagree. What is most disagreeable is \nthat we have not had the opportunity to offer amendments on this \nlegislation so that we can vote up or down.\n  There is one part of the bill in which I am particularly interested \nbecause it applies to a group of people who have been residing in our \ncountry for almost a decade, the Liberian population; 10,000 Liberians. \nThe cause of their stay in the United States was a vicious civil war in \ntheir homeland. Many have been here for years. They have established \nthemselves. They have been working and paying taxes and not, because \nthey are subject to temporary protected status, enjoying any particular \npublic benefits. Many have children who are American citizens.\n  One such individual, reported today in the Baltimore Sun is Gonlakpor \nGonkpala, 48 years old. He has been living in the United States since \nhe arrived as a student from Liberia in 1982. He got a degree in \nfinance at Central State University in Wilberforce, OH, and did \ngraduate work at Morgan State University. The civil war has prevented \nhim from returning home. Today he lives in Brockton, MA, where he owns \na three-bedroom house, belongs to a Masonic lodge, and is a member of \nthe Methodist Church. He manages a CVS pharmacy. But Friday, without \nextension of DED, deferred enforced departure, his work authority will \ncease and he will be deported back to Liberia.\n  This is typical of so many people. It seems to me supremely ironic \nthat as we are taking people from around the world under H-1B visas to \nman our industrial and commercial enterprises throughout this country, \nwe are literally sending people who are already here, working hard, \ncontributing and making our economy grow, we are sending them back to \nLiberia.\n\n  At the same time we are proposing to send people back to Liberia, our \nState Department is issuing warnings telling American citizens: Don't \ngo there; it is too dangerous; you are likely to be threatened, if not \nworse.\n  We have been working with colleagues in this body for months to bring \na bill to the floor on a bipartisan basis, Republicans and Democrats. \nYet we have been denied systematically that opportunity. The denial to \nus means the status and the lives of 10,000 Liberians in the United \nStates continue to hang by a very slender thread.\n  I hope all who embrace the notion of fairness and justice in \nimmigration will give us the opportunity to vote on this issue. To \ndate, that has not happened. It is critical because the prospect of \nsending these people home is very daunting and dangerous for these \nindividuals. Liberia today is a democracy in form but not a democracy \nin substance. It is plagued with violence, economic turmoil, \nuncertainty, and fear. As so many Liberians report to me, it is a place \nwhere they will not be accepted readily. Also, they very well could be \nthreatened physically. Certainly, they would have difficult problems \nadapting. Many face a very difficult choice: Do I leave my American-\nborn children, American citizens here, and go back, or do I bring them \nback to a country that is unprepared to care for them in terms of \nhealth care, education, and other social endeavors?\n  That is what is at stake. It is the same for so many families who are \nLatinos in this country. That is what we are about: The same kind of \nsimple justice since the same kind of difficult situations faced by the \nLiberians are faced by Hispanics. We want to give them a chance to \nadjust their status. It is not a recognition of lawlessness, it is in a \nsense a recognition of these people's contributions to America and \ntheir commitment to our country.\n  The situation is one which is especially compelling for me. Our ties \nto Liberia are older than any in Africa. The country was established by \nfreed American slaves. Its capital is Monrovia, named after President \nMonroe. It has for years been a place for which Americans and Liberians \nhave felt a special kinship. Today it is ruled by a President, Charles \nTaylor, who has been implicated in crimes of violence in neighboring \ncountry Sierra Leone, who has been nonsupportive of human rights and \npolitical freedoms, who has conducted a regime that is repressive and \nrightly criticized by so many.\n  I don't believe we can or should send thousands of Liberians residing \nhere back to Liberia. What we have is an opportunity to do something \nthat is both fair and, I believe, entirely appropriate. But that \nopportunity has been frustrated left and right by the unwillingness to \ngive us the opportunity to bring this measure forward. Later today, we \nhave an opportunity to vote on a resolution that will allow us at least \nto get a vote. We will continue to press on. We will continue to try to \ninject justice into our system of immigration, to recognize that there \nare thousands and thousands of people who are living here who \ndesperately want to stay here, who want to continue to\n\n[[Page S9350]]\n\ncontribute to America. I hope we recognize their contribution and give \nthem a chance to stay.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \nproceed for up to 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             ENERGY POLICY\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, first let me say a word about the \nprocedural morass that we find ourselves in, as I understand it. I do \nnot claim to understand it all. The Democratic leader was trying to get \nthe Senate to actually consider and vote on this Latino Fairness Act, \nwhich I strongly support. But in order to keep that from happening, I \nunderstand the majority leader came forward with a motion to proceed to \nS. 2557. Now, S. 2557 is a bill to protect the energy security of the \nUnited States and to decrease America's dependence on foreign oil \nsources. This is a bill, parts of which I support but many parts of \nwhich I cannot support because they have, in my view, wrongheaded \npolicy judgments in them. But that is the National Energy Security Act \nof 2000 to which the majority leader made a motion to proceed.\n  I am informed by those who follow this activity on the floor more \nclosely than do I that there is no serious effort by the Republican \nmajority to actually consider or vote on or pass any legislation \nregarding energy security; that that is not a subject which they \nbelieve has enough of a priority attached to it that it justifies any \nreal action by this Senate.\n  So we are somewhat on this issue because of a procedural effort to \nkeep us from considering something else. That is just by way of \nbackground, to identify for people why I am here today speaking about \nan amendment which I would offer. If we ever did seriously consider \nthis National Energy Security Act of 2000, then I would offer an \namendment to that on behalf of myself, Senator Daschle, Senator Byrd, \nSenator Baucus, Senator Bayh, Senator Johnson, Senator Levin, Senator \nRockefeller, and Senator Akaka.\n  The amendment I would offer would replace the text of S. 2557 in its \nentirety, and in its place it would offer a comprehensive approach to \nenergy policy, much of which we originally introduced as S. 1833 nearly \na year ago.\n  In order to explain why I believe it would be good for this Congress \nand good for this Senate to go ahead and pass this legislation that I \nwould offer as an amendment, let me just say a few things about the \nenergy situation. There have been several speeches. I do not know about \ntoday; I haven't watched the floor proceedings all day, but I did see \nyesterday where several people were speaking about the problems we have \nwith our energy supply. Those problems are real.\n  With the supplies of crude oil and refined products and natural gas \nextremely tight, which they are, energy prices and the availability of \nsome of these products are in the forefront of the minds of a lot of \npeople. In my State, people are receiving in their mail notices from \nthe utility companies saying the price of natural gas will be going up, \ntheir utility bills will be going up substantially this winter. So I \nbelieve it is essential we assess the current circumstance and that we \ndevelop a strategy for remedying the identified deficiencies.\n  Current prices are extreme when we compare them with the relatively \nlow prices that we have enjoyed for the past 10 years. Aside from the \noil price spike at the time of the Gulf war, the average annual price \nof crude oil during the 1990s was about $15 a barrel. The price of \nnatural gas is somewhat less volatile than oil, historically, but it \nwas also quite low. It was $1.84 per thousand cubic feet. That was \nbecause of what was called by all who focused on it ``the gas \nbubble.'' This was excess supply following the restructuring of the \nnatural gas markets.\n\n  The reality is that oil and natural gas are commodities. They are \ncommodities whose prices rise and fall just as those of any other \ncommodity. Since oil and natural gas are often developed together out \nof common reserves, as they are in parts of my State, the dramatic \ndrop-off in oil drilling in 1998 and 1999 had a direct impact on \nnatural gas supply at the same time that it was impacting future oil \nsupply.\n  So true to what we all learned in Economics 101, once supply was \nreduced enough--with some direct market intervention by OPEC, I would \nadd--the price of oil began to rise and drilling began again. Drilling \nis now going on at a robust pace around this country. While U.S. oil \nproduction overall has been in decline since 1970, the deep waters in \nthe Gulf of Mexico have recently proven to be a very active oil and gas \nproduction area for our country. The deep water royalty incentives that \nwere proposed by Senator Johnston when he was representing Louisiana in \nthis body, which were also supported by this administration, have been \na major contributor to the 65-percent increase in offshore oil \nproduction that has occurred under this administration. That is \nsomething that is often not focused on, but there has been a 65-percent \nincrease in offshore oil production since this administration came into \noffice.\n  Natural gas production on Federal lands--and that is the bulk of the \nnatural gas production in my State--has also increased 60 percent under \nthis administration due, in part, to the development of coalbed \nmethane. My State of New Mexico has been a major contributor to that \ngrowth in natural gas production. We look forward to a continuation of \nthat trend.\n  A recent survey by Salomon-Smith Barney projected the highest \nincrease this year in worldwide spending on oil and gas exploration \nsince 1981. The lion's share of that increased spending is directed \ntoward North America, with companies planning to spend 76 percent more \non natural gas projects alone this year than they did in 1999. So that \nis good news. However, those new supplies will not begin having a \nsignificant impact on natural gas prices until at least next spring or \nnext summer.\n  There has been considerable consternation about the President's \ndecision just this last week to go forward with a swap of 30 million \nbarrels of oil from the strategic petroleum reserve to address concerns \nabout heating oil stocks. I want to offer to this debate, which has \noccurred sporadically here on the Senate floor, the following \ninformation from the International Energy Agency's September monthly \noil market report. That report says that world oil demand is always \nhighest in the fourth quarter of the year, and the IEA, the \nInternational Energy Agency, is predicting a drop in world oil demand \nin the first quarter of next year on the order of 1 million barrels per \nday. In the near term, however--and this is a quote from their report:\n\n       The market is too fragile. It needs higher inventories to \n     protect against circumstances such as an abnormally cold \n     winter. Without adequate stock coverage, the market lumbers \n     from one problem to another, creating instability in its wake \n     and dragging prices ever higher.\n\n  The reduction in world oil demand in the spring, coupled with the new \nproduction from non-OPEC sources, should bring prices down appreciably \nin the spring and summer of next year.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent a page from the September IEA Oil Market \nReport be printed in the Record following my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I also ask that an article that appears \nin this morning's New York Times, the September 27 New York Times, also \nbe printed in the Record after my statement. This is an article by Paul \nKrugman entitled ``A Drop in the Barrel.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the thrust of that article is that the \ndecision to go ahead with release of oil from the SPR, the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve, was the right decision. He says we should be tapping \nour oil reserves. In fact, our mistake was that we waited too long; we \nshould have been doing it months ago. But he applauds the decision of \nthe President last week to go ahead now. I commend that article to my \ncolleagues.\n  Beyond crude oil availability, the other key and a more complicated \nelement is U.S. refining capacity, which currently is at near maximum \nutilization.\n\n[[Page S9351]]\n\n  While it is true that the number of refineries has decreased during \nthe past 10 years, the capacity has actually increased. In 1990, there \nwere 205 refineries. By 1998, that number had decreased to 163. \nHowever, the total capacity increased from 15.57 million barrels per \nday to 15.71 million barrels per day over that same period. Certain \nsmall, inefficient refineries which were originally built to take \nadvantage of the old oil allocation rules were shut down rather than \nupgraded to produce cleaner fuels, but the refineries that did upgrade \nto comply with the Clean Air Act actually expanded capacity--more \nspecifically, the capacity to produce light products.\n  According to the Economist magazine, there was considerable excess \ncapacity in the U.S. refining sector as recently as late 1996. I quote \nfrom an article in the Economist:\n\n       Demand for oil in North America and Western Europe is \n     sluggish. According to the International Energy Agency, it \n     was only 1 percent higher in 1995 than 1993. Yet both regions \n     are plagued with over-capacity. In 1990-1995, the capacity of \n     American refiners to produce light-oil products, such as \n     gasoline, increased by an average of 1 million barrels per \n     day--almost double the rate of growth in demand.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of that article entitled ``A case \nof Unrefined Behaviour'' from the October 12, 1996, Economist be \nprinted in the Record following my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of New Hampshire). Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 3.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, robust demand growth has finally caught \nup to eliminate that excess capacity, both in the United States and in \nEurope. Clearly, domestic refining capacity is a significant concern \nthat needs to be addressed, but if near-term crude prices come down \nenough--as they have started to since the announcement to swap oil from \nthe reserve--the underutilized refining capacity in Asia and the \nCaribbean could be utilized to increase the distillate stocks in the \nworld market.\n  There are many political and economic factors beyond the control of \nthe Congress and the administration that drive OPEC decisions. To a \nsubstantial extent, the price of oil will be driven by world market \nfactors beyond our control. Natural gas, on the other hand, is largely \nsold in the North American market. While there is no quick or easy fix, \nwe need to assess the impacts of our current policies on natural gas \nand on oil development during very low world oil price periods to avoid \nthese boom-and-bust cycles in the future.\n  No one wants to go back to the days of regulation with gasoline lines \nand natural gas shortages, but we do need to determine where there are \nmarket inefficiencies and market failures that cause this extreme \nvolatility in product stocks and prices.\n  One of the major problems in the crude oil market is uncertainty \nabout actual global consumption and production until months after the \nfact. Our Energy Secretary, Bill Richardson, has already begun the \nprocess of improving market data with the successful meeting this \nsummer involving both the consuming countries and OPEC representatives.\n  We also need a better assessment of whether and how increased demand \nfor oil products and natural gas will be met, and this includes better \ncoordination of environmental and fuel policies.\n  Over the long run, the least costly, most environmentally benign, and \nsustainable thing we can do is to use energy more efficiently.\n\n  I refer to this chart to make that point. When one looks at the \npetroleum consumption in this country by sector, it is very easy to \nconclude what our problem is. Our problem is consumption in the \ntransportation sector. That is this top line, which is going off the \nchart.\n  What does that mean? It means the cars especially the sport utility \nvehicles, we are driving now are much less fuel efficient than they \ncould and should be. That makes no sense. We now have much better \ntechnology than we used to have. We know how to produce a car with good \npower without it consuming such enormous quantities of gasoline, and in \nfact there are some of those on the market.\n  Because of lack of attention, because of lack of commitment, because \nof lack of purpose, we in the Congress in particular, but also the \nadministration, have given too little attention to this transportation \nissue.\n  We are going to have to get serious about energy efficiency in this \ncountry if we are going to ever reduce the demand and see to it that we \ndo not become further dependent upon foreign sources of petroleum \nproducts.\n  That is not popular, I understand. We had a vote last year on whether \nor not to even allow the study of whether sports utility vehicles could \nbe considered to be cars and come under corporate fuel efficiency \nstandards. The truth is, that effort last year failed. Most Senators \nchose to look the other way and to say this was not something that was \na priority. Now we see the result.\n  I found it a little more than ironic that once gasoline prices began \nto rise this summer, our major auto manufacturers realized they could \nincrease fuel economy of sport utility vehicles and light trucks by as \nmuch as 25 percent without costing jobs or eliminating the features \nthat consumers want in those vehicles.\n  In fact, one of the companies' CEO made an announcement that they \nwere going to go ahead and do that on their own, even though nobody \nrequired it of them. We need to make sure those efficiency improvements \nshow up in the marketplace as quickly as possible, and we need to \neducate Americans on the importance of taking advantage of those \nefficiency improvements.\n  There was reference yesterday to a New York Times article suggesting \nthat Japan appears unaffected by the current high price of crude oil. I \npoint out that according to the Energy Information Administration, \nJapan has among the highest gasoline prices in the OECD, second only to \nNorway. Approximately half the price of gasoline in Japan is made up of \ntaxes, about 48 percent. American consumers are not as inured to such \nhigh prices as the Japanese. The Japanese, however, have done a much \nbetter job of increasing overall fuel economy than we have in our \ncountry.\n  Many of the provisions in this amendment which I would offer if we \nwere going to seriously consider passing legislation on energy \nsecurity--and as I said at the beginning of my statement, there is no \nserious intention on the part of the majority leader to have us \nconsider energy security before this Congress adjourns--but if we were \nto consider energy security and I were permitted to offer my amendment \nto S. 2557, it would address a broad range of technologies and \nindustries that are necessary to meet our energy needs.\n  The amendment would include a serious commitment to more efficient \nuse of energy in its many forms, as well as incentives to ensure we can \nmaintain production of our domestic resources.\n  It would address several issues. I will list six of them.\n  First, it would address the purchase of more efficient appliances, \nhomes, and commercial buildings;\n  Second, address greater use of distributed generation; that is, fuel \ncells, microturbines, combined heat and power systems and renewables;\n  Third, the purchase of hybrid and alternative fuel vehicles and \ndevelopment of the infrastructure to service those vehicles;\n  Fourth, the investment in clean coal technologies and generation of \nelectricity from biomass, including co-firing with coal.\n  Fifth, countercyclical tax incentives for production from domestic \noil and gas marginal wells. Those are extremely important in my State.\n  Finally, sixth, provisions to ensure diverse sources of electric \npower supply are developed in the United States and to continue our \ninvestment in demand-side management.\n  I notice the assistant Democratic leader is on the floor and anxious \nto proceed with other business. I conclude by saying I believe this is \nan important issue. I hope very much that the majority leader and the \nRepublican majority in the Congress will work with us to pass a \nbipartisan energy package before we conclude this session.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the full text of the amendment \nthat I would offer be printed in the Record immediately following my \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Amendments \nSubmitted.''\n\n[[Page S9352]]\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                         A Question of Balance\n\n       With OPEC's third ministerial meeting of the year scheduled \n     to begin on 10 September, followed by a Heads of State \n     gathering later in the month, the usual questions are being \n     asked: whether, when and by how much should or will producers \n     increase production? In a complicated market, most analysts \n     expect OPEC to boost production. If OPEC goes with a modest \n     increase, it would simply endorse what has already happened: \n     August crude supply from OPEC (excluding Iraq) exceeded the 1 \n     July target by 435 kb/d. Whatever the outcome, producers will \n     likely take it upon themselves to increase production in \n     excess of formal targets.\n       Continuing high prices and extreme market volatility \n     indicate that the market is fundamentally unbalanced. Stocks \n     are stubbornly low even as economic activity has been \n     strengthening globally. Low stocks are in large measure the \n     result of 18 months of production restraint by producers in \n     an effort to achieve price recovery on the heels of extremely \n     low prices in 1998 and early 1999. At the margin, production \n     restraint works, but it is an imprecise instrument. It can \n     have profound and unforeseen side effects, including market \n     instability and the distortion of economic behaviour.\n       The Labour Day weekend signals the end of the peak summer \n     driving season in the US and Canada. Given earlier historic \n     low gasoline inventories, North American refiners had been \n     running flat out just to meet demand. Even when some \n     additional OPEC crude did become available to the market it \n     was for the most part sour and of a heavy grade, something \n     the market could not fully digest in large quantities. \n     Consequently, sweet-sour differentials widened and there was \n     a build of sour crude stocks at the same time refiners were \n     clamouring for more oil.\n\n                                              OPEC Crude Production\n                                            [Million barrels per day]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                          1 July     August                Sustainable\n                                                           2000       2000     Production   production    Spare\n                                                          targets  production   v targets    capacity   capacity\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlgeria................................................      0.81       0.83        0.02         0.90       0.07\nIndonesia..............................................      1.32       1.31       -0.01         1.35       0.05\nIran...................................................      3.73       3.67       -0.06         3.73       0.06\nKuwait.................................................      2.04       2.14        0.10         2.40       0.26\nLibya..................................................      1.36       1.43        0.07         1.45       0.02\nNigeria................................................      2.09       2.01       -0.09         2.20       0.20\nQatar..................................................      0.66       0.70        0.04         0.75       0.05\nSaudi Arabia...........................................      8.25       8.55        0.30        10.50       1.95\nUAE....................................................      2.22       2.28        0.07         2.40       0.12\nVenezuela..............................................      2.93       2.92       -0.01         2.95       0.03\nSubtotal...............................................     25.40      25.84        0.44        28.63       2.79\nIraq...................................................  ........       2.95   ..........        3.00       0.05\n  Total................................................  ........      28.79   ..........       31.63       2.84\nMemo Item: Mexico crude................................  ........   \\1\\ 3.10   ..........        3.40       0.30\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Estimated.\n\n       Even as aggregate stocks rise, albeit from low levels, \n     severe imbalances remain in product markets. By maximising \n     gasoline yields, refiners unavoidably have contributed to a \n     secondary problem. Distillate stocks in the Atlantic Basin \n     are extremely low heading into the peak winter heating \n     season. The market is too fragile. It needs higher \n     inventories to protect against circumstances such as an \n     abnormally cold winter. Without adequate stock coverage, the \n     market lumbers from one problem to another, creating \n     instability in its wake, dragging prices ever higher.\n       Fortunately, surplus crude oil production and refining \n     capacity is available around the world which, if mobilised \n     quickly, can begin to address these market imbalances. \n     Incremental feedstock is rich in distillates, something that \n     is in high demand for heating-mode operations. But stocks \n     need to build well in advance of peak seasonal demand. \n     Producers need to look beyond the present to see their way \n     through to market stability.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                         A Drop in the Barrel?\n\n       The decision to release part of our Strategic Petroleum \n     Reserve has been widely criticized. Even many commentators \n     with no ax to grind seem convinced that there is something \n     irresponsible about the move.\n       But they're wrong. We should be tapping our oil reserves; \n     in fact, the big mistake was not using them months ago.\n       Put it this way: Why has the Organization of Petroleum \n     Exporting Countries, derided as irrelevant only two years \n     ago, suddenly become so effective again? The answer is that \n     now, as in the oil crises of 1973-4 and 1979-80, \n     circumstances have given OPEC what amounts to a temporary \n     corner on the world oil market. Our long-run policy should be \n     to encourage production and discourage consumption, so this \n     doesn't happen again. But in the meantime we should try to \n     prevent OPEC from taking full advantage of that corner. \n     Releasing oil reserves to set a cap on prices--and making it \n     clear that we are prepared to release more--will do exactly \n     that.\n       Successful attempts to corner markets are rare, but they \n     happen. A Jappense company managed to corner the entire world \n     copper market in the mid-1990's (through it lost it all by \n     overplaying its hand). The standard procedure is to \n     surreptitiously buy up a large part of the supply of your \n     chosen commodity, then pull some of that supply off the \n     market, causing prices to soar for the rest. In effect, the \n     market manipulator creates a temporary monopoly position for \n     himself--the market corner--and exploits that temporary \n     monopoly by selling some but not all of his stockpile at very \n     high prices.\n       OPEC did not follow the classic procedure, but events have \n     produced much the same result. Very low oil prices a few \n     years ago discouraged independent producers; oil exploration \n     fell off sharply. Then demand for oil surged as Asia \n     recovered from its financial crisis and Americans bought ever \n     more S.U.V.'s The result is that for the time being, even \n     with non-OPEC production at maximum, a few major exporting \n     nations know that they have enormous market power. By \n     producing a few hundred thousand barrels a day less than they \n     could, they can drive prices on the oil they do produce to \n     levels not seen in many years.\n       This situation won't last indefinitely. As long as we don't \n     do something foolish like encourage consumption by cutting \n     taxes on gasoline, new supplies of oil, together with falling \n     demand in response to high prices, will eventually eliminate \n     that market power. Until then the oil exporters have us, yes, \n     over a barrel, and are exploiting their temporary advantage \n     with gusto.\n       But if withholding a few hundred thousands barrels a day \n     from the market can drive prices sky-high, putting a similar \n     amount back in can bring them back down to earth--as \n     demonstrated by the sharp drop in oil prices that followed \n     the announcement of plans to tap U.S. strategic reserves. And \n     Western governments have more than a billion barrels in \n     reserve. Why not use those reserves to break the market \n     corner, or at least to limit its effectiveness?\n       Some warn that if we supply more oil, OPEC will supply \n     less. Indeed, yesterday Libya's oil minister made that threat \n     explicit. But the logic of the situation suggests that this \n     threat isn't credible. Oil producers know that they are \n     getting higher prices for their oil now than they will in a \n     year or two; the only reason they are not putting as much as \n     they can is that they believe that holding back will keep \n     prices high. But if they know that attempts to drive up \n     prices by restricting production will be offset by increased \n     release from Western reserves, they will have less, not more, \n     reason to keep oil off the market. A credible promise \n     (threat?) to use our petroleum reserves to prevent prices \n     from going too high might well actually persuade OPEC to \n     produce more than it otherwise would.\n       Remember that we're not talking about fundamental market \n     forces here. This market is already being manipulated by a \n     handful of exporting-nation governments--so why shouldn't the \n     importing-nation governments also enter the game? We have a \n     lot of influence over this market, if we choose to use it. \n     And it would be not just a shame, but positively shameful, if \n     we allow ourselves to be deterred from acting in our own \n     interest because we're afraid to annoy the oil cartel.\n\n                               Exhibit 3\n\n          (From the Economist October 12, 1996, U.S. Edition)\n\n       A case of unrefined behaviour From Texas to Thailand, oil \n     refining is a consistently miserable business. It will stay \n     that way as long as pride is more important than profits.\n       This week three oil companies--Shell Oil, the American arm \n     of Royal Dutch/Shell; Texaco, an American firm; and Star \n     Enterprise, a joint venture between Texaco and Saudi Aramco, \n     the state-run Saudi Arabian giant--announced they were \n     discussing a possible merger of their American refining and \n     marketing operations. That would mean pooling $10 billion-\n     worth of assets and creating America's biggest oil retailer, \n     with a market share of 15 percent. Earlier this year, British \n     Petroleum, BP, and America's Mobil, two other oil giants, \n     announced a $5 billion deal to merge their downstream \n     businesses in Europe.\n       Both mergers are the sign of an industry in trouble. Until \n     a decade or so ago, the oil business barely treated refining \n     as an industry in its own right; it was simply the necessary \n     process by which crude oil was adapted for an ever-growing \n     market once the hard, glamorous job of wrenching the stuff \n     out of the ground had been completed. Now that oil firms \n     treat their downstream businesses as profit centres, they \n     have discovered that they are often nothing of the sort.\n       The world's biggest oil firms have recently been making a \n     much higher return from their upstream investments than from \n     their downstream (one chart on next page). In most parts of \n     the world there are simply too many refineries. In Europe and \n     the United States, too few firms are willing to shut them \n     down; and in Asia, they seem to be building many more than \n     they need.\n       Demand for oil in North America and Western Europe is \n     sluggish. According to the International Energy Agency, it \n     was only 1 percent higher in 1995 than in 1993. Yet both \n     regions are plagued with over-capacity. In 1990-95 the \n     capacity of American refiners to produce light-oil products, \n     such as gasoline, increased by an average of 1m barrels per \n     day--almost double the rate of growth\n\n[[Page S9353]]\n\n     in demand. Over the same period, the refining margin, ie, the \n     value of a basket of typical refined products less the cost \n     of crude, fell by 51 percent in real terms, to $2.53 per \n     barrel, according to Cambridge Energy Research Associates, \n     CERA, a consultancy based in Massachusetts.\n       Two other factors complicate the picture. The first is the \n     cost of having to refit plants to comply with environmental \n     rules. American refiners reckon that they will need to spend \n     $150 billion over the next 15 years to meet green \n     regulations. (Closing a refinery does not let a firm off the \n     hook: there are extremely onerous environmental regulations \n     about cleaning up old industrial sites.)\n       The other problem is that oil marketing--the other main \n     activity of the downstream business--has become ferociously \n     competitive in some countries. In Britain supermarkets have \n     snatched a quarter of the retail petrol market, much of that \n     from the big oil firms; in France hypermarkets now sell \n     around half of the country's petrol. European oil firms are \n     beginning to follow the example of their American \n     counterparts by adding convenience stores to their pumps: \n     the typical American petrol station now makes some 40 \n     percent of its profits from the sale of non-oil products, \n     such as cigarettes and beer.\n       Certainly the new downstream mergers should help firms cut \n     some costs. BP and Mobil reckon that they will save around \n     $450m a year; savings from the proposed new American merger \n     will be four times that, according to one estimate. Much of \n     these savings will come from merging and slimming head-office \n     and other administrative functions. The worry is that this is \n     too little, too late. The proposed American merger, as it is \n     currently being discussed, apparently will not involve \n     closing any refineries. And the BP-Mobil joint venture has so \n     far led to no new closure previously announced by the two \n     companies. After you. No, after you.\n       One problem is that it is in nobody's interest to move \n     first to shut down capacity. While the costs of closing a \n     refinery are paid by its owner, the benefits--in terms of \n     higher refining margins--accrue to the industry as a whole. \n     Hence every firm wants refineries to be closed, as long as \n     they are not its own. Meanwhile, according to a new report by \n     Enerfinance, a consultancy in Paris, there are still 600,000 \n     barrels per day of excess refining capacity in Western Europe \n     (although some oil companies reckon the surplus is double \n     that).\n       Frustrated in Europe and America, many western refiners \n     have been looking to Asia, where car ownership and \n     electricity consumption are growing fast. Demand for oil \n     products in the region is expected to rise by over 4 percent \n     a year between 1995 and 2010, according to Chem Systems, a \n     London consultancy. On some estimates, $140 billion of new \n     investment in refining will be required to meet this demand.\n       Yet, strangely, the refining business is proving dismal in \n     Asia too. Refining margins have drifted lower since the start \n     of the 1990s. In September, for example, the average \n     Singapore refining margin--a benchmark--had sunk to $2.98 per \n     barrel, compared with a 1992-93 average of over $5 per \n     barrel, according to CERA. One big oil company reckons many \n     refineries in the region are now barely covering their \n     running costs, let alone their huge capital investment (a \n     typical new refinery costs around $1.5 billion).\n       The problem is that over the past year refinery capacity in \n     Asia has grown even faster than demand for oil products. \n     Consumption in the region has been hit both by a recession in \n     Japan, and by an attempt by the Chinese government to \n     restrict imports of oil products into the country. But the \n     excess capacity is also due to a swathe of new refineries \n     that are being built.\n       In Thailand two new refineries have recently come on \n     stream. Both are joint ventures with PTT, the state-run oil \n     company--one involving Royal Dutch/-Shell, the other \n     involving Caltex, which is jointly owned by Texaco and \n     Chevron, two giant American oil firms. Many South Koreans \n     meanwhile are expanding the capacity of their existing \n     plants. According to Petroleum Argus, an industry newsletter, \n     new investment in South Korea, Thailand and India alone is \n     expected to boost Asia's capacity this year by around 6 \n     percent, to 17.5m barrels per day (last year, demand \n     across the Asia-Pacific region as a whole rose by 4.5 \n     percent).\n       Many refiners say that this is a short-term problem. They \n     argue that low margins will now deter new investment, that \n     demand will eventually outpace capacity, and that margins \n     will thus widen again. Many other capital-intensive \n     industries suffer from a similar boom-bust cycle.\n       Maybe. But many of those companies building refineries are \n     doing so for reasons other than a calculation that they will \n     make money. Politics often interferes. Middle East countries, \n     for instance, are keen to ensure a secure outlet for their \n     crude oil for decades to come. For this reason, their firms \n     sometimes seem willing to tolerate lower returns than western \n     oil Saudi Aramco has bought a stake both in Petron, a \n     Philippine oil-refining and marketing firm, and in Ssang-yong \n     Oil, a South Korean refiner. The state oil companies of \n     Kuwait, Oman and Abu Dhabi are now talking about building new \n     refineries in a number of Asian countries, including \n     Pakistan, Thailand and India.\n       Asian governments and oil firms also have their own reasons \n     for increasing domestic refining capacity. The governments \n     see it as a way to reduce their dependence on imported oil \n     products. Pakistan has recently tried to tempt investors to \n     build new refineries by offering them a guaranteed 25 percent \n     annual rate of return. The companies see building refineries \n     as a way to turn themselves into more international \n     businesses. The big South Korean refiners have expanded their \n     capacity partly in the hope of exporting greater volumes to \n     China.\n       With so many people eager to build more refineries in Asia, \n     there may be no significant improvement in refining margins \n     over the next few years, predicts Dennis Eklof of CERA. In \n     Asia everyone is rushing to build at once; in Europe and \n     America nobody wants to shut a refinery. Either way, the \n     collective ambition of individual refiners thwarts the \n     interests of the industry as a whole; and either way, oil \n     refiners behave remarkably like lemmings.\n\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. On behalf of the minority, we have approximately 90 minutes \nleft; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Rhode \nIsland, and yield Senator Kennedy 40 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized \nfor 15 minutes.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I had the opportunity to speak prior to \nSenator Bingaman about the issues pending before us with respect to \nimmigration, and, in particular, with regard to the Liberian community \nin the United States--10,000 individuals who are facing immediate \ndeportation unless the President extends DED, which is the acronym for \ndeferred enforced departure. I certainly would urge the President to do \nthat.\n  As a result of our inability to bring this measure to the floor over \nthe last several months, there is very little option for these people \nexcept for the Presidential issuance of a DED proclamation. I would \nurge him to do that.\n  But that does not solve the problem. That would essentially give the \nLiberians in the United States another year. But still their life would \nbe tenuous. They would be unsure of whether or not they could stay \nthrough the next year.\n  As a result, I believe what we must do is come to grips with the \nunderlying issue, and allow these individuals to adjust to permanent \nstatus in the United States and, hopefully, become citizens of this \ncountry. We have to do that, I think, because each year the equity and \nthe logic of allowing them to become permanent citizens becomes more \ncompelling.\n  It has been 10 years now since many of them came to this country. In \nanother year it will be 11. At some point, simple justice requires that \nthey be allowed to make an adjustment to permanent status and become \ncitizens of this country.\n  It is important to recognize how the Liberian community got to this \nparticular juncture. In 1991, in that era of\n\n[[Page S9354]]\n\nviolent civil war in Liberia, the Attorney General granted temporary \nprotected status, recognizing that the chaos in Liberia was so great \nthat, in good conscience, we could not force these people to return to \nLiberia. That TPS status was extended year after year after year, until \nvery recently when it was determined that the conditions in Liberia \nmomentarily had stabilized.\n  But the President, recognizing that what appeared to be a formal \ndemocratic government process in Liberia was, in effect, covering up \ngreat confusion, great chaos, great turmoil in the country, and did not \nrequire the deportation of these individuals but invoked DED.\n  I have heard on the floor suggestions that our proposal with respect \nto Liberia and, indeed with respect to other immigrant groups, is some \nnovel, unique, first-time attempt to upset the ``majesty'' of our \nimmigration laws; when, in fact, periodically in the United States we \nhave recognized that people have come here with temporary documentation \nbut now have stayed long enough, have contributed to our communities, \nand, in doing so, deserve the opportunity to become permanent residents \nand citizens.\n  In 1988, Congress passed a law allowing four national groups that had \nbeen allowed to stay in the U.S. at the Attorney General's discretion \nto adjust to permanent resident status: 4,996 Poles who had been here \nfor 3 years; 378 Ugandans who had been here for 10 years; 565 Afghanis \nwho had been here for 8 years; and about 1,200 Ethiopians who had been \nhere for 11 years. So this process of recognizing the reality of the \ncontribution of people who come here intending initially to stay \ntemporarily is nothing new.\n  The 102d Congress passed a law allowing Chinese nationals who had \nbeen granted DED--they were in the same position as Liberians are now--\nto adjust to permanent residency after the Tiananmen Square atrocity. \nAfter the Chinese authorities brutally repressed the demonstration of \nyoung students, it was feared that to return these people to China \nwould place them in great peril--I think a well-founded fear. But over \nthe next 4 years, 52,000 Chinese changed their status.\n\n  So, again, we recognized turmoil in a country, we recognized \nindividuals are here who established themselves, and we have given them \na chance to adjust. That is simply what we are asking for with respect \nto Liberians, with respect to many Central Americans who are here.\n  In the last Congress, we passed NACARA, which recognized some of the \nneed and some of the demand to give people from Central America a \nchance to establish themselves here permanently. So what we have seen \nover the course of many years is a pattern of recognizing the need of \nparticular groups who come here without documentation or with temporary \nprotection, who establish themselves, who contribute to their \ncommunities, and who, under our law--both its letter and its spirit--\ndeserve a chance to adjust their status.\n  That is at the heart of what we are attempting to do with these \nseveral amendments that we wanted to originally propose to the H-1B \nvisa bill. I think it is an appropriate vehicle. After all, we are all \nsupportive of the need of high-tech industry for workers. I think we \ncan equally be supportive of those people who are working today, not \nonly in high tech but in a host of enterprises throughout this country, \nwho face deportation, who face being returned to their homeland. They \nare already contributing to our country, yet we have not been able to \nbring such measures to the floor for the kind of up-and-down vote that \ntheir situation demands. I hope we can at some point.\n  It is very critical to the Liberians. It is critical to many other \npeople. The criticality for Liberians turns, I think, on the conditions \nin their own homeland. We have a situation where there was an election. \nIt was monitored by international authorities. In form it looked \ndemocratic, but in substance it has not resulted in a democratic regime \nthat is protective of the rights of individuals.\n  There are numerous examples of human rights abuses that persist today \nin Liberia. Last year, for example, human rights organizations \nestimated that approximately 100 individuals were victims of \nextrajudicial killings, but yet there have been no convictions of \nanyone involved in these killings.\n  I had an individual visit me in my office in Rhode Island who had \njust returned from Liberia. He went back there. He is trying to promote \ncommerce and industry between the two countries of the United States \nand Liberia. And he is associated with a political party that is out of \nfavor at the moment over there.\n  He was traveling with one of their principal politicians. He was in a \ncar, leaving a particular village, and they were warned to go the other \nway because an ambush had been set up to either kidnap them or kill \nthem. They avoided that situation by a few moments and the intercession \nof someone who gave them advice to go the other way. I am told this is \nvery common in Liberia.\n  We have also seen eyewitness accounts of incidents in villages. Last \nyear a village was surrounded by Government security forces. All the \nmen were taken away. Their fate is yet to be determined.\n  In 1999, the State Department issued a report, their country report, \nwhich stated that Government security forces, sometimes torture, beat, \nand otherwise abuse and humiliate citizens. Victims reported being held \nin water-filled holes in the ground, being injured when fires were \nkindled on grates over their heads, suffering beatings, and sexual \nabuse. All of this is attributed to Government security forces.\n  President Taylor has stated that these reports of human rights abuses \nare simply the results of these human rights organizations trying to \ninterfere with his country. I think that could not be further from the \ntruth.\n  There is a pattern. There is evidence. There is persistent evidence \nof these types of abuses.\n  In 1999, Government security personnel were involved in the looting \nof 1,450 tons of food intended for Sierra Leone refugees. And they \nstole vehicles belonging to nongovernmental organizations that were \nsent to Liberia to help refugees in Sierra Leone.\n  Prison conditions are harsh in the country. There are reports of \ntorture, of detainees being held without charges. Government security \nforces continue to harass and threaten political opposition figures.\n  Freedom of the press is not a reality. The press is repressed rather \nthan encouraged.\n  We find a situation that is consistent throughout the country with \nthese types of human rights abuses, so much so that our State \nDepartment has suggested and advised Americans not to travel to \nLiberia.\n  So we are on the verge of a decision, I hope, by the White House to \nextend deferred enforced departure, a decision that is entirely \nappropriate but insufficient to deal with the underlying issues. The \nunderlying issues involve 10,000 Liberians who have come to this \ncountry, who have been offered sanctuary--we must applaud the \ngenerosity of spirit that motivated the offer of temporary protected \nstatus--have established themselves, and now wait with uncertainty and \ndoubt about their future.\n  Simply to extend this uncertainty and this doubt year by year by year \nis cruel but also fails to recognize that they have become so much a \npart of our communities in such a constructive way. I mentioned before \nan individual who has a master's degree, who is now managing a CVS \nstore in Massachusetts, who owns his home. He is somebody who is \ncontributing to our economy today. He is someone who is here making our \neconomy work for us. Yet he faces the prospect of being denied the \nability to work, come Friday, and being potentially deported back to a \ncountry which is unwilling in many respects to accept him back.\n  For many reasons, we have to be supportive of this effort to bring \nthis legislation to the floor. What is so frustrating is that for many \nmonths now, working in the way I believe the Senate works, making the \ncase to my colleagues, getting the support across the aisle of several \ncolleagues for bipartisan legislation, of working for the kind of \nsupport that would be necessary to pass this legislation, but \nultimately being frustrated because it became quite clear there was no \nreal intent to give this community, to give this legislation a vote, up \nor down, on the floor. That is the wrong way to use the process.\n\n[[Page S9355]]\n\n  I don't think anyone here should be afraid of taking a vote on this \nparticular measure. One could disagree with the policy. One could \ndisagree with the principle, articulate those differences and then \nvote. What we find, time after time after time, is that type of \nprincipled, rational, careful legislative debate and decision is \nfrustrated by the decision that we can only recognize one immigration \nissue, and that is ensuring that high-technology companies have \nsufficient workers. We can't recognize the many other immigration \nissues, the many other individuals who cry out for simple justice and \ncry out for the chance to be good Americans, to be recognized as such, \nto have the chance to change their status to permanent residents and, \nwe hope, ultimately to become citizens of this great country.\n  We can do better. I don't think we have to limit our vision and our \nefforts and our activities simply to keep our economy moving forward. I \nthink we can recognize something else, to ensure that we are fair and \njust in our dealings with thousands of people who come to this country \nand, by the way, who contribute significantly to our economy.\n  I hope we can do both. I hope in the next few days we can resolve \nthis impasse and we can get a vote, and we can pass this measure with \nrespect to the Liberians but also with respect to Latinos and other \ngroups who have been here and continue to be part of our great country \nand want their contribution recognized with the opportunity to become \ncitizens of this country.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By previous order of the Senate, the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts is recognized for up to 40 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague, Senator \nReed, for his presentation and strong support. I've had the good \nopportunity, since I first came to the Judiciary Committee, to be on \nthe Subcommittee on Immigration. We have provided temporary protected \nstatus for probably 14 different nations over the past years. And we've \nalso provided the green cards for six of those countries, more than \nhalf of those countries. What the good Senator has been pressing the \nSenate on is to take action--that would be consistent with past \naction--particularly with the guns of war that continue to wreak such \nhavoc in Liberia. I think it is a very compelling case. I am in strong \nsupport.\n  Mr. President, for months, Democrats and Republicans have given their \nstrong support for the H-1B high-tech visa legislation. In addition, \nDemocrats have tried--but without Republican support--to offer the \nLatino and Immigrant Fairness Act.\n  We have worked hard to reach an agreement to vote on both of these \nimportant bills. We could easily have voted on the Latino legislation \nas part of the high-tech visa bill, but our Republican colleagues have \nrepeatedly blocked every effort we have made to do so. The Republican \nleadership is determined to prevent this basic issue from coming to a \nvote in the Senate.\n  Our Republican friends tell us that the Latino and Immigrant Fairness \nAct is a poison pill, that it will undermine the H-1B high-tech visa \nlegislation before the Senate. But if Republicans are truly supportive \nof the Latino legislative agenda, that cannot possibly be true.\n  Yesterday, Senator Gramm accused Democrats of ``putting politics in \nfront of people.'' Is Senator Gramm prepared to say that to those who \nwould benefit from the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act, people such \nas Francisco?\n  Francisco and his wife completed applications for legalization and \nattempted to submit them to the INS. The INS refused to accept the \napplications, because Francisco and his wife briefly left the United \nStates during the application period without INS permission. The courts \nhave ruled against this INS practice, but Francisco and his wife were \nnever granted legalization. They have worked legally with temporary \npermission while awaiting the court decision on their case.\n  If they are not permitted to work legally in the United States, they \nwill not be able to support their three U.S. citizen children. With \npermission to work, they have been able to find jobs that accommodate a \nhearing disability that affects one of their children. If they lose \ntheir work permit, they may not be able to find work. They constantly \nfear detention and deportation.\n  It is shameful that the Senate refuses even to allow a vote on these \nissues of fundamental fairness for immigrant families. It is \nRepublicans--not Democrats--who are playing politics with the lives of \nthose who have come to our country as refugees from persecution in \nother countries. The hypocrisy is flagrant. Our Republican colleagues \npretend to court the Latino vote across the country in this election \nyear. But when the chips are down, they refuse to act.\n  The Senate Republican leadership can't have it both ways. Either they \nare part of the solution, or they are part of the problem. They can't \ncall themselves friends of the Latino community, while working to \nprevent the Latino Fairness Act from becoming law.\n  Republican opposition to this legislation is so intense that they \ncontinue to delay passage of the H-1B legislation with their procedural \ntactics. For reasons that no one understands, the Republican leadership \nfiled a meaningless cloture petition last week, and now they have filed \nthree additional cloture petitions. I ask my Republican colleagues, \nwouldn't it be easier to allow a vote on the Latino and Immigrant \nFairness Act? If you support the Latino community, if the priorities of \nthe Latino community are your priorities too, we can pass both bills \nand move forward.\n  The choice is clear. Instead of adopting long overdue family \nimmigration reforms that have broad support from the business, \nreligious, and labor communities, Republicans would prefer to stall \naction on the high tech visa bill and block a vote on the Latino \nFairness Act. I urge my Republican colleagues to end this shameful \nhypocrisy and allow the vote that simple justice and fundamental \nfairness demand.\n  But these procedural road blocks won't stop those who support this \nlegislation. After all, the immigrant community--particularly the \nLatino community--has waited far too long for the fundamental justice \nthat the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act will provide. These issues \nare not new to Congress. The immigrants who will benefit from this \nlegislation should have received permanent status from the INS long \nago.\n  Contrary to remarks made on the Senate floor earlier today, these \nissues have been around for a long, long time. If my friend, the \nchairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, wanted to have a hearing, \nhe could have scheduled a hearing at any time over the past 3 years. \nAnd if we had had such a hearing, it would have demonstrated that this \nlegislation is not what he described as a ``broad amnesty for illegal \nimmigrants.'' It is a measured bill necessary to reunite families and \nensure that American businesses have the workers they need. He would \nhave learned that contrary to Republican concerns that this bill would \n``let everybody in,'' the legislation only seeks to create fairness \nwhere there is injustice and restore longstanding immigration policy \nobjectives, and is similar to actions Congress has taken often in the \npast.\n\n  The Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act includes parity for Central \nAmericans, Haitians, nationals of the former Soviet bloc, and \nLiberians. In 1997, Congress enacted the Nicaraguan Adjustment and \nCentral American Relief Act, which granted permanent residence to \nNicaraguans and Cubans who had fled their repressive governments.\n  Other similarly situated Central Americans, Soviet bloc nationals, \nand Haitians were only provided an opportunity to apply for green cards \nunder a much more difficult and narrower standard and much more \ncumbersome procedures. Hondurans and Liberians received nothing.\n  The Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act will eliminate the disparities \nfor all of these asylum seekers, and give them all the same opportunity \nthat Nicaraguans and Cubans now have to become permanent residents. It \nwill create a fair, uniform set of procedures for all immigrants from \nthis region who have been in this country since 1995.\n  The Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act will also provide long overdue \nrelief to all immigrants who, because of\n\n[[Page S9356]]\n\nbureaucratic mistakes, were prevented from receiving green cards many \nyears ago. In 1986, Congress passed the Immigration Reform and Control \nAct, which included legalization for persons who could demonstrate that \nthey had been present in the United States since before 1982. There was \na one-year period to file.\n  However, the INS misinterpreted the provisions in the 1986 Act, and \nthousands of otherwise qualified immigrants were denied the opportunity \nto make timely applications.\n  Several successful class action lawsuits were filed on behalf of \nindividuals who were harmed by these INS misinterpretations of the law, \nand the courts required the INS to accept filings for these \nindividuals. As one court decision stated: ``The evidence is clear that \nthe INS' . . . regulations deterred many aliens who would otherwise \nqualify for legalization from applying.''\n  To add insult to injury, however, the 1996 immigration law stripped \nthe courts of jurisdiction to review INS decisions, and the Attorney \nGeneral ruled that the law superceded the court cases. As a result of \nthese actions, this group of immigrants has been in legal limbo, \nfighting government bureaucracy for over 14 years.\n  Our bill will alleviate this problem by allowing all individuals who \nhave resided in the U.S. prior to 1986 to obtain permanent residency, \nincluding those who were denied legalization because of the INS \nmisinterpretation, or who were turned away by the INS before applying. \nOur bill would also amend some of the procedural blocks in terms of \nnormalizing one's green card situation.\n  The nation's history has long been tainted with periods of anti-\nimmigrant sentiment. The Naturalization Act of 1790 prevented Asian \nimmigrants from attaining citizenship. The Chinese Exclusion Act of \n1882 was passed to reduce the number of Chinese laborers. The Asian \nExclusion Act and the National Origins Act which made up the \nImmigration Act of 1924, were passed to block immigration from the \n``Asian Pacific Triangle''--Japan, China, the Philippines, Laos, \nThailand, Cambodia, Singapore, Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia, Burma, India, \nSri Lanka, and Malaysia--and prevent them from entering the United \nStates for permanent residence. Those discriminatory provisions weren't \nrepealed until 1965. The Mexican Farm Labor Supply Program--the Bracero \nProgram--provided Mexican labor to the United States under harsh and \nunacceptable conditions and wasn't repealed until 1964.\n  The Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act provides us with an opportunity \nto end a series of unjust provisions in our current immigration laws, \nand build on the most noble aspects of our American immigrant \ntradition.\n  It restores fairness to the immigrant community and fairness in the \nnation's immigration laws. It is good for families, it is good for \nAmerican business, and it is good for our economy.\n  Last summer, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said,\n\n       Under the conditions that we now confront, we should be \n     very carefully focused on the contribution which skilled \n     people from abroad, [as well as] unskilled people from \n     abroad, can contribute to the country, as they have for \n     generation after generation. The pool of people seeking jobs \n     continues to decline. At some point, it must have an impact. \n     If we can open up our immigration rolls significantly, that \n     clearly will make [the unemployment rate's effect on \n     inflation] less and less of a problem.\n\n  The Essential Worker Immigration Coalition, a consortium of \nbusinesses and trade associations and other organizations shares this \nview and strongly supports the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act. This \ncoalition includes the health care and home care associations, hotel, \nmotel, restaurant and tourism associations, manufacturing and retail \nconcerns, and the construction and transportation industries.\n  These key industries have added their voices to the broad coalition \nof business, labor, religious, Latino and other immigrant organizations \nin support of the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act.\n  The coalition of supporters includes Americans for Tax Reform, \nEmpower America, the AFL-CIO, the Mexican American Legal Defense and \nEducational Fund, the National Council of La Raza, the League of United \nLatin American Citizens, the National Association of Latino Elected and \nAppointed Officials, the Anti-Defamation League, the National \nConference of Catholic Bishops, the Union of Needletrades and \nIndustrial Textile Employees, and the Service Employees International \nUnion.\n  Few days remain in this Congress, but my Democratic colleagues and I \nare committed to doing all we can to see that both the Latino and \nImmigrant Fairness Act and the H-1B high tech visa legislation become \nlaw this year.\n  As others have pointed out, we have been discussing this issue now \nfor several days. There is, as the indication of the votes suggest, \noverwhelming support for H-1B. There is virtual unanimity in the Senate \nto pass the H-1B program. I was very hopeful that we would be able to \noffer an amendment with a training component that would be available to \nAmericans, so that the American worker would be able to obtain the \nlevel of skills which these new immigrants are bringing here to the \njobs in the United States.\n  The average income for the H-1B worker is $47,000; it is not \n$150,000. Really, all that is necessary for Americans to fill the \noverwhelming majority of these jobs is training and skills. There is a \nsmall percentage of very highly skilled and talented individuals in the \nH-1B program who add an additional dimension in terms of our economy. \nBut the great majority--the average, as I mentioned--is $47,000.\n  We only require a $500 application fee now. An immigrant family has \nto pay $1,000 to get a green card to cover the processing. If we were \nto require a $2,000 fee for the Microsofts, the multibillion-dollar \ncompanies, for every H-1B application they have, we would have a fund \nof about $280 million a year. That fund would be allocated between the \nNational Science Foundation and the existing workforce boards, under \nthe bipartisan workforce legislation that we passed 2 years ago. It \nwould be allocated on the basis of competition to these communities \nthat develop training programs for high skills. That would include the \nemployers, the workers, and the educational institutions. It would give \nthem some continued resources to be able to provide the skills to \nAmericans to meet this particular challenge.\n  We don't have a crisis in terms of workers; we only have a crisis in \nterms of skills. So we ought to be able to develop the kind of support \nso that out into the future these jobs will be fulfilled by Americans. \nBut we are not able to offer that amendment under the cloture motion, \neven though it is directly relevant and even though we offered and \ndebated those in the conference and even though it seems to me to be \ndirectly on target with regard to the underlying amendment. We ought to \nbe able to do that.\n  I don't know what the problem is among those on the other side in \nrefusing to permit us to develop a program so these jobs can be \nfulfilled by Americans. That seems to me to make sense. Good jobs, good \nbenefits--why shouldn't they be for Americans? The only thing that is \nlacking is the skilled training. Is it asking too much to ask the \nMicrosofts and the great successful IT businesses for a $2,000 \napplication fee for the H-1Bs? I don't think so.\n  We can develop that fund and develop the training program--not create \na new bureaucracy--and use the existing training programs with \nadditional funding that would be targeted for that purpose, and also \nsupport additional funding for the National Science Foundation, for \noutreach programs, for women and minorities in these high-tech areas to \nsupport those kinds of efforts because there is an enormous absence of \nwomen and minorities in the area of these H-1B jobs.\n  There is no reason in the world that we should not have an outreach \nprogram. There are excellent programs in terms of developing interest, \nand programming in terms of women and minorities in the high-tech area. \nThey need additional support. We can use some resources to expedite the \nprocessing of the H-1B visas.\n  Massachusetts yields to no one in terms of the high-tech aspects of \nour industry. We are second to California in the small business \ninnovative research programs. Half of all health patents created in \nthis country are in my own State of Massachusetts. We get high awards \nin terms of peer review for research. But when I talk to either the \nprivate sector or talk to others, they\n\n[[Page S9357]]\n\nsay: Right on. They don't question the importance of getting additional \nskilled workers.\n  It is difficult to understand the reluctance and the resistance for \nthis. It is true that 30 years ago if someone worked, for example, in \nmy State in the Four Rivers Shipyard, their grandfather worked there, \ntheir father worked there, they generally had a high school education. \nEvery employee who enters the job force now is going to have eight \ndifferent jobs. What it means in terms of the continued growth of that \nemployee is that there is going to be continuing education and training \nprograms that are going to be available to them. That is just obvious. \nIf we don't understand that, we don't understand what is happening in \nterms of the needs of American highly competitive, high-tech industries \nin this Nation, and for the most part other industries as well.\n  We are denied the opportunity to offer that amendment. We would be \nglad to enter into a time limitation. We are denied that opportunity. \nWe are denied the opportunity in terms of the Latino fairness, even \nthough, as I have mentioned, we have a court decision that found for \nthese particular individuals. But for the actions of the Immigration \nand Naturalization Service, they would have had their position adjusted \nand would have had a green card. It was certainly the intention of \nCongress at that time that they should. We are trying to remedy that \nsituation. We are denied that opportunity.\n  We are denied the opportunity to give fairness to the other Central \nAmericans and others who were given the assurance that it was just a \nmatter that we were being rushed at the end of the last Congress and we \nwere unable to get the clearance for these other Central Americans. We \nwere denied that opportunity. We had the judgment for the Cubans and \nNicaraguans but not for the Guatemalans, Haitians, Hondurans, and \nEastern Europeans. They were given assurance that they would. \nRepublicans and Democrats alike indicated that we are prepared to vote \non that with a short time limit. But we are denied that opportunity as \nwell.\n  We find ourselves in this extraordinary situation with all of the \nmachinations on the other side to prohibit us from having a vote. Maybe \nthey have the votes. They probably do, although I somehow feel that if \nwe were to get to this fairness in the light of day, it would be \ndifficult to argue against it. It would be difficult to argue against \nwhy on the one hand we are increasing the immigration for high skills \nand for the high-skilled industries, and on the other hand we are \nrefusing to provide additional manpower and womanpower for many of the \nother industries with the kind of support that they have in terms of \nthe Chamber of Commerce, labor, and church groups that say they should \nbe able to get it.\n\n  If we are going to have sauce for the goose, let's have sauce for the \ngander. Beyond that, they ought to treat these individuals fairly. They \nhave been treated unfairly because of the actions that have been taken \nin denying them the kinds of protections and rights that they otherwise \nwould have received.\n  They have the compelling argument that they ought to be treated \nsimilarly as the H-1Bs; and, second, because they been denied fairness \nbecause of other actions that have been taken by the Government.\n  It is difficult as we go through this to understand why we are being \ndenied the opportunity to bring this up. It is very difficult to \nexplain to our colleagues in the Hispanic caucus, let alone to church \nleaders and other groups, why fair is not fair. That is where we are. \nThe extent to which the Republican leadership is going to deny us this \nopportunity is absolutely mind-boggling. Why not just let the chips \nfall where they may? No. We are being denied that opportunity. We are \nnot even permitted a vote on it.\n  That is becoming sort of the custom. It never used to be that way in \nthe Senate. The Senate used to be a place where you could have the \nclash of ideas, and also the opportunity to express them and get some \ndegree of accountability. But we are being denied, on Latino fairness, \nto ever get a vote.\n  We are denied the opportunity to have another vote on minimum wage.\n  We are denied the opportunity to get a vote on the prescription drug \nprogram.\n  We are denied the opportunity on Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  We are denied the opportunity on the education programs.\n  We can't get those. We can understand people voting different ways, \nand maybe voting for positions I favor and against positions that I \nsupport. That was the way it was generally done in the Senate. But we \ncannot have that opportunity.\n\n\n                           Prescription Drugs\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, earlier this week, the Republican \nleadership in the House and Senate emphasized again their attempt to \nblock needed action this year to provide prescription drug coverage \nunder Medicare.\n  Their letter to President Clinton declared any legislation to provide \nfair prescription drug benefits dead for this year. President Clinton \ndisagreed, and he was right to do it. There is still time for this \nCongress to pass a long overdue Medicare prescription drug benefit. \nHouse Democrats are for it. Senate Democrats are for it. So are many \nRepublicans. President Clinton has been fighting for it for years.\n  All that is needed to make Medicare prescription drug coverage a \nreality for this year is for the Republican leadership to finally say \nyes to senior citizens and no to the drug companies.\n  In addition to opposing Medicare prescription drug coverage --in a \nshameful example of disinformation--the Republican leaders also tried \nto blame the President for their failure to act.\n  Their letter charges the President with rejecting the recommendations \nof the commission. But the commission proposed to raise premiums for \nsenior citizens as much as 47 percent.\n  It proposed charging a copayment for home health services that could \nadd more than $3,000 a year to the out-of-pocket costs of the sickest \nand most vulnerable senior citizens.\n  It proposed restricting the eligibility for Medicare, forcing \nhundreds of thousands of senior citizens into the ranks of the \nuninsured.\n  And it proposed a new cap on Medicare spending that could push \nMedicare into bankruptcy as early as 2005.\n  In fact, the commission proposed the same anti-Medicare agenda that \nGovernor Bush has adopted. The President was right to reject it, and \nSenator Lott and Speaker Hastert are wrong to endorse it.\n  Their letter criticizes the House Democrats for walking off the House \nfloor when the House leadership refused to allow a vote on a fair \nMedicare drug benefit, and then rammed through a measure that was not \nMedicare and was not adequate. All the Speaker had to do was to allow a \nvote. Democrats wouldn't have walked out. He knew that a fair \nprescription drug benefit would have passed.\n  The GOP leadership letter also attacks the President for failing to \nendorse the Republican alternative of means-tested block grants to the \nStates to help low-income senior citizens. But it would take years for \nStates to put that alternative in effect and would leave out at least \n70 percent of senior citizens.\n  It would provide yet another excuse for inaction.\n  Mr. President, do you understand that? It would limit the benefit. \nThe block grant would be limited to persons under 175 percent of the \npoverty level, and only those persons under 135 percent of the poverty \nlevel would receive total coverage. But that leaves out 29 million \nseniors who, for the next 4 years, would not participate in the \nprescription drug program. That makes absolutely no sense.\n  Senior citizens want Medicare, not welfare. In 1965, the Nation \nrejected the idea that the only way for seniors to obtain health \nbenefits should be to go to the welfare office. Medicare was passed, \nand today it has become one of the most successful social programs ever \nenacted. That decision was right then, and it continues to be right \ntoday. We should not turn back the clock. It is not too late for \nCongress to enact prescription drug coverage under Medicare for senior \ncitizens. We know where the President stands. We know where Democrats \nin Congress stand. Most of all, we know where senior citizens and their \nfamilies stand. The Republican leadership should listen to their voices \nand end its obstruction.\n\n[[Page S9358]]\n\n                               Education\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I bring to the attention of the Senate the excellent \nrecommendations announced today of the Glenn Commission, a very \nprestigious group of academic educators from around the country, \nGovernors, and Members of Congress, who had been interested in \neducation. The presentations and discussions over the past year have \nreinforced our sense of urgency about the need for better-qualified \nmath and science teachers in the nation's classrooms.\n  The report emphasizes the need for greater investments in math and \nscience at every level--federal, state, and local. We've made \nsignificant progress in recent years, but we can't afford to be \ncomplacent. In out increasingly high-tech economy, high school graduate \nneed strong math and analytical skills in order to be competitive in \nthe workplace. Schools also face record-high enrollments that will \ncontinue to rise, and looming teacher shortages.\n  Recruiting, training, and retaining high-quality math and science \nteachers deserve a higher priority on our education agenda in Congress. \nI intend to do all I can to see that schools have the federal support \nthey deserve. The need is especially urgent in schools that serve \ndisadvantaged students.\n  Mr. President, this brings me back to where we are on the issues of \neducation. I can't turn my television on without finding Governor Bush \nin another school talking about education. I wish he would pick up the \ntelephone and call our majority leader and say, why don't you bring up \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act and have a debate on that \nlegislation.\n  If we don't get action on it, it will be the first time in 35 years \nthat we have not had debate or discussion on the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act and have not been willing to take a position on \nthis extremely important area of public policy.\n  We had 22 days of hearings in our committee on this measure. We had \nhours during markup, and we came to the floor of the Senate, and it was \nlike running into a brick wall. We had 6 days of what could be called \ndebate, although 2 days was debate only. And in this time we had 8 \nvotes. But 1 vote was a voice vote, so we only had 7 votes. And 3 of \nthose votes were virtually unanimous. So we only had 4 votes in a \ncouple of days. Compare that to 55 amendments in 16 days on the \nbankruptcy bill.\n  For those on this side, we think we should have had a much longer \nopportunity to debate this issue. I think this was the position of the \nmajority leader because he indicated in January of 1999:\n\n       Education is going to be the central issue this year . . . \n     we must reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education \n     Act.\n\n  In June of 1999:\n\n       Education is number one on the agenda for Republicans in \n     Congress this year. . . .\n\n  In May of 2000:\n\n       This is very important legislation. I hope we can debate it \n     seriously and have amendments in the education area. Let's \n     talk education.\n\n  May 2, 2000:\n\n       No, I haven't scheduled a cloture vote: But education is \n     number one in the minds of the American people all across \n     this country and every State, including my own State. For us \n     to have a good, healthy, and even a protracted debate and \n     amendments on education I think is the way to go.\n\n  July 25:\n\n       We will keep trying to find a way to go back to this \n     legislation this year and get it completed.\n\n  We heard we would have two-track action during the course of the days \non appropriations and we would deal with other issues at night. We \ncompleted the trade bill, and now we have protracted sessions without \nany kind of action.\n  We invited the majority leader to call up the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act and deal with it in the evenings because it is \nsomething the American people want. We are told, no, we will not do \nthat, because there was going to be a possible effort to include an \namendment to try to reduce the number of guns that might be going into \nthe schools of this country and we were told that safe schools were not \nrelevant to education.\n  That might be an interesting philosophical position, but yesterday in \nNew Orleans there was another school shooting. We have been following \nthe terrible tragedy and the circumstances of the two children, ages 13 \nand 15, who are in critical condition.\n  I think parents across the country want to make sure we are doing \neverything we possibly can to make our schools safe and secure. There \nare other elements in the debate, but safety is enormously important. \nIt is enormously important because we are reaching record high \nenrollments in the public school system.\n  Fifty-three million students enrolled in school this Fall. Over the \nnext 100 years, we will double that number of students, and in order to \ndeal with these increases, the Federal, State, and local governments \nshould work together and share the responsibility. This is not an issue \nwe can escape.\n  We have made significant progress in education over the last 30 \nyears. Public schools are experiencing greater success than ever \nbefore--with higher graduation rates, increased test scores, higher \nacademic standards, and greater accountability. Students have made \ngains in achievement, and are more effectively meeting the challenge of \nhigh standards.\n  More students are taking the advanced math and science classes. This \nchart indicates between 1990 and 2000, those who took precalculus rose \nfrom 31 percent up to 44 percent; 19 percent in calculus, up to 24 \npercent; 44 percent in physics, up to 49 percent.\n  The number of students taking the Scholastic Aptitude Tests has also \nincreased. 33 percent of all students were taking this test in 1980, \nand now it is 44 percent in 2000.\n  Contrary to what many have talked about, we are finding in many of \nthe urban areas that a number of the urban school systems are doing \nincreasingly better. One of those that was extremely challenged in the \nearly 1990s was Detroit, for example. These are the increase-in-\nperformance percentages from 1992 to 1998:\n  Michigan Education Assessment Program: In the district of Detroit, in \n1992, 33 percent passed; in the State, 60 percent passed. In 1998, 65 \npercent in the district of Detroit passed, which is a 97-percent \nimprovement; in the State 74 percent passed. So you are seeing not only \nis there a dramatic increase in the performance of children in this \nfourth grade on the subject of mathematics, but also the disparity \nbetween the children in a large urban area and those statewide have \ndramatically been reduced.\n  All of these indicators are rising. The fact is, also, that they are \nmodest, but they are all the positive indicators. But, our work is far \nfrom over. In spite of this promising news--the results so far are not \nenough. Now is not the time to be complacent. We cannot leave any child \nor any group behind. We have a responsibility in Congress to help all \nstudents. The nation's children, the nation's parent, and the nation's \nschools are counting on us.\n  As we are getting closer to the election, it is getting fashionable \nto use the education issue as a political issue. But I think it is \nimportant to remind our colleagues and friends about who has the \nspecial responsibility for education. The fact is, the States and the \nGovernors still have the prime responsibilities. They control \neffectively 97 cents out of every 100 cents that are spent on \neducation. When some public officials go around and try to blame people \nfor the fact that a particular area, region or community is failing in \neducation, we ought to recognize who has the responsibilities--the \nlocal communities and the States.\n  We do have some important responsibilities as well. The American \npeople expect us to fulfill those responsibilities. We are going to \ncontinue to speak about this issue and work until the end of this \nsession, to see if we cannot put education back as a priority item for \nthis Congress.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum and ask the time be charged equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I had the opportunity, earlier today, to \ntalk\n\n[[Page S9359]]\n\nabout the effort by Senator Daschle and the minority to suspend the \nrules of the Senate and to bring before this body an amnesty provision. \nIn essence, this provision would reward people who violated the laws of \nthis country by coming to the United States illegally when we have \nmillions of people waiting to come the right way, legally.\n  After I left, the minority leader, in response to what I said, asked \nif I had seen the Statue of Liberty lately. Let me assure him that not \nonly have I seen it, but that when my grandfather, who came to this \ncountry by way of Ellis Island, saw the Statue of Liberty he rejoiced \nin it. I would also like to ask the people who are for this bill, if \nthey have they seen the Supreme Court Building lately? ``Equal Justice \nUnder Law.''\n  Without law, we can't have liberty. Without law, we can't have an \norganized society. We corrupt the legal system when we have a set of \nrules that people are supposed to operate under, and then for political \nreasons in an election year, say to all of those who have abided by the \nlaw in waiting to come to America, that they are going to be treated \ndifferently than people who violated the law in coming to this country.\n\n  I have seen the Statue of Liberty and I rejoice in it. I want people \nto give us the best they have so we can build a greater country. But I \nwant people to come, as my grandfather came, as my wife's grandparents \ncame--I want them to come legally.\n  Second, the H-1B program is a temporary work program for highly \nskilled people. It is an entirely different issue than the issue before \nus, which is an effort to waive the rules of the Senate and bring \nbefore us a bill that would grant amnesty to and reward people who have \nviolated the law. I do not believe my colleagues are going to do this. \nI know our Democrat colleagues believe this is good politics and that \nthis is going to get them more votes, but I don't believe it. As I said \nbefore, I would be willing to let this election, and every other \nelection for the remaining history of this country, be determined on \nthis issue and this issue alone.\n  I do not believe it is good politics to basically say that we are \ngoing to reward people who violate the law at the expense of those who \nabide by the law.\n  Also, the idea that somehow immigrants support this bill I think is \noutrageous. I think those who have abided by the law resent the fact \nthat we routinely reward people who violate the law.\n  Finally, in 1986 we adopted an amnesty provision, and that was \nsupposed to be the final granting of amnesty. Now we are back trying to \nrenegotiate the deal. The point is, every time we grant one of these \namnesty provisions, we say to people all over the world: Violate the \nlaw, come to America illegally, and you will ultimately be rewarded for \nit.\n  I say to people all over the world: Come to America legally, and \nsecondly I say, we need to promote free enterprise to individual \nfreedom where we can take America to them. Not everybody who goes to \nbed at night praying to come to America is going to get to come. We \ncannot have the whole world in America, but we can take America to them \nby promoting the policies worldwide that have made us the greatest and \nrichest country in the history of the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The Senator from Idaho.\n\n\n                           ANGELS IN ADOPTION\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am going to use some time this afternoon \nand depart from this immediate debate to talk about an event that \noccurred last night which I and my colleague from Louisiana had the \nopportunity to cohost, along with the Freddie Mac Foundation.\n  My colleague, Senator Mary Landrieu, and I are cochairs of the \nCongressional Caucus on Adoption. Both she and I are adoptive parents \nand very proud of that fact. For the last good number of years, we have \nworked to organize our colleagues into a caucus to become sensitive to \nthe issues of adoption. We became very active in the transformation of \nthe foster care laws of our country which this Senate passed 5 years \nago that have certainly made many children safer and available to \nindividuals, couples who want to form families through adoption to \nprovide permanent loving homes for those children.\n  More importantly, the Senator and I have been active with our \ncolleagues on the House side to literally debate and move nationally \nthe whole issue of adoption, both at the State and the Federal level. \nWhy? For a very simple reason. We know, and many of my colleagues know, \nthat there are literally hundreds of thousands of children who are in \nsearch of loving adults and parents who will provide them with a home--\nnot a foster home, not a temporary home, but a permanent home. Why? \nBecause their natural parents either are no longer alive or are \ndysfunctional in a way that they cannot provide for and love these \nchildren. In many instances, they were actually harming these children \nand, as a result, we have worked in a bipartisan way to make a very \nreal difference.\n  In the course of all of our efforts, the Senator from Louisiana and I \na year ago stumbled on an idea that we thought just made all the sense \nin the world, to lift the visibility of and the general public \nawareness of adoption: That there are marvelous, beautiful young people \nwho are in search of a home.\n  We began to ask our colleagues in the Senate and the House to \nrecognize individuals who were outstanding in the area of adoption, \nwhether it was individuals, families, or couples who were adopting \nchildren, whether it was foster parents, whether it was mentors who \nwere attempting to work in the adoption of children, or volunteers with \nthe court-appointed special advocates, known as CASA, who help family \ncourts by working with children in their homes, support communities, \norganizations across the country, or just outstanding individuals who \nstand above it all, whose greatest and most direct interest is in \nhelping kids.\n  Last night, we recognized a number of people who are doing just that. \nOne hundred and twenty nominees flowed from House and Senate Members \nand from their States to be recognized. At a gathering last night at \nthe Hyatt, over 450 people, hosted by the Freddie Mac Foundation, came \ntogether to honor Angels in Adoption.\n  I now turn to my colleague, Senator Mary Landrieu, my cochair of the \nCongressional Caucus on Adoption, to speak to this issue. There is a \nlot more to be said, and I want her to have a full share of this time \nas we talk about the most important issue of providing loving, caring \nhomes for children who do not have them and who can have them if we can \nsimply help facilitate the ability of adults to adopt these children.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Idaho for \nbeing such a wonderful partner in this endeavor. He and I have quite \nenjoyed leading the Senate coalition on adoption and working with our \ncounterparts, Tom Bliley and Jim Oberstar on the House side.\n  Senator Craig is absolutely right. Last evening was a wonderful event \nwith over 450 people from all around our Nation nominated by Members of \nCongress for the outstanding work they are doing in their communities \nand States to promote the great beauty and joy of adoption, that it is \na wonderful way to be a family.\n  Before I list some of the award winners from last night, it is our \nhope--and I think Senator Craig will agree with me--that every child \nwho comes into this world is wanted, loved, and can remain with the \nfamily who brought them into the world--that would be ideal--to have \nsomeone love them and care for them.\n  For many reasons, which we do not have the time today to go into, \nfamilies disintegrate or break down and children are abandoned or left \nalone. The fact of the matter is, children cannot raise themselves. The \nother fact is, although the Government can help with policies, the \nGovernment itself cannot raise children. The children need to be raised \nby adults who are responsible and who love them.\n  Today in our country--and the Senator from Idaho knows this because \nhe speaks out regularly about it--there are 500,000 children, a half a \nmillion children--you could fill up the Superdome, which is in New \nOrleans, with\n\n[[Page S9360]]\n\nwhich a lot of people are familiar; it seats 80,000 people--you could \nfill up that Superdome many times with the number of children who have \nbeen taken from their homes because of abuse, neglect, or other very \ndifficult situations. About 130,000 of those 500,000 are right now \nready for adoption.\n  We believe there are no unwanted children, just unfound families. \nThat is what our coalition is about: To promote the concept of \nreunification, obviously, when possible, but, if not, to move these \nchildren into loving homes.\n  We want to focus our attention on the children in the United States \nwho need our help, but also there are children all around the world. \nThere are literally too many to count. Millions and millions of \nchildren are being raised by themselves on the streets or are in \ninstitutions or are languishing in foster care. We want to correct \nthat.\n  Last night, we nominated for our national Angels award Congressman \nTom Bliley, who is retiring this year, the wonderful Congressman from \nVirginia.\n  In his many years in Congress, he promoted tax credits for adoption, \nadoption awareness, family leave for adoptive parents, the formation of \nthe National Adoption Information Center, foster care incentive \npayments, and aid to orphans and displaced children, which is one of \nthe most recent things Tom Bliley has promoted.\n  I say to Senator Craig, since you introduced Gale and Larry Cole, why \ndon't you say a word on the record about this particularly wonderful \nfamily--Lynette Cole, Miss USA, and her parents.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, last night, as we were recognizing these \nnational Angels in Adoption, I had the privilege of introducing Lynette \nCole and her parents, Gale and Larry.\n  Lynette is a beautiful young lady whom we have come to know as Miss \nUSA. She is a young lady of color, and her parents are not of color, \nthey are Caucasian. Yet the marvelous chemistry of the family said they \nwere made for each other. They came together, both she and her brother, \nto be adopted by Larry and Gale Cole and to be raised by them. Never \nprouder parents did you see than last night when they were standing \nbeside their beautiful daughter on stage--all three--to be recognized \nas Angels in Adoption.\n  It was so appropriate that we did that. Here is a perfect example of \nwhat can happen when all of the right chemistry comes together, but, \nmore importantly, when all of the right law comes together.\n  Here is an adult couple who wanted this child, who could not adopt \nher. They were not allowed to adopt her. They actually moved out of one \njurisdiction into another, where the laws were different, so they could \nadopt this child and become her permanent parents.\n  The country knows the rest of that story now--not only the story of \ntheir unlimited love, but the fact that they raised and helped shape a \nbeautiful young lady who ultimately became the reigning Miss USA 2000.\n  So it was my tremendous privilege last night to be there to honor \nthem and to recognize them as the recipients of our Congressional \nCaucus on Adoption national award of Angels in Adoption.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, let me just add to that an extraordinary \nelement about this particular story. Obviously, part of it is that \nLynette Cole went on to become Miss USA. But 25 years ago, her father \nhad a steady job at Chrysler. He gave up his job, moved out of State, \nand his wife had to go back to work, so that they could basically fight \nthe Government system to allow them to adopt this child.\n  When everyone said no--the Government said it was the wrong thing to \ndo--this family, through sheer will and dedication, adopted this young \nlady. And she has grown up to be Miss USA. We are proud of them. These \nare the kinds of people who are helping us change the view of adoption \nand the way the system should work in this country. We are proud of \nthem.\n  Let me mention Bertha Holt, another person we honored last night. I \npresented this award to her daughters because, unfortunately, she \npassed away just this year, at 96 years of age, as we were preparing to \ngive her this award. So last night I said, she truly is our angel \nbecause she was observing, watching from Heaven last night.\n\n  But 50 years ago, Bertha Holt, and her husband Harry Holt, began \nbreaking down the barriers for international adoption. They had six \nbiological children of their own and were well on their way, raising \nthose children, when the aftermath of the Korean war brought these two \nloving people basically to their knees. They said: What can we do to \nhelp? They went over to Korea and literally began trying to save \nchildren, one by one, picking them up off the streets, out of the \nhospitals, children who had been orphaned by the war, and said: Let's \nmake a home for them here in our own home in the United States.\n  It took an act of Congress, back in the late 1950s, to allow them to \ndo this. They had to literally change the law to allow them to do this. \nBecause of that ground-breaking work and their advocacy, decade after \ndecade they have found homes here in the United States for 2,000 \nchildren from around the world.\n  We honored Bertha Holt last night. She truly is an angel in Heaven.\n  Finally, one of our national award winners was Children's Action \nNetwork, a group of individuals who have great stature and standing \nbecause many of them operate in movies and in videos. So they are quite \nfamiliar to the general public. They have come together to use their \ncelebrity status to promote this idea, to bring attention to it.\n  Last year, they raised money and contributed to a wonderful program \nthat was filmed in our Nation called ``Home For the Holidays.'' It was \nshown, I say to the Senator, all across the country. Because of that \nvideo, and because of the issue that was raised to the American public, \nhundreds of children were adopted into homes here.\n  So we had a grand night. These were our national Angels. I think for \nthe Record we may submit these other names. There were over 120 of our \naward winners last night.\n  I am happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me talk just a little more about what \nthe Congressional Caucus on Adoption and the coalition we formed \nactually does.\n  As you know, coalitions or caucuses here in the Congress are \nnonpartisan. We are bicameral. We are an alliance of Members of the \nHouse and the Senate, now 150 strong, who work very closely together \nfor the purpose that both Senator Landrieu and I have talked about.\n  We are from all political stripes: Liberal, moderate, conservative. \nBut we have one goal, and that is to help facilitate and change the \nlaws so young people, in search of loving, permanent homes and families \ncan come together.\n  Just this last week, we were able to see the ``adoption bonuses'' \nannounced. These are the incentive payments that were created by \nCongress in the Adoption and Safe Families Act, which provides to \nStates, if you will, the carrot and the stick to assure that States \nhelp get more children out of that system once they have determined \nthat the natural parents--if they are still living--are unable or \nunacceptable to parent these children. Then they move them into \nadoption and into loving homes. These are the incentives we have \ncreated in the passage of that law for the reshaping of foster care in \nour country.\n\n  I would be remiss if I did not mention the name of the late Senator \nJohn Chafee, and Senator Mike DeWine, who, with myself, and others--I \nsay to Senator Landrieu, I think she was just coming to the Senate at \nthat time--worked to reshape that law.\n  It has become a tremendously valuable change in the law because, \ntragically enough, for all the right reasons--and for some of the wrong \nmotivations--the foster care system in our country was becoming a \nwarehouse which young people went into and stayed and oftentimes \ngraduated out of at the age of 18, never knowing a permanent home, \nsometimes living in three or four or five homes during their life. \nFoster care parents are wonderful, loving, giving people, but those \nchildren knew that this was not a permanent environment. They did not \nhave a mom or a dad.\n  We are changing that now, and doing it very quickly, by erring on the \nside of\n\n[[Page S9361]]\n\nthe child and making the determination for the child and not for the \nnatural parent, because, by definition of being in foster care, that \nparent in some way has given up a good many rights or has been found \ndysfunctional and unable to care for the child they may have brought \ninto this world.\n  Also, last week--and I will let the Senator speak more about this--\nSenator Landrieu, working with Senator Helms, was very instrumental in \nbringing about the final clearance of the Hague Treaty that deals with \ninternational intercountry adoption, which is so critical as we try to \nchange laws not just in our country, nationally and on a State-by-State \nbasis, to create greater uniformity in State law to accommodate and \nenhance adoption, but also working internationally. These are very \nimportant steps.\n  Let me conclude and yield back to the Senator by saying this to my \ncolleagues. In November, we are not going to be here, hopefully. We are \ngoing to be adjourned. All of us will be back in our States and back in \nour hometowns.\n\n  November is Adoption Month. That is when our Nation celebrates the \ninstitution of adoption. I certainly encourage my colleagues to think \nabout November and look forward and ask the congressional coalition to \nwork with them in giving them material or information so they could \nprepare to give a speech back in their home State about adoption. Host \nan adoption party for prospective parents and adoptable children. Most \nimportantly, though, speak publicly about it. Make your citizens in \nyour State more aware or at least give them the opportunity to be more \naware of it.\n  You can also do something I did. You can host, with the U.S. Postal \nService, a ceremony about the adoption stamp that was just released \nthis year. You can give out those stamps. It is a marvelous activity \nthat the Post Office loves to do, not only to bring attention to \nadoption but to bring attention to the fact that they are sensitive to \nthese kinds of important issues in our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. The Senator has made some wonderful suggestions as to \nwhat we all can do to celebrate Adoption Month, which is November, \nwhether you have adopted children or perhaps adopted grandchildren; \nperhaps you yourself were adopted and you know someone, a neighbor, who \nhas built a family through adoption. It is life affirming.\n  This is what we can all agree on, whether you are conservative or \nliberal, Democrat or Republican. It is an endeavor where we believe our \nNation can step forward; we can do a better job of making sure that \nevery child has a family to call their own. That is what this is about.\n  The Senator mentioned the Hague Treaty on Intercountry Adoption. I \nwould be remiss if I did not thank publicly the chairman of that \ncommittee, Senator Jesse Helms, and our ranking member, Senator Joe \nBiden. There are many treaties sitting on shelves, waiting to be acted \non by this Senate. There are literally, to my understanding, hundreds. \nBut this chairman, even with a busy schedule, with many demands about \ntaking up a treaty on other international issues, brought forth a \ntreaty for intercountry adoption.\n  It is going to be and is already a historic milestone so that the \nUnited States can continue to lead, to say that there should be no \nbarriers to adoption.\n  We would love all children to stay with the parents to whom they were \nborn or the parent or the family to stay within the country where they \nwere born. But if we can't find a home for them in that country or in \nthat community, we should not leave children in institutions or \norphanages or, for Heaven's sake, living on the street by themselves in \nboxes and boxcars. We should do everything we can.\n  This treaty will help us to do just that. It will help the \ngovernments of the world to shape laws and policies, minimize costs, \nstamp out corruption, and help us to have a system where we can all \nfeel good about our work to bring help to these children. It will be \ndone with the governments, in partnership with the nonprofit \norganizations, churches, faith-based organizations, and individuals \nthroughout the world. It is quite exciting.\n  Perhaps, because there are other Senators on the floor who may want \nto speak, we could submit the names of our 120 Angels into the Record. \nI know the Senator probably will want to at least mention his Idaho \nAngel.\n  I will mention our Louisiana Angel. I was proud to present, with \nCongressman David Vitter, the award last night to Judith Legett from \nthe New Orleans area, and Sister Rosario O'Connell from the Houma area. \nBoth are doing extraordinary work. The sister, with her other sisters, \noriginally from Ireland but now long-time residents of Louisiana, are \ntaking care of approximately 22 abused and neglected children, helping \nthem to move through that system and find permanent homes. Mrs. Legett \nhas been an outstanding spokesperson in our State.\n  I thank the Senator for the time and thank Chairman Helms for his \ngreat leadership in intercountry adoption and thank the Senators for \ntheir vote on that earlier this year.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the list of Angels in \nAdoption 2000 Awardees.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n Congressional Coalition on Adoption--Angels in Adoption 2000 Awardees\n\n\n                  national angel in adoption awardees\n\n       The Honorable Tom Bliley\n       Children's Action Network\n       Gail and Larry Cole\n       Lynette Cole\n       Bertha Holt\n\n\n     congressional coalition on adoption angel in adoption awardees\n\n       Alabama: John Hamilton Carr, Judith Smith Crane, and Anne \n     Forgey.\n       Alaska: Dawn Crombie.\n       Arizona: Barbara and Samuel Aubrey, John A.

The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, again, a very special thanks to my cochair \nwith the Congressional Coalition on Adoption for the tremendous work \nshe has done.\n  We now are able to have an intern, thanks to a private organization \nhelping facilitate the development of our coalition.\n  Lastly, a marvelous lady in Boise, ID, Jolyn Callen, is my Angel in \nAdoption. Her advocacy grew out of her own experience adopting her \ndaughter from abroad. She is now a volunteer with a local adoption \nagency, helping others who are thinking about adopting or going through \nthe adoption process. Even as we work to streamline this process and \nimprove the law and create the tax credits, all of that, it is still a \nphenomenally daunting process. It takes time. It is a legal approach \nand necessary, as we make sure that the laws are dealt with \nappropriately.\n  What we want to make sure is that there are no locked doors, that the \ndoors are there with large signs on them for people to walk through, \nwhether it be State by State or across the Nation or nation to nation, \nto assure, as Senator Landrieu says, that every child in search of a \nhome can find one.\n  Let me close by drawing attention to the map behind Senator Landrieu. \nA good many people will recognize that these are all of the people and \ntheir names and locations that we have just placed into the Record. For \nSenators who might be listening or Senators who will read this Record, \nlook at the States where there are no Angels yet. That means you \nhaven't done your homework. That means you haven't gone home to check \nto see who that marvelous individual is in your State who is helping \nfacilitate an adoption or may have 10 or 12 or 15 adopted children of \ntheir own. They are all over America, wonderful people, whether it is \nat the court level, at the family level, at the agency level, \nadvocating for children to be placed in permanent, loving homes.\n  Next year, when the Congressional Coalition on Adoption once again \nsteps forward to name nationally our Angels in Adoption, let's make \nsure that this map is completely full, not 150 but several hundreds of \ncitizens who are helping us facilitate and work for this very worthy \ncause across our country.\n  I thank the Senator from Louisiana for the tremendous work she does \nand yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, S. 2045 and the Lott amendment would \nraise the H-1B visa cap for highly skilled workers, and there seems to \nbe considerable support on both sides of the aisle for raising this \ncap.\n  Much has been said about the shortage of skilled workers for the \ninformation technology industry. In my State of Minnesota, the \nMinnesota Department of Economic Security has said that over the next \ndecade, the industry will need about 8,800 more skilled workers, but at \nthe same time they see only about 1,000 workers a year being trained \nfor such jobs. I am sympathetic to what the business community is \nsaying in Minnesota and around the country. But I think there is a \nright way and a wrong way to raise the H-1B visa cap. I rise to speak \nabout what I think would be the right way.\n  The only way we can do it the right way is if we are able to bring \namendments to the floor to improve this bill. That is how you are a \ngood Senator representing people in your State.\n  One amendment would call for more resources for high-skilled training \nfor workers in our country, for men and women who want nothing more \nthan to be able to obtain a living wage job, earn a decent standard of \nliving, take care of their families. We ought to make sure that there \nis a significant investment of resources for such skill development and \njob training. The Kennedy amendment would have done that. We are not \nable to do that because we are shut out from amendments.\n  If we are going to raise the H-1B visa cap, we ought to make sure \nthat those workers with more advanced skills that Americans could not \nobtain the training for right away--that is to say, workers who have a \nPhD or a master's degree--would be the ones who, first of all, would be \ncoming to our country from other countries.\n  That way, you make sure working people in our country who can easily \nbe trained for these jobs are not shut out. My understanding is that \nSenator Kennedy will be offering a carve-out amendment after the \ncloture vote.\n  Then there is rural America. The Center for Rural Affairs, located in \nNebraska, came out with a study that one-third of households in rural \ncounties in a six-State region, including Minnesota, have annual \nincomes of less than $15,000 a year. Information technology companies \nsay we need skilled workers. People in rural America have a great work \nethic. Farmers and other rural citizens tell me: Paul, we would like \nnothing more than to have the opportunity to receive the training for \nthese jobs and then we could telework, do it from our homes and farms, \nor from a satellite office. We can make a decent wage. Why don't we put \nsome focus on that?\n  I have an amendment, the telework amendment, and I have worked on \nthis for the better part of a year. Whether it is Native Americans, \nfirst Americans, who want the opportunity for skills development or \nwhether it be rural people, I wanted to bring an amendment to the floor \nthat would have provided funding for this telework. I think this \namendment would have made all the sense in the world.\n  Rural workers need jobs. High-tech employers need workers. This \namendment would have found a solution to these common challenges. It \nwould authorize competitive grants to qualified organizations for 5-\nyear projects to connect and broker employment in the private sector \nthrough telework to a population of rural workers, setting up centers \nof distance learning around the country in rural America, where we can \nmake the connection between rural citizens who so desire the \nopportunity to have the skills and find the employment and the \ninformation technology companies that need these skilled workers.\n  It seems to me that if we are going to have such a piece of \nlegislation on the floor--we would be respectful, of course, of skilled \nimmigrants coming to our country to do the work. I am all for that. But \nat the same time, we would also make sure citizens within our own \ncountry who desire the opportunity to receive the skills and job \ntraining to obtain these jobs are given such an opportunity.\n  Cloture on the underlying bill would also doom another amendment that \nI think is necessary to improve this legislation. We cannot escape the \nirony that we are proceeding to pass a bill that would bring more \nforeign nationals into this country to work in high-tech companies, \nwhile we have done nothing to help literally thousands of immigrants \nwho have been living in this country for years and paying taxes and \noften raising their children as American citizens. If we are going to \nbring more foreign workers into this country, it is only fair and just \nto take into account people who are already here, already contributing \nto our economy, and who already have families who have only known \nAmerica as their home. It is hypocrisy, in my view, to do one without \nthe other.\n  There are thousands of taxpaying immigrants who have been waiting \nyears for an adjustment of status to permanent residency. Many of them \nhave done everything they are required to do to stay in this country. \nBut through a bureaucratic mixup, a change in laws, or another reason, \nlargely beyond their control, they have become ``out of status.'' It is \nfor these people that we must--I use the word ``must''--pass the \nLatino and Immigrant Fairness Act. Instead, we have moved to pass the \nH-1B bill and we ignore them. We ignore them, while we open our doors \nto more high-tech workers. With so many of our neighbors, our \ncoworkers, our fathers, our mothers, and friends facing possible \ndeportation to countries that have not been their home, I do not know \nhow we can stand here and\n\n[[Page S9363]]\n\nargue that increasing the H-1B cap to admit new foreign nationals \nshould pass without bringing fairness and relief to those who are \nalready here. I include a thousand wonderful people in the Liberian \ncommunity in my own State of Minnesota.\n\n  I don't know how a nation that believes in fairness could say that if \nyou fled Castro, you can stay, but if you fled the death squads in El \nSalvador, you must go. I don't know how a nation that calls for more \nfamily values and responsible fatherhood would deport the father of \nAmerican children such as JoJo Mendoza of Minnesota, who has worked for \nyears building our economy, our community, and our Nation. Mr. Mendoza \nwas deported 2 weeks ago from Minnesota. He left his children, who are \nAmericans.\n  I would be prepared to vote for raising the H-1B visa cap if it were \ndone in the right way. I do not think the Lott amendment is the right \nway. I hope we can reach an agreement to do it in the right way--by \npermitting amendments that would make this bill one I could support.\n  Finally, I say one more time--and I feel as if I have said it so many \ntimes that perhaps I have deafened all the gods--we cannot be good \nSenators, whether we are Democrats or Republicans, when we no longer \nhave a process that allows unlimited debate and allows any Senator to \ncome to the floor with amendments that he or she believes will lead to \nan improvement in the quality of life of the people we represent. I \nhave said to the majority leader a million times--he is not on the \nfloor now, but I don't feel badly saying it because I have said it so \nmany times when he has been on the floor of the Senate--I believe the \nway in which we have proceeded, the way in which the majority party \ndoesn't want to debate amendments and doesn't want to vote on \ncontroversial questions, robs the Senate of its vitality. It makes it \nhard for any of us to be good Senators.\n  Here I am giving a speech. I like speaking on the floor of the \nSenate. I am honored to speak on the floor of the Senate. I get goose \nbumps every time I come to the Chamber. I love this Chamber, but I \nwould rather be on the floor doing what I consider to be the work of a \nSenator, which is with an amendment that would set up centers for \ndistance learning, that would focus on telework, that would be so \nimportant to so many rural Americans, including so many citizens in \nMinnesota, that would connect the need of the information technology \nindustry for more skilled workers with a strong desire of rural people \nto be able to have the training, I say to my colleague from Idaho, and \nthen telework from a satellite office from their home, a good job with \na decent wage, with decent health care benefits.\n  I can't introduce that amendment to this bill with the way the \nmajority leader has proceeded. I can't improve this bill. I can't \nrepresent the people in greater Minnesota and rural Minnesota, many of \nwhom are really hurting given the farm economy. For that reason, I \ncertainly will vote for the motion to move forward on the immigrant \nfairness legislation, but I won't vote for this H-1B legislation as \nbrought to the floor by the majority leader. I will not vote for \ncloture.\n  I am going to insist over and over again, as is my right as a \nSenator, to come to this floor and introduce and debate amendments that \nI think will make our country better. My solution could be another \nSenator's horror. I understand that. But the beauty and the greatness \nof the Senate, when we are at our best, is not this process, but it is \nthe process of amending and debating, disposing of amendments, voting \nyes or no, and having more amendments to deal with, and then work to \npass the legislation. I think we are making a terrible mistake in \nproceeding the way we have. I do not think it is for the good of the \nSenate as an institution, and I don't think it is for the good of \nMinnesota or the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, we will vote later this afternoon on a \nmotion to change the way we proceed here to allow an amendment to come \nto the floor of the kind the Senator from Minnesota has spoken to.\n  This is an interesting process because the beauty of the process of \nthe Senate that the Senator speaks of is that there are rules and \nprocedures by which we live. Historically, most Americans understand \nthat when they elect a majority to the Congress, they expect that \nmajority, under the Constitution, to form a Congress and to form rules \nand to be able to manage that Congress. Under that responsibility of \nmanagement, which this time the Republicans have under the majority \nleader of Trent Lott, there are the rules that each one of us as \nSenators have a right to enforce and to live by; that is, that we are \nall equal as our Founding Fathers assured that every State must be.\n  But it also recognized that there are more important procedures and \nprocesses that keep us functioning and functioning well. It is the rule \nof the majority, and in some instances in our Senate it is a \nsupermajority that must move, giving the minority even greater rights \nto speak out.\n  While the Senator from Minnesota may be frustrated, clearly he has \nthe right to make every effort to enjoy his right. But if a majority or \na supermajority says, no, that is not the way we will proceed, and this \nis what we must do to carry on the business of the Senate and the \nGovernment, then while it may collectively have chosen to say to the \nSenator from Minnesota this is the way we are going to go, it is very \ndifficult to suggest that is an outright denial of his right.\n  We are here to deal with allowing people from other countries to come \nto this country to work and not only to share in the American dream, to \nenhance the American dream, but to share in the freedoms and the \nbenefits that all citizens in our country have.\n  While we as a country have always recognized the importance of our \nexistence, we are a conglomerate as a country. We are not one people in \nthe sense of one nationality or one color or one religion. We are all \nAmericans, and we live under this marvelous system. We are brought \ntogether by our Constitution, and oneness under that Constitution which \nis really spelling out the rights and the freedoms of us as citizens.\n  We take seriously allowing others to come. They must come by rule, \nand they must come by law, or we become a nation quite lawless. \nCertainly a lawless nation is a nation that loses control of its \nboundaries, loses control of its borders, and, in fact, could lose \ncontrol of its institutions--the very institutions of which the Senator \nfrom Minnesota and I are so proud.\n  We, as a country, have established laws. We have said this is the way \na foreign national can enter our country to enjoy those things that are \nbasically American. Some would choose to enter illegally; in other \nwords, they would choose to violate the process or to violate the law.\n  We have before us today what we consider is waiving the rules of the \nSenate to consider a bill that basically says it is OK to violate the \nlaw; that we will change the law now that you violated it to make you \nlegal.\n  I don't think American citizens with their full faith as it relates \nto how our institutions of government work are going to be very excited \nabout that idea. They, too, may once have been a foreign national and \nbecame a naturalized American citizen. My family was five or six or \nseven generations ago. I am not sure when. But in the late 1700s, they \nwere once foreigners coming from the great land of Scotland.\n  I have tremendous empathy for and have always voted when it came to \nchanging our immigration laws or adjusting them to accommodate the \nneeds of our country and the needs of our citizenry. But we as an \ninstitution and responsible as caretakers under the Constitution cannot \nreward the breaking of the law by simply changing it and saying it is \nOK now. It is OK if you can make it across the border into this \ncountry. Somehow we will accommodate you and change the law.\n\n  A sovereign nation is not a nation if it cannot control its borders--\nif it cannot police its borders and control the process of movement \nacross those borders, both exit and entry. That is what creates a \nnation. That is what constitutes a nation. That is what identifies us \nas a nation. We are not one indivisible world. We are one indivisible \nnation under God. Nations make up a world.\n\n[[Page S9364]]\n\n  There is a fundamental debate going on on the floor today, and it \nspells a difference.\n  My colleague from Texas talked about the millions and millions of \nforeign nationals who have applied to become American citizens, or at \nleast legal as foreign nationals in our country. They stand in line. \nThey work the procedure. It is complicated. We want it to be \ncomplicated. We do not want all of the world at our doorstep, nor would \nany other nation of the world. But we have always recognized that the \nvitality of our country is the uniqueness of our character, and our \ncharacter is made up of many, many who come here and are not only the \nbeneficiaries of our country but the great contributors to our country. \nThey are many, and they are all different. Once they are here and once \nthey are legal, under the process of law then they become part of that \none nation indivisible.\n  There is a very important vote this afternoon that will occur about \n4:30. It will be to decide whether we are going to change the law to \nallow those who came here illegally to all of a sudden be legal and, \ntherefore, send a message to the world that there is no consequence. If \nyou can make it across the border, you are home free.\n  That is not the way you sustain a nation. That is not the way you \nidentify a border. That is not the way you protect the strength of our \nsovereignty. Diversity is important. We all recognize that because we \nare all part of this great diversity. We became the melting pot of the \nworld, as so many down through the years have spoken of, but in doing \nso we did it through process and procedure--orderly with responsibility \nunder the law. That is why this vote this afternoon will be so \nimportant.\n  I hope the Senate will not choose to waive our rule or waive our \nprocedures for the purpose of an amendment that would clearly change \nthe character of the law and allow an illegal alien to have benefits \nfrom having been the performer of an illegal act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                     THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, in only a matter of 2 or 3 weeks, the \nCongress will adjourn--I trust having passed H-1B visas, but in all \nlikelihood without passing a Patients' Bill of Rights, or, \nunfortunately, a prescription drug benefit, and probably without any \nreal improvement in gun safety legislation.\n  While many of us will take comfort in helping American high-\ntechnology companies by providing H-1B visas, it is not even a mixed \nsuccess. Worse, however, than most of these frustrations is the most \nunnecessary of all of these failures; that is, the failure to pass the \nViolence Against Women Act.\n  Five years ago, Senator Biden led this Congress in passing a Violence \nAgainst Women Act, which I believe became noncontroversial and which \nbenefits have been widely accepted. It makes it all the more difficult \nto understand that this $1.6 billion package is languishing and will \nexpire.\n  Under this legislation, we have trained thousands of police officers \nto make them sensitive to the problems of family violence and abuse. \nJudges and counselors have received training in sensitivity. We have \nincreased the means of reporting domestic violence. So our records are \naccurate. We know the extent of the problem and how to respond.\n  Most importantly, we have provided real services, medical services, \nfor a woman or a family who is abused; a place to go to get counselling \nfrom someone who understands domestic violence and how to deal with it; \na place to take a child.\n  I think the most important of all is temporary housing. No American \nparent should have to choose between subjecting their child or \nthemselves to violence, sexual abuse, or even a threat to life, and \nhomelessness. Thousands of American women face that every night. Do I \ntake my child to the streets, to a temporary motel, unsafe shelter, no \nshelter at all, or do I stay in a home where the child can be abused, \nwhere my life can be threatened?\n\n  The Violence Against Women Act has created thousands of beds in \ntemporary shelters across the country so women do not have to face that \nchoice. It established an emergency hotline which continues to get \n13,000 calls a month, half a million calls since its inception; where a \ndesperate woman, not knowing her options, or how to protect her child, \nnot knowing what to do, how to get medical help, how to get counseling, \nhow to get a police officer who understands, can call and get someone \non the other end of a phone and get help.\n  The greatest part of the Violence Against Women Act is that it is \nshowing results. Since 1997, the programs created by the Violence \nAgainst Women Act have reduced the rate of partner violence against \nwomen by 21 percent. This is a dramatic decline in the amount of \nviolence against women since the act came into being. There may be many \nreasons.\n  We are also seeing dramatic drops in murders. Fewer murders were \ncommitted by intimate partners in 1996, 1997, and 1998, than any year \nsince 1976. The number of women raped has declined by 13 percent \nbetween 1994 and 1997. Members may cite many reasons why violence is \ndown, rape rates are down, and most importantly, murder rates are down, \nbut one of those reasons must be that police officers are better \ntrained and are responding more promptly, judges are move sensitive to \nthe crime, and most importantly, women who feel threatened in these \ncircumstances have a choice, are getting out of residences and into \nshelters, into protected environments.\n  During a recent recess, I visited a number of the shelters across my \nState of New Jersey. The Women's Center in Monmouth County, NJ, is \nreceiving $285,000 for counseling and shelter and emergency services. \nThe Passaic County Women's Shelter in Paterson received $185,000 under \nthe Violence Against Women Act for Spanish-speaking women to get help \nand advice.\n  If this act is not reauthorized, these shelters lose their Federal \nfunding, potentially close their doors, with the unescapable conclusion \nthat violence may rise as women lose choices.\n  We have come to recognize in these years, the criminal justice system \nhas come to recognize, as well, that violence in the family, \nparticularly in cities, is dangerous not only to the individuals in the \nfamily, but society, which is built upon a family unit. We decided not \nto ignore the problem. But that may be exactly what this Congress is \ndoing. This legislation will lapse, this funding will end, and people \nwill get hurt. Those are realities. They are not partisan comments. \nThey don't represent a philosophy or ideology. They are cold, hard, \nfacts because for all the progress we have made, family violence in \nthis country remains an epidemic. One in three women continues to \nexperience domestic violence in their lifetime. A woman is still raped \nevery 5 minutes, and still there are no arrests in half of all the \nNation's rape cases.\n  The risks of not acting are great: Lose the shelters, lose another \ngeneration of police officers or judges who are not properly trained, a \nphone call in the night that cannot be made, beds that will not be \navailable. Is it worth the price, the cost of this inaction?\n  I am pleased we are voting on this H-1B visa today. I wish we were \ndoing many other things. Other things may be controversial, we may have \nour own ideas about them, but surely this could bring us together. It \ndid once. In 1995, we acted together, without division. Are we less now \nthan we were then--is the problem so much less in our minds?\n\n  I urge the leadership to bring the Violence Against Women Act to the \nfloor and to do so now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Who yields time?\n  If no one yields, time will be charged equally against both sides.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I again lend my support to the Latino and \nImmigrant Fairness Act. I understand we may be voting at 4:30 this \nafternoon to waive the rules to allow this legislation to be \nconsidered. I am hopeful in\n\n[[Page S9365]]\n\nthe spirit of fundamental fairness the Senate will vote to allow a full \ndebate on this issue.\n  The focus of this legislation is the same word that I just used to \nrefer to what I hope will be the disposition of the Senate, and that is \n``fairness.'' There has been a lot of discussion over the past few days \nabout high-tech workers, H-1B visas. Our American companies need these \nhigh-tech workers.\n  Unfortunately, there are deficiencies in the skill level of Americans \nwhich have resulted in the necessity of providing visas for specific \nhigh-skilled foreign workers to come to the United States to fill these \njobs. I hope this deficiency will just be a temporary one and we will \nuse the debate we are having on H-1B as a spur to do the fundamental \nreforms we are called upon to do to see that Americans have the skills \nto fill these high-tech, high-wage jobs. Until then, American industry \nneeds these workers. High-tech industries are one of the engines that \nhave been growing our prosperous economy.\n  I want to see the H-1B bill become law. I am a cosponsor and a long-\ntime supporter of this legislation. However, high-tech workers are not \nthe engine of our economic growth. The equally essential workers in our \nservice and retail industry, manufacturing, care giving, tourism, and \nothers are part of that economic engine. The need is great for H-1B and \nhigh-tech workers. The need is also great for these essential workers. \nMany of these workers would remain as legal, permanent members of our \nsociety under the relief provided with the Latino and Immigrant \nFairness Act.\n  Simply put, what is fairness? I said before that we all learn in \ngrammar school what is fair and what is not fair. It is fair for a \nteacher to punish two noisy and disruptive schoolchildren by keeping \nboth of them inside during recess. But if the teacher keeps only one \nstudent in and lets the other go outside and play, that is unfair. In \nother words, fair is treating people in the same circumstances in the \nsame way. This is exactly what we are trying to achieve with the \n``NACARA Parity'' section of the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act.\n  We are here today trying to achieve fairness because in 1996 we \npassed an immigration law that went too far. It was unfair because it \napplied retroactively. This is like changing the rules in the middle of \nthe game. This is what we have done, and we should correct it, and we \nshould begin that process of correction today.\n  What we are being asked to do is not to provide citizenship or even \nlegal permanent status to the persons who will be affected by this \nlegislation. In most instances what we are being asked to do is to give \nthese people a chance to apply for legal status in the United States, \njust as we have given others who are in the same circumstances the \nright to apply for legal residence in the United States.\n  I spoke on the Senate floor earlier about the human faces and human \nstories I came to know when Congress corrected part of this unfairness, \nthe unfairness of the 1996 act, in 1997 and 1998 with two immigration \nbills dealing with Central Americans and Haitians.\n  On the Senate floor I spoke of Alexandra Charles, whom I came to know \nwhen I participated in a hearing held in Miami when we were originally \nintroducing the Haitian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act. Let me tell \nyou Alexandra's story.\n  As a young child in Haiti, she witnessed the military murder her \nmother. Her father has disappeared. She came to the United States as an \nunaccompanied minor, but she has built a life here. When I testified \nabout her at the hearing in Miami, she was working at two jobs. She was \nfinishing 2 years at Miami Dade Community College. Congress took the \nright step, in 1997, to protect her future in the United States. We \nhave the opportunity today to start the process to take the right step \nfor others who are in Alexandra's same circumstances.\n  We are now treating differently those individuals who faced equally \narduous hurdles to come to the United States: Those who fled civil \nwars, those who witnessed brutal acts--such as Alexandra, seeing a \nmilitary man shoot down her mother--those who were forced out of a \nnation after a military overthrow because of their views on democracy. \nOur Nation has always set the standard for offering refuge to those in \nneed. We did so in this case. We gave legal status to many in the mid-\n1980s who came here in these circumstances, fleeing persecution, \nseeking democracy and freedom. Then, in 1996 we took it away and did it \nretroactively. This is wrong. This is not the American way. We should \ncorrect this error in this legislation.\n  In July of this year, Congressman Alcee Hastings and I met with \nmembers of the Haitian community in Fort Lauderdale, FL. One of the \naudience members who approached the microphone to speak was in \nelementary school. His name was Rickerson Moises. He and some of his \nsiblings were born in the United States. They are U.S. citizens. His \nmother fled the violence in Haiti but was not protected in the Haitian \nRefugee Fairness Act because she came with a false document, a method \nshe had to take to escape Haiti.\n\n  If I could just explain for a moment the differences in exit from \nHaiti during that period of the Duvalier regime and then the military \ndictatorship which followed. Most Haitians who fled the country did so \nby small boat. They arrived in the United States with no documentation \nat all. They had no passports, no other documents to support their exit \nfrom their former country or their arrival in the United States. There \nwas another group, a smaller group, approximately 10,000, who came by \ncommercial airline. These frequently were the people who were in the \ngreatest jeopardy. They realized they did not have time to seek out a \nboat, to wait possibly the days or weeks before the boat was prepared \nto leave. They had to leave tonight because of the nature of the threat \nthey faced.\n  Mr. President, I ask for an additional 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator clarify as to what time that \n10 minutes will come from? We have a time agreement which has a \ndeadline for a vote.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. It will come from the minority side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time on the minority side. It \nwould have to come from the majority side. As a Senator from Idaho, I \nwould have to object until I have advice from the majority leader as to \nthe time.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, in light of the fact that there is no one \nhere seeking the floor, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \ncontinue until someone seeks the floor or for an additional 5 minutes, \nwhichever is shorter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, those persons who came by commercial \nairliner had to have some documents in order to get on the plane. So \nwhat they would frequently do is get counterfeit passports so they \ncould get onto the plane and out of Haiti and escape the imminent \nprospect of persecution or worse.\n  She was one of those persons. She came to the United States with \nfalse documents, counterfeit documents she admits. Had she come with no \ndocuments at all, she would have been allowed to stay here. But because \nshe arrived with false documents, she is subject to deportation. After \nyears of life in the United States, this action would separate U.S. \ncitizen children from their Haitian mother. This is an agonizing \nchoice--follow the law and leave your children behind or take your \nchildren back to a country where you suffered violence and persecution. \nI cannot think of any choice more un-American, more offensive to our \nbasic principles. We have a chance to correct this and restore \nfairness, and we should do so as soon as possible.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \ntwo editorials, one from the Miami Herald, one from the San Francisco \nChronicle, which explain in greater detail the urgent need to take \naction and correct this injustice. I ask these two editorials be \nprinted in the Record immediately after my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I do not want to speak much longer. I \ndidn't speak much when I was on the floor before about another element \nof the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act because I focused on my own \npersonal experiences in south Florida. But\n\n[[Page S9366]]\n\nthe ``registry date'' component of the legislation will have a \ntremendously positive impact on my State and on our Nation as a whole.\n  Congress every so often in the course of legislation updates what is \ncalled the registry date in immigration law. This is the way, for many \nyears, residents of our Nation have had to formalize their status in \nthe United States. It recognizes the fact that after many years in our \ncountry doing the hardest work, paying taxes, participating in the \ncommunity, and starting small businesses, there should be an avenue of \nappeal to be able to stay in the United States.\n  To apply for relief--and I underscore apply for relief, not be \ngranted relief--to apply for relief under the new registry date, 1986, \nyou must have been here since that time, nearly 15 years.\n  For many Floridians, these are the most long-term employees or our \nestablished neighbors. These workers for Florida's companies have the \nmost experience and are among the most dedicated. It is fundamentally \nunfair to these workers, the businesses, and our communities to uproot \nthese families after 15 years or more.\n  Critics have said this condones illegal immigration. Our Nation \nshould have a firm policy on illegal immigration, and through the last \nfew years' appropriations cycles, we have allocated more money for \nborder enforcement. We have the Federal responsibility to strengthen \nour borders, but we also have the responsibility to face the reality \nand the consequences of uprooting families after nearly two decades of \nwork and life in the United States.\n  Many of these individuals did have legal status at one time and were \naffected by the immigration laws passed in 1996. Some were given bad \nadvice about whether they were eligible for the amnesty program in \n1986. They were told not to apply, when, in fact, they were eligible \nfor the program.\n  Updating the registry date allows those who have dedicated 15 or more \nyears of their life to building and strengthening our economy and \nNation to finally have the opportunity for a formal status here. It \nmakes both economic and humanitarian sense.\n  Lastly, I want to react to some of the debate yesterday. I believe \nthere should be a free and open debate on this important immigration \nissue, but, in my view, that debate does not need to be partisan.\n  This is an issue that affects every city, business, and family in \nAmerica. It crosses State lines and party lines. There is a common \nground, and I hope we can work together to find a way to allow both H-\n1B and the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act to become law. It is in \nthe greatest of America's tradition of justice and fairness.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                  [From the Miami Herald, May 4, 2000]\n\n      Haitian Parents of U.S. Kids Deserve To Remain Here Together\n\n       Imagine a scene where American children are made to bid \n     goodbye to their mothers and fathers as federal agents force \n     the parents to board a plane to Haiti, where they'll have to \n     rebuild their lives.\n       After going to extraordinary lengths to reunite Elian \n     Gonzalez with his father, Attorney General Janet Reno must \n     not let that tragedy come to pass for the 5,000 U.S.-born \n     children of Haitians who soon might be placed in this awful \n     situation. These parents, some of whom have been here for as \n     many as 20 years, could be deported at a moment's notice. \n     They'd be forced to choose between leaving their children \n     behind or raising them in a destitute, strife-torn country \n     the children have never seen.\n       That's what the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization \n     Service, which Ms. Reno oversees, proposes to do. Ms. Reno \n     should be consistent in her concern for children. For their \n     sake, she must protect these families by suspending their \n     deportation at the highest executive level.\n       The next step is for Ms. Reno to allow these Haitians to be \n     included in the Haitian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act of \n     1998, which was intended to cover Haitians fleeing political \n     violence in Haiti in the early 1990s. The law granted amnesty \n     from deportation to Haitians who made it to U.S. shores \n     before the 1996 cutoff date, as these 10,000 people did.\n       But unlike those who arrived by boat or other means, most \n     of these 10,000 came through South Florida's airports using \n     phony documents to flee that country. Yet because they broke \n     the law by using counterfeit papers, the INS has refused to \n     let them apply for protection under that amnesty law signed \n     by President Clinton in 1998. One such refugee was a former \n     Haitian soldier who fled after refusing to follow orders and \n     shoot at unarmed demonstrators.\n       Another is Kenol Henricy who paid $2,500 for a passport and \n     visa that got him to Turk and Caicos, then to Maimi. He was \n     stopped at the airport and spent four months at the Krome \n     Detention Center. ``I knew it was illegal,'' says Henricy, \n     32. ``There was nothing else I could do.''\n       That was 11 years ago. In the meantime, his wife died, \n     leaving him alone to care for Kenisha, his asthmatic, \n     American-born child. Since he arrived, Mr. Henricy has worked \n     at the same Medley tool-and-die shop. Recently he's been \n     sharing a house in Hollywood to help a brother pay the \n     mortgage.\n       Last August, Mr. Henricy received his deportation letter \n     with an extension set to run out in September if he's denied \n     residency under HRIFA. He's interviewing with an INS officer \n     today. If his request for amnesty is turned down, Henricy \n     fears he may be detained and deported on the spot.\n       What then? Here he has work and insurance for his asthmatic \n     daughter. In Haiti--nothing.\n       Ms. Reno must show compassion for children like Kenisha, \n     some who don't speak a word of Creole. She has the power to \n     stop INS lawyers from prosecuting fraudulent-entry cases, and \n     she must use it. The HRIFA law was intended to correct a \n     wrong, not to break apart families.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From the San Francisco Chronicle, April 5, 2000]\n\n                        No Room for 5,000 Elians\n\n       While much of the nation is consumed by the plight of one \n     little Cuban boy, more than 5,000 Haitian children are facing \n     an even more frightening prospect: banishment by the \n     Immigration and Naturalization Service to a Caribbean hell of \n     filth, tyranny, starvation and, some cases, surely death.\n       Obscured in the dark shadows just beyond America's \n     spotlight on Elian Gonzalez, few know the pain of thousands \n     of lesser known but equally vulnerable children on the verge \n     of either being ripped from their families or booted out of \n     the only homeland they've ever known. Worried and puzzled, \n     the children await the execution of deportation orders that, \n     at any moment will either make them orphans, doom them to a \n     life of squalor, or both.\n       U.S. citizens by birthright, the children can't be \n     deported. But their parents can and have been so ordered--the \n     penalty for doctoring passports to escape a fearsome Haiti \n     more than a decade ago.\n       Now, 3,000 parents face an agonizing choice: take their \n     children with them or leave their children here--in effect \n     making them orphans--as the only way to ensure them at least \n     a chance at a better life.\n       The fate of the Haitians, long colored by politics and \n     race, is a brutal tale of a people unable to awake from \n     nightmares most thought they fled years ago. From 1981 to \n     1994, 10,000 Haitians boarded leaky boats, leaving a country \n     wracked by street chaos, military coups and the kind of \n     ruthless politics that made Cuba look orderly by comparison.\n       But the U.S. Coast Guard seized and burned their boats, and \n     returned them to a regime the world routinely scorns. But \n     many tried again, this time using altered passports to board \n     airlines and fly.\n       In 1997, Cubans and Nicaraguans who came here in much the \n     same way were given amnesty, but not Haitians who entered \n     with fake passports. Apparently, scaling border fences or \n     floating in on rafts like Elian is less criminal.\n       Ironically, Haitians mostly live in Florida, virtually next \n     door to Elian and his rabid street crusade for citizenship.\n       The Haitians have worked hard at menial jobs, obeying laws, \n     buying homes, educating their kids. But no politicians have \n     taken up their cause. No one is protecting their dilemma, \n     demanding parental rights or simply fighting to save their \n     children.\n       But if it is wrong to tear one child away from his father, \n     surely it's wrong to tear 5,000 children away from theirs. \n     It's time to end America's double standard for Haitian \n     refugees. Attorney General Janet Reno should stay the \n     deportations and assure the Haitians that they too won't be \n     ripped from their parents.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be allowed to \nproceed as in morning business counted against the time on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are supposed to vote here at 4:30, so I \nwant\n\n[[Page S9367]]\n\nto take a few minutes while we have a little time to talk about an \nissue that is very important to me and, I think, very important to many \npeople in this country that has to do with rural health care.\n  I am cochairman of the Rural Health Care Caucus in the Senate. We are \nfaced with a number of issues, of course, in health care for everyone. \nBut one of the issues we always have to work at is the notion that when \nyou have low population areas, rural areas, then the provision of \nhealth care and delivery of health care is different than it is in \nurban areas, than it is in city areas. So, from time to time, we have \nto make some different kinds of adjustments. That is what our Rural \nHealth Care Caucus seeks to do.\n  It is also interesting that although Wyoming is certainly one of the \nrural States, almost every State has rural areas. Even New York, which \nwe never think of that way, has, I think, a higher percentage of people \nwho live in cities than any other State; so, therefore, they have rural \nareas as well.\n  I want to take a minute to bring to the attention of the Senate what \nI consider to be current inequities in the Medicare program that do not \naddress the unique and different needs of rural Medicare providers and \nbeneficiaries in my State and across the country.\n  Rural health care beneficiaries--those who utilize the program--tend \nto be poorer, tend to have more chronic illnesses than their urban \ncounterparts. There is generally a higher proportion of seniors in \nrural areas. Rural providers generally serve a higher proportion of \nMedicare patients and therefore, of course, are impacted and are highly \nsusceptible to changes and reductions in Medicare reimbursements for \nthe services they provide.\n  It is because of these unique circumstances that rural providers and \nbeneficiaries are working now to put into whatever package we come up \nwith, as this Congress comes to a close, that which strengthens \nMedicare.\n  The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 asked for some reductions. \nUnfortunately, HCFA, the agency that handles the disbursements for \nMedicare, reduced those payments a great deal more than asked for by \nCongress. It had been provided at one time to bring them up again. \nThere is an effort being made to have a sort of payback arrangement \nfrom the BBA this year as well.\n  So there are a number of specific provisions I hope will be \nconsidered that do pertain to rural areas and are specifically \npertinent to rural Medicare providers.\n  The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 reduced the annual inflation --the \nmarket basket it was called--update that hospitals usually received in \norder to make the payments even with inflation. In fiscal years 2001 \nand 2002, hospitals were slated to receive a market basket which would \nhave been the inflation minus 1.1 percent as an update. Unfortunately, \nstudies demonstrate that because of the reductions, many rural \nhospitals have margins now that hover below that. So we are really \ninterested in that. This market basket payback does reflect what the \nincreased inflationary costs are. I think that is terribly important as \nwe move forward.\n\n  We need to revise the disproportionate share hospital payment \nformula. A majority of those hospitals serve large numbers of seniors \nwho are in low-income brackets and receive little or no Medicare \npayments because of the differential qualifications for rural and urban \nhospitals.\n  Rural and sole community hospitals must meet a higher threshold of \ncriteria of 45 percent and 30 percent than their urban counterparts. So \nhere again is a certain amount of unfairness in these kinds of payments \nand distributions.\n  So we are asking that the committee apply the threshold of the 15 \npercent of having these kinds of patients, to make it fair and \nequitable--which is currently what it is in urban hospitals--rather \nthan the 30 percent.\n  The wage index: Here again we have the formula that applies to most \nhospitals. The local wage index is considered to be about 70 percent of \nthe total cost. However, that is not true in rural hospitals, where it \nis more like 50 or 60 percent. So when that adjustment is made, our \nhospitals in the rural areas have lower wages and, therefore, are \nunfairly penalized. So we are asking that each of them be assessed on \nwhat their average percentage really is.\n  Rural home health agencies are not able to spread out their fixed \ncosts. They are not able to generally include the costs of the \nexcessive traveling that takes place in rural areas. That needs to be \nchanged.\n  Medicare-dependent hospitals: We find that this program was \nestablished in 1989 to provide special protections to rural hospitals \nthat serve a high proportion of Medicare patients. They used the old \nfigures that were there. We need to do something about that.\n  So there are a number of areas in rural health care that need to be \njustified, and hopefully can be justified, as we move forward toward \nthe kind of changes that ought to be made to bring this balanced budget \nbusiness back into play and to be fair.\n  All we are asking for is fairness as we compare the different kinds \nof hospitals. We found some time ago that the payments made in Florida \nwere much larger than payments made for the same kind of services in \nWyoming. Now there is some adjustment in terms of cost, and so on, but \nnot nearly the kind of adjustment that showed up in the payments. We \nhave made some improvements on that. I think it is something we have to \ncontinue to look at as we revise the criteria.\n  Last year, we also established a critical access hospital arrangement \nfor small communities that could not sustain a hospital with all the \nfull requirements that are necessary in an urban hospital, so their \nhospitals could be listed so they could be paid for their services \nunder Medicare.\n  We do have community access hospitals which basically are clinics. \nPeople can take care of emergencies knowing, if it is a serious illness \nor a serious accident, they can be moved to another location, but the \ncommunity access hospitals can provide the emergency care that is \nneeded and can be paid for it out of Medicare. That is simply a very \nreasonable, sensible, fair, and equitable thing that needed to be \nchanged and was. I am pleased about that.\n  I am looking for ways to increase the program which entices providers \nto come to rural areas where they could pay off part of their \neducational expenses by serving in areas of low population in the \nUnited States. That is just one of the things, as we complete this \nsession, that needs to be done. I hope it will be done. And as that \nhappens, I am very anxious that the uniqueness of our rural communities \nbe recognized and that we have fairness based on that.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the minority has \nno more time left under the time agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know the Chair, acting in his capacity as \na Senator from Idaho, if there was a problem, would certainly correct \nit. But nobody is here.\n  I ask unanimous consent that until somebody from the majority wants \nto talk--I have spoken to Senator Thomas, to whom I have indicated I \nwas going to speak. I don't know if he knew that we had no time. I ask \nunanimous consent that I be allowed to address the Senate for up to 4 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Before the vote occurs at 4:30, I want to make sure we all \nunderstand where we are coming from in this instance. Our leader has \nasked that the rules be suspended, in effect, so that we can vote on \nthe Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act. This is a very simple measure \nthat we want to vote on. Some people disagree with what we are trying \nto do. We want an up-or-down vote on this amendment. The Latino and \nImmigrant Fairness Act contains Central American parity, date of \nregistry,\n\n[[Page S9368]]\n\n245(i), and the matter that has been so well discussed by Senator Reed \nfrom Rhode Island dealing with Liberians. We want an up-or-down vote on \nthis and we will get one eventually. We hope this measure will pass.\n  Everybody should understand that a vote against our suspending the \nrules is against the amendment that we are advocating, the Latino and \nImmigrant Fairness Act. This has nothing to do with illegal \nimmigration. These are people who are already in the United States, who \nare here seeking to have their status readjusted. It has nothing to do \nwith criminals. None of these people are criminals who could apply to \nhave legal status here and apply for citizenship.\n  There are a number of red herrings that have been thrown up, and this \nis a simple proposal. We want the ability of these people who are in \nthe country to have their status adjusted. Some of it is so unfair that \npeople have the ability to apply under an amnesty act passed in 1986. \nAnybody in the country prior to 1982 could apply to have their status \nreadjusted. They had a year to do that. Some people took more than a \nyear. We believe there should be the ability of these people who were \nhere before 1982 to have their status adjusted. We have asked that that \ndate be moved up to 1986 in keeping with what we have done in this \ncountry since 1929. We have been adjusting the time for individuals to \nreadjust their status.\n  It is unfair if we are unable to do this. The President has said he \nwould not allow this Congress to adjourn unless this fairness provision \nis passed and made law.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n            AMERICAN WRESTLER RULON GARDNER WINS GOLD MEDAL\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I want to suggest something that is very \nexciting for those of us in Wyoming and, I think, all over the country. \nI will start with a headline off of the Internet: ``American Stops \nRussian's 13-year Streak.''\n  It says:\n\n       ``I cannot believe I actually won,'' said the 286-pound \n     Rulon Gardner, and he was not alone.\n\n  He wasn't expected to win. He is a wrestler from Star Valley, WY, \nweighing 286 pounds. This was really an incredible thing. Listen to \nthis:\n\n       Just how invincible was the Russian Icon he beat? Alexander \n     Karelin had not lost a match in international competition in \n     14 years. Only one point had been scored against him by an \n     opponent in 10 years. He'd won gold in the past three \n     Olympics. The American who wrestled him in Atlanta in 1996, \n     respected silver medalist Matt Ghaffari, faced him 22 times \n     over his career and lost every time.\n\n  He is a huge guy and has done this great, great job of wrestling \nthroughout the years. In fact, it seemed so certain he would win again \nthat the Olympic Committee president was there to present him with the \nmedal. Sure enough, that did not happen. The unthinkable happened, in \nfact, and our man scored a point. Gardner scored a point early on and \nmaintained that point, and now he is the gold medal winner in \nheavyweight wrestling at the world Olympics.\n  He grew up the youngest of nine in Afton, WY, population 1,400. He \nwent to college and wrestled there. Before wrestling, he also played a \nlittle football. But he has been wrestling for some time and had a \nchance to go to the Olympics this year. This is the first Olympic gold \nfor a U.S. wrestler since 1984.\n\n  We are especially proud in Wyoming to have had a number of athletes \nin the Olympics. But we are really so proud of this one in particular, \nwho, as of yesterday, had the gold medal in heavyweight wrestling.\n  I couldn't resist the opportunity to recognize that.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               OIL CRISIS\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, this morning there was a meeting of the \nJoint Economic Committee on which I sit. The subject had to do with oil \nprices. I would like to report to my fellow Senators and any who may be \nwatching on television some of the things we found out.\n  The first thing that became clear was that the oil crisis that we are \ndealing with now did not occur in the last 60 days. It has been \nbuilding for months. Indeed, the conditions have been building for \nyears.\n  One of the things that I found distressing was a comment made by one \nmember of the committee whose suggestion was that anyone who disagreed \nwith what the President and the Vice President are currently proposing \nshould be challenged with this question: What is your solution? And if \nthe answer was you don't have an easy solution, then stop complaining \nabout our solution.\n  I think that is an irresponsible reaction.\n  I quoted to the members of the committee a column that was written in \nthe New York Times yesterday by Thomas L. Friedman. He is the foreign \naffairs commentator for the New York Times, not normally known--either \nMr. Friedman or his newspaper--for their support of Republicans or for \ntheir disapproval of Democrats.\n  I found it a rather interesting column. I quoted some of this to my \nfellow committee members. I would like to quote from it here on the \nfloor.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of my remarks, the \nentire column be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, Mr. Friedman is writing this column from \nTokyo. It has a Tokyo byline on it. He starts out by saying:\n\n       It's interesting watching the American oil crisis/debate \n     from here in Tokyo. The Japanese are cool as cucumbers \n     today--no oil protests, no gas lines, no politicians making \n     crazy promises. That's because Japan has been preparing for \n     this day since the 1973 oil crisis by steadily introducing \n     natural gas, nuclear power, high-speed mass transit and \n     conservation, and thereby steadily reducing its dependence on \n     foreign oil.\n\n  That is one of the key paragraphs in this entire piece, that for \nnearly 30 years now the Japanese have been steadily reducing their \ndependence on foreign oil. In the same period in the United States, we \nhave been steadily increasing our dependence on foreign oil.\n  Look at the power sources Mr. Friedman refers to: Natural gas, \nnuclear power, high-speed transit, on the conservation side. I have \nbeen a supporter of high-speed transit ever since I came to the Senate. \nThere are some people who have said: Senator, you come from the West. \nWhy do you care about Amtrak? Why do you care about high-speed ground \ntransportation in the Northeast corridor? I have said I care about it \nbecause it is part of the long-term solutions in the United States. \nEven as a Senator from Utah, I have sided with the Senators from New \nJersey, the Senators from New York, and the Senators from Delaware in \nsupporting Amtrak and high-speed ground transportation, in hoping to \nkeep that form of transportation alive so we are not always on the \nhighways.\n  Natural gas: There is an enormous amount of natural gas in the United \nStates.\n  Nuclear power: We have not built a nuclear powerplant in this country \nsince the oil crisis of 1973. There are those who say nuclear power \ncannot be built. I am a strong supporter of nuclear power.\n  Just because we have large supplies of natural gas, including large \nsupplies of natural gas on Federal lands, public lands, doesn't mean we \ncan use the natural gas to heat our homes. Why? Because natural gas on \nFederal lands is of no value. It must be explored for, it must be \nbrought out of the ground, and then it must be transported, which means \nbuilding pipelines, usually across Federal lands.\n  Once we realize, particularly in this administration, what the \nattitude has been, we begin to understand why Mr.\n\n[[Page S9369]]\n\nFriedman can write this somewhat sarcastic column in Tokyo. This \nadministration, for 8 years, has done everything it can to prevent the \nbuilding of additional pipelines across Federal lands. They say, no, we \ndon't want to do that; somehow it will despoil the Federal land if \nthere is a pipeline under it. I stress ``under it'' because once a \npipeline is in place, people who are out on that Federal land who love \nthe wide open spaces will not be aware of the fact that the pipeline is \nthere. The pipelines get buried, particularly natural gas pipelines, \nand the scenery is unaffected. It comes back quickly, in the age of the \nwide open spaces of the West, a few years, to recover from where a \npipeline has been buried. It is nothing more than the blink of an eye \nin nature's time. This administration is opposed to pipelines.\n  Friedman goes on to tell us that America has failed to do the kind of \nexploration and conservation that the Japanese have done. He makes this \ncomment:\n\n       Imagine if America had that sort of steely focus. Imagine, \n     in fact, if at this time of soaring oil prices and endangered \n     environments, America had a presidential candidate who could \n     offer a realistic plan for how to preserve our earth in the \n     balance.\n\n  Then Thomas Friedman goes on to make this comment, writing in the New \nYork Times:\n\n       Wait a minute--that was supposed to be Al Gore, but in the \n     heat of the campaign, Mr. Gore has shamelessly offered us \n     instead a fly-by-night plan for putting America out of \n     balance. The new Gore energy theory is to demonize the oil \n     companies, tap into the Nation's strategic oil reserve--\n     which only a few months ago he declared shouldn't be \n     touched to manipulate prices --and talk about developing \n     new magic energy-saving technologies that will create jobs \n     in the swing states where Mr. Gore needs to get elected \n     and will allow Americans to keep driving gas-guzzling big \n     cars and indulging their same energy-consuming habits \n     without pain.\n\n  I felt a little sense of satisfaction when I read that particular \nparagraph because I have just traded in my gas-guzzling car for one \nthat will get 70 miles to the gallon on the highway. I am sorry to say \nthat it is Japanese in its origin, but it is a lovely little car and I \nwill be happy to give any Member of this body a ride in it at any \npoint.\n  Back to the Friedman article, referring, again, to the Gore policy \nwith respect to energy:\n\n       How nice! How easy! And how far from what's really required \n     to free us from the grip of OPEC.\n\n  He goes on and describes what needs to be done and then makes this \ncomment:\n\n       Mr. Gore knows this, but instead of laying it on the line \n     he opted for an Olympic-quality, full-bodied pander--offering \n     a quick-fix to garner votes and pain-free solutions for the \n     future. Prime the pumps, pumps the polls and pay later. Don't \n     get me wrong, tapping the strategic reserve makes some sense \n     to ease the current distribution crisis--but doing it without \n     also offering a real program for consuming less oil and \n     finding more makes no sense at all.\n\n  I go back to the accusation made in this morning's committee hearing: \nyou who are complaining about what the President is doing, have no \nsolution yourselves, so stop complaining.\n  What Mr. Friedman is talking about illustrates what I and other \nMembers of this body have been proposing as a solution for 8 years. For \n8 years, we have been trying to increase the domestic supply of power. \nFor 8 years, we have been on this floor asking this administration to \nallow us to drill more, to find more, to produce more so that we will \nhave the supply when the demand comes. For 8 years, we have been \nsounding the alarm on the energy issue and we have been ignored by the \nPresident of the United States, or on those occasions where we have \nactually passed legislation, it has been vetoed by the President of the \nUnited States on the recommendation of the Vice President: No, we do \nnot need to go after that vast pool of oil that is there in Alaska; It \nwill despoil the environment.\n  The Senator from Alaska has pointed out if we compared this room to \nthe Alaska Natural Wildlife Reserve or ANWR, say this room is the size \nof ANWR, the footprint of the drilling would be about the size of one \nof those decorative stars in the middle of the carpet. One could cover \nit entirely with a single piece of paper 8\\1/2\\ by 11. That would be \nthe total amount of impact on the entire room in the bill that this \nCongress has passed and that the President has vetoed--not once but \ntwice.\n  Yet now when we say wait a minute, it is the action of this \nadministration that has prevented America from having the oil supplies \nwe need to deal with this crisis, we are told: you have no solution. We \nhave had a solution and we have had it for years and it is the \nPresident and the Vice President who have stymied us.\n  I don't want to overdramatize this, but I will try to be a student of \nhistory. I feel a little like Winston Churchill who for years and years \nand years warned of the coming threat, and then when it happened, he \nhad to say to his people: I have nothing to offer you but blood, toil, \ntears, and sweat.\n\n  That is overdramatic, and I do not want to overplay it. The point is, \nthere is one thing to be complaining about this over and over and then \nthere is another thing to come along and say: We are in a mess and you \nguys don't have any solution.\n  My senior colleague from Utah is here. I understand he has reserved \nthe last 10 minutes before the vote so I shall terminate my comments.\n  I want to make it clear, the solution to the problem of high oil \nprices does not lie in short-term fixes. It does not lie in the kind of \nneat conclusions that Thomas Friedman talks about. It lies in long-term \nplans and long-term policies. That being the case, we are not going to \nget out of this anytime soon.\n  I leave you with this one conclusion that came out of the witnesses. \nThey said this: If everything goes the very best that it can, if \neverything works according to our plans, home heating oil prices in New \nEngland this year will be substantially higher than they were last \nyear. That is the best-case scenario.\n  I think those who should have seen the handwriting on the wall last \nyear bear the responsibility for that situation and should not be let \noff the hook by just saying to us: Well, what's your solution?\n  We were not in charge. Those who were should bear the responsibility. \nI yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the New York Times, Sept. 26, 2000]\n\n                        Candidate in the Balance\n\n                        (By Thomas L. Friedman)\n\n       It's interesting watching the American oil crisis/debate \n     from here in Tokyo. The Japanese are cool as cucumbers \n     today--no oil protests, no oil protests, no gas lines, no \n     politicians making crazy promises. That's because Japan has \n     been preparing for this day since the 1973 oil crisis by \n     steadily introducing natural gas, nuclear power, high-speed \n     mass transit and conservation, and thereby steadily reducing \n     its dependence on foreign oil. And unlike the U.S., the \n     Japanese never wavered from that goal by falling off the \n     wagon and becoming addicted to S.U.V.'s--those they just make \n     for the Americans.\n       Imagine if America had that sort of steely focus. Imagine, \n     in fact, if at this time of soaring oil prices and endangered \n     environments, America had a presidential candidate who could \n     offer a realistic plan for how to preserve our earth in the \n     balance.\n       Wait a minute--that was supposed to be Al Gore, but in the \n     heat of the campaign Mr. Gore has shamelessly offered us \n     instead a fly-by-night plan for putting America out of \n     balance. The new Gore energy theory is to demonize the oil \n     companies, tap into the nation's strategic oil reserve--which \n     only a few months ago he declared shouldn't be touched to \n     manipulate prices--and talk about developing new magic \n     energy-saving technologies that will create jobs in the swing \n     states where Mr. Gore needs to get elected and will allow \n     Americans to keep driving gas-guzzling big cars and indulging \n     their same energy-consuming habits without pain.\n       How nice! How easy! And how far from what's really required \n     to free us from the grip of OPEC. Here is how we got into \n     this pickle, which you won't hear from Mr. Gore:\n       OPEC came along in the 1970's and pushed the crude oil \n     price up too far too fast, and it created a global economic \n     slowdown, triggered both energy conservation and widespread \n     new exploration outside of OPEC. The result was an oversupply \n     of oil from 1981 to 1998--culminating in 1998 with oil \n     falling to $10 a barrel, when the glut coincided with Asia's \n     economic crisis.\n       This cheap oil lulled us into retreating from conservation, \n     and was like a huge tax cut. And because it coincided with \n     the technology revolution, it added to the booming U.S. \n     economy, which helped fuel a world economic recovery. But \n     this boom eventually stretched OPEC's capacity for quality \n     oil, used up most of the world's oil tankers and once again \n     pushed up prices. As such, today we either have to start to \n     consume less oil--by shrinking our S.U.V.'s, raising gasoline \n     taxes and again taking conservation seriously--or find more \n     non-OPEC oil, which means figuring out how to tap more of \n     Alaska's huge natural gas reserves without spoiling Alaska's \n     pristine environment. Or else we pay the price.\n\n[[Page S9370]]\n\n       Mr. Gore knows this, but instead of laying it on the line \n     he opted for an Olympic-quality, full-body pander--offering a \n     quick fix to garner votes, and pain-free solutions for the \n     future. Prime the pumps, pump the polls and pay later. Don't \n     get me wrong, tapping the strategic reserve makes some sense \n     to ease the current distribution crisis--but doing it without \n     also offering a real program for consuming less oil and \n     finding more makes no sense at all.\n       It's also dangerous. Another name for the Gore strategy \n     would be ``The Saddam Hussein Rehabilitation Act of 2000.'' \n     Because tapping into the strategic reserve, without \n     conservation or exploration, only guarantees OPEC's \n     dominance. And when the oil market remains tight, it means \n     that Saddam is in an ideal position to hold America hostage. \n     Any time he threatens to take any of his oil off the market, \n     he can make the price soar.\n       Mr. Gore's oil pander also reminds many Democrats of what \n     it is that bothers them about the vice president. Many \n     Democrats really are not wild about him, yet they know they \n     have to vote for him over Mr. Bush. They would at least like \n     to feel good about that vote.\n       But when you hear Mr. Gore bleating that ``I will work for \n     the day when we are free forever of the dominance of big oil \n     and foreign oil''--without leveling with Americans that the \n     only way to do that is by us consuming less and drilling \n     more--you just want to cover your ears. Surely Mr. Gore is \n     better than that. Surely Gore supporters are entitled to \n     expect more from him. I guess all they can hope for now is \n     that he will show more spine and intellectual honesty as a \n     president than he has as a candidate. You really start to \n     wonder, though.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to oppose cloture on the H-1B \nvisa bill. I understand the importance of filling jobs in our high-tech \nindustry. Yet hiring more people from abroad is only a short-term stop-\ngap solution.\n  We don't have a worker shortage--We have a skill shortage. We must \nupgrade the skills of American workers.\n  If we don't start dealing with the issue of skills, we will never \nhave enough high-tech workers, and we'll perpetuate the underclass.\n  I am pleased that the H-1B visa bill would use visa fees for worker \ntraining and National Science Foundation scholarships, but we must do a \nlot more for K-12 education. That is why I want to offer an amendment \nto enable all Americans to learn the skills they need to work in the \nnew digital economy.\n  My amendment is endorsed by the NAACP, the National Council of La \nRaza, the American Library Association, and the YMCA.\n  During consideration of the budget resolution, I offered an amendment \nto create a national goal: to ensure that every child is computer \nliterate by the 8th grade, regardless of race, ethnicity, income, \ngender, geography, or disability.\n  My amendment passed unanimously. Yet in this Congress, we have done \nnothing to make this goal a reality.\n  A digital divide exists in America. Low-income, urban and rural \nfamilies are less likely to have access to the Internet and computers. \nBlack and Hispanic families are only two-fifths as likely to have \nInternet access as white families. Some schools have ten computers in \nevery classroom. In other schools, 200 students share one computer.\n  Technology is the tool; empowerment since the Civil Rights Act of \n1964, or it could result in even further divisions between races, \nregions and income groups.\n  Last year I visited New Shiloh Church in Baltimore. The pastor, \nReverend Carter is working to bring jobs and hope to his community. He \nwanted to start a technology center. He asked for my help--and I didn't \nknow how to help him. So for over a year, I've been learning about the \ndigital divide.\n  I reached out to the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, the Congressional \nBlack Caucus, people throughout Maryland, including, Speaker Cass \nTaylor, who is trying to wire western Maryland, ministers in Baltimore, \nwho want their congregations to cross the digital divide, business \nleaders, who need trained workers, and educators, who want to help \ntheir students become computer literate.\n  I learned that our Federal programs are scattered and skimpy. \nTeachers and community leaders have to forrage for assistance.\n  The private sector is doing important, exciting work in improving \naccess to technology. But technology empowerment can't be limited to a \nfew zip codes or a couple of recycled factories. We need national \npolicies and national programs.\n  We must focus on the ABC's: A--Universal Access; B--best trained--and \nbetter paid teachers; C--computer literacy for all students by the time \nthey finish 8th grade.\n  My amendment would do two things. First of all, I am focusing on \naccess. Community leaders have told me that we need to bring technology \nto where kids learn not just where we want them to learn.\n  They don't just learn in school; they learn in their communities.\n  Not every family has a computer in their home, but every American \nshould have access to computers in their community.\n  This is a truly American ideal. We are the nation that created free \npublic schools to provide every child with access to education.\n  We created community libraries across the country to provide all \nAmericans with access to books.\n  We now need to bring technology into our communities to give all \nAmericans access to technology.\n  What does this amendment do to improve access to technology? It \ncreates 1,000 community based technology centers around the country. \nThese centers would be created and run by community organizations, like \na YMCA, the Urban League, or a public library.\n  The Federal Government would provide competitive grants to community \nbased organizations.\n  At least half the funds for these sectors must come from the private \nsector. So we will be helping to build public-private partnerships \naround the country.\n  The private sector is eager to form these partnerships because their \nbiggest problem is hiring enough skilled workers.\n  What does this mean for local communities? It means a safe haven for \nchildren, where they could learn how to use computers and use them to \ndo homework or surf the Web.\n  It means job training for adults, who could use the technology \ncenters to sharpen their job skills or write their resumes.\n  These community centers can serve all regions, races, and ethnic \ngroups. They will be where they are needed, where there is limited \naccess to technology.\n  They will be in urban, rural, and suburban areas.\n  They will be in Appalachia, and urban centers, and Native American \nreservations.\n  Over 750 community organizations applied for Community Technology \nCenter grants last year.\n  We were only able to give grants to 40 community organizations.\n  There were so many excellent proposals last year that they didn't ask \nfor new applicants this year, so this year, they are funding 71 more of \nthe original applicants.\n  We must do better.\n  The second part of my amendment is about education.\n  My amendment doubles teacher training in technology.\n  Why is this important?\n  Because everywhere I go, teachers tell me that they want to help \ntheir students cross the digital divide. They need the training to do \nthis because technology without training is a hollow opportunity.\n  Yet, according to a 1998 study by the National Center for Educational \nStatistics, only 20 percent of teachers feel fully prepared to use \ntechnology in their classrooms.\n  The Maryland Superintendent of Schools, Dr. Nancy Grasmick, told me \nthat last summer, over 600 teachers from across the State volunteered \nto participate in a technology training academy. They volunteered their \ntime to go to Towson State University to learn how to use technology in \ntheir classrooms. Over 400 were turned away because of lack of funding.\n  That is why my amendment would double funding for teacher training in \ntechnology.\n  Finally, my amendment doubles funding to train new teachers. Over the \nnext 10 years, we will have to hire an additional 2 million teachers. \nIn Maryland, over half our teachers will be eligible to retire by 2002. \nWe must make sure that all new teachers have the skills they need to \nfully integrate technology into their classes.\n  Under cloture, I would not be able to offer my amendment.\n  Some of my colleagues would be glad about that.\n\n[[Page S9371]]\n\n  They would say this bill is about immigration, not education.\n  Well, I would have preferred to offer this amendment to the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act, but the majority leader pulled \nthat bill off the floor after only nine days of debate.\n  So instead of educating Americans for high-tech jobs, we are putting \na Band-Aid on the problem by relying on workers from abroad.\n  We are living in an exciting time.\n  The opportunities are tremendous: to use technology to improve our \nlives; to use technology to remove the barriers caused by income, race, \nethnicity, or geography.\n  This could mean the death of distance as a barrier for economic \ndevelopment for poor children and children of color; it could mean the \ndeath of discrimination and enable them to leap frog into the future.\n  My goal is to ensure that everyone in Maryland and in American can \ntake advantage of these opportunities, so that no one is left out or \nleft behind.\n  It would be a shame and a disgrace for this Congress to end without \nhelping all Americans to cross the digital divide.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I cannot agree with the premise of the \nH1B Visa bill. Affluent America with all of its opportunities cannot be \ndesignated skill-short. I have been in the game of technical training \nfor skills for years. At present we are attracting high-tech \nindustries, like Black Baud, training computer operators overnight. \nStop for a moment and analyze the zeal behind this movement. We have \nlearned that 20 percent of Microsoft employees are part-time. The \nemployees had brought a suit in 1992 so that they would receive stock \noptions, health care and retirement benefits as other workers \nperforming the same task. By 1998 these workers had prevailed in the \ncourts, but Microsoft put them all on part-time employment. The trend \nin these high-tech industries is to part-time. Today this amounts to 20 \nto 30 percent of those at Redmond, Washington. In Silicon Valley 42 \npercent of the employ is part-time. So high-tech is not providing the \npaying jobs to support a middle class in America. High-tech is looking \nto bring in the so-called Indian or Chinese talented at a $40,000 per \nyear rate. But these jobs can and should be trained for in the United \nStates. In fact, that is what they have told the 38,700 textile workers \nin South Carolina who have lost their jobs since NAFTA. ``We have moved \ninto a new economy'' is the cry with the rejoinder, ``retrain, \nretrain.'' So, as I set about retraining them for high-tech, the \nCongress prepares to superimpose 600,000 foreign trained before they \nhave had a chance to compete in the new economy. Mind you me, I am \ndevoted to advanced technology. I authored the successful advanced \ntechnology program now ongoing in the Department of Commerce. I believe \nAmerica's security rests with its superiority in technology. But high-\ntech doesn't provide the number of jobs that manufacture does. \nMicrosoft has 21,000 employees in Redmond, Washington; Boeing has \n100,000. And high-tech doesn't pay. I know firsthand that we can train \nthe cotton picker to become a skilled automobile manufacturer. We have \ndone this at BMW in Spartanburg, South Carolina. Incidentally, the \nquality of the product of the South Carolina BMW plant exceeds the \nquality of the Munich product. What we are really facing is a foot race \nfor the high-tech political money. I saw this in the farcical Y2K law \nadopted by the Congress. We saw it again in the foot race for the \nestate tax legislation to take care of 100 new Internet billionaires. \nAnd now we presume a non-existent national crisis in H1B for the high-\ntech political contributions. I am not joining in this charade.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article entitled ``How To Create a \nSkilled-Labor Shortage'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Sept. 6, 2000]\n\n                 How to Create a Skilled-Labor Shortage\n\n                         (By Richard Rothstein)\n\n       To alleviate apparent shortages of computer programmers, \n     President Clinton and Congress have agreed to raise a quota \n     on H-1B's, the temporary visas for skilled foreigners. The \n     annual limit will go to 200,000 next year, up from 65,000 \n     only three years ago.\n       The imported workers, most of whom come from India, are \n     said to be needed because American schools do not graduate \n     enough young people with science and math skills. Microsoft's \n     chairman, William H. Gates, and Intel's chairman, Andrew S. \n     Grove, told Congress in June that more visas were only a \n     stopgap until education improved.\n       But the crisis is a mirage. High-tech companies portray a \n     shortage, yet it is our memories that are short: only \n     yesterday there was a glut of science and math graduates.\n       The computer industry took advantage of that glut by \n     reducing wages. This discouraged youths from entering the \n     field, creating the temporary shortages of today. Now, taking \n     advantage of a public preconception that school failures have \n     created the problem, industry finds a ready audience for its \n     demands to import workers.\n       This newspaper covered the earlier surplus extensively. In \n     1992, it reported that 1 in 5 college graduates had a job not \n     requiring a college degree. A 1995 article headlined ``Supply \n     Exceeds Demand for Ph.D.'s in Many Science Fields'' cited \n     nation-wide unemployment of engineers, mathematicians and \n     scientists. ``Overproduction of Ph.D. degrees,'' it noted, \n     ``seems to be highest in computer science.''\n       Michael S. Teitelbaum, a demographer who served as vice \n     chairman of the Commission on Immigration Reform, said in \n     1996 that there was ``an employer's market'' for technology \n     workers, partly because of post-cold-war downsizing in \n     aerospace.\n       In fields with real labor scarcity, wages rise. Yet despite \n     accounts of dot-com entrepreneurs' becoming millionaires, \n     trends in computer technology pay do not confirm a need to \n     import legions of programmers.\n       Salary offers to new college graduates in computer science \n     averaged $39,000 in 1986 and had declined by 1994 to $33,000 \n     (in constant dollars). The trend reversed only in the late \n     1990's.\n       The West Coast median salary for experienced software \n     engineers was $71,100 in 1999, up only 10 percent (in \n     constant dollars) from 1990. This pay growth of about 1 \n     percent a year suggests no labor shortage.\n       Norman Matloff, a computer science professor at the \n     University of California, contends that high-tech companies \n     create artificial shortages by refusing to hire experienced \n     programmers. Many with technology degrees no longer work in \n     the field. By age 50, fewer than half are still in the \n     industry. Luring them back requires higher pay.\n       Industry spokesmen say older programmers with outdated \n     skills would take too long to retrain. But Dr. Matloff \n     counters by saying that when they urge more H-1B visas, \n     lobbyists demonstrate a shortage by pointing to vacancies \n     lasting many months. Companies could train older programmers \n     in less time than it takes to process visas for cheaper \n     foreign workers.\n       Dr. Matloff says that in addition to the pay issue, the \n     industry rejects older workers because they will not work the \n     long hours typical at Silicon Valley companies with youthful \n     ``singles'' styles. Imported labor, he argues, is only a way \n     to avoid offering better conditions to experienced \n     programmers. H-1B workers, in contrast, cannot demand higher \n     pay; visas are revoked if workers leave their sponsoring \n     companies.\n       As for young computer workers, the labor market has \n     recently tightened, with rising wages, because college \n     students say earlier wage declines and stopped majoring in \n     math and science. In 1996, American colleges awarded 25,000 \n     bachelor's degrees in computer science, down from 42,000 in \n     1985.\n       The reason is not that students suddenly lacked \n     preparation. On the contrary, high school course-taking in \n     math and science, including advanced placement, had climbed. \n     Further, math scores have risen; last year 24 percent of \n     seniors who took the SAT scored over 600 in math. But only 6 \n     percent planned to major in computer science, and many of \n     these cannot get into college programs.\n       The reason: colleges themselves have not yet adjusted to \n     new demand. In some places, computer science courses are so \n     oversubscribed that students must get on waiting lists as \n     high school juniors.\n       With a time lag between student choice of majors and later \n     job quests, high schools and colleges cannot address short-\n     term supply and demand shifts for particular professions. \n     Such shortages can be erased only by raising wages to attract \n     those with needed skills who are now working in other \n     fields--or by importing low-paid workers.\n       For the longer term, rising wages can guide counselors to \n     encourage well-prepared students to major in computer science \n     and engineering, and colleges will adjust to rising demand. \n     But more H-1B immigrants can have a perverse effect, as their \n     lower pay signals young people to avoid this field in the \n     future keeping the domestic supply artificially low.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I regret that the Latino and Immigrant \nFairness Act, which I enthusiastically support, has fallen victim to \npolitical currents in the Senate that do a disservice to the many \nLatino and other immigrants who rightly deserve the status this \nlegislation would afford them. I strongly support the H-1B visa bill \nbut, like my colleagues, recognize that attaching the Latino and \nImmigrant Fairness Act to it would likely prevent the high-tech worker \nlegislation's passage in the 106th Congress. Indeed, the\n\n[[Page S9372]]\n\nHouse leadership has indicated that it will not bring the H-1B visa \nbill to the floor with the Fairness provisions attached--a position I \nstrongly disagree with.\n  Senators who support passage of both the H-1B bill and the Fairness \nAct thus find themselves in the position of being forced to vote \nagainst a procedural motion to allow consideration of the Fairness \nprovisions to keep alive our hope of raising visa caps for the high-\ntech workers our companies so desperately need.\n  I hope the Senate will have the opportunity to vote on passage of the \nLatino and Immigrant Fairness Act before the 106th Congress adjourns. \nIt is the right thing to do, and our leaders on both sides of the aisle \nshould find a way to bring it to a vote.\n  Throughout my political career, I have been deeply honored by the \nsupport of Latinos and other immigrants in my home state of Arizona. \nOur compassion and advocacy of family values for all members of our \nsociety, including hard-working, tax-paying Latinos who have resided in \nthis nation for many years, require us to take a closer look at the \nLatino and Immigrant Fairness Act than has been afforded us during the \nH-1B visa debate. I look forward to an up-or-down vote on this \nlegislation and will support its passage.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, earlier today I voted against suspending the \nrule to allow for the consideration of the Latino and Immigration \nFairness Act as an amendment to the H-1B visa legislation.\n  I opposed suspending the rules because the Latino and Immigration \nFairness Act sends the wrong message to those persons who might \nconsider illegally entering the United States. Under current law, a \nperson who enters this country as a temporary alien or nonimmigrant \nmust return to his native country after his temporary papers have \nexpired if he wants to apply for permanent residency in the United \nStates. This amendment would allow these nomimmigrants to pay a $1,000 \nfee to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) in order to \nremain in the United States while they apply for permanent residency. \nAdvocates of this provision argue that this fee would be a significant \nsource of income for the INS. That may be so, but, at the same time, \nthe amendment would allow for illegal immigrants to legally work in the \nUnited States while their residency application is pending, and send \nthe message abroad that this is the preferred route to U.S. residence. \nAlthough it may be inconvenient for eligible aliens who are in the \nUnited States to have to apply for residency from outside of the United \nStates, that is not a sufficient reason for giving them an advantage \nthat is unavailable to other hopeful immigrants who are patiently \nwaiting abroad for their opportunity to legally immigrate.\n  Similarly, the Latino and Immigration Fairness Act would extend the \nregistration time line for immigrants who are here illegally to apply \nfor permanent residence if they entered the country prior to 1986. \nWhile this provision would allow immigrants of good moral conduct to \napply for permanent residency, it also rewards immigrants who managed \nto stay in the United States illegally. What is worse is, that it sends \nthe unfortunate message that is possible to gain permanent residency in \nthe United States regardless of whether you are an alien who arrived \nhere legally or illegally.\n  I am opposed to Congress' sending these mixed signals to immigrants \nentering this country. The Immigration and Nationality Act, our primary \nlaw for regulating immigration into this country, sets out a very \nspecific process by which nonimmigrants may apply for permanent \nresidency in this country. The Latino and Immigration Fairness Act \nwould effectively create short cuts around this process by allowing \nillegal immigrants to circumvent the normal rules. This is not the \nmessage I want to send abroad.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today in support of \nS. 2045, the American Competitiveness in the Twenty-First Century Act.\n  This bill provides for an increase in foreign workers possessing \nspecial skills to enter the United States on a temporary basis in the \nfield of information technology.\n  This bill also encourages more young people to study mathematics, \nengineering, and computer science to insure that in the future, \nAmericans can fill these high technology jobs.\n  I support this legislation, but I do have some concerns about the \npotential for the theft of American technology through immigrant high-\ntech workers.\n  H-1B is a visa classification. H-1B visas were created for non-\nimmigrant foreign nationals admitted to the U.S. on a temporary basis. \nThese H-1B visas are valid for three years and can be renewed for an \nadditional three years.\n  In order to qualify for H-1B visa status, an individual must be in a \nspecialty occupation which requires a theoretical and practical \napplication of a body of highly specialized knowledge and at least a \nbachelor's degree in the specific specialty area.\n  In 1998, Congress passed, and the President signed, legislation \nincreasing the annual ceiling for admission of H-1B visas from 115,000 \nin fiscal year 1999 and 2000, and 107,500 in fiscal year 2001.\n  In 1999, it took nine months to exhaust the H-1B annual ceiling. This \nyear the ceiling was reached in 6 months. The high tech industry has \nnot filled these jobs and the American economy is paying the price.\n  Another provision of this legislation addresses the long-term problem \nthat too few U.S. students are excelling in mathematics, computer \nscience, and engineering. We need to encourage more young people to \nstudy mathematics, engineering, and computer science and to train more \nAmericans in these areas, so that there will be no need in the future \nfor H-1B visas.\n  I do have national security concerns about the H-1B visa program. I \nwould like to see a proper screening of candidates for H-1B visas by \nthe Immigration and Naturalization Services to ensure that these \nforeign nationals do not steal technology for export to a foreign \ngovernment.\n  I will be monitoring the implementation of this new law to ensure \nthat national security and intellectual property rights are protected.\n  We also need to make a better effort to encourage these companies to \ntrain and recruit American workers for these high paying jobs.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the Senate support this increase in the \nceiling on H-1B visas and this increase in funding to train young \nAmericans to fill these important jobs in the high tech industry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: How much time is \nleft on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority controls all remaining time until \n4:30.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ndistinguished Senator from Connecticut be granted 5 minutes to make \nwhatever speech he desires, and that there be an additional 10 minutes \nfor me to conclude my remarks on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Utah. As always, \nhe is very gracious.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in support of the pending motion made by \nthe Democratic leader on behalf of the Latino fairness legislation, and \nalso in support of the underlying H-1B visa legislation. First, let me \nspeak to the H-1B legislation, which is so vital to the economic growth \nof our nation. This legislation both raises the limit on the number of \nforeign high-tech workers admitted to the United States each year, and \ninvests vital funds in educating our American students, especially \nthose in low-income areas, in math, science, and technology. This is a \ncritically important bill that is necessary to maintain the dynamic \ngrowth we have seen in the high-tech sector of our economy over both \nthe short- and long-term.\n  We live in a remarkable period of prosperity. Just today we read in \nour newspapers that the poverty rate in America is the lowest in 20 \nyears, while median household income is at an all time high--over \n$40,000 a year. Yet, we can do more to lift the tide of growth for all \nAmericans. Currently, approximately 190,000 high-tech jobs go unfilled \nin America each year, and it is expected that close to 1.3 million \nhigh-tech jobs will be unfilled in 2006. Our\n\n[[Page S9373]]\n\nhigh-tech businesses are hurting for employees, and there are not \nenough American students graduating with technology degrees to fill \nthese jobs. The short-term answer to this shortage of technology \nskilled workers is simple: we must admit more highly-trained foreign \nworkers to the United States. This legislation will do that by raising \nthe number of H-1B visas issued to 195,000.\n  Yet, in the long-run, we should not simply keep importing foreign \nworkers to shore up our workforce. We must do a better job of preparing \nour own students to seek careers in technology. That is why the \neducation and training provisions included in this bill are so \nimportant. By making an investment in math and science education for \nour young people, especially those students who live in our low-income \nareas, we are investing in their future as well as America's future.\n  Having said that, we must remember that the economic prosperity that \nwe enjoy today is not being distributed equally. There is a cloud \nbehind the silver lining of our current prosperity. The gap between the \nmost affluent Americans and the rest of the population is widening, and \npoverty rates are still too high. 11.8 percent of our citizens live \nbelow the poverty line. True, that number is the lowest in years. \nHowever, it also means that 32.2 million Americans cannot afford the \nbasic necessities of life. A disproportionate number of those who live \nin poverty are minorities, including a great many who have left their \ncountry of birth for a better life in America.\n  This is one of the reasons why when we talk about H-1B visas we must \nalso talk about the Latino Fairness Act. This act will help restore \nfairness and parity to our immigration laws, keeping families together \nand encouraging more Hispanics to work lawfully. This bill has three \npurposes;\n  First, it will update the date of registry to 1986, recognizing that \nimmigrants who have lived in the United States for a very long time \nhave deep roots here, and it is best to put them on a track toward \ncitizenship.\n  Second, it would restore section 245(I) of the immigration code to \nallow immigrants who are undergoing the process of legalization to \napply for their visas in the United States, rather than forcing them to \nleave the country and reenter, sometimes causing them to be ``locked-\nout'' of the United States for years.\n  Finally, the Latino Fairness Act would guarantee that Latinos from \nstrife-torn nations are treated the same under immigration law. \nThe oppression that residents of one Latin American country have \nsuffered should not be considered more or less grave than the \noppression faced by the residents of another country where serious \nhuman rights abuses have been committed. By improving parity and \nequality in our immigration law, this bill would even the playing field \nfor many Latin Americans who want to come to this country and be \nreferred to as simply ``Americans.'' In fact, I would hope that as we \ncontinue efforts to enact this legislation, we would consider expanding \nthe list of covered nationalities to include people from countries that \nalso experience economic strife.\n\n  I would like to take a moment to share with you the story of just one \nof the many immigrants that would be helped by this law. Gheycell moved \nto the United States in 1991, when she was 12 years old, with her \nfather and sister from war-torn Guatemala. She went to school and \nbecame an active member of her community. In high school, she formed a \nclub to help homeless adults and children in Los Angeles. Her father \napplied for asylum and they were all given work permits. Gheycell \naspired to go to college to become a teacher and help others. She could \nnot afford to go to a state university so she went to community college \nwhile working full time to save money for university tuition. Her \nfather has applied for permanent residence under current law, but \nGheycell has turned 21 and no longer qualifies for adjustment of status \nthrough her father's application. Her work permit has expired and she \nis now undocumented. She must return to Guatemala where she will not \nhave the opportunities she has here. Her father and sister are not \ngetting their green cards and Gheycell does not want to be separated \nfrom her family or give up her dream of educating and helping children \nhere in her adopted homeland.\n  Do we really want to be responsible for turning Gheycell away from \nher dream? America needs more teachers. Why are we sending this \ndedicated American away? Denying Gheycell a visa is both her and \nAmerica's loss. That is why we must act to help Gheycell and others \nlike her. Reforming our immigration laws is not only an issue that is \nimportant for our economy, but is also important to our values as a \nnation. If we truly believe in family values, we need to value \nfamilies. We should be trying to keep families together, especially \nthose families with children that need two wage-earners to stay above \nthe poverty line. The Latino Fairness Act, as much as any other \nlegislation this Congress will consider, tells Americans and the world \nthat we do value families. It says that we will not turn family members \naway when they have for years been a part of America--working, serving \ntheir community, and contributing to the well-being of their families \nand our country.\n  We read stories every day in the paper and in magazines about the \ninnovators and leaders of the new economy. Thanks in many respects to \nthem, the technology sector is booming. That sector now needs the \nrelief that the H-1B legislation will provide. However, we must \nremember that people like Gheycell also exist--people who are not the \nsubject of biographies and ``man-of-the-year'' awards--that need relief \ntoo.\n  Whle the Latino Fairness measures may not be technically germane to \nthe H-1B bill, they are highly relevant to the issues we are debating \ntoday. The general goal of the H-1B legislation is to admit immigrants \nto our country to work and contribute to our economic prosperity. Why \nthen are we attempting to limit consideration of a bill that would \nallow people who have been living and working in the United States to \nstay here and continue to contribute to our prosperity? We seem to be \ngiving with one hand, and taking with the other. By obstructing the \nLatino Fairness Act, we are effectively closing our doors and \ncontributing to a process that will result in the departure of people \nthat have been working and adding to our prosperity for years. At a \ntime when job vacancies are commonplace, we can't afford as a nation to \nturn people out. If we want to help the high tech community, our \neconomic well-being, and families, we need to pass both the H-1B and \nLatino fairness bills, and I hope that my colleagues will agree with me \non this matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous agreement, the Senator from \nUtah is recognized for 10 minutes prior to the vote.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I spoke at length this morning on the \nissues before us, so I will try and be brief now.\n  First, let me begin by emphasizing how critical this bill is for our \ncountry's future. The second vote this afternoon is on the Hatch \nsubstitute to the underlying bill, S. 2045. Like the bill, the \nsubstitute raises the annual cap on H-1B visas to 195,000 in each of \nthe next three years. The increase in the number of highly skilled \ntemporary workers will help American companies continue to create jobs \nin this country and maintain their competitiveness in the global \neconomy.\n  But this substitute, however, does a lot more. The use of skilled \nforeign labor is nothing more than a temporary stop gap solution to a \nlong term problem we face in this Century. The problem is one of \nensuring that our high tech industry has an adequate number of highly \ntrained and educated workers to fill the demand. To hear some of my \ncolleagues in recent days, one would think there is nothing in this \nbill on educating our young people and training our workforce. That is \nsimple and completely inaccurate. The substitute contains important \neducation and training provisions, worked out with my colleagues--\nincluding Senators Lieberman, Feinstein, Kennedy, and Abraham. Senators \nAbraham and Kennedy are respectively the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Immigration Subcommittee. These provisions use the fees generated \nby these visas to finance important education and training programs for \nour children and our current workforce. These are critical measures for \nour country.\n  That, Mr. President, is the matter at hand. Unfortunately, however, \nmuch of the discussion and debate this week\n\n[[Page S9374]]\n\nhas been on an unrelated and far-reaching immigration matter--the so-\ncalled Latino fairness bill. As I noted in some detail this morning, \nthis measure, which purports to simply restore due process to a limited \ngroup is a broad, far-reaching and costly new amnesty program, \nconservatively estimated to cost $1.4 billion over the next 10 years. \nIt provides amnesty to hundreds of thousands if not millions of illegal \naliens on an ongoing basis--or, in other words, an amnesty, ``rolling'' \namnesty--over the next 5 years. That is right, Mr. President--it is a \nrolling amnesty, obviously creating an incentive for illegal aliens to \ncontinue to escape the law because the rewards for those who are most \neffective at remaining in this country illegally happen to be permanent \nresident status.\n  But this so-called Latino fairness is no fairness at all--no fairness \nto the millions of immigrants who have and will continue to play by the \nrules and follow the legal process. I have said to my friends on the \nother side, if we are so eager to increase the supply of labor from \nabroad, if we are so eager to unify families, then perhaps we should \nexamine lifting the caps on legal immigrants or at least cutting down \ntheir waiting periods.\n  I am willing to work on that, but I can never get any cooperation \nfrom the other side. They want to have a ``rolling'' amnesty for \nseveral million illegal aliens in this country who can evade the law \nfor a matter of time and then be eligible for full nonresident status \non the way to citizenship.\n  To summarize:\n  First, the so-called Latino fairness bill extends a broad amnesty to \nillegal immigrants here since 1986.\n  Second, it is a ``rolling'' amnesty, so that over the next 5 years we \nmove the date up to 1991.\n  Third, a conservative CBO estimate, even without considering the \n``rolling'' provision, puts the cost of the amnesty at $1.4 billion \nover 10 years.\n  Fourth, this provision rewards illegal immigrants who have been the \nmost effective in evading law enforcement.\n  What this proposal does not do, and what I think real Latino fairness \nwould be is:\n  First, we should increase the number of legal immigrants allowed in \nthis country annually if such an increase is needed to ensure an \nadequate labor supply and greater family unification. This would be a \nwise thing to do. It would be a fair thing to do. It would also be the \nlegal thing to do, compared to what they are trying to do over there.\n  They are trying to enact a bill that they did not even have the \nforesight to bring up on the floor or to file until July 25 of this \nyear.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. I only have a limited period of time, so I have to finish \nmy remarks.\n  Second, we should expedite INS review of petitions by family members \nof citizens. Let's face it, the INS is in a mess right now, and it \ncould be reformed to expedite the processing of legal immigrants.\n  Third, we should restore the right of persons allowed amnesty back in \n1986 to have their claims adjudicated.\n  These three changes in law, in contrast to what is proposed today by \nour friends on the other side, would be real Latino fairness. It would \nreward those who have followed the law and played by the rules.\n  So this is where we are. The vote we are about to have on suspending \nthe rules is a ``have it both ways'' vote. My colleagues voted \noverwhelmingly for cloture yesterday--including almost all Democrats \nand all Republicans. The last time I looked, cloture meant the \ninability to consider nongermane amendments.\n  Today, many of these same persons who voted for cloture are voting to \nsuspend the results of that vote and allow debate on this unrelated \nmeasure. Tomorrow, they will probably vote for cloture again.\n  So on Tuesday, the high-tech community gets its vote. On Wednesday, \nmany of the same group vote to undo their vote, and on Thursday they \nvote with high tech again. Oh, it is confusing when you are trying to \nhave it both ways.\n  I hope no one will be fooled by what is happening. I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose suspending the rules, which is an extraordinary \nprocedural move aimed at playing politics.\n  I am told that this procedure of suspending the rules has not been \nused since 1982. I do not believe it has ever been used in this manner \nfor crass political purposes and maneuvering. I hope it will be \noverwhelmingly rejected. I hope that, once again, we will vote for \ncloture on this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the Chamber \nof Commerce dated September 26, 2000, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                     U.S. Chamber of Commerce,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 26, 2000.\n       To Members of the United States Senate: On behalf of the \n     U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business \n     federation representing more than three million businesses \n     and organizations of every size, sector, and region, I wish \n     to clarify our position with regard to the current debate on \n     the H-1B legislation and proposals unrelated to that \n     legislation concerning legalization of certain workers \n     already in the United States. During this afternoon's debate \n     on this issue, there have been misleading statements as to \n     the Chamber's position on provisions relating to updating the \n     registry date, restoring section 245(i), and adjustments for \n     certain Central Americans.\n       While the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, as part of the \n     Essential Worker Immigration Coalition, has expressed its \n     general support for these concepts, it strongly opposes \n     efforts to amend the pending H-1B legislation with these \n     provisions. These are completely separate issues and must be \n     considered separately.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  R. Bruce Josten.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have heard all this talk on the other \nside about how all these people are supporting what they want to do. It \njust ``ain't'' true. Let me read this letter dated September 26, 2000:\n\n       To Members of the United States Senate: On behalf of the \n     U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business \n     federation representing more than three million businesses \n     and organizations of every size, sector, and region, I wish \n     to clarify our position with regard to the current debate on \n     the H-1B legislation and proposals unrelated to that \n     legislation concerning legalization of certain workers \n     already in the United States.

Bruce Josten.\n                      Executive Vice President Government Affairs.\n\n  Mr. President, it is remarkable to say all these organizations \nsupport this type of extraordinary procedural maneuvering. Because when \nyou really look at what the organizations support, they support a \nregular process whereby the committee with jurisdiction holds real \nsubstantive hearings to determine what is right and what is wrong. The \norganizations do not support just slamming some bill that would change \nour immigration laws wholesale--on the floor at the last minute--for no \nother reason than to try to indicate that they are currying favor with \ncertain groups in this society. In reality this so-called Latino \nfairness bill would undermine every one of the people who have come \nhere legally, have earned their right to be citizens, and have abided \nby the rules of this country.\n  That is just not right. I think this type of procedural maneuvering \nand politicking should not occur on something where most everybody in \nthis body agrees. And we--most everybody--agrees that this bill should \npass.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the pending motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The assistant minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the majority leader leaves the floor, \nI know that he and the minority leader have had the opportunity to \nspeak this afternoon. I haven't had an opportunity to speak since that \ntook place.\n  For purposes of informing Members, could the leader give us some idea \nof what we can expect. We know that tomorrow is pretty well filled up. \nWe have 7 hours set aside for the continuing resolution, but there is \nsome progress being made on various bills. Energy and water, they are \nreading that now. Hopefully, that might be filed tonight.\n  Mr. LOTT. I might say, Mr. President, I know the Senator from Nevada \nhelped with some of the completion efforts on that energy and water \nappropriations bill. We should have it ready, hopefully, to be \nconsidered tomorrow; if not tomorrow, then the first part of next week.\n  I yield further for his questions and then I have some answers for \nhim.\n  Mr. REID. On the H-1B, we are ready to vote on it. We have tried to \nhave a vote on the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act. There was one \nthis afternoon that this Senator considers a vote on that amendment. \nPerhaps we are arriving at a point where we can start moving some of \nthese things because I know we are going to get out of here next \nThursday or Friday.\n  Mr. LOTT. That sounds like an excellent suggestion to me, Mr. \nPresident.\n  If I could respond, of course, the Senator is correct when he noted \nthat we have, I believe, 7 hours of time that will be consumed, if it \nis all used, to discuss the continuing resolution. And, of course, we \nwould have a vote at the end of that time. Obviously, Senator Reid and \nothers have made their points on the immigration issue. The H-1B issue, \nhopefully, we could come to agreement to have a vote scheduled on that. \nAnd I would like to work with the minority in determining what time \nthey would find agreeable to have that vote. Perhaps we could do that \ntomorrow. I am fixing to ask consent that we consider the D.C. \nappropriations bill, which would give us a time agreement on that, if \nwe could get that.\n\n  On the appropriations bills, it is like all appropriations \nconferences. They are never closed until they are closed. There are one \nor two issues that are very important that are still pending on a \nnumber of them. Interior appropriations, I believe, is very close to \nclosure. There is still discussion going on with regard to so-called \nlands legacy funding and the CARA conservation bill.\n  The Agriculture appropriations bill is very close to conclusion. Once \nagain, we have a couple of issues that have to be dealt with in \nfinality. One of them is how do you deal with the sanctions question. A \nlot of people are making suggestions and, hopefully, a compromise can \nbe reached that satisfies the great majority of the Senate and the \nHouse, Republicans and Democrats.\n  We think we are very close on the HUD-VA appropriations bill. The \ninformation I get is the administration is signaling that they think \nthat could be an acceptable bill. There might be some issues that would \nbe considered being added to that, not necessarily appropriations \nbills.\n  The Transportation appropriations bill, I believe, is for the most \npart done, with one remaining issue that is very difficult to resolve. \nBut I know the Senator from New Jersey has a very passionate feeling \nabout that. I understand that. So there are at least four or five \nappropriations bills that are pretty close to being wrapped up in terms \nof the dollar amounts. There is about one policy issue left on each one \nof them.\n  We hope to have two or three of those done, perhaps in the House of \nRepresentatives tomorrow, and then as quickly as we could get to them \nafter that, we would want to do that.\n  I might say, I am expecting that we will be in session obviously on \nMonday. We do have the Jewish holiday to honor on Friday, September 29. \nBut we will expect to be here on Monday, October 2, and could be having \nvotes on these conferences that Monday.\n  I want to give Senators as much notice as we can, although we have \nindicated for quite some time that that first week in the new fiscal \nyear, obviously we will have to be prepared to be in session the whole \nweek and into the night, if necessary.\n  Those are the issues we now have identified. There are a number of \nother issues that are being worked on. The Finance Committee has been \ndoing some work on the railroad retirement bill and on the community \nrenewal legislation, two issues in which I know there is a lot of \ninterest on both sides of the Capitol. I will give the Senator that \nlist, and, hopefully, we can begin to work together to move a number of \nthese. I believe I sense that opportunity now, when maybe it hadn't \nbeen quite ready for that earlier.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/27/senate-section/article/S9376-3", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9376-S9377]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          HEROISM OF WILLIBALD C. BIANCHI AND LEO K. THORSNESS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the state of South Dakota has just \ndedicated a very special park at my alma mater, South Dakota State \nUniversity. This park holds two new granite markers, each honoring a \nformer SDSU student who won the Congressional Medal of Honor, our \nnation's highest award for valor in action against an enemy force.\n  Today I offer my solemn appreciation to these great Americans: First \nLieutenant Willibald C. Bianchi, whose heroism occurred in the \nPhilippines during the first weeks of World War II, and Lt. Colonel Leo \nK. Thorsness, who was decorated for his feats as a fighter pilot over \nNorth Vietnam.\n  First Lieutenant Bianchi, a Minnesota native, was a football player \nat SDSU and graduated in 1940 with a degree in animal science. During \nWorld War II, he served in the 45th Infantry, Philippine Scouts, one of \nthe largest units in the Philippines during the Japanese invasion of \nDecember 1941. The invasion was brutally effective and, after less than \na month, our Filipino and American troops were forced to retreat onto \nthe Bataan Peninsula where they mounted a final stand against a \nnumerically superior foe.\n  For three desperate months, the Americans and Filipinos battled the \nJapanese in a sweltering, mountainous jungle. Food was limited and \nmedical supplies scarce. About a month into the fight, however, First \nLieutenant Bianchi participated in a crucial series of battles that \nhelped eliminate a pocket of Japanese troops behind the American line.\n  Four days after the Japanese incursion, our forces targeted ``the Big \nPocket'' in a coordinated infantry-tank attack. A tank was lost and \nonly slight gains made. On February 3, our forces tried again. Although \nhe was assigned to another unit, First Lieutenant Bianchi volunteered \nto join a rifle platoon that was directed to destroy two machine gun \nnests. While leading part of the platoon, First Lieutenant Bianchi was \nstruck by two bullets in his left hand. Refusing to pause for first \naid, he dropped his rifle and began firing a pistol. He located one of \nthe\n\n[[Page S9377]]\n\nmachine gun nests and silenced it with grenades. When wounded again, \nthis time by machine gun bullets through his chest muscles, First \nLieutenant Bianchi climbed atop an American tank, seized its anti-\naircraft gun, and fired into another enemy position until he was \nknocked off the tank by a third severe bullet wound.\n  This story has a sad ending. First Lieutenant Bianchi survived that \nday and returned to the fight a month later. The American-Filipino \nforces crushed ``the Big Pocket'' about a week after his heroics. But \nthe Japanese would take Bataan in the end, and First Lieutenant Bianchi \nwas sent off on the Bataan Death March. Though he survived the march, \nhe died on January 9, 1945, when an American plane bombed a Japanese \nprison ship, not realizing that it held Americans.\n  The other hero memorialized in Brookings is Lt. Colonel Leo \nThorsness, with whom I share some history. We both studied at SDSU, we \nboth served in the Air Force, and we both ran for South Dakota's 1st \nCongressional District seat in 1978. While I prevailed, it was only by \nthe skin of my teeth--110 votes out of more than 129,000 total ballots. \nAnd from that struggle, I gained a first-hand appreciation of the \nspirit, determination and patriotism of Leo Thorsness. For me, that \nexperience enhances my appreciation for the remarkable story of a 35-\nyear-old Air Force major who, in the words of his strike force \ncommander, took on ``most of North Vietnam all by himself.''\n\n  Lt. Colonel Thorsness had served as a pilot for about 15 years when \nhe was assigned to the 357th Tactical Fighter Squadron at Takhli Royal \nThai Air Base. Lt. Colonel Thorsness was sent in just months after the \nSoviet Union began supplying North Vietnam with surface-to-air missiles \n(SAMs), and his mission was a new and dangerous one--distract and \ndestroy the SAMs so that U.S. bombers could deliver their ordnance.\n  At one o'clock in the afternoon on Wednesday, April 19, 1967, his F-\n105 screamed off the runway, headed for the Xuan Mai army barracks and \nstorage supply area, 37 miles southwest of Hanoi. Lt. Colonel Thorsness \nand his wingman attacked from the south, while another pair of F-105s \nattacked from the north. He silenced one SAM site with missiles, and \nthen destroyed a second SAM site with bombs. But in the attack on the \nsecond site, Lt. Colonel Thorsness' wingman was shot down by intensive \nanti-aircraft fire, and the plane's pilot and electronic warfare \nofficer were forced to eject over North Vietnam. Lt. Colonel Thorsness \ncircled their parachutes and relayed their position to search and \nrescue crews. While he was circling, a MIG-17 was sighted in the area. \nLt. Colonel Thorsness immediately initiated an attack and destroyed the \nMIG, but he was then forced to depart the area in search of an aerial \ntanker for refueling.\n  After learning that rescue helicopters had arrived, but that no \nadditional F-105s were arriving to provide cover, Lt. Colonel Thorsness \nreturned alone, flying back through an area bristling with SAMs and \nanti-aircraft guns to the downed flyers' position. As he approached, he \nspotted four MIG-17 aircraft, which he attacked, damaging one and \ndriving away the rest. Soon it became clear that Lt. Colonel Thorsness' \nplane lacked sufficient fuel to continue protecting the rescue \noperation and that he would have to find an aerial tanker. On his way \nto the tanker, however, Lt. Colonel Thorsness received a distress call \nfrom a fellow F-105 pilot who had gotten lost in battle and was running \ncritically low on fuel. In response, Lt. Colonel Thorsness allowed that \npilot to refuel at the tanker, while he himself flew toward the Thai \nborder, a decision that may have saved the other plane and the life of \nits pilot, according to the Medal of Honor citation. Lt. Colonel \nThorsness managed to return to a forward operating base--``With 70 \nmiles to go, I pulled the power back to idle and we just glided in,'' \nhe would recall later. ``We were indicating `empty' when the runway \ncame up just in front of us.''\n  A week-and-a-half later, on a similar mission, Lt. Colonel Thorsness \nwas shot down over North Vietnam by a heat-seeking missile from a MIG-\n21. He spent the next six years as a North Vietnamese prisoner of war. \nHe was released on March 4, 1973, and in October of that year, the \nPresident of the United States draped the light blue ribbon of the \nCongressional Medal of Honor around Lt. Colonel Thorsness' neck.\n  The official citation says: ``Lt. Colonel Thorsness' extraordinary \nheroism, self-sacrifice, and personal bravery involving conspicuous \nrisk of life were in the highest traditions of the military service and \nhave reflected great credit upon himself and the U.S. Air Force.'' I \ncould not have put it any better myself.\n  With this statement before the United States Senate, I join in \nsaluting First Lieutenant Bianchi and Lt. Colonel Thorsness. As \nCongressional Medal of Honor winners, they are a symbol of the finest \nour nation has to offer. Their feats serve as extraordinary lessons in \ncourage, commitment, and self sacrifice, and I am proud that they are \nidentified with my home state.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/27/senate-section/article/S9377-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9377-S9378]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    THE PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS FOR GOVERNMENT ATTORNEYS ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I spoke earlier this month about the \ncontinuing problems for Federal law enforcement caused by the so-called \nMcDade law, which was slipped into the omnibus appropriations law at \nthe end of the last Congress. I discussed how the interplay of the \nMcDade law and a recent attorney ethics decision by the Oregon Supreme \nCourt is severely hampering Federal law enforcement efforts in Oregon. \nOregon's Federal prosecutors will no longer use federally authorized \ninvestigative techniques such as wiretaps and consensual monitoring, \nand by the end of this week, the FBI will shut down Portland's Innocent \nImages undercover operation, which targets child pornography and \nexploitation. This is just the latest example of how the McDade law has \nimpeded important criminal prosecutions, chilled the use of traditional \nFederal investigative techniques and posed multiple hurdles for Federal \nprosecutors.\n  Due to my serious concerns about the adverse effects of the McDade \nlaw on Federal law enforcement efforts, I introduced S. 855, the \nProfessional Standards for Government Attorneys Act, on April 21, 1999. \nThe Justice Department has called this legislation ``a good approach \nthat addresses the two most significant problems caused by the McDade \nAmendment--confusion about what rule applies and the issue of contacts \nwith represented parties.''\n  Since that time, I have conferred with a number of lawmakers from \nboth sides of the aisle about crafting an alternative to the McDade \nlaw. Together, we worked out a proposal based on S. 855, which would \naddress the problems that have caused by the McDade law, while adhering \nto the basic premise of that law-- that the Department of Justice \nshould not have the authority it long claimed either to write its own \nethics rules or to exempt its lawyers from the ethics rules adopted by \nthe Federal courts. Based on these discussions, I am filing this \nsubstitute amendment to my bill, S. 855.\n  I regret that we have squandered opportunities to move any corrective \nlegislation through the Congress. The consequences of our inaction have \nbeen severe, as I have discussed, and it is clear that Federal law \nenforcement efforts will continue to suffer if we do not act now.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the substitute amendment and a \nsection-by-section summary be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Summary of the Professional Standards for Government Attorneys Act of \n                                  2000\n\n\n                              1. overview\n\n       The Professional Standards for Government Attorneys Act of \n     2000 adheres to the basic premise of section 801 of the \n     omnibus appropriations act for fiscal year 1999 (Pub. L. 105-\n     277), commonly known as the McDade law: the Department of \n     Justice does not have the authority it has long claimed to \n     write its own ethics rules. The proposed legislation would \n     establish that the Department may not unilaterally exempt \n     federal trial lawyers from the rules of ethics adopted by the \n     federal courts. Federal courts are the more appropriate body \n     to establish rules of professional responsibility for federal \n     prosecutors, not only because federal courts have traditional \n     authority to establish such rules for lawyers generally, but \n     because the Department lacks the requisite objectivity.\n\n[[Page S9378]]\n\n       The first part of the proposed legislation embodies the \n     traditional understanding that when lawyers handle cases \n     before a federal court, they should be subject to the federal \n     court's rules of professional responsibility, and not to the \n     possibly inconsistent rules of other jurisdictions. By \n     incorporating this ordinary choice-of-law principle, the \n     proposed legislation would preserve the federal courts' \n     traditional authority to oversee the professional conduct of \n     federal trial lawyers, including federal prosecutors. It \n     would thereby avoid the uncertainties presented by the McDade \n     law, which subjects federal prosecutors to state laws, rules \n     of criminal procedure, and judicial decisions which differ \n     from existing federal law.\n       The second part of the proposed legislation addresses the \n     most pressing contemporary question of government attorney \n     ethics--namely, the question of which rule should govern \n     government attorneys' communications with represented \n     persons. It asks the Judicial Conference of the United States \n     to submit to the Supreme Court a proposed uniform national \n     rule to govern this area of professional conduct, and to \n     study the need for additional national rules to govern other \n     areas in which the proliferation of local rules may interfere \n     with effective federal law enforcement. The Rules Enabling \n     Act process is the ideal one for developing such rules, both \n     because the federal judiciary traditionally is responsible \n     for overseeing the conduct of lawyers in federal court \n     proceedings, and because this process would best provide the \n     Supreme Court an opportunity fully to consider and \n     objectively to weigh all relevant considerations.\n\n\n                             2. short title\n\n       Section one is the short title of the bill.\n\n\n                    3. amendments to 28 u.s.c. 530b\n\n       Section two supersedes the McDade law with a new 28 U.S.C. \n     530B, consisting of four subsections.\n       Subsection (a) codifies the definition of ``attorney for \n     the Government'' in the current Department of Justice \n     regulations, and also includes in the definition any outside \n     special counsel, or employee of such counsel, as may be \n     appointed by the Attorney General under 28 CFR 600.1 or any \n     other provision of law.\n       Subsection (b) establishes a clear choice-of-law rule for \n     government attorneys with respect to standards of \n     professional responsibility, modeled on Rule 8.5(b) of the \n     ABA's Model Rules of Professional Conduct. An attorney who is \n     handling a case in court would be subject to the professional \n     standards established by the rules and decisions of that \n     court. An attorney who is conducting a grand jury \n     investigation would be subject to the professional standards \n     of the court under whose authority the grand jury was \n     impanelled. In other circumstances, where no court has clear \n     supervisory authority over particular conduct, an attorney \n     would be subject to the professional standards established by \n     rules and decisions of the United States district court for \n     the judicial district in which the attorney principally \n     performs his official duties, except that the Act does not \n     apply to government attorney conduct that is unrelated to the \n     attorney's work for the government.\n       Thus, for example, an Assistant United States Attorney for \n     the Eastern District of New York would ordinarily be subject \n     to the attorney conduct rules prescribed by the E.D.N.Y. \n     courts, as interpreted and applied by those courts. If the \n     attorney handled a government appeal in the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the attorney's \n     conduct in connection with the appeal would be subject to the \n     local rules and interpretive decisions of the Second Circuit. \n     If cross-designated to handle a prosecution in another \n     judicial district, e.g., the District of New Jersey, the \n     attorney's conduct with respect to that prosecution would be \n     subject to the local federal district court rules. Similarly, \n     if the attorney were to handle a matter for the government \n     before a New York State court, the attorney would be subject \n     to the professional standards established by the rules and \n     decisions of that court, in the same manner and to the same \n     extent as other New York State practitioners.\n       This provision anticipates that the Supreme Court might \n     promulgate one or more uniform national rules governing the \n     professional conduct of government attorneys practicing \n     before the federal courts. In this event, the terms of the \n     uniform national rule would apply.\n       Subsection (c) codifies the predominant practice with \n     respect to state disciplinary proceedings against government \n     attorneys. A government attorney whose conduct is subject to \n     the professional standards of a federal court may be \n     disciplined by state authorities only if referred to state \n     authorities by a federal court. No referral is needed when \n     the applicable professional standards are those of a state \n     court (which may occur, under subsection (b), if the attorney \n     is handling a matter before a state court). This gatekeeping \n     provision ensures that federal courts will have the first \n     opportunity to interpret and apply federal court rules to \n     government attorneys, while leaving substantial enforcement \n     authority with state disciplinary bodies. This provision also \n     specifically promotes federal uniformity in the application \n     of professional standards to government attorneys.\n       Subsection (d) clarifies the law regarding the licensing of \n     government attorneys, an issue that is currently addressed \n     through the appropriations process. Since 1979, \n     appropriations bills for the Department of Justice have \n     incorporated by reference section 3(a) of Pub. L. 96-132, \n     which states: ``None of the sums authorized to be \n     appropriated by this Act may be used to pay the compensation \n     of any person employed after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act as an attorney (except foreign counsel employed in \n     special cases) unless such person shall be duly licensed and \n     authorized to practice as an attorney under the laws of a \n     State, territory, or the District of Columbia.''\n       Subsection (d) codifies this longstanding requirement, and \n     also makes clear that government attorneys need not be \n     licensed under the laws of any state in particular. The \n     clarification is necessary to ensure that local rules \n     regarding state licensure are not applied to federal \n     prosecutors. Cf. United States v. Straub, No. 5:99 Cr. 10 \n     (N.D. W. Va. June 14, 1999) (granting defense motion to \n     disqualify the Assistant United States Attorney because he \n     was not licensed to practice in West Virginia).\n       Subsection (e), like the McDade law, authorizes the \n     Attorney General to make and amend rules to assure compliance \n     with section 530B.\n\n\n           4. JUDICIAL CONFERENCE REPORTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n       Section three directs the Judicial Conference of the United \n     States to prepare two reports regarding the regulation of \n     government attorney conduct. Both reports would contain \n     recommendations with respect to the advisability of uniform \n     national rules.\n       The first report would address the issue of contacts with \n     represented persons, which has generated the most serious \n     controversy regarding the professional conduct of government \n     attorneys. See, e.g., State v. Miller, 600 N.W.2d 457 (Minn. \n     1999); United States v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 132 F.3d \n     1252 (8th Cir. 1998); United States v. Lopez, 4 F.3d 1455 \n     (9th Cir. 1993); United States v. Hammad, 858 F.2d 834 (2d \n     Cir. 1988).\n       Rule 4.2 of the ABA's Model Rules of Professional Conduct \n     and analogous rules adopted by state courts and bar \n     associations place strict limits on when a lawyer may \n     communicate with a person he knows to be represented by \n     another lawyer. These ``no contact'' rules preserve fairness \n     in the adversarial system and the integrity of the attorney-\n     client relationship by protecting parties, potential parties \n     and witnesses from lawyers who would exploit the disparity in \n     legal skill between attorneys and lay people and damage the \n     position of the represented person. Courts have given a wide \n     variety of interpretations to these rules, however, creating \n     uncertainty and confusion as to how they apply in criminal \n     cases and to government attorneys. For example, courts have \n     disagreed about whether these rules apply to federal \n     prosecutor contacts with represented persons in non-custodial \n     pre-indictment situations, in custodial pre-indictment \n     situations, and in post-indictment situations involving the \n     same or different matters underlying the charges.\n       Lawyers who practice in federal court--and federal \n     prosecutors in particular--have a legitimate interest in \n     being governed by a single set of professional standards \n     relating to frequently recurring questions of professional \n     conduct. Further, any rule governing federal prosecutors' \n     communications with represented persons should be respectful \n     of legitimate law enforcement interest as well as the \n     legitimate interests of the represented individuals. Absent \n     clear authority to engage in communications with represented \n     persons--when necessary and under limited circumstances \n     carefully circumscribed by law--the government is \n     significantly hampered in its ability to detect and prosecute \n     federal offenses.\n       The proposed legislation charges the Judicial Conference \n     with developing a uniform national rule governing government \n     attorney contacts with represented persons. Given the \n     advanced stage of dialogue among the interested parties--the \n     Department of Justice, the ABA, the federal and state courts, \n     and others--the Committee is confident that a satisfactory \n     rule can be developed within the one-year time frame \n     established by the bill.\n       While the ``no contact'' rule poses the most serious \n     challenge to effective law enforcement, other rules of \n     professional responsibility may also threaten to interfere \n     with legitimate investigations. The proposed legislation \n     therefore directs the Judicial Conference to prepare a second \n     report addressing broader questions regarding the regulation \n     of government attorney conduct. This report, to be completed \n     within two years, would review any areas of conflict or \n     potential conflict between federal law enforcement techniques \n     and existing standards of professional responsibility, and \n     make recommendations concerning the need for additional \n     national rules.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/27/senate-section/article/S9378-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9378-S9379]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \ncommemorate the 30-day period from September 15 through October 15, \nwhich was designated by the President as Hispanic Heritage Month. \nHispanic Heritage Month was first initiated by Congress in 1968 to \ncelebrate the diverse cultures, traditions, and valuable contributions \nof Hispanic people in the United States.\n\n[[Page S9379]]\n\n  We are living through the longest and strongest economic boom in \nAmerican history. Since 1992, our economy has created 22 million new \njobs--and Hispanics in Massachusetts and around the country are sharing \nin our national prosperity and contributing to this marvelous growth. \nSince 1993, Hispanic employment has increased by nearly one-third \nnationwide, and median weekly wages for Hispanics have risen more than \n16 percent. The unemployment rate for Hispanics is the lowest since we \nbegan tracking it, and the median income for Hispanic households has \nrisen 15.9 percent over the last three years.\n  But for all our progress, we know that many challenges remain. The \ndropout rate for Hispanic youth is astonishingly high. There are far \ntoo many young people with nothing to do after school, and the \nunemployment rate is still too high in many predominately-Hispanic \ncommunities. We cannot ignore or turn our backs on these young people, \nbecause they are truly the future of this nation. And prosperity that \nis not broadly shared is not true prosperity.\n  In February of 1994, President Clinton signed Executive order 12900, \n``Educational Excellence for Hispanic Americans,'' specifically, ``To \nadvance the development of human potential, to strengthen the Nation's \ncapacity to provide high-quality education, and to increase \nopportunities for Hispanic Americans to participate in and benefit from \nFederal education programs.'' I am proud to tell you about an \ninitiative in my state, the Massachusetts Education Initiative for \nLatino Students (MEILS), which was created to implement the White House \nInitiative on Educational Excellence for Hispanic Americans in \nMassachusetts. MEILS created a Steering Committee responsible for \ndeveloping and implementing a comprehensive approach for dealing with \nLatino educational issues statewide. MEILS has formulated a partnership \nbetween the state, federal, and local government to ensure high-level \neducational achievements for Latino students, from preschoolers to \nlifelong learners. MEILS has already established working groups in 13 \nof the communities with the highest percentages of Hispanic populations \nin the state of Massachusetts. Last Fall, MEILS held a conference in \nWorcester, Massachusetts, expecting approximately 300-400 participants, \nbut ultimately drawing 700. They are currently planning their second \nconference, anticipating over 1,000 participants.\n  By 2050, one-quarter of all Americans will be Hispanic. In \nMassachusetts, Hispanics comprise 6% of the population and have made \nsignificant contributions to our communities, to our workplaces, to our \npublic schools, and to academe. One of those contributors, Juan \nMaldacena, an Associate Professor of Physics at Harvard University, \nrecently secured a MacArthur Foundation ``genius'' grant for his work \non ``string theory,'' a method for describing gravity in the same terms \nas other forces in the universe. A colleague of Mr. Maldacena's from \nthe University of Chicago was so taken by this theory that he penned a \nnew version of the ``Macarena'' called the ``Maldacena.''\n  We know that the key to growing and staying strong is making sure \nthat every American participates in our nation's prosperity. I will \ncontinue, and I hope the Congress will continue, to work closely with \nthe Hispanic community because, together, we bring Massachusetts and \nAmerica closer to the vision of a nation where all citizens are free to \nreach their potential.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/27/senate-section/article/S9379-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9379]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      THE PREVENTION OF CIRCUMVENTION OF SUGAR TARIFF RATE QUOTAS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

This rule took over three \nyears to finally implement.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an \nextraordinary Vermonter, Daniel Dyer. As the world celebrates the end \nof the twentieth century, Daniel Dyer is celebrating the end of his \nfirst century. He has seen history made, but he has also made history \nof his own. Growing up on a farm in Vermont, Mr. Dyer attended the \nlocal school in Albany. His strong academic record afforded him the \nopportunity to attend Craftsbury Academy--where he performed odd jobs \nto help defray the cost of his room and board. From there, he moved on \nto the University of Vermont to study education and agriculture, and \ngraduated in 1924. Since then, Mr. Dyer has given over forty years of \ndedicated service to the young people of Vermont as a teacher, a coach \nand a principal.\n  Even after retiring, Mr. Dyer remains active in his community--just \nlast year he was speaking to a classroom of sixth-grade students about \nhis experiences growing up. His contributions to Vermonters were \nrecognized by the University of Vermont when he received awards for \nCommunity Service Leadership in 1978 and Distinguished Service in 1988. \nToday Mr. Dyer is the University's oldest active alumnus and still \nmaintains an amicable relationship with members of the faculty.\n  On November 3, Daniel Dyer will celebrate his one hundredth birthday \nwith friends and family. Of course, this grand event will include his \nchildren, grandchildren and great-grandchildren, all of whom--along \nwith countless other Vermont children--have been touched by this \nspecial man.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/27/senate-section/article/S9380-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9380]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO CAROLYN C. ROBERTS\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nCarolyn C. Roberts, an outstanding Vermonter and a national leader in \nthe area of health care reform. As she prepares to retire from her \nposition as President and Chief Executive Officer of Copley Health \nSystems in Morrisville, Vermont, it is important to reflect on how much \none person can accomplish in serving others.\n  Carolyn was the first Vermonter and the second woman to serve as the \nChair of the Board of Trustees of the American Hospital Association. \nWhile Carolyn worked to represent all hospitals in this country, she \nstressed the importance of ensuring residents of rural communities \naccess to health services in their communities. Carolyn also fought \nhard to preserve the role of community hospitals by advocating for \nrelationships with other health systems. In this, as in every other \ncapacity, her mark has been felt far beyond the boundaries of Lamoille \nCounty, Vermont.\n  Carolyn began her vocation as a nurse and quickly rose to leadership \npositions as a direct provider, clinical administrator, and executive. \nSince 1982, Carolyn has been at the helm of Copley, a rural, community-\nwide, health delivery system in Morrisville, Vermont. Under her \nleadership, Copley Hospital received the 1987 Foster G. McGaw Prize for \nExcellence in Community Service in 1987.\n  During Carolyn's career, she has frequently held leadership positions \non national boards, including the Joint Commission on Accreditation of \nHealthcare Organizations, The Hospital Fund, the Commission on \nProfessional and Hospital Activities, the Institute for Healthcare \nImprovement, the American Academy of Medical Administrators, and the \nAmerican College of Healthcare Executives.\n  I must also acknowledge Carolyn's willingness to advise me personally \nover the years on critical health care policy issues. As Chairman of \nthe Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, I have \nbeen gratified to know that I could always rely on Carolyn's expertise \nin such arenas as rural health care, integrated systems of care, and \nMedicare reform.\n  Vermont has much to be grateful for, in view of Carolyn's steadfast \ncommitment to improving the quality of life in our State. Whether \nserving on Governor Snelling's Blue Ribbon Health Care Commission or on \nGovernor Dean's Task Force on Medicaid Managed Care, she always brought \na sense of knowledge, dedication, and grace to solving the problem at \nhand. It is reassuring to know that her legacy will lead Copley Health \nSystems and the greater community of Vermont itself into the next \nmillennium.\n  Mr. President, Carolyn's unwavering commitment toward improving the \nhealth status of Vermont and its citizens serves as a testament to us \nall. Vermont is truly indebted to her. Her deep commitment to the \ncitizens of the Green Mountain State has endeared her to us. She has \nour sincerest good wishes for the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/27/senate-section/article/S9380-3", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9380]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:20 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills and joint resolution, in which it requests \nthe concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 1248.

A bill to establish an Office of Children's Services within \nthe Department of Justice to coordinate and implement Government \nactions involving unaccompanied alien children to ensure that their \nbest interests are held paramount in immigration proceedings and \nactions involving them; to prescribe standards for their custody, \nrelease, and detention; to improve policies for their permanent \nprotection; and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n            UNACCOMPANIED ALIEN CHILD PROTECTION ACT OF 2000\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n\n[[Page S9382]]\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation to change the way unaccompanied immigrant children are \ntreated while in the custody of the Immigration and Naturalization \nService (INS). The Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act of 2000 \nwould ensure that the federal government addresses the special needs of \nthousands of unaccompanied alien children who enter the U.S. It would \nensure that these children have a fair opportunity to obtain \nhumanitarian relief when eligible.\n  Central throughout this legislation are two concepts:\n  (1) The United States government has a special responsibility to \nprotect unaccompanied children in its custody; and\n  (2) In all proceedings and actions, the government must have as its \nparamount priority the protection of the best interests of the child.\n  The Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act of 2000 would ensure \nthat children who are apprehended by the INS are treated humanely and \nappropriately by transferring jurisdiction over the welfare of \nunaccompanied minors from the INS Detention and Deportation division to \na newly created Office of Children Services within the INS.\n  This legislation would also centralize responsibility for the care \nand custody of unaccompanied children in a new Office of Children's \nServices. By doing so, the legislation would resolve the conflict of \ninterest inherent in the current system--that is, the INS retains \ncustody of children and is charged with their care while, at the same \ntime, it seeks their deportation.\n  Under this bill, the Office of Children's Services would be required \nto establish standards for the custody, release, and detention of \nchildren, ensuring that children are housed in appropriate shelters or \nfoster care rather than juvenile jails. In 1999, the INS held some \n2,000 children in juvenile jails even though they had never committed a \ncrime. Equally as important, the bill would require the Office to \nestablish clear guidelines and uniformity for detention alternatives \nsuch as shelter care, foster care, and other child custody \narrangements.\n  The bill would strengthen options for the permanent protection of \nalien children in the United States, including providing asylum or \nadjustment of status to those who qualify.\n  Finally, the Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act would provide \nunaccompanied minors with access to legal counsel, who would ensure \nthat the children appear at all immigration proceedings and assist them \nas the INS and immigration court considers their cases. The bill would \nalso provide access to a guardian ad litem to ensure that they are \nproperly placed in a safe environment. The guardian ad litem would also \nmake sure that the child's attorney is, in fact, operating in his or \nher best interest.\n  Let me turn for a moment to the issue of access to counsel. Children, \neven more than adults, have immense difficulty tackling the \ncomplexities of the asylum system without the assistance of counsel. \nDespite this reality, most children in INS detention are unrepresented. \nWithout legal representation, children are at risk of being returned to \ntheir home countries where they may face further human rights abuses.\n  I am aware of two cases that demonstrate the compelling need for \ncounsel on behalf of these children. The first case involves two 17-\nyear-old boys from China. Li and Wang were apprehended on an island \nnear Guam and have been in INS custody for 16 months. During their \ndetention on Guam, the two boys testified in federal court against the \nsmugglers who brought them to Guam. In their testimony, they described \nbeing beaten by the smugglers even before leaving China, and stated \nthat others were beaten during the trip to Guam. In the spring of 2000, \nthe two boys were brought to a corrections facility in Los Angeles and \nare currently being held in the INS section of that facility. This is \nwhere the similarity in their cases end.\n\n  While both of the boys would face danger from the smugglers if they \nreturned to China because of their testimony, only one was granted \nasylum. Li applied for asylum and was denied. He was not represented by \ncounsel at his hearing. Despite the fact that the INS trial attorney \nmentioned that Li had testified in federal court against the smugglers, \nthe judge did not include this information in her decision on the \nclaim. Luckily for Li, an attorney overheard the hearing, and after \nspeaking with Li, agreed to appeal his asylum claim. Li is still being \nheld in a Los Angeles corrections facility. The story is different for \nWang. Wang had an attorney and won his asylum hearing. But INS is \nappealing the decision so Wang still sits in a Los Angeles corrections \nfacility, too.\n  These cases demonstrate the pressing need of legal representation for \nchildren. Li may have won his asylum claim if he had been represented \nby counsel and if the evidence regarding his testimony in federal court \nhad been incorporated into his asylum claim. Instead, a 17-year-old boy \nunfamiliar with our immigration system and our language was forced to \nnavigate the tricky court system alone.\n  According to Human Rights Watch, children detained by the INS, \nwhether in secure detention or less restrictive settings, often have \ngreat difficulty obtaining information about their legal rights. On a \nvisit to the Berks facility in 1998, Human Rights Watch staff found \nthat none of the children they interviewed had received information \nabout their rights or available legal services from either the INS or \nthe facility's staff. Neither could local INS or facility staff \nidentify how these children might receive this information.\n  In one way or another, we have been affected by the six-year-old \nshipwreck survivor from Cuba, Elian Gonzalez. His tragic story brought \nto light the plight of numerous other youngsters who find their way to \nthe United States, unaccompanied by an adult and, in many cases, \ntraumatized by the experiences provoking their flight.\n  Unaccompanied alien children are among the most vulnerable of the \nimmigrant population; many have entered the country under traumatic \ncircumstances. They are unable to protect themselves adequately from \ndanger. Because of their youth and the fact that they are alone, they \nare often subject to abuse or exploitation.\n  Because of their age and inexperience, unaccompanied alien children \nare not able to articulate their fears, their views, or testify to \ntheir needs as accurately as adults can. Despite these facts, U.S. \nimmigration laws and policies have been developed and implemented \nwithout careful attention to their effect on children, particularly on \nunaccompanied alien children.\n  Each year, the INS detains more than 5,000 children nationwide. They \nare apprehended for not having proper documentation at the ports-of-\nentry for entering the United States. Their detention may last for \nmonths--and sometimes for years--as they undergo complex immigration \nproceedings.\n  Under current immigration law, these children are forced to struggle \nthrough a system designed primarily for adults, even though they lack \nthe capacity to understand nuanced legal principles and procedures. \nChildren who may very well be eligible for relief are often vulnerable \nto being deported back to the very abuses they fled before they are \nable to make their case before the INS or an immigration judge.\n  Under current law, the INS is responsible for the apprehension, \ndetention, care, placement, legal protection, and deportation of \nunaccompanied children. I believe that these are conflicting \nresponsibilities that undercut the best interests of the child. Too \noften, the INS has fallen short in fulfilling the protection side of \nthe these responsibilities.\n  The INS uses a variety of facilities to house children. Some are held \nin children's shelters in which children are offered some of the \nservices they need but still may experience prolonged detention, lack \nof access to counsel, and other troubling conditions.\n  The INS relies on juvenile correctional facilities to house many \nchildren, even in the absence of any criminal wrongdoing. Today, one \nout of every three children in INS custody is detained in secure, jail-\nlike facilities. These facilities are highly inappropriate, \nparticularly for children who have already experienced trauma in their \nhomelands.\n  There is currently no provision of federal law providing guidance for \nthe placement of unaccompanied alien\n\n[[Page S9383]]\n\nchildren. In 1987, the Flores v. Reno settlement agreement on behalf of \nminors in INS detention established the nationwide policy for the \ndetention, release, and treatment of children in the custody of INS. \nThe Flores agreement requires that the INS treat minors with dignity, \nrespect, and special concern for their particular vulnerability. It \nalso requires the INS to place each detained minor in the least \nrestrictive setting appropriate to the child's age and special needs.\n  In response to Flores, the INS issued regulations that permitted its \nofficers to detain children in secure facilities only in limited \ncircumstances. The INS officers were required to provide written notice \nto the child of the reasons for such placement. More importantly, the \nregulations required the INS to segregate immigration detainees from \njuvenile criminal offenders.\n  Although INS officials have contended that these children are placed \nin these facilities largely because they are charged with other \noffenses, the INS statistics do not bear out this claim. In fiscal year \n1999, only 19 percent of the children placed in secure detention were \nchargeable or adjudicated as delinquents.\n  According to non-governmental organizations (NGOs) such as Human \nRights Watch and the Women's Commission on Refugee Women and Children, \nthe INS regularly violates these regulations. The NGOs contend that too \noften children are placed in jail-like facilities for seemingly \narbitrary reasons, seldom notified of the reasons why, and forced to \nshare rooms and have extensive contact with convicted juvenile \noffenders.\n  I was also astonished to learn that many of these children, some as \nyoung as four and five years old, are placed behind multiple layers of \nlocked doors, surrounded by walls and barbed wire. They are strip \nsearched, patted down, placed in solitary confinement for punishment, \nforced to wear prison uniforms and shackles, and are forbidden to keep \npersonal objects. Often they have no one to speak with because of the \nlanguage barrier.\n  The Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act of 2000 would ensure \nthat the particular needs of the thousands of unaccompanied alien \nchildren who enter INS custody each year are met and that these \nchildren have a fair opportunity to obtain immigration relief when \neligible.\n  In 1999, the INS held approximately 4,600 children under the age of \n18 in its custody. Some of these children fled human rights abuses or \narmed conflict in their home countries, some were victims of child \nabuse or had otherwise lost the support and protection of their \nfamilies, some came to the United States to join family members, and \nsome came to escape economic deprivation.\n  Many of these children came from troubled countries around the world, \nincluding the Peoples Republic of China, Honduras, Afghanistan, \nSomalia, Sierra Leone, Colombia, Guatemala, Cuba, former Yugoslavia, \nand others. They range in age from toddlers to teenagers. Some traveled \nto the United States alone, while others were accompanied by unrelated \nadults.\n  Sadly, a significant number are victims of smuggling or trafficking \nrings. In one recent instance, Phanupong Khaisri, a two-year-old Thai \nchild, was brought to the U.S. by two individuals falsely claiming to \nbe his parents, but who were actually part of a major alien trafficking \nring. The INS was prepared to deport the child back to Thailand. It was \nnot until Members of Congress and the local Thai community had \nintervened, however, that the INS decided to allow the child to remain \nin the U.S. until the agency could provide proper medical attention and \ndetermine what course of action would be in his best interest. Now \nhis case is before a federal district court judge who will determine \nwhether he should be eligible to apply for asylum.\n\n  The Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act aims to prevent \nsituations like this from recurring by centralizing the care and \ncustody of unaccompanied children into a new Office of Children's \nServices within the INS, but outside the jurisdiction of the District \nDirectors. By doing so, the Act resolves the conflict of interest \ninherent in the current system--that is, the INS retains custody of \nchildren and is charged with their care while, at the same time, it \nseeks their deportation.\n  I would like to take a moment to share with you a few other examples \nof how the federal government has fallen short in the manner in which \nwe handle vulnerable unaccompanied minors. One would think that our \ncountry would treat unaccompanied minors with the sensitivity and care \ntheir situations demands. Unfortunately, in too many instances, that \nhas not been the case. Too often, these children are often treated like \nadults and, under the worst circumstances, like criminals.\n  Xaio Ling, a young girl from China who spoke no English, was detained \nby the INS at the Berks County Juvenile Detention Center. The INS \nplaced her among children guilty of violent crimes, including rape and \nmurder. Xaio was never guilty of any crime, and yet she slept in a \nsmall concrete cell, was subjected to humiliating strip searches, and \nforced to wear handcuffs. She was forbidden to keep any of her clothes \nor possessions and, under the policies of the Berks Center, Xaio was \nnot allowed to laugh.\n  Imagine the fear this child had: thrust into a system she did not \nunderstand, given no legal aid, placed in jail that housed juveniles \nwith serious criminal convictions, including murder, car jacking, rape, \nand drug trafficking. She did not speak English and was unable to speak \nto any staff who knew her language, and she had to submit to strip \nsearches. It is hard to believe that our country would have allowed \nthis innocent child to be treated in such a horrible manner.\n  Situations like that of the young Chinese girl make a compelling case \nfor a change in the way our nation treats unaccompanied alien children. \nUnder the legislation I have introduced today, this youngster would \nnever have been placed in a detention center with criminal offenders. \nRather, she would have immediately been placed in shelter care, foster \ncare, or a home more appropriate for her situation. She would have been \nprovided an attorney for her immigration proceedings and a social \nworker would have been appointed as guardian ad litem to ensure that \nthe child's needs were being met. Sadly, this young girl was given none \nof these options. Neither was a 16-year-old boy from Colombia.\n  This youngster fled Colombia to escape a life of violence on the \nstreets of Bogota, where FARC guerrillas attempted to recruit him and \nthe F-2 branch of the Colombian government harassed him in its attempt \nto get rid of street children. Fearing for his life, he fled Colombia \nfor Venezuela where he lived without shelter or sufficient food. In \nsearch of a safer life, he sneaked into the machine room of a cargo \nship bound for the United States. He was lucky to survive; many other \nstowaways were thrown overboard when discovered by the ship's crew.\n  The boy remained on the ship from November 1998 until March 1999, \nwhen he arrived in Philadelphia. He was soon turned over to the INS and \nplaced into the same detention center the young Chinese girl was held \nin. He, too, was kept with criminal offenders. He did not understand \nEnglish, which created a myriad of problems because he was unable to \nunderstand what was expected of him in the detention center. He was \nheld in an inappropriately punitive environment for six months.\n  I have one last story to share with you today. Placed on a boat bound \nfor the United States by her very own parents, a 15-year-old girl fled \nChina's rigid family planning laws. Under these laws she was denied \ncitizenship, education, and medical care. She came to this country \nalone and desperate. And what did our immigration system do when they \nfound her? They held her in a juvenile jail in Portland, Oregon. She \nwas held for eight months and was detained for an additional four \nmonths after being granted political asylum. At her asylum hearing, the \nyoung girl could not wipe away the tears from her face because her \nhands were chained to her waist. According to her lawyer, ``her only \ncrime was that her parents had put her on a boat so she could get a \nbetter life over here.''\n  For years children's rights and human rights organizations have \nimplored Congress to improve the way our immigration system handles \nunaccompanied minors--just like the ones whose stories I have just \ntold. I believe my bill would do just that.\n  We cannot continue to allow children, who come to our country, often\n\n[[Page S9384]]\n\ntraumatized and guilty of no crime, to be held in jails and treated \nlike criminals. We cannot continue to allow children, scared and \nhelpless, to be thrown into a system they do not understand without \nsufficient legal aid and a guardian to look after their best interests. \nWe must adhere to the principles of our justice system. What kind of \nmessage do we send when we deprive children who come to our country \nseeking refuge of their basic rights and protections?\n  As a nation that holds our democratic ideals and constitutional \nrights paramount, how then can we continue to avert our attention from \nrepeated violations of some of the most basic human rights against \nchildren who have no voice in the immigration system? We should be \noutraged that children who come to the U.S. alone, many against their \nwill, are subjected to such inhumane, excessive conditions.\n  I am proud to have the support of the United States Catholic \nConference and the Women's Commission on Refugee Women and Children, \nwith whom I have worked closely to develop this legislation.\n  Although we are nearing the end of the session, I want to highlight \nthis issue now so that we can begin to think about the importance of \nprotecting the rights of children in immigration custody and work \ntowards passing this legislation in the next Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY:\n  S. 3118. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to impose \na windfall profits adjustment on crude oil (and products thereof) and \nto fund heating assistance for consumers and small business owners; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n        Windfall Oil Profits For Heating Assistance Act of 2000\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Windfall Oil Profits for Heating \nAssistance Act of 2000 is a bit of a mouthful, but let me explain what \nthis does. My legislation imposes a windfall profits adjustment on the \noil industry so we can fund heating help for consumers and small \nbusiness owners across America.\n  Mr. President, while American families have been paying sky-high \nprices at the gas pump and are bracing for record-high home heating \ncosts this winter, the oil industry is savoring phenomenal profits. \nSomething is wrong when working families are struggling to pay for \nbasic transportation and home heat while Big Oil rakes in obscene \namounts of cash by the barrel.\n  Indeed, the overall net income for the 14 major petroleum companies \nmore than doubled in the second quarter of 2000 relative to the second \nquarter of 1999, to $10.3 billion.\n  In the second quarter of 2000, BP Amoco PLC reported profits of $2.87 \nbillion, Chevron Corporation reported profits of $1.14 billion, Conoco \nreported profits of $460 million, Exxon Mobil Corporation reported \nprofits of $4.53 billion, Marathon Oil Company reported profits of $367 \nmillion, Phillips Petroleum Company reported profits of $439 million, \nRoyal Dutch/Shell Group reported profits of $3.15 billion and Texaco, \nInc. reported profits of $641 million.\n  Look at these huge profits. When people in Vermont and New England \nwant to know why they are paying so much extra for home heating oil, \npick up the phone and call Texas and ask them how they justify these \nhuge windfall profits.\n  This chart illustrates the phenomenal profits of the oil industry. \nKeep in mind, these profits came as gasoline prices soared and heating \noil stocks fell. The oil industry executives said: It is the people of \nOPEC. It is not our fault. We love our customers. We are your friends. \nWe wouldn't raise these prices. It is the naughty people overseas. We \nare not making any money from this. We are sorry you have to pay so \nmuch more to commute to work. We are sorry you can't heat your home.\n  In my State, where it can drop down to 20 below zero, this is not a \nmatter of comfort. It is a matter of whether you will live or not.\n  But the oil industry executives say: We are sorry you have to pay so \nmuch more. Gee, maybe you should fill up early. Stocks are low. It is \nnot our fault. We are not making anything out of this. We are not \nmaking any money out of it.\n  They are liars. They are making money. They are making windfall \nprofits.\n  I have a chart here that illustrates the phenomenal profits of the \noil industry for the past year when gasoline prices soared and heating \noil stocks fell. Compared to the second quarter of 1999, the profits in \nthe second quarter of 2000 increased 133 percent for BP Amoco, 136 \npercent for Chevron, 205 percent for Conoco, 123 percent for Exxon \nMobil, 208 percent for Marathon, 275 percent for Phillips, 96 percent \nfor Shell and 124 percent for Texaco.\n  Not surprisingly, these multi-million and even multi-billion dollar \nprofits in the second quarter of 2000 for BP Amoco, Chevron, Conoco, \nExxon Mobil and Shell were record quarterly profits.\n  These gushering profits are not new for the oil industry in 2000. In \nthe first quarter of 2000, Big Oil also reaped record profits.\n  In the first quarter of 2000, ARCO reported profits of $333 million, \nBP Amoco reported profits of $2.68 billion, Chevron reported profits of \n$1.10 billion, Conoco reported profits of $391 million, Exxon Mobil \nreported profits of $3.35 billion, Phillips reported profits of $250 \nmillion, Shell reported profits of $3.13 billion, and Texaco reported \nprofits of $602 million.\n  I have a second chart here that illustrates the phenomenal profits of \nthe oil industry for the first quarter of the past year. Compared to \nthe first quarter of 1999, the profits in the first quarter of 2000 \nincreased 136 percent for ARCO, 296 percent for BP Amoco, 291 percent \nfor Chevron , 371 percent for Conoco, 108 percent for Exxon Mobil, 257 \npercent for Phillips, 117 percent for Shell and 473 percent for Texaco.\n  Again, these multi-million and multi-billion dollar profits in the \nfirst quarter of 2000 for BP Amoco, Conoco, Exxon Mobil and Shell were \nrecord quarterly profits.\n  Yet these same oil company executives can tell the people of Vermont, \nthe Northeast and elsewhere: Sorry you have to pay so much more for \nyour gasoline. Sorry you have to pay so much more for your home heating \noil. It is not our fault. We are not making any profits. It is those \nmean people in the Middle East.\n  Man, what hypocrisy.\n  Somebody once said, in Vermont: We will rely on the facts. Vermonters \nare not fooled by this. But how frustrating it is for all of us, how \nfrustrating it is for middle America, to pay these bills, feeling they \nare helpless. Because the fact comes down, in our State, in an \nextraordinarily cold winter, we have to have heat. The fact comes down, \nwhen men and women have to go to work and they have to commute, they \nhave to pay the price of going there. Everybody expects to pay what it \ncosts to live. But they do not expect to have to pay windfall profits \nfor a cartel of companies.\n  Big Oil reaped record profits while American consumers and small \nbusiness owners dug deeper into their pockets to pay for soaring \ngasoline prices. And more record profits for Big Oil at the expense of \nconsumers and small business owners are expected this winter when \nheating costs go through the roof.\n  Even more disturbing are the recent press reports that the major oil \ncompanies are not using their record profits to boost production and \nlower future prices, but are instead cutting back on exploration and \nproduction.\n  If they were using some of these huge profits to create more fuel, to \ncreate more production ability to be able to stave off shortages in the \nfuture, I would say let them have the profits because we will all \nbenefit. They are not. They are just pocketing the profits. They are \nnot doing a thing to find new oil, to find new production facilities.\n  Listen to this from a report in yesterday's Wall Street Journal: \n``Exploration and production expenditures at the so-called super \nmajors--Exxon Mobil Corp., BP Amoco PLC, and Royal Dutch/Shell Group--\nfell 20 percent to $6.91 billion in the first six months of the year \nfrom a year earlier. . . .'' Mr. President, that is outrageous.\n  The oil industry is made up of corporations formed under the laws of \nthe United States. These oil industry corporations have a \nresponsibility to the public good as well as their shareholders.\n\n[[Page S9385]]\n\n  To reap record windfall profits and then cut back on exploration and \nproduction to further increase future profits is poor corporate \ncitizenship and an abuse of the public trust by these oil industry \ncorporations and their executives.\n  Well I for one have had enough of Big Oil making record profits at \nthe expense of the working families and the small business owners who \npay the oil bills, live by the rules and struggle mightily when fuel \nand heating costs skyrocket.\n  In response to the energy crisis of the 1980s, Congress enacted the \nCrude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act of 1980. This windfall profits tax, \nwhich was repealed in 1988, funded low-income fuel assistance and \nenergy and transportation programs.\n  Similar to the early 1980s, American families again face an energy \ncrisis of high prices and record oil company profits. This past June, \ngasoline prices hit all-time highs across the United States, with a \nnational average of $1.68 a gallon, according to the Energy Information \nAdministration.\n  This winter, the Department of Energy estimates that heating oil \ninventories are 36 percent lower than last year with heating oil \ninventories in New England estimated to be 65 percent lower than last \nyear. In my home state of Vermont, energy officials estimate heating \noil costs will jump to $1.31 per gallon, up from $1.19 last winter and \n80 cents in 1998.\n  Given the oil industry's record windfall profits in the face of this \nenergy crisis, it is time for Congress to act and again limit the \nwindfall profits of Big Oil.\n  The Leahy bill would do just that and dedicate the revenue generated \nfrom this windfall profits adjustment to help working families and \nsmall business owners with their heating oil costs this winter.\n  If they are not going to put more money into providing more energy \nfor us, then the Windfall Oil Profits For Heating Assistance Act of \n2000 would impose a 100 percent assessment on windfall profits from the \nsale of crude oil. My legislation builds on the current investigation \nby the Federal Trade Commission, a well deserved investigation into the \npricing and profits of the oil industry.\n  My bill requires the Federal Trade Commission to expand this \ninvestigation to determine if the oil industry is reaping windfall \nprofits.\n  The revenue collected from windfall oil industry profits, under my \nlegislation, would be dedicated to two separate accounts in the \nTreasury for the following: 75 percent of the revenues to fund heating \nassistance programs for consumers such as the Low Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program (LIHEAP), weatherization and other energy efficiency \nprograms; and 25 percent of the revenues to fund heating assistance \nprograms for small business owners.\n  American consumers and small business owners continue to pay sky-high \ngasoline prices and home heating oil costs are expected to hit an all-\ntime high this winter while U.S. oil corporations reap more record \nprofits. We ought to restore some basic fairness to the marketplace. It \nis time for Congress to transfer the windfall profits from Big Oil to \nfund heating oil assistance for working families.\n  If big oil executives say: But we need these profits so we can \ncontinue our exploration, we can continue to increase refineries--then \nlet them spend the money for that. If they are actually spending the \nmoney for that, it is not a problem. But they want to have it both \nways: They want to have a shortage, they want to force up the price, \nthey want to have a windfall profit, and they want to stick it in their \npocket and they don't want to do anything to help the consumer. If they \nare unwilling to help the consumer, the Congress ought to stand up and \nhelp the consumer.\n  I ask unanimous consent the text of the bill be printed in the Record \nat the conclusion of my remarks and the bill be appropriately referred.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                                S. 3118\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Act entitled ``An Act to provide for the \nestablishment of Fort Clatsop National Memorial in the State of Oregon, \nand for other purposes''; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n        The Fort Clatsop National Memorial Expansion Act of 2000\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce, with my \nfriend and colleague from Oregon, Senator Gordon Smith, the Fort \nClatsop National Memorial Expansion Act of 2000. I am also pleased that \nCongressman David Wu, representing Fort Clatsop and Clatsop County in \nthe United States House of Representatives, is introducing companion \nlegislation in the House.\n  The Fort Clatsop Memorial marks the spot where Meriwether Lewis, \nWilliam Clark and the Corps of Discovery spent 106 days during the \nwinter of 1805. The bicentennial of their historic journey is fast \napproaching and it is estimated that over a quarter-million people will \nvisit the Memorial during the bicentennial years of 2003 through 2006. \nDespite this anticipated influx of visitors, the Memorial is still \nlegally limited to no more than 130 acres. This legislation would \nauthorize the boundary expansion of the Memorial to no more than 1500 \nacres so as to help accommodate the large number of expected visitors.\n  Since the 1980s, the U.S. Park Service in Astoria, Oregon has been \ntrying to negotiate a land purchase with Williamette Industries to \nacquire approximately 928 acres for the expansion of the Ft. Clatsop \nNational Memorial. These acres are integral to the interpretation and \nenjoyment of the Memorial's historic site. Over the past 13 months the \nPark Service and Willamette Industries negotiated and, recently, \nreached an agreement that will lead to the Park Service acquiring this \nproperty. Before that can happen, however, this legislation, \nauthorizing the expansion of the park boundary, will allow the Park \nService to acquire the Willamette land administratively.

The Clatsop County \nCommission supports this legislation, as do the local landowners in and \naround the Memorial.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fort Clatsop National \n     Memorial Expansion Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In 1805, the members of the Lewis and Clark Expedition \n     built Fort Clatsop at the mouth of the Columbia River near \n     Astoria, Oregon, where they spent 106 days waiting for the \n     end of winter and preparing for their journey home. The Fort \n     Clatsop National Memorial was created by Congress in 1958 for \n     the purpose of commemorating the culmination, and the winter \n     encampment, of the Lewis and Clark Expedition following its \n     successful crossing of the North American continent, and is \n     the only National Park Service site solely dedicated to the \n     Lewis and Clark Expedition.\n       (2) The 1995 General Management Plan for the Fort Clatsop \n     National Memorial, prepared with input from the local \n     community, calls for the addition of lands to the memorial to \n     include the trail used by expedition members to travel from \n     the fort to the Pacific Ocean and to include the shore and \n     forest lands surrounding the fort and trail to protect their \n     natural settings.\n       (3) The area near present day McGowan, Washington where \n     Lewis and Clark and the Corps of Discovery camped after \n     reaching the Pacific Ocean, performed detailed surveying, and \n     conducted the historic ``vote'' to determine where to spend \n     the winter, is of undisputed national significance.\n       (4) The National Park Service and State of Washington \n     should identify the best alternative for adequately and cost \n     effectively protecting and interpreting the ``Station Camp'' \n     site.\n       (5) Expansion of the Fort Clatsop National Memorial would \n     require Federal legislation because the size of the memorial \n     is currently limited by statute to 130 acres.\n       (6) Congressional action to allow for the expansion of Fort \n     Clatsop for both the trail to the Pacific and, possibly, the \n     Station Camp site would be both timely and appropriate \n     before the start of the national bicentennial celebration \n     of the Lewis and Clark Expedition planned to take place \n     during the years 2004 through 2006.\n\n     SEC. 3. ACQUISITION OF LANDS FOR FORT CLATSOP NATIONAL \n                   MEMORIAL.\n\n       The Act entitled ``An Act to provide for the establishment \n     of Fort Clatsop National Memorial in the State of Oregon, and \n     for other purposes'', approved May 29, 1958 (Chapter 158; 72 \n     Stat. 153), is amended--\n       (a) by inserting in section 2 ``(a)'' before ``The \n     Secretary''.\n       (b) by inserting in section 2 a period, ``.'', following \n     ``coast'' and by striking the remainder of the section.\n       (c) by inserting in section 2 the following new \n     subsections:\n       ``(b) The Memorial shall also include the lands depicted on \n     the map entitled `Fort Clatsop Boundary Map', numbered and \n     dated `405-80016-CCO-June-1996'. The area designated in the \n     map as a `buffer zone' shall not be developed but shall be \n     managed as a visual buffer between a commemorative trail that \n     will run through the property, and contiguous private land \n     holdings.\n       (c) The total area designated as the Memorial shall contain \n     no more than 1,500 acres.''\n       (d) by inserting at the end of section 3 the following:\n       ``(b) Such lands included within the newly expanded \n     boundary may be acquired from willing sellers only, with the \n     exception of corporately owned timberlands.''\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \nmodify restrictions added by the Illegal Immigration Reform and \nImmigrant Responsibility Act of 1996; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n[[Page S9387]]\n\n             the immigrant fairness restoration act of 2000\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am honored to join my colleagues, \nSenators Graham, Leahy, Kerry, Wellstone, Durbin, and Feingold in \nintroducing the Immigrant Fairness Restoration Act. This legislation \nwill restore the balance to our immigration laws that was lost when \nCongress enacted changes in 1996 that went too far.\n  The 1996 law has had harsh consequences that violate fundamental \nprinciples of family integrity, individual liberty, fairness, and due \nprocess. Families are being torn apart. Persons who are no danger to \nthe community have languished in INS detention. Individuals who made \nsmall mistakes and atoned for their crimes long ago are being summarily \ndeported from the United States to countries they no longer remember, \nseparated from all that they know and love in this country.\n  The Immigrant Fairness Restoration Act will repeal the harshest \nprovisions of the 1996 changes. It will eliminate retroactive \napplication of these laws. The rules should not change in the middle of \nthe game. Permanent residents who committed offenses long before the \nenactment of the 1996 laws should be able to apply for the relief from \nremoval as it existed when the offense was committed. Unfair new \nconsequences should not attach to old conduct.\n  Our legislation will also restore proportionality to our immigration \nlaws. Current immigration laws punish permanent residents out of \nproportion to their crimes. Relatively minor offenses are now \nconsidered aggravated felonies. Permanent residents who did not receive \ncriminal convictions or serve prison sentences should not be precluded \nfrom all relief from deportation.\n  Our proposal also restores the discretion of immigration judges to \nevaluate cases on an individual basis and grant relief from deportation \nto deserving families. Currently, these judges are unable to grant such \nrelief to many permanent residents, regardless of their circumstances \nor equities in the cases. Their hands are tied, even in the most \ncompelling cases, and deserving legal residents are being unfairly \ntreated by these laws.\n  In addition, our proposal will end mandatory detention. The Attorney \nGeneral will have authority to release person from detention who do not \npose a danger to the community and are not a flight risk. The \ntraditional standards governing such determinations should be restored \nto immigrants. Dangerous criminals should be detained and deported. But \nindefinite detention must end. Those who have lived in the United \nStates with their families for years, established strong ties in our \ncommunities, paid taxes, and contributed to the Nation deserve to be \ntreated fairly.\n  The 1996 changes also stripped the Federal courts of any authority to \nreview the decisions of the INS and the immigration courts. As a \nresult, life-shattering determinations are often now made at the \nunreviewable discretion of an INS functionary. Immigrants deserve this \nday in court, and our proposal will provide it.\n  It is long past time for Congress to end these abuses. Real \nindividuals and real families continue to be hurt by the unacceptable \nchanges made four years ago.\n  Armando Baptiste of Boston was recently featured in a column in the \nNew York Times by Anthony Lewis. Armando came to the United States at \nthe age of 9 from Cape Verde. As a teenager, he became involved in a \ngang and was convicted of assault. Later, he joined a church-sponsored \ngroup and turned his life around. He became a key figure in the city, \nhelping other young people in the Cape Verdean community avoid the \nmistakes that he had made.\n  But the 1996 law made Armando deportable as a result of his earlier \nconviction. In February, he was jailed by the INS, and he now awaits \ndeportation. The immigration judge will not be able to consider his \npositive contributions to his community, his family ties, or the \nhardship that severing those ties will cause.\n  Mary Anne Gehris was born in Germany and adopted by a family in \nGeorgia when she was 2 years old. She is married and has two children, \nincluding a 14-year-old with cerebral palsy. Eleven years ago, she \npulled another woman's hair during an argument and pled guilty to a \nmisdemeanor. Although she never spent a day in jail, the crime is a \ndeportable offense under the 1996 laws. Mary Anne was pardoned by the \nGeorgia Board of Pardons this year. The Board does not usually grant \npardons for misdemeanor convictions, but it decided to do so because, \nit said, the 1996 laws have ``adversely affected the lives of numerous \nGeorgia residents.''\n  Ana Flores also deserves a chance. For several years, she complained \nto police about physical abuse by her husband. In 1998, she bit her \nhusband during a domestic dispute. Without consulting a lawyer, she \npleaded guilty at the urging of a judge and was placed on probation for \nsix months. Because the 1996 immigration law calls domestic violence a \ndeportable offense, she is now being deported to Guatemala, even though \nshe has two children who are U.S. citizens.\n  We still have time to act this year to end these abuses. The House of \nRepresentatives has already passed legislation that is an important \nfirst step in this process, but it fails to deal with many of the most \nharmful aspects of the 1996 laws. The legislation we are introducing \ntoday is needed to end these festering abuses once and for all, and we \nurge Congress to enact it.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today, with my colleagues, Senators \nKennedy, Leahy, Durbin, Kerry, and Wellstone to introduce legislation \nthat will help restore fairness and justice to our legal system.\n  Our nation is known worldwide for our system of justice.\n  We proclaim that everyone is equal under the eyes of the law.\n  Since the passage of the 1996 immigration law and the Anti-Terrorism \nand Effective Death Penalty Act, this statement has been only partially \ntrue.\n  There have been thousands of individuals who have been, in simple \nterms, punished twice: once for a crime, even a very minor crime, that \nwas committed, and once again for their immigration status.\n  These are individuals who are legally here in the United States; but \nthey are not U.S. citizens.\n  I do a workday once a month.\n  On these days I work a full shift on jobs ranging from garbage \ncollection to teaching.\n  In my 345th workday, in May 1999, I spent the day at the INS Krome \nDetention Center near Miami.\n  I met individuals who had been legally present in the United States \nfor years.\n  They had committed a crime, and for that they had fully served any \ncriminal sentence that was imposed.\n  When I met them, they were being indefinitely detained by the INS \nsolely because of their immigration status.\n  Under the two laws we passed in 1996, the United States could not \nrelease them.\n  And because we don't have a treaty with their country of origin--in \nthis case--Cuba, we could not deport them.\n  Cuba won't take them back.\n  So we are locking up for life individuals who may have bounced a \ncheck, or stolen a car radio and have already been sentenced, and have \ncompleted their sentence, for those crimes by a court of law.\n  Allow me to offer a few examples from my home state of Florida.\n  Catherine Caza was born in Canada but came to this country as a legal \npermanent resident when she was three years old.\n  She has always considered herself an American.\n  Until recently, she had no reason to believe otherwise.\n  Twenty years ago Ms. Caza made a terrible mistake. She sold drugs to \nan undercover policeman. For this she pleaded guilty and received five \nyears probation--which she successfully completed.\n  That was 20 years ago. Now she is 40 years old. She is the mother of \na 7-year-old girl. She is attending college, hoping to someday become a \nsocial worker. The INS wants to deport her.\n  Ms. Caza is scared, and justifiably so. She wonders how she will be \nable to build a new life for herself and her daughter, her American-\nborn daughter, in a country that is wholly unfamiliar.\n  Roberto and Sheila Salas are facing an equally bleak future.\n\n[[Page S9388]]\n\n  Mrs. Salas dreamed of going overseas with the United States Air \nForce. Naturally, she planned to take her husband and two children with \nher.\n  Her husband, 31-year-old Roberto Salas, came to this country from \nPeru as a permanent legal resident when he was 17.\n  At 19, he was sentenced to five years probation. He was released from \nprobation two years early because he followed all the rules. He has \nfollowed the rules ever since.\n  His family calls him a loving husband and father and a good provider. \nIn 1997 he applied for naturalization so his wife could go overseas. \nMonths later he was told that his adopted country was sending him back \nto Peru. The rules had changed.\n  These are, as I have said, just two of countless stories from every \nstate in the nation. This is not fair. This is not humane. This is \nsimply not reasonable.\n  Our legislation tries to restore a measure of sanity to the laws \ngoverning deportation of legal aliens.\n  First and foremost: It is blatantly unfair to change the rules in the \nmiddle of the game. This is what we did in 1996.\n  We passed a bill that applied new rules retroactively. We need to fix \nthis. Under our legislation, if you committed a crime 10 years ago, the \nrules that will punish you will be the rules that were in place then.\n  This bill restores proportionality to our immigration law. With the \npassage of Immigrant Fairness Restoration Act, the ``punishment will \nfit the crime.''\n  Under our current law, an individual can be deported for very minor \ncrimes.\n  They can be punished even if a judge and jury hand down no jail time.\n  This person may have children who were born in this country, a spouse \nwho is a U.S. citizen, even a business with many U.S. citizen \nemployees.\n  This legislation returns to judges the discretion they had before \n1996. There are some cases where deportation is the appropriate \nsanction. There are other cases where it is clearly not.\n  Let's let judges look at the facts and decide instead of taking over \ntheir role and insisting on a one-size-fits-all system of justice.\n  Let's not treat someone who stole a car as a teenager, served his \ntime, and has since become a law-abiding productive adult, the same way \nwe treat someone who has committed violent crimes over and over again.\n  Let's also not lock someone up for life because they have the bad \nfortune to come from a country that won't take them back. Long-term \ndetention is an extremely powerful judicial tool.\n  We ask that the INS use this action only when necessary--not as a \nfirst option.\n  This is a very difficult issue to advocate. These are criminals. I \nabsolutely believe they should be punished. They should fully repay \ntheir debt to society through incarceration, monetary restitution, \ncommunity service, or any other sanction.\n  Judges and juries decide these punishments, and the legal immigrant \nshould fully comply with each and every decision. However, from that \npoint on, they should be allowed to start over.\n  As Americans, we cannot and should not re-punish them.\n  What we are doing now is locking up everyone: car radio thieves, \ncheck bouncers, and others, all mixed in with the most dangerous \nfelons. Everyone should get an equal change to plead their case.\n  Experienced judges should have the discretion to keep together \nAmerican families who now face the prospect of lifetime separation. I \ndo not want a mass release of legal immigrants who pose a threat to our \nsociety.\n  However--I do want fairness and discretion restored to all those who \nlegally live in the United States.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of a bill as \nimportant as the Immigrant Fairness Restoration Act, which would \nrestore a number of the due process rights that were taken away by the \npassage in 1996 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nResponsibility Act (IIRIRA) and the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death \nPenalty Act (AEDPA). With those laws, we turned our back on our \nhistorical commitment to immigration and the rule of law. It is long \npast time to undo the damage that was done then, and this bill provides \nan excellent foundation for such important change.\n  First, this bill would eliminate the retroactive effects of the 1996 \nlaws. Those laws not only contained new and overly harsh provisions \ncalling for increased deportations for minor offenses, it applied those \nnew provisions retroactively. Under those laws, immigrants who may have \ncommitted a crime years before and had since gone on to live productive \nlives suddenly faced removal from the United States. Some had plead \nguilty to minor offenses--many of which did not even require jail \ntime--with the understanding that such a plea would have no effect on \ntheir immigration status. And that was true at the time. But suddenly, \nwith the passage of this law, they face removal and are not even \nallowed to apply for relief. They receive no due process, despite the \nfact that they have American families and legal immigration status.\n  This part of our immigration law simply must be changed. I have \npreviously introduced legislation that would at least provide \nnoncitizen veterans of our Armed Forces the right to due process before \nbeing removed for past offenses under these laws--the Fairness to \nImmigrant Veterans Act (S. 871). This bill has the support of the \nAmerican Legion, the Vietnam Veterans of America, and other veterans' \ngroups. It is unconscionable that those who served our country would be \nforced to leave it for a crime they committed 20 years ago, under a \ndifferent immigration law regime, without even receiving the chance to \nconvince a judge that they deserve the opportunity to stay. But in \ntruth, this country should not treat any immigrant in that way, and I \nwelcome a total eradication of the retroactivity provisions of these \nlaws.\n  The Immigrant Fairness Restoration Act also refines the definition of \n``aggravated felony'' that was itself altered in the 1996 legislation. \nThis redefinition will ensure that immigrants who commit relatively \nminor offenses will not be classified as aggravated felons and \nprecluded from all relief from deportation. Current law is unfair even \nwhen it is not applied retroactively, and we must fight to restore the \nconcept of judicial review in our immigration law. The United States \nhas historically been committed to the idea that people should be \njudged as individuals, and that we are just to impose penalties--\nwhether they be criminal penalties or severe civil measures such as \nremoval--because we have considered them carefully. We must return to \nthat historical commitment.\n  The bill will also return the definition of ``crimes involving moral \nturpitude'' to the pre-1996 definition of that term. Before the 1996 \nlaws were passed, an immigrant had to have been sentenced to a year in \nprison for a crime involving moral turpitude to be deportable. Today, \nany crime that could lead to a sentence of a year--even if a judge \ndecides to impose no sentence whatsoever--qualifies as a crime \ninvolving moral turpitude. A one-year prison term requirement makes \nsense and could prevent great unfairness. Our immigration law should \nrespect the decisions of judges and juries, not seek to undermine them.\n  This bill also touches on an area that I have worked on extensively--\nexpedited removal. Expedited removal allows low-level INS officers with \ncursory supervision to return people who enter the United States to \ntheir home countries without opportunity for review. Although those who \nsay they fear returning are given the opportunity for a credible fear \nhearing, there is ample evidence that that protection is insufficient \nto help those who have learned to fear authority in their native lands, \nor those whose grasp of English is halting or nonexistent. Senator \nBrownback and I last year introduced S. 1940, the Refugee Protection \nAct, which would restrict the use of expedited removal to immigration \nemergencies, as certified by the Attorney General. I have been greatly \ndisappointed that the Judiciary Committee has not scheduled a hearing \non this bipartisan bill. I hope that we can still take action in this \nCongress to resolve this critical human rights issue. Meanwhile, I \nstrongly support this bill's provision to restrict the use of expedited \nremoval to our ports of entry. The INS has recently begun implementing \nexpedited removal inside the United States. I believe an expansion of \nthis program is inappropriate,\n\n[[Page S9389]]\n\nconsidering the bipartisan movement in Congress to reevaluate its \nexistence even at our ports of entry. This bill will limit expedited \nremoval's growth while we continue our efforts to restrict its use \naltogether.\n  I would also like to note this bill's restoration of the authority of \nfederal courts to review INS decisions. Portions of this authority were \nstripped in both 1996 bills, a move I opposed at the time and continue \nto oppose today. Congress should not be in the business of \nmicromanaging the federal docket, especially in politically sensitive \nareas such as immigration law. We should restore the pre-1996 status \nquo and give federal courts back the power we improvidently removed in \nthe midst of the anti-immigration movement that seized this Congress.\n  I have highlighted only some of the excellent provisions in this bill \ntoday. This legislation also contains good provisions addressing the \ndetention of immigrants, and allowing immigrants who have already been \ndeported under the 1996 laws to reopen their cases. We cannot be \ncontent simply to fix these problems while ignoring those who have \nalready been harmed by them. Rather, we must find a way to rectify the \nsituations of those who have been treated unfairly over the last four \nyears.\n  Although it is late in this Congress, there is a real opportunity for \naction on these issues. The House has already passed bipartisan \nlegislation eliminating some of the retroactive effects of the 1996 \nlaws. That legislation is not comprehensive enough in my view, but it \nis a good start, and it shows that members on both sides of the aisle \nare concerned about the effects--perhaps unintended--of those laws.\n  I would like to thank Senator Kennedy and Senator Graham for their \nhard and consistent work on these issues. I am happy to be able to join \nwith them and I hope that we can work together to gain attention for \nthis bill, and convince our colleagues and the Administration that \nthese are changes that need to be made this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. HUTCHINSON:\n  S. 3122.

A bill to provide for Federal class action reform; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n          consumer rights in federal class actions act of 2000\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I offer today legislation entitled \nthe ``Consumer Rights in Federal Class Actions Act of 2000.'' It is \ndesigned to incorporate checks upon the abuses of class action law that \nhas led to an increasing number of suits where the primary benefit \naccrues to the attorney, and not the class represented. The bill also \ntakes steps to ensure that attorney fees in class action resolutions \nare in proportion to the benefits that actually accrue to the class.\n  The last few years have seen the rise of ``coupon settlements'' in \nclass action suits, in which attorneys reap literally hundreds of \nthousands of dollars in fees while the class members merely receive \ncoupons for discounts on later purchases. For instance, in one well-\nknown airline price-fixing settlement, class members received coupons \nin $8, $10, and $25 denominations which could not be pooled. In another \nclass action settlement, a manufacturer was sued because its \ndishwashers caught on fire under conditions of normal use. Under the \nsettlement, customers were provided coupons to purchase replacement \ndishwashers from the very same maker. So not only are the trial lawyers \nhitting the jackpot for themselves, but the defendants in many coupon \nsettlements actually receive the benefit of a promotional tool for \ntheir products. These types of deals only further erode the credibility \nof our judicial system.\n  Moreover, notices to class members are so densely worded and \ndifficult to slog through that they are routinely ignored, and the \nclass action attorneys are free to proceed and negotiate without true \naccountability to their supposed clients. The idea of attorneys working \nfor the benefit of their clients has been turned on its head, and now \nin many class action lawsuits class members exist for the benefit of \nthe lawyer, and the lawyer walks away from the table with a large fee \nwhile the class members receive next to nothing.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee has recently addressed the problem of \n``coupon settlements'' with S. 353, the Class Action Fairness Act, \nwhich would move more large, multi-state claims into federal court \nwhere there has been more vigilance in reviewing class action \ncertifications and settlements. This is an important reform, but I \nthink we can take specific steps that go beyond this reform to cut down \non the number of ``coupon settlements'' in class action lawsuits.\n  The first reform in my bill requires that the attorney filing the \nclass action lawsuit file a pleading, including a disclosure of the \nrecovery sought for class members and the anticipated attorney's fees, \nalong with an explanation of how any attorney's fees will be \ncalculated. This will give the court and the public notice of what the \nattorney is actually attempting to accomplish with the litigation for \nthe class, and for themselves.\n  The second reform would require that, after a proposed settlement \nagreement has been filed by the parties, counsel for the class shall \nprovide notice to the class members of the expected benefits they will \nreceive, the rights they will waive through the settlement, the fee \namount class counsel will seek, an explanation of how the attorney fee \nwill be calculated and funded, and the right of any class member to \nenter comments into the court record about the proposed \nsettlement terms. This will give class members a\n\n[[Page S9390]]\n\nmore thorough knowledge about what they will receive in the settlement \ncompared to what the attorney would receive, and will provide the court \na mechanism for receiving comments from the class about the proposed \nsettlement terms before rejecting or approving the agreement.\n\n  The third reform would require a regular, continuing disclosure as to \nhow many members of the class are participating in the settlement. One \nof the dirty secrets of coupon settlements is that the benefits to the \nclass are often of such minimal value that the class members do not \neven bother to take the steps necessary to receive the benefit, making \nthe high fees received by the attorneys even more outrageous. Some \nsettlements even offer cash recoveries to class members that are so \nminimal that it is not worth their time to recover the funds. The \nrequired disclosure will be via Internet so that the public and legal \nresearchers can access the information, and also will be mailed \ndirectly to the class members for their information and use.\n  The final reform is that Congress will authorize a report by the \nJudicial Conference of the United States on ways to correct a \nparticular abuse by class action lawyers in which they use polling \nsurveys of the class to determine how many class members would utilize \nthe settlement, and then submit it to the court as evidence for \ndetermining an appropriate fee. Courts have indeed used these tools to \ndetermine fees, however, the polling numbers regularly overestimate \nclass utilization of the settlements by a wide margin, leading to \ninflated fee awards for class attorneys. My legislation directs the \nConference to make recommendations to ensure that attorneys receive \nfees that are commensurate with the degree that the lawsuit benefits \nthe class. The Judicial Conference is also directed to make \nrecommendations affecting the broader topic of ensuring that proposed \nclass action settlements are fair to the class members for whom the \nsettlements are supposed to benefit.\n  My legislation will expose the trial bar to greater scrutiny in \nlawsuits that are filed primarily to line their own pockets, give class \nmembers greater rights in assessing the settlement offers, and set in \nmotion other reforms that will put attorneys fees in line with the \nbenefit they bring to the class. This is a true consumers' rights bill \nthat will cut down on the abuses by the trial bar and shed more light \non who is actually being benefited by these lawsuits. I urge all of my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this commonsense reform.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. CONRAD:\n  S. 3125. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act, the Internal \nRevenue Code of 1986, and title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nsustain access to vital emergency medical services in rural areas; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n   Sustaining Access to Vital Emergency Medical Services Act of 2000\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Sustaining \nAccess to Vital Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Act of 2000. This bill \nwould take important steps to strengthen the emergency medical service \nsystem in rural communities and across the nation.\n  Across America, emergency medical care reduces human suffering and \nsaves lives. According to recent statistics, the average U.S. citizen \nwill require the services of an ambulance at least twice during his or \nher life. As my colleagues surely know, delays in receiving care can \nmean the difference between illness and permanent injury, between life \nand death. In rural communities that often lack access to local health \ncare services, the need for reliable EMS is particularly crucial.\n  Over the next few decades, the need for quality emergency medical \ncare in rural areas is projected to increase as the elderly population \nin these communities continues to rise. Unfortunately, while the need \nfor effective EMS systems may increase, we have seen the number of \nindividuals able to provide these services decline. Nationwide, the \nmajority of emergency medical personnel are unpaid volunteers. As rural \neconomies continue to suffer, and individuals have less and less time \nto devote to volunteering, it has become increasingly difficult for \nrural EMS squads to recruit and retain personnel. In my state of North \nDakota, this phenomenon has resulted in a sharp reduction in EMS squad \nsize. In 1980, on average there were 35 members per EMS squad; today, \nthe average squad size has plummeted to 12 individuals per unit. I am \nconcerned that continued reductions in EMS squad size could jeopardize \nrural residents' access to needed medical services.\n  For this reason, the legislation I introduce today includes two \ncomponents to help communities recruit, retain, and train EMS \nproviders. First, this proposal would establish a Rural Emergency \nMedical Services Training and Equipment Assistance program. This \nprogram would authorize $50 million in grant funding for fiscal years \n2001-2006, which could be used by rural EMS squads to meet various \npersonnel needs. For example, this funding could help cover the costs \nof training volunteers in emergency response, injury prevention, and \nsafety awareness; volunteers could also access this funding to help \nmeet the costs of obtaining State emergency medical certification. In \naddition, EMS squads would be offered the flexibility to use grant \nfunding to acquire new equipment, such as cardiac defibrillators. This \nis particularly important for rural squads that have difficulty \naffording state-of-the-art equipment that is needed for stabilizing \npatients during long travel times between the rural accident site and \nthe nearest urban medical facility. This grant funding could also be \nused to provide community education training in CPR, first aid or other \nemergency medical needs.\n  Second, the Sustaining Access to Vital Emergency Medical Services Act \nwould help individuals meet the costs of providing services by offering \nall volunteer emergency medical personnel a $500 income tax credit. \nVolunteers could use this credit to cover some of the incidental \nexpenses incurred in providing services, such as purchasing gasoline \nfor the vehicles they use to respond to emergencies or to buy medical \ngear like safety gloves and clothing. It is my hope that this tax \ncredit would provide an incentive for unpaid EMS volunteers to \ncontinue providing services and for new volunteers to join rural \nemergency medical squads.\n\n  In addition to the provisions I have just described, this legislation \nalso includes two other measures that would provide additional \nresources to EMS squads. The Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 reduced \ninflationary update payments to ambulance providers through 2002. This \nmeans that during this time frame, ambulance providers have not been \ngiven adequate resources to keep up with increasing service demands. To \nensure ambulance providers receive appropriate resources, this \nlegislation would eliminate the BBA market basket reductions and would \ninstead provide a full inflationary update over the next two years. \nAlso, this bill would provide an extra one percentage point increase in \nfiscal year 2001 to all EMS providers.\n  In addition, this proposal takes steps to fix the shortcomings of the \nnewly implemented Medicare ambulance fee schedule. The negotiated \nrulemaking committee that developed the fee schedule voiced concern \nthat the payment system does not adequately account for the costs of \nproviding emergency care to low-volume rural areas. In response to this \nconcern, the Committee included an add-on payment for services provided \nto rural areas. While this payment adjustment is a step in the right \ndirection, we must go further in identifying low-volume areas and \nensuring EMS providers are paid appropriately for serving these \ncommunities. This proposal would direct the Department of Health and \nHuman Services (HHS) to conduct a study and provide recommendations to \nCongress on options for providing more appropriate payments to the \nnation's rural EMS providers. In conjunction with providing these \nrecommendations, HHS would be required to implement any appropriate \nreimbursement changes by January 1, 2002.\n  It is my hope that the Sustaining Access to Vital Emergency (SAVE) \nMedical Services Act will help ensure EMS providers can continue \nproviding quality medical care to our communities. I urge my colleagues \nto support this important effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HAGEL (for himself and Mr. Biden):\n\n[[Page S9391]]\n\n  S. 3126. A bill to amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to revise \nand improve provisions relating to famine prevention and freedom from \nhunger; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n   famine prevention and freedom from hunger improvement act of 2000\n\n Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to \namend title XII of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. Title XII \ndescribes the relationship between American universities and the United \nStates Agency for International Development (USAID), with respect to \nUSAID's international agriculture development programs. I am pleased to \nbe joined in introducing this bill by my distinguished colleague from \nDelaware, Senator Biden.\n  This bill revitalizes the relationship between our universities, \ntheir public and private partners, and USAID. It reflects the fact that \nagriculture development work has changed dramatically in the past few \nyears. For example, universities have long been important partners in \nthe United States' efforts to promote agricultural development and \ndecrease world hunger, but universities are no longer ivory towers. \nThey now work with a variety of public and private partners to carry \nout agriculture-related assistance projects. This bill authorizes \nuniversities to utilize such partners when carrying out projects for \nUSAID.\n  The bill also reflects the fact that agriculture development work \nincreasingly focuses on income generation, rather than simply on \nhousehold subsistence production. In addition to helping farmers grow \nenough to feed their immediate families, foreign agricultural \nassistance should also help farmers market and sell their products, and \nmaximize their household income. This bill recognizes this new focus on \nincome generation as a goal of American foreign agricultural assistance \nprograms.\n  Lastly, the bill reflects the fact that sustainable development has \nincreased in importance. Environmental and natural resource issues \nshould be considered as part of the big picture in agriculture \ndevelopment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record immediately following these remarks.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3126\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my good friend \nSenator Hagel in introducing the Famine Prevention and Freedom from \nHunger Improvement Act of 2000.\n  The challenge facing developing nations whose people live in hunger \ntoday is no longer just how to increase food production. As we enter \nthe new millennium, those countries must also confront the problems of \ninadequate income, lack of access to markets for both producers and \nconsumers, and unsustainable natural resource management practices.\n  One of the keys to all these issues must be a new, more productive \nrelationship between educational institutions--here in the U.S. and in \nthe affected countries--and their private partners involved in \nagricultural development. In short, they must become part of the new, \nhigher-tech, international agricultural economy. This bill, an \namendment to the Foreign Assistance Authorization Act, is designed to \nmove us in that direction.\n  Mr. President, when delegates from around the world gathered in Rome \nin 1996 for the World Food Summit, they pledged to reduce by half the \nnumber of people suffering from hunger by the year 2015. At that time \nthe number of hungry people was estimated to be between 830 and 840 \nmillion. Now, four years later, the Food and Agriculture Organization \nof the United Nations estimates that there are 790 million people in \nthe developing world who do not get enough the eat each day. This is \npositive news, but it is painfully evident that more needs to be done.\n  Title XII of the FAA, Famine Prevention and Freedom from Hunger, was \nwritten in 1975, at a time when there was a significant level of famine \nand hunger in the world. Its aim was to involve U.S. universities in \nthe fight to increase food production. Mr. President, that mission has \nachieved a large degree of success. It is time to go beyond the basic \nissue of production, to take on the further challenges of increasing \naccess to markets, improving shipping and storage, promoting \nenvironmentally sustainable agriculture, and turning farming in \ndeveloping nations from a subsistence activity into a source of income.\n  The U.S. Action Plan on Food Security was developed to fulfill \nAmerica's part of the 1996 commitment to cut in half the number of \nhungry persons by 2015. This plan includes several key priority areas, \nincluding strengthened research and educational capacity, increased \nliberalization of trade and investment, and greater attention to \nnatural resource management and environmental degradation. This \nlegislation furthers U.S. efforts by amending title XII of the Foreign \nAssistance Act to reflect these priorities.\n  As a donor country, our task is to channel assistance into the areas \nin which it is most needed, and to use the most effective means to do \nso. American land and sea grant colleges have been engaged in \nagricultural research for years and, increasingly in the past decade, \nhave partnered with private research institutions. In my own state of \nDelaware, Mr. President, both the University of Delaware and Delaware \nState University are engaged in just the kind of research that could \nbenefit from the support this legislation will provide.\n  I would wager, Mr. President, that most Americans are not aware of \nthe many direct benefits that our country's foreign assistance programs \ncan provide for us right here at home. Our commitment to reduce hunger \nin developing countries not only benefits those in need: with the \nchanges this bill proposes, we will increase the existing benefits to \nU.S. universities and research institutions, and our private \norganizations involved in agricultural development. Our assistance \nprograms, while primarily aimed at helping those abroad, can and should \nreflect our commitment to involve U.S. universities and businesses, \nwith all of their expertise and experience, in making the world a \nhealthier, more productive, and a safer place.\n  Mr. President, here in the United States, we are experiencing a \nperiod of unprecedented growth. At a time in which we have so much, I \nbelieve that we have a moral obligation to share our blessings. This \nbill helps us to shift our priorities to reflect changing realities so \nthat the generosity of the American people is as effective and targeted \nas possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. SANTORUM (for himself, Mr. Hutchinson, and Mr. Fitzgerald:)\n  S. 3127. A bill to protect infants who are born alive; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n               born alive infants protection act of 2000\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nBorn Alive Infants Protection Act. I would like to thank Senator \nHutchinson and Senator Fitzgerald for joining me as original sponsors. \nThis bill is the Senate companion to H.R. 4292, which the House of \nRepresentatives passed by a vote of 380-15.\n  When I came to the Senate six years ago, I never imagined that the \nbill I am offering today would be necessary. Simply stated, this \nmeasure gives legal status to a fully born living infant regardless of \nthe circumstances of his or her birth. I am deeply saddened that we \nmust clarify federal law to specify that a living newborn baby is, in \nfact, a person.\n  One could ask, ``Why do you need federal legislation to state the \nobvious? What else could a living baby be, except a person?'' I will \nbegin my explanation with events in 1995, when the Senate began its \nattempts to outlaw a horrifying, inhumane, and barbaric abortion \nprocedure: partial birth abortion. In this particular abortion method, \na living baby is killed when he or she is only inches from being fully \nborn. Twice, the House and Senate have stood united in sending a bill \nto President Clinton to ban this procedure. Twice, the President has \nvetoed the bill. And twice, the House courageously voted to override \nthe veto. Although support in the Senate grew each time the ban came to \na vote, the Senate fell a few votes shy of overriding the veto.\n  The Supreme Court's ruling in Stenberg v. Carhart, as well as \nsubsequent rulings in lower courts, are disturbing on a number of \nlevels. First, the Supreme Court struck down Nebraska's attempt to ban \na grotesque procedure the American Medical Association has called ``bad \nmedicine,'' and thousands of physicians who specialize in high risk \npregnancies have called ``never medically necessary.'' Further, the \nCourt said it did not matter that the baby is killed when it is almost \ntotally outside the mother's body in this abortion method. In other \nknown abortion methods, the baby is killed in utero. Finally, the U.S. \nSupreme Court, and the Third Circuit Court have stated it does not \nmatter when the baby is positioned when it is aborted. This assertion, \nto me, is the most horrifying of all.\n  In the five years worth of debates on partial birth abortion, I have \nasked Senators a very simple question: ``If a partial birth abortion \nwas being performed on a baby, and for some reason the head slipped out \nand the baby was delivered, would the doctor and the mother have the \nright to kill that baby?'' In five years, not one Senator who defended \nthe procedure has provided a straightforward ``yes'' or ``no'' \nresponse. They would not answer my question. So last year, I revised \nit. In an effort to try to define when a child may be protected by the \nConstitution, I asked whether it would be alright to kill a baby whose \nfoot is still inside the mother's body, or what if only a toe is \ninside? Again, I did not receive an answer.\n  Unfortunately, evidence uncovered at a recent hearing before the \nHouse Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution suggests my questions \nwere not so hypothetical. In fact, two nurses testified to seeing \nbabies who were born alive as a result of induced labor abortions being \nleft to die in soiled utility rooms. Furthermore, the intellectual \nframework for legalization of killing unwanted babies is being \nconstructed by a prominent bioethics professor at Princeton University. \nProfessor Peter Singer has advocated allowing parents a 28 waiting \nperiod to decide whether\n\n[[Page S9394]]\n\nto kill a disabled or unhealthy newborn. In his widely disseminated \nbook, Practical Ethics, he asserts, ``killing a disabled infant is not \nmorally equivalent to killing a person. Very often it is not wrong at \nall.''\n  In response to these events, the Born Alive Infants Protection Act \ngrants protection under federal law to newborns that are fully outside \nof the mother. Specifically, it states that federal laws and \nregulations referring to a ``person,'' ``human being,'' ``child,'' and \n``individual'' include ``every infant member of the species homo \nsapiens who is born alive at any stage of development.'' ``Born alive'' \nmeans ``the complete expulsion or extraction from its mother of that \nmember, at any stage of development, who after such expulsion or \nextraction breathes or has a beating heart, pulsation of the umbilical \ncord, or definitive movement of voluntary muscles, regardless of \nwhether the umbilical cord has been cut, and regardless of whether the \nexpulsion or extraction occurs as a result of natural or induced labor, \ncaesarean section, or induced abortion.'' The definition of ``born \nalive'' is derived from a World Health Organization definition of \n``live birth'' that has been enacted in 30 states and the District of \nColumbia.\n  Again, all this bill says is that a living baby who is completely \noutside of its mother is a person, a human being, a child, and an \nindividual. Similar legislation passed by the House of Representatives \nreceived overwhelming bipartisan support from Members on both sides of \nthe general abortion debate. I am hopeful that the Senate and the \nPresident can agree that once a baby is completely outside of its \nmother, it is a person, deserving protections and dignity afforded to \nall other Americans.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Born Alive Infants \nProtection Act be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3127\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Born-Alive Infants \n     Protections Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Born-\nAlive Infants Protection Act. While I am profoundly saddened by the \nfact that such legislation has become necessary, I am proud to be an \noriginal cosponsor and commend Senator Santorum for his efforts on \nbehalf of those members of our society who don't yet have a voice.\n  While the abortion lobby announced its vociferous opposition to this \ncommon-sense legislation and will most-certainly denounce this as an \nattack on Role v. Wade, this is not such an attack. Rather, it is an \neffort to end the brutal practice of infanticide, and to reaffirm that \na child may not be killed once it has been born.\n  I simply do not know how some of my colleagues will be able to defend \nthe practice of killing children who have been born alive. We are \ntalking about children who have been fully delivered. As I think of the \nmoment I first held my grandson Jackson, I am repelled by the fact that \nour society has degenerated to the point where some people say that \nJackson's life should be able to be taken even after his birth. I truly \nfear that if this practice is not stopped, some day, when the Peter \nSingers of the world have their way, the weakest members of our \nsociety--babies, the mentally retarded, the terminally ill, and the \nelderly--will have their lives taken from them against their will after \nsomeone has determined that their life is not meaningful.\n  Accordingly, I ask that my colleagues join me and work to enact this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. ROTH (for himself, Mr. Sarbanes, and Mr. Biden):\n  S.J.

Mr. President, Senator Bob Smith has a substitute amendment \nat the desk and I ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Lott], for Mr. Smith of \n     New Hampshire, proposes an amendment numbered 4272.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent that the substitute be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4272) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to encourage \nmy colleagues to support final passage of S. 1752, a bill to \nreauthorize the Coastal Barrier Resources Act, CBRA. I am offering a \nmanager's amendment in the nature of a substitute that makes several \nimportant changes to the bill that was reported by the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works. These changes have been negotiated with \nthe House Committee on Natural Resources. I believe that in adopting \nthese changes, we will not only improve the bill, but will also ensure \nthat this important legislation is signed into law this year.\n  Most people do not realize that coastal barriers are the first line \nof defense protecting the mainland from major storms and hurricanes. \nThis extremely vulnerable area is under increasing pressure from \ndevelopment. From 1960 to 1990, the population of coastal areas \nincreased from 80 to 110 million, and is projected to reach over 160 \nmillion by 2015. Continued development on and around coastal barriers \nplace people, property and the environment at risk.\n  To address this problem Congress passed CBRA in 1982. This extremely \nimportant legislation prohibits the Federal Government from subsidizing \nflood insurance, and providing other financial assistance, such as \nbeach replenishment, within the Coastal Barrier Resources System, \nSystem. Nothing in CBRA prohibits development on coastal barriers; it \njust gets the Federal Government out of the business of subsidizing \nrisky development.\n  The law proved to be so successful that Congress expanded the Coastal \nBarrier System in 1990, with the support of the National Taxpayers \nUnion, the American Red Cross, Coast Alliance and Tax Payers for Common \nSense, to name just a few. The 1990 act doubled the size of the System \nto include coastal barriers in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, \nthe Great Lakes, and additional areas along the Atlantic and Gulf \ncoasts. Congress also allowed the inclusion of areas that are\n\n[[Page S9399]]\n\nalready protected for conservation purposes, such as parks and refuges. \nCurrently the system is comprised of 3 million acres and 2,500 \nshoreline miles.\n  Development of coastal barriers decreases their ability to absorb the \nforce of storms and buffer the mainland. The devastating floods of \nHurricane Floyd are a reminder of the susceptibility of coastal \ndevelopment to the power of nature. The Federal Emergency Management \nAgency reports that 10 major disaster declarations were issued for this \nhurricane, more than for any other single hurricane or natural \ndisaster. In fact, 1999 sets a record for major disaster declarations--\na total of 14 in that year alone. As the number of disaster \ndeclarations has crept up steadily since the 1980's, so has the cost to \ntaxpayers. Congress has approved on average $3.7 billion a year in \nsupplemental disaster aid in the 1990's, compared to less than $1 \nbillion a year in the previous decade.\n  Homeowners know the risk of building in these highly threatened \nareas. Despite this, taxpayers are continually being asked to rebuild \nhomes and businesses in flood-prone areas. The National Wildlife \nFederation published a study that found that over 40 percent of the \ndamage payments from the National Flood Insurance Program go to people \nwho have had at least one previous claim. A New Jersey auto repair shop \nmade 31 damage claims in 15 years.\n  At a time when climatologists believe that we are entering a period \nof turbulent hurricane activity after three decades of relative calm, \nthe safety concerns associated with continued development of coastal \nbarrier regions must also be considered. As roadway systems have not \nkept up with population growth, it will become increasingly difficult \nto evacuate coastal areas in the face of a major storm.\n  Beyond the economic and safety issues, another compelling reason to \nsupport the Coastal Barrier Resources Act is that it contributes to the \nprotection of our Nation's coastal resources. Coastal barriers protect \nand maintain the wetlands and estuaries essential to the survival of \ninnumerable species of fish and wildlife. Large populations of \nwaterfowl and other migratory birds depend on the habitat protected by \ncoastal barriers for wintering areas. Undeveloped coastal barriers also \nprovide unique recreational opportunities, and deserve protection for \npresent and future public enjoyment.\n\n  S. 1752, would reauthorize the act for 5 years and make some \nnecessary changes to improve implementation. Due to the complexity of \nthe coastal barrier maps, Congress periodically authorizes changes to \nthe map, primarily to correct errors. In this process, we always ask \nthe administration to determine whether or not a modification to the \ncoastal barrier maps is ``technical'' in nature. This provision would \nrequire the Secretary of the Interior to use a set of criteria when \nmaking this determination. The criteria that we included in the bill is \nbased on a rule that the administration proposed in 1982, and on \nguidance published in 1985.\n  This provision would require the Secretary to determine whether the \narea in question, at the time of its inclusion into the system, has \nmore than one structure per 5 acres and a ``complete set of \ninfrastructure.'' Infrastructure, for the purposes of this bill, is \ndescribed as a road with a reinforced roadbed, wastewater disposal \nsystem, electric service, and fresh water to each lot or building site. \nIf the area, at the time of its inclusion into the system, does not \nmeet all of the criteria, the Secretary is required to find that the \narea is undeveloped and therefore should remain in the system.\n  I strongly believe this criteria is necessary because some \nrecommendations recently made by the administration have concerned me. \nFor example, the administration claimed in one instance that a golf \ncart path should be considered a road. By requiring in law that a road \nmust contain a reinforced roadbed, Congress is indicating that we mean \nreal roads-roads where construction work has been done by a public or \nprivate entity to ensure that the road includes surfaces, shoulders, \nroadsides, structures, and any traffic control devices as are necessary \nfor safe use. This definition will preclude future golfcart paths and \ntrails from being considered legitimate roads.\n  S. 1752 will also require the Secretary of the Interior to complete a \npilot project to determine the feasibility of creating digital versions \nof the coastal barrier system maps. Digital maps would improve the \naccuracy of the older coastal barriers maps, and make it easier for the \nDepartment of Interior and homeowners to determine where a structure is \nlocated. Eventually, we hope that the entire system can be accessed by \nthe Internet.\n  I believe that Congress should make every effort to conserve barrier \nislands and beaches. This legislation offers an opportunity to increase \nprotection of coastal barriers, and at the same time, save taxpayers \nmoney. I urge my colleagues to support S. 1752.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the bill, as \namended, be read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, before the majority leader leaves, I think \nwhat we have heard today has been comforting, except for one thing. I \nwish we had a vehicle here before us that we could amend. I think we \nhave a number of amendments we would like to offer to this legislation. \nThe leader decided not\n\n[[Page S9401]]\n\nto do that. I hope in the next few days we can work on some of the \nissues that we believe are so important, which we have talked about on \nmany occasions, such as minimum wage, Patients' Bill of Rights, \nprescription drugs, and education. We understand where we are in a \nparliamentary situation now that we can't offer any amendments. We look \nforward to the next week being very productive and our being able to \nmove forward on some of this very important legislation.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in response, I believe the Senate has voted \none or more times on all of the issues that Senator Reid mentioned. It \nis my full expectation that before this session is over a minimum wage \nbill, coupled with a small business tax relief package that we will \nhave to work through the final details on, will be incorporated in some \nother bill or moved in one way or another and sent to the President. I \nfully expect that it will be accomplished.\n  I think maybe the Senator knows there is a Patients' Bill of Rights \nconference that is still meeting. I think there are meetings, even \ntoday, to see if we can come to an agreement to get a bill that truly \nprotects patients, but not just become a bill that provides more \nopportunities for my brother-in-law to sue people. So I am hopeful on a \ncombination there. In fact, I discussed that with the President \ndirectly and said we would still like to see if we couldn't have some \nsort of a sit-down meeting and a broad, bipartisan, bicameral, ``bi-\nbranch'' of the Government discussion and get an end result. I am still \nhopeful that can occur.\n\n  On education, obviously, when we get to the Labor-HHS-Education \nappropriations conference report, it is going to have funds for \neducation in it--more funds than was requested by the administration or \nwas in our budget resolution. We will have to come to some agreement \nabout how we help local school districts in terms of flexibility, \naccountability, school construction, and if the best way to be helpful \nis a bond or some other program. All of that is under discussion now, \nand it is occurring between the House and Senate and the \nadministration.\n  So certainly I understand that there is a desire to perhaps offer \nother amendments. I am sure the Senator can understand my feeling that \nwe have already voted on all of those issues, and repeated votes don't \nnecessarily render a result. I think what we need to do in this final \nperiod of the session is get agreements and work together.\n  I had a meeting with Senator Daschle. We talked about a bill that has \nbroad bipartisan support--actually, a couple of bills. We looked at \nwhether we can consider them on the floor, or if there is another way \nwe can get a result that would be satisfactory to the largest number of \nSenators without having an extended cloture process, such as we had on \nH-1B.\n  I have indicated I would like for us to see if we can find a way to \ndo the railroad retirement bill. But if I bring that up, it probably \nwould have to go through a lot of hurdles, and there is opposition to \nsome aspects of it. Instead of trying to find a way to have a fight, I \nam trying to find a way to get an agreement and get it done.\n  I certainly understand Senator Reid's position. He has been \npersistent in that effort, and he has done it without rancor. I \nappreciate that. As we go into these final few days of the session, \nhopefully we can keep the channels of communication open and see what \nwe can do to facilitate a conclusion with which most Senators can be \nsatisfied.\n  Mr. REID. Finally, the majority leader raised the minimum wage issue. \nI believe we can do something on a bipartisan basis. The three Senators \non the floor presently--two Democrats and one Republican--know that one \nof the tax incentives we have to give small business is a meals tax \ndeduction. We cut that back significantly and it has hurt restaurant \nbusinesses all over America. For Mississippi, having a heavy resort \nindustry, along with Atlantic City and Nevada, I think that is \nsomething we can do on a bipartisan basis.\n  I hope we can get the minimum wage issue before us and have decent \ntax breaks that aren't budget busters and move forward on that.\n  On the Patients' Bill of Rights, for example, sadly, the structure of \nthe Senate has changed by one. We believe we are entitled to another \nvote, and that failed by one vote previously. That is an issue we can \ndebate later in some other forum. We have talked enough today on H-1B \nand matters related thereto. I can say that I am comforted by the fact \nthat we were able to get an early vote on the motion to suspend the \nrules. I hope that will satisfy everybody because it was an up-or-down \nvote on the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act.\n  I hope we can set that matter aside and schedule an early vote on H-\n1B.\n  Mr. LOTT. I would be glad to work with Senator Reid and our \ncolleagues to see if we can find a time to do that tomorrow. I ask our \nstaff to see if we can work through that agreement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I understand that I have 15 minutes \nbased on the unanimous consent agreement that we just concluded.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/27/senate-section/article/S9401-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9401-S9403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             TRANSPORTATION\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am getting very close to the end of \nmy Senate career. One of the issues I consider vital in terms of my \nknowledge and experience in the Senate for these last 18 years is that \nI have learned, among several other serious problems, of a problem that \nlooms large and is often ignored. That is, how do we establish our \ntransportation system to satisfy the growing needs for travel in this \ncountry?\n  I see a crisis looming in our country because of congestion and \nbecause of our inability to move in a timely and reasonably comfortable \nfashion. We constantly read about delays at airports. As a matter of \nfact, these days I can almost never travel by air without resigning \nmyself to the fact that I am not going to get there on time. There is a \nvery good chance that I am going to miss my connection. There is a very \ngood chance that a flight may be canceled. There is a very good chance \nthat it is going to be a stressful, tough trip.\n  I was fortunate enough to be a grandparent for the eighth time. My \nson lives in Colorado. I am, as everyone knows, I hope, from New \nJersey. My son and his wife just had their first child, my number eight \ngrandchild. The oldest is six years old. They are little kids. They are \nan awful lot of fun. I would like to see more of them if I could do it \nand still make sure I perform the duties necessary to represent the \npeople of New Jersey and the people of this country.\n  The trip I made consisted of two legs: one to Denver, CO, and the \nnext one a short trip outside of Denver. It was on a Saturday. It \nwasn't on a busy weekday. It left an hour late from Newark. We were \ntold that we should plan on a refueling stop in Wichita, KS. I have \nnothing against Kansas. I just didn't want to stop there if I didn't \nhave to, because I was in such a hurry to get out and see my newest \ngranddaughter. Her name is Hannah Lautenberg. I wanted to see her in \nthe worst way. We stopped in Wichita long enough, about 40 minutes, to \nadd more fuel.\n  Why did we leave the Newark airport to start on a trip knowing full \nwell that we weren't going to have enough fuel to make the trip? They \nsaid, based on the passenger load, the baggage load, and the severe \nheadwinds that we were going to run into, we had to provide for \ncircling over Denver Airport in case that was necessary. We managed to \ntake on the fuel. We didn't have to circle over Denver. The weather was \nreasonable. But it was enough for me to miss my next flight.\n  I called ahead and tried to reserve the second flight 2 hours later \nand was told that it was canceled and that the one 2 hours after that \nwas full. Normally I would have exploded. But nobody would have cared. \nThe worst thing is that you kind of resign yourself to saying, ``Oh, \nwell, that is what I expected.'' Instead of getting a 30-minute \nairplane ride, I took a 2\\1/2\\ hour van ride bouncing along the \npavement and trying to figure out what to do to keep myself amused \nduring that period of time. It was hard to read.\n  I got to see that beautiful grandchild. Boy, was I happy, too. She \nwas as glorious as my daughter-in-law and my son described her. I \nthought she looked a lot like me. They said no. But it was a pleasant \nexperience.\n\n[[Page S9402]]\n\n  I stayed overnight and planned to take a 1:30 flight out because I \nhad only come in 5 o'clock the night before to Denver, CO from New \nJersey. But I was told that the short flight was canceled and that I \nhave to go back in the van. I have nothing against the van, the \ncompany, or the driver. It was just a lot of time to spend together \nwith a stranger. That is what I did.\n  I got back having missed two legs of the flight for which I paid in \nadvance. I am not blaming that particular airline.\n  It is terrible what we have adjusted to. We have adjusted to poor \nperformance. We have adjusted to discomfort. We have adjusted to not \nhaving services that we paid for. That is the kind of society we \ncreated.\n\n  I have all kind of friends. I come out of the corporate world, as the \ndistinguished occupant of the Chair knows, and am accustomed to \nbusiness travel. In the days before I came to the Senate, you would \nhave a reservation and arrive kind of at the last minute, get on the \nplane, arrive on time, do your business, and get on your way. It is not \nso anymore at all.\n  Again, it is not simply because the airlines are neglectful or that \nthe airlines aren't trying. They simply can't carry the load.\n  We have to face up to it. If you have bad weather in Denver, CO, you \ncan bet your boots that you will be held up by aviation travel \nthroughout the country. If you have bad weather, as we do even in \nWashington, DC, where sometimes they say the weather is always sunny--\nit is hard to believe that--you get stuck, and you feel it all over the \ncountry.\n  We had a meeting at the Newark airport. I sat down with people from \nthe FAA, the Secretary of Transportation, people from the controllers \noperation, people who manage the airports, and people from the Air \nTransport Committee who operate the airlines.\n  I asked one question: Is the sky a finite place or can we say it is \ninfinite and just put every airplane that you can get in the sky up \nthere without feeling the impact? I don't think they were surprised. I \nwas. The answer was no. It is crowded up there.\n  I went to a place in central southern New Jersey just about two-\nthirds of the way down where a couple of weeks ago we had an airplane \ncrash. Two airplanes with a total of 11 people collided in the sky on a \nbright, sunny day. All 11 people died. It was a miracle that more \npeople on the ground were not killed. I don't want to get too grizzly. \nBut part of the airplane fell through a house roof with people in it. \nIt was a stark reminder about how this system is overloaded.\n  I fly a lot in the second seat in the airplane, listen to the radio, \nand do some of the observing that one has to do in an airplane cockpit.\n  I hear over the collision warning system ``traffic,'' ``traffic,'' \n``traffic.'' That means that there are airplanes close enough to you \nthat you had better be careful.\n  I point these out because we have our heads in the sand. We are not \nfacing up to the problem. There is no more room in the sky.\n  I can tell you this: There are no communities that I have seen \nbegging for more airplanes to come into their airports. I have not seen \nanybody that says, let's not build more highways. I don't care if the \ncars pass underneath my window making noise all night. I don't care if \nmy kids read that excessive carbon monoxide and other emissions come \nout of automobiles and diesel trucks. I don't know of anybody saying \nthat. They are saying, help us get around more effectively. There is \none way to do that, Mr. President; that is, get this country into the \n21st century transportation mode.\n  Not too long ago, I was on a trip to NATO and went from Brussels, \nBelgium, to Paris, France, a distance of 200 miles in about an hour and \n25 minutes. We are 250 miles from New York. Sometimes I make it in a \ncool 4 hours by air, because I have to get on the plane. One time they \ntold me: Get on the plane, Senator. I want you to know that we are \nmoving away from the gate but we are going to wait 3 hours because of \nthe line-up of traffic before we can take off. But we have to pull away \nfrom the gate. So please make the adjustment.\n  In 1987 I had the good fortune to understand the problem and wrote \nthe law that banned smoking in airplanes. It happened right here. It \nwas a tough fight, but we got it through. I thought, my goodness, \nsuppose we had to sit in an airplane 3 hours before we took off today \nwith the people who are accustomed to smoking in airplanes saying to \nthe pilot while banging on the door: Let us smoke. It would have been \nawful, and people across the country would have been in rebellion if \nthey had to do that. So there is a solution: Get on with an investment \nin high-speed rail.\n\n  I have heard debate on this floor that distresses me, from \nintelligent people, from people who say: No, we don't want to spend any \nmore on Amtrak, we have spent enough. This is a cash guzzler.\n  The fact of the matter is, we haven't done the job that we planned or \nthat we thought we should have. We have spent $23 billion, \napproximately, since Amtrak--as we know it now--was developed in the \nearly 1970s. It sounds like a lot of money, but it isn't a lot of \nmoney, not when we consider what we put into aviation, what we put into \nairports over the same period of time. I repeat, $23 billion since \n1971.\n  Since that period of time, we have spent $160 billion on aviation \nprograms, $380 billion on highways. Yes, we do collect a highway tax, \nand I am not saying we haven't done a pretty good job in building \nhighways and airports. I am glad to see things being updated and \nupgraded. The fact of the matter is, when it is compared to $23 billion \nin Federal subsidies for high-speed rail, it is a drop in the bucket. \nGermany is going to spend $70 billion in a decade upgrading its high-\nspeed rail system. We ought to learn from that.\n  To say just because a State doesn't have active rail service they \ndon't want it to happen is crazy. Everybody doesn't have the same kind \nof aviation airline service we have in Chicago or New York or Los \nAngeles or Dallas, TX. But we help the system perform. We pay funds \ninto FAA and build control towers and build a flight service network. \nWhy? Because it is good for the country. And so is high-speed rail, \neven if it doesn't touch your neighborhood.\n  As a matter of fact, we have a bunch of locations that are going to \nbe beneficiaries of high-speed rail. They are included in 14 of the \nmost congested urban areas that are designated high-speed corridors, \nincluding Chicago, Los Angeles, Seattle, Atlanta, GA, Houston, TX, \nWashington, DC, and Portland, OR, just to name a few of the places that \nare going to benefit by investments in high-speed rail. However, we \nhave a problem convincing people from those States that it is good for \nthem, that we ought to be spending more money on getting this system up \nto snuff.\n  I proposed a piece of legislation that calls for $10 billion worth of \ncapital investment by Amtrak over the next 10 years to try to bring the \nsystem up to grade for the 21st century. That is on top of other \nsubsidies for which we appropriate funds. It gives them the ability to \nsell $10 billion worth of bonds. The Federal Government does have to \ntake some cost for providing a tax credit for bondholders.\n  The benefits are enormous. Within 2 weeks, we will see the first \nhigh-speed rail train set come into Washington. It will be there just \nas a showpiece to tell us what is coming. Very soon thereafter, within \n4 or 5 weeks, we will be seeing high-speed rail service or modified \nhigh-speed rail service in this corridor, between Washington and New \nYork. We started in New York, the New York to Boston route. It is not \ntruly high-speed rail; it is modified high-speed. It took an hour and a \nhalf off a 5\\1/2\\-hour trip, and the trains are loaded. It is as if \npeople were standing on the platform for weeks waiting to find a train \nride that would get them to their destinations, depending on weather, \novercrowded skies, congestion all over the place, getting in your car \nand sitting there with all of the toxic emissions, all of the \npollution, waiting for the traffic to move along. It was indeed a \nblessing, recognized by the public.\n  When we get the system in the New York to Washington area, it will be \nconsiderably less than a 3-hour trip. That competes very effectively \nwith aviation and the shuttle flights. We have approximately 100 \nflights a day. I don't want to deprive the airlines of revenue. That is \nnot my mission. My mission is to help the American public\n\n[[Page S9403]]\n\nget to their destinations on time, not miss connections, and to feel \nmore comfortable, and lift the spirit of people who have to travel for \na living, or recreationally, for family reunions or all kinds of \nreasons--to make it easier. That is the mission we are on.\n\n  We have endorsements from many organizations. I know the occupant of \nthe Chair was a member of the National Governors' Association when he \nwas the Governor of Ohio. They endorse high-speed speed rail. National \nConference of State Legislatures; U.S. Conference of Mayors; we have \nenvironmentalists; the American Road and Transportation Association; \nthe AFL-CIO, Rail Labor Division; all people who have an interest in \nseeing high-speed rail. And newspapers that think about these things \nand whether or not they are going to be affected by this: The New York \nTimes, the Houston Chronicle, the Philadelphia Inquirer, the Chicago \nSun-Times, the Tampa Tribune, Minneapolis Star Tribune, and other \nnewspapers support this investment in high speed rail.\n  I think we ought to get on with it. I plead with my colleagues, don't \nlet this be a last-ditch stand to try to uproot the possibilities of \ngetting these trains underway, getting this track underway, getting the \nsignal systems underway. It will make a difference in lives all across \nthis country. Some of those whose States are serviced or will be \nserviced by this high-speed rail connection have to recognize what it \nmeans to them directly and step up to the plate and say this will be a \nnational asset, even if it doesn't touch any of the cities in my State.\n  Recognizing time is precious and not wanting to hold the present \noccupant of the chair to a stricter schedule than he would like, I am \nfeeling very generous and sympathetic because I know I am going to be \nable to call on the occupant of the chair to help us with the high-\nspeed rail situation. I thank the chair for the courtesy of permitting \nme to make these comments. This is a milestone for America. It is a \nvery important point in how we see ourselves getting from here to \nthere.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this with enthusiasm, knowing very \nwell this is going to be the mode of transportation that is essential \nto continue to carry out our responsibilities.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/27/senate-section/article/S9403-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECESS UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
