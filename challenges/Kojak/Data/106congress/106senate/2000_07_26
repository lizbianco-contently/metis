Mr. President, I am certain those who were observing the \nSenate Chamber yesterday and perhaps the day before are curious as to \nwhy absolutely nothing is happening. It reflects the fact that there is \nno agreement between the parties as to how to proceed on the business \nof the Senate, particularly on the appropriations bills.\n  At this moment in time negotiations are underway, and hopefully they \nwill be completed successfully very soon. At issue is the number of \namendments to be offered, the time for the debate, and some tangential \nbut very important issues such as the consideration of appointments of \nFederal district court judges across America to fill vacancies. These \njudgeships have been a source of great controversy in recent times \nbecause there is a clear difference of opinion between Democrats and \nRepublicans about how many judges should be appointed this year.\n  Of course, the Republicans in control of the Senate are hopeful that \ntheir candidate for President will prevail in November and that all of \nthe vacancies can then be filled by a Republican President. That is \nunderstandable. The Democrats, on the other hand, in the minority in \nthe Senate, have a President who has the authority to appoint these \njudges and wants to exercise that\n\n[[Page S7588]]\n\nauthority in this closing year. Therein lies the clash in \nconfrontation.\n  Historically, the last time the tables were turned and there was a \nRepublican President and a Democratic Senate, President Ronald Reagan \nhad 60 Federal district court judges appointed in the election year. In \nfact, there were hearings on some of them as late at September of that \nyear. This year, we have had about 30 appointed and we have many more \nvacancies, many more pending. We are hopeful, on the Democratic side, \nthese will be filled. Those on the Republican side are adamant that \nthey do not want to bring them up. I hope they will reconsider that and \nat least give Democrats the same consideration we offered President \nReagan when he faced a Democratic Senate with many Federal district \ncourt vacancies.\n  The other item of business which consumed our attention over the last \nweek or two related to tax relief. It is an interesting issue and one \nthat many Members like to take back home and discuss; certainly most \nAmerican families, regardless of whether they are rich or poor, desire \nsome reduction in their tax burden.\n  The difference of opinion between the Democrats and Republicans on \nthis issue is very stark. There is a consideration on the Republican \nside that tax relief should go to those who pay the most. Of course, \nthose who pay the most taxes are, in fact, the wealthiest in this \ncountry. We have a progressive tax system. We have had it for a long \ntime. We believe if one is fortunate enough to be successful, those \ntaxpayers owe something back to this country. Those who are more \nsuccessful owe more back to this country. You can't take blood from a \nturnip; you can't put a high tax rate on a person with a low income. \nBut you can certainly say to a successful person: We ask you to \ncontribute back to America. We ask you, in the payment of taxes, to \nhelp maintain this great Nation which has given you, your family, and \nyour business such a wonderful opportunity.\n  The Republican program from the start, as long as I have served in \nCongress, has always been to reduce the tax burden on those who are the \nwealthiest in this country. I happen to believe the tables should be \nturned and we should have a situation where those who are in the lower \nincome groups and middle-income families who are struggling to make \nends meet should be the ones most deserving of tax relief. That is a \ndifference in philosophy, a difference between the parties, and is \nreflected very clearly in the debate we have had over the last 2 weeks.\n  This is a chart which I have been bringing to the floor on a regular \nbasis. Some House Republicans told me this morning that they are tired \nof seeing my chart. They are going to have to get a little more \nexhausted because I am going to produce it again today. This chart \noutlines what happens with the Republican tax plans, with their idea of \ntax cuts.\n\n  In the area of the estate tax, a tax is imposed on less than 2 \npercent of the American population. Of 2.3 million people who die each \nyear, only 40,000 end up with any liability under the estate tax. It is \na tax reserved for those who really have large estates that they have \naccumulated during a lifetime. There are exemptions that people can \nwrite off when it comes to the estate tax liability, and those \nexemptions are growing, as they should, to reflect the cost of living \nincreases.\n  By and large, the Republicans have proposed to do away with the tax \ncompletely, so the very wealthiest of Americans who pay this tax would \nreceive the tax relief.\n  What does it mean? On the Republican plan, if you happen to be a \nperson making over $300,000 a year in income--if my calculations are \ncorrect, that is about $25,000 a month in income--the Republicans have \nsuggested you need an annual tax cut of $23,000 as a result of their \nelimination of the estate tax. That boils down to close to $2,000 a \nmonth, for those making $25,000 a month, that the Republicans would \nsend your way when it comes to tax relief.\n  Most American income categories are people making between $40,000 and \n$65,000 a year. Under the Republican plan, if you happen to be with the \nvast majority of Americans paying taxes, you aren't going to notice \nthis tax relief; $200 a year is what the Republicans offer to you. That \ncomes down to $16 a month they are going to send your way. If you are \nin the highest income categories, you receive $2,000 a month; if you \nhappen to be with the vast majority of Americans, you receive $16 a \nmonth.\n  That is the Republican view of the world. That is the Republican view \nof tax relief: If we are going to help people, for goodness' sake, \nlet's help the wealthy feel their pain, understand the anxiety they \nmust face in making investments, in choosing locations for new vacation \nhomes, and give them some tax relief.\n  The fact is that 80 percent of Americans are making under $50,000 a \nyear. For these Americans, $15 or $16 a month is something, but it is \ncertainly not going to change their lifestyle.\n  Mr. President, 26 percent of Americans make between $50,000 and \n$100,000 a year. In those two categories of people under $100,000 a \nyear and under $50,000 a year, we find the vast majority of American \nfamilies, the overwhelming majority, and the people who will not \nbenefit from the idea of tax relief propounded by the Republicans on \nthe floor. They suggest to all American families they have them in mind \nwhen it comes to tax relief. The facts tell a different story.\n  Look at what we have suggested instead. The Democrats think we have \nto be much more responsible in spending this Nation's surplus or \ninvesting. It wasn't that long ago we were deep in deficit with a \nnational debt that accumulated to almost $6 trillion. Now we are at a \npoint where we have a strong economy, families are doing better, \nbusinesses are doing better, people are making more money, and the tax \nrevenues coming in reflect it. That surplus is what we are debating. We \nhave gone from the days of the Reagan-Bush deficits to a new era where \nwe are talking about a surplus and what we will do with it.\n  Those who are younger in America should pay attention to this debate. \nIf you are a young person in America, we are about to give you a very \ngreat nation. Our generation hopes to hand over as good a country as we \nfound, perhaps even better, but we are also going to hand over to you a \nvery great debt of $6 trillion. That debt we have to pay interest on. \nIt is like a mortgage. You say to your children and grandchildren: \nWelcome to America, welcome to this land of opportunity, here's the \ndebt you will have to pay.\n\n  In the late 1980s and 1990s in America, the political leadership in \nthis country accumulated a massive debt, starting with the election of \nPresident Reagan, then with President Bush, and for the first few years \nof President Clinton we continued to see this debt grow. We have turned \nthe corner. Under the Clinton-Gore leadership, under the votes that \nhave been cast by Democrats in Congress, we now have a stronger \neconomy.\n  People have a right to ask, What are we going to do with the surplus? \nThe Republican answer is: Tax cuts for wealthy people. The Democratic \nanswer is much different: First, pay down the national debt. We can't \nguarantee the surplus will be here in a year, 2 years, or 10 years. If \nit is here, shouldn't it be our highest priority? Let's wipe off the \ndebt of this country as best we can, reduce the burden on our children, \ninvest in Social Security and in Medicare.\n  This is not a wild-eyed idea. It is what Alan Greenspan of the \nFederal Reserve recommends. It is what major economists recommend. But \nyou cannot sell it on the Republican side of the aisle. They think, \ninstead, we should give tax cuts to the wealthy.\n  We think we should bring down the national debt and invest in Social \nSecurity and Medicare. If we are to have tax cuts, let us target these \ntax cuts to people who really need them, not the folks making over \n$300,000 a year. They are going to do quite well. They are going to \nhave nice homes on islands off the coast of Maine. They are going to \nhave places in Florida and California. They are going to have a very \ncomfortable life.\n  But what about the people who live in Chicago? What about the people \nwho live in Portland, ME? What about those who live in Philadelphia, \nPA? I would like to take to them this proposal, not to eliminate taxes \non those making\n\n[[Page S7589]]\n\nover $300,000 a year but to say to working families and middle-income \nfamilies: Here are targeted tax cuts that you can use, that will help \nyour life. Let's provide for a marriage tax penalty elimination for \nworking families. Let's expand educational opportunities by making \ntuition costs tax deductible. Think about your concern of sending your \nson or daughter through college and the increasing cost of a college \neducation. For a family who is struggling to try to make ends meet and \nto give their kids the best opportunity, to be able to deduct those \ncollege education expenses means an awful lot more to them than the \ncomfort in knowing that Donald Trump does not have to pay estate taxes \nunder the Republican proposal.\n  That is the difference in our view of the world. The Republicans feel \nthe pain of Donald Trump, that he might have to pay these estate taxes. \nWe believe that families across America face a lot more anxiety and \npain over how to pay for college education expenses. We had a vote on \nthe floor here, up or down, take your pick: Estate tax relief for \nDonald Trump or college deductions for the families working across \nAmerica. Sadly, the Republicans would not support the idea of college \neducation expense deductions.\n  Let's talk about caring for elderly parents. Baby boomers understand \nthis. Everyone understands it. As your parents get older, they need \nspecial help. You are doing your best. I cannot tell you how many of my \nfriends this affects. I am in that generation of baby boomers--slightly \nolder, I might add--but in a generation where a frequent topic of \nconversation for my age group is how are your mom and dad doing? The \nstories come back, and some of them are heartbreaking, about \nParkinson's and Alzheimer's and complications with diabetes that lead \nto amputations and people finally having to make the tough decision of \nasking their parents to consider living in a place where they can \nreceive some assistance.\n  It is expensive. We, on the Democratic side, believe that helping to \npay for those expenses the families endure because of aging parents is \na good tax cut, one that is good for this country and good for the \nfamilies. Not so on the Republican side. When we offered this, they \nvoted against it. They would rather give estate tax relief to the \nwealthiest people.\n  How about child care? Everybody who got up this morning in America \nand headed to work and left a small child with a neighbor or at a day-\ncare center understands that this is tugging at your mind constantly \nduring the day. Is my child in safe hands? Is this a quality and \npositive environment for my child to be in? How much does it cost? Can \nwe afford it? Can we do a little better?\n  We, on the Democratic side, think we ought to help these families. \nThey are working families who should have peace of mind. Senator Dodd \noffered an amendment that proposed tax credits, not only for day care, \nbut also tax credits for stay-at-home moms who decide they are going to \nforgo working, to stay with the children and try to raise them. We want \nto help in both of those circumstances. We think those are the real \nproblems facing America. The Republicans instead believe that estate \ntax relief for the superrich is much more important.\n\n  Expand the earned-income tax credit for the working poor, help \nfamilies save for retirement, provide estate tax relief--particularly \nto make sure that a family-owned farm or a family-owned business can be \npassed on to the next generation. I think the estate tax needs reform. \nWe support that. We voted for it. But we think the Republican proposal \ngoes way too far in proposing we abolish it.\n  I see my time is coming to a close. We think the agenda before this \nCongress is an agenda of missed opportunities. The Republicans are in \ncontrol in the House and Senate. They decide what will be considered on \nthe floor, if anything. They have failed to bring forward commonsense \ngun safety legislation after Columbine, to try to keep guns out of the \nhands of kids and criminals. We passed it in the Senate with Al Gore's \nvote, sent it to the House--the gun lobby killed it. We lose 30,000 \nAmericans every year to gun violence; 12 children every single day. For \nthe Republicans, it is not a priority to bring this bill forward.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights, so your doctor can make the call on \nyour medical treatment or your family's medical treatment--most people \nthink that is common sense. The insurance companies do not. They want \ntheir clerks to make the decision based on the bottom line of profit \nand loss. It is not a medical decision for them, it is a financial \ndecision. And for a lot of families it is disastrous when they cannot \nget the appropriate care for their kids and their families. We think a \nPatients' Bill of Rights makes sense. The insurance lobby opposed it. \nThe insurance lobby prevailed. The special interest groups won on the \nfloor and we have gone nowhere with this proposal.\n  Minimum wage: $5.15 an hour for a minimum wage that affects some 10 \nmillion workers across America. It is about time for a pay raise. These \nfolks deserve to do better. It used to be bipartisan. We didn't even \nargue about it. Now the Republicans say: No, no no, we can't give a 50-\ncent-an-hour pay raise to people making $5.15 an hour. Do you realize \nthat 50 cents an hour comes out to, what, $1,000 a year that we will \ngive these people?\n  Yet we are going to turn around and give Donald Trump a $400 million \ntax break on his estate? You cannot give working families a thousand \nbucks a year, but you can give the one of the superrich $400 million \ntax relief? Is something upside-down in this Chamber? I think so.\n  Take a look at the prescription drug benefit. Ask Americans--\nDemocrats, Republicans, and Independents--the one thing we ought to do \nthis year? A guaranteed universal prescription drug benefit under \nMedicare. The pharmaceutical companies oppose it. They are pretty \npowerful characters in this town. They have stopped this Senate and \nthis House from considering it. Here we are, languishing, doing \nnothing, when it comes to a prescription drug benefit.\n  Finally, something for our schools. Seven million kids in America \nattend schools with serious safety code violations; 25,000 schools \nacross our country are falling down. Are we going to be ready for the \n21st century? Will our kids be ready? Will our workforce be ready? You \ncan answer that question by deciding at this point in time whether \neducation is truly a priority and, if it is such a priority, then for \ngoodness' sakes we should invest more than 1 percent of our Federal \nbudget in K-12 education. That is what we invest. The Democrats, under \nthe leadership of Senator Kennedy, believe that investment is overdue. \nWe think that is what families in America are looking for, not for tax \nrelief for the wealthiest among us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, obviously I had hoped we would be making a \nlot more progress this week on appropriations bills and other issues. \nThat has not transpired yet. But we have been filing cloture motions, \nand we will be getting votes. In some way we will deal this week with \nthe Treasury-Postal Service appropriations bill. I hope we can find a \nway to proceed on the energy and water appropriations bill. We will get \nto a vote at some point on the intelligence authorization bill. So, \nhopefully, we can still go forward.\n  I do not feel as if we are proceeding appropriately, but in spite of \nthat, I think it generally was interpreted or understood that I would \ntry to begin the discussion on the China PNTR bill. Even though it will \nbe difficult to get through the maze of clotures we have\n\n[[Page S7590]]\n\nhad to file this week, I still think it is the appropriate thing to do \nto begin this process because we do not know exactly how long it will \ntake to get to a final vote on the China trade issue.\n  I am still going to do my best to find a way to have the Thompson-\nTorricelli legislation considered in some manner before we get to the \nsubstance of the China trade bill because I think Chinese nuclear \nweapons proliferation is a very serious matter. We should discuss that \nand have a vote on it. I think it would be preferable to do it aside \nfrom the trade bill itself.\n  In the end, if we can't get any other way to get at it, these two \nSenators may exercise their right to offer it to the China PNTR bill. \nBut I am going to continue to try to find a way for that to be offered \nin another forum. I think Senator Daschle indicated he would work with \nus to try to see if we could find a way to do that. But I do think if \nwe can go ahead and get started--and since there will be resistance to \nthe motion to proceed--then we will file cloture and have a vote on it \nthen on Friday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/26/senate-section/article/S7590-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n NONDISCRIMINATORY TREATMENT TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA--MOTION \n                               TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of Rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to calendar No. 575, H.R. 4444, a bill to authorize \n     extension of nondiscriminatory treatment (normal trade \n     relations treatment) to the People's Republic of China:\n         Trent Lott, Pat Roberts, Larry E. Craig, Christopher \n           Bond, Chuck Grassley, Ted Stevens, Connie Mack, Orin \n           Hatch, Frank H. Murkowski, Wayne Allard, Kay Bailey \n           Hutchinson, Don Nickles, Bill Roth, Michael Crapo, \n           Slade Gorton, and Craig Thomas.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this cloture vote will occur on Friday, \nunless consent can be granted to conduct the vote earlier or we are in \na postcloture situation on the Treasury-Postal Service appropriations \nbill. There is opposition, obviously, to this motion to proceed. But I \nstill think that adequate time can be used for discussion. I know there \nare a number of Senators who would like to see this vote occur on \nThursday instead of Friday. I am willing to accommodate that. But if \nthat cannot be worked out, then we will have the vote on Friday. If we \nare in a postcloture situation, the vote could be postponed for some \ntime. But I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I now withdraw the motion to proceed. I believe I have that \nright.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  The motion is withdrawn.\n  Mr. LOTT. In conclusion, while we seek Utopia in dealing with these \nappropriations bills, the promised land of how we can work together to \ndo the people's business, which we are not doing right now, at least in \nthe case of this bill, I believe we will have broad bipartisan support \nfor the China PNTR bill. I might add, there is going to be some \nbipartisan opposition, too.\n  So as we get into the substance of this--which I would rather be \ngetting into rather than having to once again file cloture on a motion \nto proceed--I think we will have a good debate. I think it is going to \nserve the Senate well. I think it will serve the American people well. \nI believe when we do finally get to a vote, it will pass--and probably \nshould. But there are a lot of serious questions still involved in how \nwe are going to deal with China. So I look forward to this discussion.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/26/senate-section/article/S7590-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7590-S7618]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TREASURY AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2001--MOTION TO \n                            PROCEED--Resumed\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I take a few moments following this \ncloture vote to talk about the appropriations bill and a couple of \nrelated matters to that bill that are to be brought to the Senate \nfloor. We are completing the last week of the legislative session \nbefore the August break. When we come back following the August break, \nwe will have a number of weeks in September and a couple of weeks in \nOctober, perhaps, at which time the 106th Congress will be history.\n  We will have an election in early November, something that the late \nCongressman Claude Pepper, a wonderful public servant, used to call one \nof the miracles of democracy. He said: Every even numbered year, our \nConstitution provides that the American people grab the steering wheel \nand decide in which direction this country moves. He said it was one of \nthe miracles of democracy. Indeed it is. We are headed toward an \nelection. That will affect the Senate schedule. That means it is likely \nthe Senate will complete its work, the Congress will complete its work, \nin the 106th Congress by the middle of October.\n  As we look to that moment, we have a lot of work to do between now \nand then. We have appropriations bills to complete. After all that, one \nof the fundamental responsibilities we have is to provide for the \nfunding of things we do together in government. We build our roads \ntogether. It doesn't make sense for each family to build their own road \nto the supermarket. It is called government. We come together and build \na system of roads. We come together to build schools and maintain and \noperate schools in which the American people can send their children. \nIt doesn't make sense for each and every person to build their own \nschool. So we have roads and schools. Then we hire a police force. We \nhire folks who will serve in the Armed Forces to defend our liberty and \nfreedom.\n  All of these things we do, and much more, as a part of our governing \nprocess. I am proud of much of what we do. Much of what we have \naccomplished in this country is a result of the ingenuity of people in \nthe private sector, in the market system, competing, the genius of \nthose who are willing to take risks and use ideas to build new products \nand create new markets; on the other side, in the public sector, the \nvision that has been exhibited by some who have served this country for \nmany years to do the right things in the public sector, to do together \nwhat we should do to provide for our common defense and build our \nschools, build roads, and do those things that we know also make this a \nbetter country.\n  One of the pieces of legislation we are intending to bring to the \nfloor very soon is the Treasury-Postal appropriations subcommittee \nbill. That is through the full Appropriations Committee in the Senate. \nIt is legislation that will be, I hope, debated next on the Senate \nfloor. The bill is through the full Appropriations Committee and \nincludes funding for a wide range of things we do in this country.\n  One of the larger portions of the bill is the funding for the Customs \nService. The Customs Service is a very important element. Given the \nexpanding nature of world trade, with the amount of commerce and goods \nand services moving in and out of our country and across our borders, \nthe Customs Service provides an ever increasing important service to \nour country.\n  We fund the Internal Revenue Service which collects the revenue by \nwhich we fund most of the government services we have in this country. \nOne of the areas of this legislation is the national youth antidrug \nmedia campaign. That campaign in the drug czar's office is now about 3 \nyears old, and the Congress has been working on that diligently, as \nwell.\n  We have a number of issues in this legislation that are very \nimportant, that are timely, and that we need to get to the floor of the \nSenate to debate and try to make some decisions about them.\n  Let me comment for a moment about a couple of issues that no doubt \nwill be brought to the Senate floor on this bill. I will talk about why \nthese issues are important and what I think will happen with these \nissues. In the House of Representatives, when they wrote the \nlegislation dealing with Treasury and general government in that \nsubcommittee, that legislation included some amendments dealing with \nthe subject of Cuba and the sanctions with respect to food and medicine \nthat exist with respect to Cuba.\n  I want to talk just a bit about that because those provisions are \nincluded in the House bill. We will undoubtedly have amendments on that \nsame subject in the Senate bill. There will be a defense of germaneness \non those amendments. I will offer one of those amendments. I believe my \ncolleagues Senator Dodd, Senator Roberts, perhaps Senator Baucus, and \nothers will offer similar amendments. I want to describe why this is an \nimportant issue and why the Senate should consider these amendments, \nespecially inasmuch as these types of amendments are in the House bill \ncoming over for consideration in conference.\n  There are some bad actors internationally who run governments in a \nway that is well outside the norm of international behavior. We \nunderstand that. Saddam Hussein is one of those leaders. There are \nothers. We have watched the behavior and the activities of countries \nsuch as Cuba, Iraq, Iran, North Korea, and others, and view with alarm \nsome of the things that are happening.\n  Cuba is a country that is run, with a Communist government, by Fidel \nCastro. North Korea is a relatively closed society run by a Communist \ngovernment, a Communist dictator. Iran is a different kind of country, \nrun by a group of folks who seem to operate--at least they have for \nsome while--outside the norms of international behavior, engaged in an \nattempt to acquire sophisticated missile technology. I suspect they and \nothers on the list would love to acquire nuclear weapons. These are \ncountries that have demonstrated by their behavior, by their actions, \nthat they are operating outside the norms of what we consider \nacceptable behavior. I am talking now about the international \ncommunity, the community of nations.\n  So what do we do? What we do is we say to Saddam Hussein: We are \ngoing to impose economic sanctions on your country. These sanctions, in \nthe form of either sanctions or an embargo, are an attempt to choke \nyour economy and cause you economic pain. They cause you to understand \nwhen you operate outside the norms of international behavior, when you \nare attempting to acquire nuclear weapons, chemical weapons, and \nbiological weapons with which you can threaten your neighbors, we care \nabout that and we intend to do something about that. We and other \ncountries have imposed sanctions against the country of Iraq.\n  We have had an embargo against the country of Cuba for some 40 years. \nIt is a small country 90 miles off the tip of Florida. We have had an \nembargo for some 40 years against the country of Cuba, preventing goods \nfrom being shipped to Cuba, preventing Cuban goods from coming into our \ncountry, essentially trying to shut down their economy with that \nembargo. We have had similar sanctions against North Korea and Iran.\n  One of the mistakes this country has made--and a very serious \nmistake--is deciding we will include food and medicine as a part of our \neconomic sanctions. We should not have done that. This country should \nnever have done that. This country is bigger and better than that. We \nshould never use food as a weapon.\n  We produce food in such abundant quality--the best quality food in \nthe world. We have farmers today who are out driving a tractor in some \nfield somewhere, planting a seed and raising crops with great hope they \nwill be able to make a living on their family farm. We produce such \nwonderful quality food in such abundance, and then we say to countries \nwhose behavior we don't like: By the way, we are going to slap you with \neconomic sanctions. We are going to put our fist around your economic \nthroat, and included in that, we are going to prevent the movement of \nfood in and out of your country.\n  I am all for economic sanctions. There is not any reason to make life \nbetter for Saddam Hussein. He ought to pay a price for his behavior. \nBut this country is shortsighted to believe that using food as a weapon \nis an advancement in public policy for us. It is not. First, it hurts \nour farmers who are prevented from moving food through the \ninternational markets. Second, it takes aim at a dictator and ends up\n\n[[Page S7592]]\n\nhitting hungry people. That is not the best of what this country has to \noffer.\n\n  So we have a very simple proposition--those of us who care about this \nissue. We say let's stop using food as a weapon; let us, as Americans, \ndecide we shall never use food as a mechanism to try to punish others. \nWe understand that Saddam Hussein and Fidel Castro have never missed a \nmeal. They have never missed breakfast, they have never missed dinner, \nnever missed supper. They eat well. When we use food as a weapon, it is \nonly poor people, sick people, and hungry people who pay a price; and \nof course, our farmers here in America also pay a price.\n  So last year we had a debate about this. My colleague Senator \nAshcroft, I, Senators Dodd, Roberts, Baucus--a range of people--have \noffered amendments. Last year we had a vote, and 70 Senators said: No, \nwe shall not any longer ever use food as a weapon. Let us lift the \nsanctions on food and medicine; 70 percent of the Senate said let's \nstop it.\n  I cannot speak for all 70, but I will speak for myself to say it is \nimmoral to have a public policy that uses food as a weapon. It is \nimmoral to punish hungry, sick, and poor people around the world \nbecause we are angry at dictators. Seventy percent of the Senate said: \nLet's stop. Let's change the sanctions. We can continue some of the \neconomic sanctions. We are not making a judgment about using economic \nsanctions to punish dictators or punish countries whose behavior is \noutside the international norm. We are saying, however, we should not \nany longer use food or medicine as a weapon or as part of the \nsanctions.\n  So 70 percent of the Senate voted. It was on the Senate agricultural \nappropriations bill, and off we marched to conference. I was one of the \nconferees. One of the first acts of conference between the House and \nSenate was my offering an amendment insisting that the Senate retain \nits position. In other words, we were saying as a group of Senators who \nwere conferees: We insist on our provision, lifting the sanctions on \nfood and medicine.\n  I offered the amendment in the conference. We had a vote of the \nSenate conferees, and my amendment carried. Therefore, the Senators at \nthis conference with the House Members said: We insist on the \nprovision. We insist on our policy of removing food and medicine as \npart of our economic sanctions.\n  Guess what. A Member of the House moved that the conference adjourn. \nWe adjourned. It was late one morning, and we never, ever returned to \nconference. Do you know why? Because the House leaders, the House \nleadership, did not like that provision and they intended to kill it. \nThey knew they could not kill it with their conferees. If there were a \nvote on it in the conference, they would lose. If there were a vote on \nit on the floor of the House, they would lose. So the only way they \ncould win was to hijack that conference, adjourn it, never come back \ninto session, and throw the ingredients of that bill into a broader \nbill, and we never saw the light of day on our policy.\n  The result is we are back on the floor right now and this country \nstill has in place a policy of using food and medicine as part of our \neconomic sanctions. It is wrong. It is wrong.\n  Following that conference last year, I had the opportunity to go to \nCuba. I have traveled some, in various parts of the world, and have \nseen that what we produce in such abundance, the world needs so \ndesperately. The winds of hunger blow every minute, every hour, and \nevery day all across this world. So many people die of hunger, \nmalnutrition, and hunger-related causes, and so many of them are \nchildren--every single day.\n  I went to Cuba. What I saw was a country in collapse. It is a \nbeautiful country with wonderful people. The city of Havana is a \nbeautiful city, but in utter collapse. There are gorgeous buildings \ndesigned in the 1940s and 1950s by some of the best architects--\nbeautiful architecture, in total disrepair. The city is collapsing. The \nCuban economy is in collapse. There is no question about that.\n  I visited a hospital, and I saw a young boy lying in a coma. His \nmother was seated by his bedside holding his hand. This was in an \nintensive care ward of a Cuban hospital. This young boy in intensive \ncare was not hooked up to any wires. There was no fancy gadgetry, no \nfancy equipment, no beeping that you hear in intensive care--the \nbeeping of equipment--no, none of that. He was lying on his bed with \nhis mother holding his hand.\n  I asked the doctor, Do you not have equipment with which to monitor \nthis young boy? He had a head injury and was in a coma. He said, Oh, \nno; they didn't have any of that equipment. They didn't even have any \nrudimentary equipment with which to make a diagnosis. Intensive care \nwas to lay this boy in a room. They told me they were out of 250 \ndifferent kinds of medicine in that hospital.\n  My point is this. The Cuban people do not deserve Fidel Castro--that \nis for sure. They deserve a free and open country, a free and open \neconomy; they deserve the liberties we have and the freedom we have. \nBut 40 years of an embargo, and especially 40 years preventing the \nmovement of food and medicine back and forth, surely makes no sense.\n  It has not hurt Mr. Castro. It has hurt the poor people of Cuba and \nthe hungry people of Cuba. It is time to change that policy. A year ago \nwe tried it. Seventy percent of the Senate voted for it, and it has not \nhappened.\n  This is what we have done this year: I offered an amendment, with \nSenator Gorton from the State of Washington, on the Agriculture \nappropriations bill that lifts the sanctions on food and medicine and \nalso let's us do one other thing. It prevents any future President from \never including food and medicine as part of economic sanctions unless \nthey come to the Senate and get a vote and the Senate says: Yes, we \nought to do that.\n  We do two things: We lift the sanctions on food and medicine that \nexist with those countries that are subject to our economic sanctions, \nand we prevent future Presidents from imposing sanctions and using food \nas a weapon. That is in the Agriculture appropriations bill which came \nto the floor of the Senate. The Senate passed that bill. My amendment \nis in it. We will go to conference.\n  The only way we can lose that issue is if the House leaders hijack it \nonce again. There is a member of the leadership of the House, whom I \nshall not name, who makes it his cause to derail us. He believes we \nought to use food as a weapon, especially with respect to Cuba. He \nbelieves we ought not change the policy and will do everything he can \nto stop us.\n  My colleague in the House who has been working on this passed some \nlegislation that was negotiated with the House leadership, but it turns \nout the legislation, when one looks at the language, is a step \nbackward, not a step forward.\n  We will go to conference on the Agriculture appropriations bill with \nmy amendment in it, and I say to those who might pay attention to the \nSenate record from the House side, if the House leaders expect to \nhijack this once again this year, they are in for a long session \nbecause there is a group of us--Republicans and Democrats--who insist \nthis country change its policy. This policy is wrongheaded and it must \nchange.\n  Yes, we have some people in the Senate who are still fighting the \ncold war. We have people in the Senate--not very many, I admit--but we \nhave a few people in the Senate who do not want this changed, but 70 \npercent of the Senate want this changed. At some point, if they get a \nfull vote in the House and we have a full vote in the Senate, 70 \npercent of the Congress will say: Let's change this foolish policy. \nThis policy is not the best of this country. This policy is wrong, and \nwe aim to change it.\n  Now we bring this bill to the floor of the Senate. We had a cloture \nvote on the motion to proceed today, and the Treasury-Postal bill will \ncome to the floor at some point. As I indicated, in addition to the \ndescription of the amendment I offered to the Agriculture \nappropriations bill on the floor of the Senate dealing with sanctions \non Cuba, a couple Members of the House applied some amendments, which \nwere successful, to the Treasury-general government bill which means \nwhen our bill comes to the floor of the Senate, it will also attract \nthese amendments. That is fine with me. Having them in two places is \nbetter than having them in one place. Perhaps one conference will be \nsuccessful in changing this policy.\n\n[[Page S7593]]\n\n  My colleagues in the House added a piece of legislation, for example, \ndealing with travel in Cuba saying that no funds will be used to \nenforce the restrictions on travel to Cuba. I prefer to do it a \ndifferent way. Who is going to believe it makes sense to travel to Cuba \nif it is still illegal but they just will not enforce it? If we change \ntravel, let's change travel. Let's not say you shall not enforce \nsomething that remains illegal. Let's say the travel restrictions are \nlifted. Period. End of story.\n  I hope my colleague who intends to offer that amendment in the Senate \nwill consider doing that. We have other amendments as well, and I \nintend to offer an amendment dealing with food and medicine sanctions \non Cuba on the Treasury-Postal bill when it is brought to the floor of \nthe Senate.\n\n  There is another issue I wish to talk about briefly that relates in \nsome measure to this bill, but especially to the issue of the Customs \nService and our borders and the issue of international trade. I am \ngoing to talk in a bit about our trade problem because we have the \nlargest trade deficit in the history of humankind.\n  There is a lot right with this country. There is a lot going on to \ngive us reason to say thanks and hosanna. We have a wonderful economy. \nIt is producing new jobs and new opportunity. All of the indices are \nright: unemployment is down; home ownership is up; inflation is way \ndown. All the things one expects to happen in a good economy have been \nhappening.\n  Some parts of the country are left behind, such as rural areas. We \nhave a farm program that is a debacle, and we cannot get anybody to \neven hold a hearing to change the farm program, but that is another \nstory.\n  There are some areas that have not kept pace with the prosperity. We \nneed to continue to fight to write a better farm program and make sure \nthose rural areas share in the full economic prosperity of America.\n  There is a lot right in this country. This is a good economy. It is \nproducing unprecedented opportunities.\n  The one set of storm clouds above the horizon, however, is in \ninternational trade. We have a huge trade deficit. Our merchandise \ntrade deficit was nearly $350 billion in 1999, and is projected to \nexceed $400 billion this year. Put another way: We are buying $1 \nbillion more in goods from overseas than we are selling each and every \nday, 7 days a week.\n  Some say: Does that matter? Is it important? Gee, our economy is \ndoing well. How on Earth can you make the case we should care about \nthis?\n  You can live in a suburb someplace and have a wonderful home with a \nhuge Cadillac in the driveway and have all the evidence of affluence, \nbut if it is all borrowed, you are in trouble. On the borrowing side, \nwe have made a lot of progress dealing with Federal budget deficits. In \nfact, we have eliminated the Federal budget deficits, and good for us, \nbut the deficits on the trade side have continued to mushroom, and we \nmust get a handle on that as well and deal with our trade imbalance.\n  What causes the trade imbalance, and what relevance does it have to \nthis bill? In this bill, we fund the Customs Service, and the Customs \nService evaluates what comes in, what goes out, and they try to assist \nin the flow of goods moving back and forth across our borders.\n  The fact is, they have an old, antiquated computer system to take \ncare of all of that and it is melting down. With expanded trade coming \nin and going out, we need a new system. The Customs Service has \nproposed a new system to accommodate and facilitate their needs. We \nneed to fund it. It is very important we fund this system. It is called \nthe Automated Commercial Environment or ACE system. We need to keep it \noperational, and we need to build it and make it work.\n  In 1 day, the Customs Service processes $8.8 billion in exports and \nimports. They have to keep track of it all: $8.8 billion in daily \nexports and imports; and 1.3 million passengers and 350,000 vehicles \nmoving back and forth across our borders. Think of that. This is the \nagency that has the responsibility of keeping track of all of it--whose \nvehicle, when did it come in, when did it go out, who is coming in, who \nis leaving our country, what are the goods coming in, what kind of \ntariffs exists on those goods, who is sending them, who is receiving \nthem.\n  All of that is part of what we have to keep track of in terms of \nmovement across our border. The current system that keeps track of all \nof that is nearly two decades old, and running at near capacity. It is \nthe single most important resource in collecting duties and enforcing \nCustoms laws and regulations.\n  This system has been experiencing brownouts over the past months that \nhave brought the Customs operation at these border ports, in some \ncases, to a dead halt.\n  Over 40 percent of the Customs stations are using work stations that \nare unreliable, are obsolete operating systems, and are no longer \nsupported by a vendor.\n  Trade volume has doubled in 10 years. The rate of growth in trade is \nastronomical. The Customs Service anticipates an increase of over 50 \npercent in the number of entries by 2005. That means the current system \njust can't and will not handle it.\n  So we have a responsibility to do something about that. If anybody \nwonders whether all this trade is important, and keeping track of it is \nimportant, as I said, look at the trade deficit and look at what is \nhappening in this country.\n  From the standpoint of policy--I was talking about the system that \nkeeps track of it--but from the standpoint of policy, we also have to \nmake significant changes. We will not make them in this bill because \nthis isn't where we do that, but you can't help but look at what is \nhappening in our country and understand that our own trade policy does \nnot work. It just does not work.\n  We have a huge and growing trade deficit with China--growing \nrapidly--of nearly $70 billion a year. We have a large abiding trade \ndeficit with Japan that has gone on forever--$50 to $70 billion a year.\n  This Congress, without my vote--because I voted against it--passed \nsomething called NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement. It was \nbilled as a nirvana. What a wonderful thing, we were told, if we can do \na trade agreement with Mexico and Canada. What a great hemispheric \ntrade agreement, and how wonderful it would be for our country.\n  In fact, a couple of economists teamed together and said: If you just \npass NAFTA, you will get 300,000 new jobs in the United States. The \nproblem is, there is never accountability for economists. Economists \nsay anything, any time, to anybody, and nobody ever goes back to check.\n  The field of economics is psychology pumped up with helium and \nportrayed as a profession. I say that having taught economics a couple \nyears in college, but I have overcome that to do other things.\n  But economists told us, if we pass NAFTA, it will be a wonderful \nthing for our country. Well, this Congress passed NAFTA. I didn't vote \nfor it. Guess what. We had a trade surplus with Mexico. We have now \nturned a trade surplus with Mexico into a significant deficit with the \ncountry of Mexico.\n  They said, by the way, if we pass NAFTA, the products that will come \nin from Mexico will be products produced by low-skilled labor. Not \ntrue. The products that are coming in from Mexico are the product of \nhigher-skilled labor, principally automobiles, automobile parts, and \nelectronics. Those are the three largest imports into the United States \nfrom Mexico.\n  So the economists were wrong. I would love to have them come back and \nparade around, and say: I said NAFTA would work, but I apologize. We \nhad a trade surplus with Mexico. Now it is a fairly large deficit. We \nhad a trade deficit with Canada, and we doubled the deficit. I want one \nperson to stand up in the Senate and say: This is real progress. \nDoubling the deficit with Canada, and turning a surplus into a deficit \nwith Mexico--hooray for us. That is real progress. I want just one \ninebriated soul to tell me here in Washington, DC, that this makes \nsense. Of course it does not make sense.\n  It did not work. So we have trade policy challenges dealing with \nMexico, Canada, and NAFTA. We have policy differences dealing with our \nbig trade deficit with China. We are going to have other struggles and \nchallenges\n\n[[Page S7594]]\n\ndealing with the recurring deficit that goes on forever with Japan.\n\n  It might be useful--I know people get tired of me talking about \nthis--but it might be useful to describe our diminished expectations in \nthis county and why we are in such trouble on trade.\n  About 10 years ago--we have always had a struggle with Japan--we were \nhaving, at that time, an agreement negotiated on the issue of American \nbeef going to Japan. We were not getting enough beef into Japan. At \nthat point, it cost about $30 a pound to buy a T-bone steak in Tokyo. \nWhy? Because there was not enough beef. So you keep the supply low, the \ndemand and price go up, and a T-bone steak costs a lot of money in \nTokyo.\n  We wanted to get American beef into Japan. After all, we buy all \ntheir cars, VCRs and television sets. Maybe they should buy American \nbeef. So we sent our best negotiators, and they negotiated. Our \nnegotiators were hard nosed. It only took them a couple of days to \nlose. They sat at the table, and they negotiated and negotiated. And \nguess what they negotiated? They had a press conference and said: We \nhave a victory. We have a beef agreement with Japan. What a wonderful \ndeal. You would have thought they had just won the Olympics because \nthey celebrated. And everybody said: Gosh, what a great deal.\n  Here is the agreement. You get more American beef into Japan. Yes, \nyou do. And we did.\n  Ten or 11 years after the beef agreement with Japan, the tariff on \nAmerican steak or American ground beef or American beef going to Japan \ntoday is 40 percent on a pound of beef. Can you imagine that? What \nwould people think if you told them: In the United States, we only have \na 40 percent tariff on your product coming into our country? They would \nsay: What kind of nonsense is that? That is not free trade. Yet we \ncelebrated the fact that we had an agreement with Japan that takes us \nto a 50 percent tariff, which is reduced over time, but snaps back up \nif we get more beef into Japan. We celebrated that.\n  This is the goofiest set of priorities I have ever heard. We ought to \nlearn to negotiate trade agreements that are in this country's \ninterests.\n  I have threatened, from time to time, to introduce a piece of \nlegislation in Congress that says: When our trade negotiators go to \nnegotiate, they must wear a jersey that says ``USA,'' just so that they \ncan look down, from time to time, and see who they are negotiating for. \n``I am from the United States. I have the United States's best \ninterests at heart. When we negotiate with you, Japan, China, Mexico, \nCanada, or others, we insist on fair trade.''\n  Yes, our producers will compete. We are not afraid of competition. \nBut we are not going to compete with one hand tied behind our back. Our \nnegotiators negotiated GATT with Europe, and they said to the \nEuropeans: You know what--my colleague, Senator Conrad, talks about \nthis a lot--we will have a deal with you. You can have 6, 8, or 10 \ntimes greater subsidies on your sales of grain to other countries than \nwe will have. And we will have a deal where we will agree to limit our \nsupport payments to family farmers to a fraction of what yours are. So \nonce we have done that, we have tied both of our hands behind our back, \nand then said let's go ahead and compete.\n  That is what our negotiators have done virtually every time they have \nnegotiated a trade agreement. They did it in GATT to family farmers and \ndid it with Japan to our ranchers. I should say, our ranchers were \npleased with the agreement with Japan. I would say to them: How can you \nbe pleased? How can you call that success? It is because they have such \nlow expectations in our trade negotiations. We give away everything. We \nexpect little, get almost nothing, and then we are so pleased.\n  When you have roughly $1 billion a day in the merchandise trade \nimbalance, it is time to wonder whether your policy is working. When \nyou have a $1-billion-a-day deficit--every single day--in merchandise \ntrade, it is time to ask whether this is a policy that works. The \nanswer is no.\n  I think it would behoove this Congress to say: Good for all the \nwonderful things that are happening in this country. Everybody deserves \na little credit for all of that. Good for all the good things happening \nin our economy. But it is important for all of us to look at the storm \nclouds as well, and evaluate what is wrong, and try to fix that. If we \ndid that, it would behoove us to bring to the floor of the Senate a \ndebate and full discussion about America's trade policy.\n  Every time I come and talk about this issue, there is someone \nwatching or someone listening, or somebody later will say: That guy \nsounds like a protectionist. There is this caricature: You are either \nfor free trade or you are some isolationist, xenophobic stooge. You are \neither for free trade or you don't get it. You either see the horizon \nor you are nearsighted. That is the way it all works.\n  Even the largest newspapers do that. Try to get an op-ed piece in the \nWashington Post on trade issues. If you happen to believe we ought to \nstand up for our economic interests in trade, you can't do it.\n  It is not my intention to say this country should not be a leader in \nexpanding trade. This country ought to be a leader in promoting an \nexpanded free and fair opportunity for international trade. This \ncountry ought to be a leader. We ought to expect that other countries \nwould be involved in saying the things that we fought for for 75 to 100 \nyears. This country will be part of the discussions about trade.\n  We had people dying in the streets in this country, fighting for the \nright to organize in labor unions, fighting for the right to create \nlabor unions. We had people die on the streets of America.\n  Some will say: We can avoid all that, having labor unions, having to \nworry about dumping chemicals into the water and the air, having to \nhave a safe workplace, having to be prohibited from hiring kids; we can \navoid all of that. We have debated it for 75 or 100 years in this \ncountry. We have made a lot of progress. We can avoid it all by moving \nour plant to some other Third World country where they don't have those \ninconveniences, where you can hire 12-year-old kids and work them 12 \nhours a day and pay them 12 cents an hour and everybody calls it free \ntrade.\n  This country has a responsibility also to lead on the issues of what \nare the fair rules for international trade--not protectionism, what are \nthe fair rules for trade that establish fair competition. That is \nsomething this country has a responsibility to be involved with as \nwell.\n  Talking about trade in the context of the Customs Service and our \nresponsibility to keep track of what is happening around the world, it \nis true that my frustration from time to time boils over on the issue. \nI come to the floor and talk about it without much effect because there \nare not sufficient votes in the Senate to require a very robust debate \non trade policy. It is coming. We ought to make it happen.\n  If I can digress--because I have the time this morning, and I don't \nsee anyone else waiting to speak--I want to mention something that \nhappened some years ago that made a profound impact on me. I mentioned \na moment ago that we struggled in this country to establish the right \nto form labor unions and establish collective bargaining. There are \nplenty of countries where, if you try to form labor unions, try to get \nworkers together to see if they can't get a better deal, they can be \nthrown in jail. As I said, we had people who died in the streets in \nthis country fighting for that opportunity. We now understand the \nconsequences of that. We have labor unions, and we have management and \nlabor, collective bargaining. It is a better country because of that. \nThere are some areas of the world where we don't have the opportunity \nto do that. People who try to demonstrate for those rights are thrown \nin jail.\n  Let me describe something that happened in Congress a long while ago \nrelated to that point. We had a fellow who spoke to a joint session of \nCongress. Normally, a speaker to a joint session of Congress is a \nPresident. The pageantry is quite wonderful when there is a joint \nsession. It is normally in the House Chamber because that is the larger \nChamber. The Senators come in and are seated in the House Chamber, \nCabinet officials come in, the Supreme Court comes in. The American \npeople see this. That is when the network television cameras come on.\n  Then the Doorkeeper says: Mr. Speaker, the President of the United\n\n[[Page S7595]]\n\nStates. And the President marches in and gives a State of the Union \nspeech.\n  We occasionally have other speakers who are invited to give an \naddress to a joint session of Congress. On rare occasions, it has been \na head of state. Many will remember other circumstances: General \nDouglas MacArthur coming back from Korea, when he was relieved of his \ncommand by President Truman, was invited to address a joint session of \nCongress; Winston Churchill addressed a joint session of Congress.\n  One day about 10 or 12 years ago, I was a Member of the U.S. House, \nit was a joint session of Congress. In the back of the room, the \nDoorkeeper announced the visitor. The Doorkeeper said: Mr. Speaker, \nLech Walesa from Poland. And this fellow walked in, a rather short man \nwith a mustache. He had red cheeks and probably a few extra pounds, an \nordinary looking fellow who walked into the Chamber of the House, \nwalked up to the microphone. The joint session stood and applauded and \ndidn't stop. This applause continued to create waves, and it went on \nfor some minutes. Then this man began to speak. Most of us, of course, \nknew the history. But in a very powerful way this ordinary man told an \nextraordinary tale.\n\n  He said 10 years before, he was in a shipyard in Gdansk, Poland on a \nSaturday leading a strike for workers to be able to chart their own \ndestiny, leading a strike for a free labor movement in Poland against a \nCommunist government. On that day, he had already been fired from his \njob as an electrician at a shipyard for his activities to fight for a \nfree labor movement in Poland. The Communist government had him fired \nfrom his shipyard. So this unemployed electrician, on a Saturday \nmorning, was leading a strike, leading a parade inside this shipyard \nfor a free labor movement. He was grabbed by some Communist thugs and \nbeaten and beaten badly. As they beat him, they took him to the edge of \nthe shipyard, hoisted him up and unceremoniously dumped him over the \nbarbed-wire fence outside the shipyard face down in the dirt. He lay \nthere bleeding, wondering what to do next.\n  Of course, we know what he did next. Ten years later, he was \nintroduced to a joint session of Congress as the President of the \ncountry of Poland. This man went to the microphone and said the \nfollowing to us: We didn't have any guns; the Communists had all the \nguns. We didn't have any bullets; the Communists had all the bullets. \nWe were armed only with an idea.\n  What he did next that Saturday morning, from lying on the ground \nbleeding from the beating he had received from the Communist agents of \nthat Government of Poland, the history books record. He pulled himself \nback up and climbed back over the fence and climbed back into the \nshipyard.\n  This unemployed electrician showed up in the Chamber of the U.S. \nHouse to speak to a joint session of Congress 10 years later as the \nPresident of his country--not a diplomat, not a politician, not an \nintellectual, not a scholar, an unemployed electrician who showed up in \nthis country 10 years later as the President of his country.\n  He said: We didn't break a windowpane in Poland. We didn't have guns. \nWe didn't have bullets. We were armed with an idea and that idea simply \nwas that free people ought to be free to choose their own destiny.\n  I have never forgotten that moment, understanding the power of ideas \nand understanding that common people can do uncommon things. Ordinary \npeople can do extraordinary things. Wondering where did Lech Walesa get \nthe courage to pull himself up that Saturday morning in a shipyard in \nGdansk, an unemployed electrician, believing so strongly in the need to \nprovoke change in this Communist country that this man and his \nfollowers toppled a Communist government and lit the fuse, caused a \nspark that lit the fuse that began to topple Communist governments all \nthrough Eastern Europe. That is the power of an idea.\n  What are the ideas that exist in this country that will make a better \nAmerica and create a better future? We know from our history that in \ntwo centuries, a series of ideas by some remarkable men and women have \ncreated the best country in the world. It is the freest. I know there \nare a lot of blemishes, but there is no country that has freedoms like \nours. There is no country that has accomplished what we have \naccomplished in every area. Find an area where we have had difficulty, \nwe have confronted it. We have had difficult times, but we have solved \nthe issues. We survived a civil war. We survived a great depression. \nWhen you think of what this country has done, it is quite remarkable.\n  We stand today at the edge of a new century, the year 2000, with a \nlot of challenges in front of us. Some say we are just sort of content \nto be where we are and to kind of nick around the edges. No person, no \ncountry, no organization ever does well by resting.\n  There are challenges in front of us. We have talked about some of \nthem. Some of them will be in this legislation when we bring it to the \nfloor. Some will be in other legislation. I was on the floor yesterday \nand Senator Durbin, who is on the floor at the moment, talked about the \nchallenge of making our health care system work; the challenge of \npassing a Patients' Bill of Rights, and one that is a real Patients' \nBill of Rights; the challenge of putting a prescription drug benefit in \nthe Medicare program. Those are ideas--ideas with power and resonance, \nideas which ought to relate to the public policy this Congress \nembraces. I talked, a little bit ago, about trade policy, the idea that \nwe need to change trade policy to make it a policy that is effective \nfor our country, to reduce the trade deficits and continue to expand \nmarkets, and to have fair rules of trade.\n  There are so many things we need to do. Yesterday, I showed some of \nthe challenges that we ought to address now in the coming weeks. For \ninstance, gun safety. This is a wonderful country, but when you read \nthe newspapers and read of the killings, and then you understand that \nwe have a right to own weapons--and nobody is changing that right; it \nis a constitutional right. But we have said it makes sense for us to \nkeep guns out of the hands of convicted felons. How do we do that?\n  We have a computer base with the names of felons on it. When you want \nto buy a gun, your name has to be run against the computer base. At the \ngun store, they run your name to find out if you are a convicted felon. \nIf you are, you don't get a gun. But guess what. You can go to a gun \nshow on a Saturday someplace and buy a gun or a weapon, and nobody is \ngoing to run your name through an instant check.\n  We say let's close that loophole. Are those who don't want to close \nit saying they don't want to keep guns out of their hands? I hope not. \nSo join us in fixing this problem. That is an idea. That has some \npower. How many Americans will that save? How many children will it \nsave by keeping the gun out of the hands of a convicted felon? We are \nnot talking about law-abiding citizens. We are not going to \ndisadvantage them. Let's keep guns out of the hands of convicted \nfelons. Close the gun show loophole. It is a simple idea; yet one we \ncan't get through the Congress because people are blocking the door on \nthis issue.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights: We talked about that yesterday. We \ntalked about putting a drug benefit in the Medicare program. We talked \nabout school modernization. I will conclude by talking for a moment \nabout school modernization.\n  Our future is education. I have told my colleagues many times about \nwalking into the late-Congressman Claude Pepper's office and seeing two \npictures, both autographed, behind his chair. One was a picture of \nOrville and Wilbur Wright making the first airplane flight. It was \nautographed by Orville Wright, saying, ``To Congressman Pepper, with \ndeep admiration, Orville Wright.''\n  Then, the first person to stand on the Moon, Neil Armstrong, gave him \nan autographed picture. I thought to myself, this is really something. \nHere is a living American who has an autographed picture of the first \nperson to leave the ground in powered flight, and also the person who \nflew all the way to the Moon. What was the in between? What was the \ndifference between just leaving the ground and arriving on the Moon? \nEducation, schools, learning; it is our future--allowing every young \nboy and girl in this country to become the very best they can be; \nuniversal education, saying that every young boy or girl, no matter \nwhat their background or circumstances are, can walk through a \nschoolroom door and be\n\n[[Page S7596]]\n\nwhatever they want to be in life, universal opportunity in education.\n  In the middle part of this past century, those who came back fighting \nfor liberty in the Second World War, fighting for freedom, built \nschools all across our country as they went to school on the GI bill, \ngot married, and had children. They built schools all across America. \nNow those schools, in many cases, are 45, 50 years old and in desperate \nneed of repair and renovation. This country, as good as it is, can send \nour kids to the schoolroom doors of the best schools in the world. And \nwe should. That ought to be our policy. So before this Congress ends, \nlet's embrace our ideas and policies of saying let's modernize our \nschools, renovate our schools, and connect our schools to the Internet. \nLet's reduce the size of classes and make sure every student has the \nopportunity to go through a schoolroom door that we as parents are \nproud of. Let's make sure we keep the finest teachers, the best \nteachers in our classrooms and pay them a fair wage. These are ideas \nthat we have that we can't get through this Congress. It doesn't make \nany sense to me.\n\n  So we are prepared to bring the Treasury-general government \nappropriations bill to the floor. In that legislation there will be \nseveral of the ideas I have talked about, and other appropriations \nbills, and other pieces of legislation. We will continue to pound away \nat this Congress to say: Accept some of these ideas. Accept some \nprogress. Join us. This isn't partisan. Our kids and our schools don't \nrepresent a partisan issue. Keeping guns out of the hands of felons \nsurely can't be a Republican or Democratic issue. Surely, every \nAmerican should embrace that goal. Putting the prescription drug \nbenefit in the Medicare program so senior citizens who have reached \ntheir declining income years have the opportunity and can afford to buy \nlife-saving drugs surely can't be a Republican or Democratic approach. \nThere can't be differences here in terms of goals. So let's resolve to \njoin together to meet these goals, to do our work and embrace ideas--\nyes, big ideas--that recognize, yes, this country is doing very well in \na lot of areas, but we are at the first stage of a new century, and we \nneed to embrace new ideas to advance this country's interests and \nprepare for this country's future. Nowhere is that preparation more \nnecessary than with our children and our schools.\n  Mr. President, I have spoken at some length. I know others on the \nfloor have comments about these and other issues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I understand that we are running out \nthe clock on a motion to bring to the floor the Treasury-Postal \nappropriations bill. So I think my comments are pertinent to that bill \nand to the situation in which we find ourselves.\n  Mr. President, about 14 months ago, those of us in this Chamber \npassed a juvenile justice bill. Prior to its passage, many of us on \nthis side of the aisle came together to say if we want to really \nachieve some limited improvements in targeted gun measures, what should \nthey be? We decided on a few, and the Republican side had a few. So \nsome targeted measures were added to that bill.\n  One of them was that guns should not be sold without trigger locks. \nThat was made from our side of the aisle. One from the Republican side \nof the aisle was that children should not be permitted to buy assault \nweapons--a no-brainer. That was accepted by this body. A third vote was \nto close the gun show loophole which enabled the two youngsters from \nColumbine, 16 years old, to go to a gun show and buy two assault \nweapons with no questions asked. The final one was one I offered on the \nfloor, which was to plug a hole in the assault weapons legislation.\n  Under the assault weapons legislation, it is illegal to manufacture, \npossess, sell, or to transfer a large-capacity ammunition feeding \ndevice in this country. So, in other words, nobody can manufacture one \ndomestically in this country now. The loophole is that they can come \nin, if manufactured in foreign countries, and be sold. So since the \npassage of the original assault weapons legislation, about 18 million \nlarge-capacity ammunition feeding devices have come into the country. \nBut just in the last 14 months, since the passage of the juvenile \njustice bill, 6.3 million of these clips have come into this country, \nmany of them 250 rounds, but most 30 rounds.\n  What is the use of these clips? You can't hunt with them. You can't \ncarry a clip with more than 10 bullets in virtually any State if you \nare going to hunt. You don't use them for self-protection. The street \nprice of them has dropped. You can buy them, no questions asked, over \nthe Internet for $7, $8, $9. The only reason for them is to turn a \nweapon into a major killing machine. They are used by drive-by \nshooters, by the gangs, and by the grievance killer who has a grievance \nand wants to walk into his place of business and kill a large number of \npeople. Well, this body passed that, and the other body actually passed \nit by unanimous consent. So those are measures that have held up a \nwhole huge juvenile justice bill for that period of time.\n  So in 14 months, we have gone nowhere in achieving safety \nregulations, prudent targeted gun regulations to protect people.\n  A million women--now 240 new organizations--in the Million Mom March, \nwent to the streets of their cities and to the Capitol on Mother's Day \nto say they wanted prudent gun regulations. But what has happened since \nthen is we have actually back slipped. The backsliding is taking place \nright in this very bill which time is running on.\n  An amendment was put in the bill that says this:\n\n       None of the funds made available in this Act may be used to \n     implement a preference for the acquisition of a firearm or \n     ammunition based on whether the manufacturer or vendor of the \n     firearm or ammunition is a party of an agreement with a \n     department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States \n     regarding codes of conduct, operating practices, or product \n     design specifically related to the business of importing, \n     manufacturing, or dealing in firearms or ammunition under \n     chapter 44 of title 18, United States Code.\n\n  This amendment is essentially meant to prohibit the U.S. Government \nfrom giving any preference to any responsible gun manufacturer. I \nbelieve this measure is simply the worst possible public policy. I \nwould rather not have a Treasury-Postal appropriations bill that has \nthis kind of disincentive to good conduct in a manufacturer of weapons \nin this country.\n  When this bill comes to the floor, the first amendment from our side \nwill be the amendment to strip this verbiage from the bill.\n  I am pleased to say I am joined in cosponsoring this by the Senator \nfrom Illinois, Mr. Durbin, and the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. \nLautenberg.\n  First, it is important to point out that no such preferences have \nbeen given. The thrust of this provision is based on a hypothetical. \nBut it is based to be a deterrent. It is based to send a message. The \nmessage is to every manufacturer of weapons that there can be no reward \nin government if you manufacture safe guns. If you put trigger locks, \nif you have good, safe marketing practices, if you manufacture guns and \nsee they are sold and distributed in a way to keep them out of the \nhands of children, people who are mentally deficient, or criminals--\nthat is the thrust of this amendment--to reduce the gun industry to its \nlowest possible common denominator all across the United States of \nAmerica, that is the worst possible public policy. Members on both \nsides of this aisle should stand together and refute it.\n  At least one company, Smith & Wesson, has agreed to adopt certain \nreasonable, responsible marketing practices. While this agreement was \nmade under the threat of litigation, it is important to note that no \ndealer has to comply, and no measures have been forced on Smith & \nWesson. Smith & Wesson has decided to take a responsible path to \nproduce responsible policy, and for that this body would slap them on \nthe hand.\n  As a result of their effort, Smith & Wesson has allegedly been \ntargeted by others in the gun industry that are unhappy with the \nagreement who say you can't march ahead of us; you can't do something \nright; we all want to be able to do something wrong. There has been \ntalk of boycotts and anticompetitive behavior. In fact, I recently \njoined a number of my colleagues in writing to the Federal Trade \nCommission, asking them to look into these allegations.\n  Given the determination of the National Rifle Association and its \nallies\n\n[[Page S7597]]\n\nto stop any and all reasonable control of the flow of guns to criminals \nand children, I believe it would be dreadful to prevent the \nadministration from encouraging agreements such as this one.\n  Let me be clear. No one is saying that law enforcement should buy \ninferior weapons simply because the manufacturer has agreed to act \nresponsibly. The fact is, Smith & Wesson produces very good weapons. I \nhave certainly never been one to argue that we should leave law \nenforcement without adequate weaponry. But where technology and safety \nof guns are similar, it makes eminent sense to give preference to the \nmanufacturer that has agreed to certain commonsense standards.\n  I wish to take a few moments and go over a few of the details in the \nSmith & Wesson settlement document. This is what it looks like.\n  First, under the agreement, all handguns and pistols will be shipped \nfrom Smith & Wesson with child-safety devices. Again, the juvenile \njustice bill would have made this provision unnecessary. But, again, \nthat bill has gone nowhere.\n\n  What would that do?\n  In Memphis, TN, not too long ago, a 5-year-old took a weapon off of \nhis grandfather's dresser. It was loaded. He took it to kindergarten to \nkill the kindergarten teacher because that youngster had been given a \n``time out'' the day before. The gun was discovered because a bullet \ndropped out of his backpack--a 5-year-old child toting in his backpack \na loaded pistol with no safety lock to kill the teacher because he had \nbeen given a ``time out'' the day before. With the safety lock, the gun \nwould have been inoperable to that child.\n  Another child in Michigan, a 6-year-old, has an argument with a \nchild, brings a gun to school, and actually kills another 6-year-old.\n  These may not be everyday events. But they would be prevented from \nhappening if guns were made with smart technology and, prior to that, \nwith safety locks.\n  Also in the agreement, every handgun would be designed with a second \nhidden serial number. Why that? Because it prevents criminals from \neasily eradicating a serial number to impede tracing. How can we not \nsupport that?\n  New Smith & Wesson models will be no longer able to accept any large-\ncapacity magazine. What is important about that? That immediately \nlimits the kill power of that weapon. The weapon can still be used for \ndefense. But the drums of 250 or 75 rounds with clips of 30 rounds, \nwhich are there for one reason--to kill large numbers of people--would \nnot be accepted into that gun.\n  Within 2 years, every Smith & Wesson model would have a built-in, on-\nboard locking system by which the firearm could only be operated with \nthe key, or combination, or other mechanism unique to that gun.\n  Two percent of Smith & Wesson's firearms revenue would be devoted to \ndeveloping smart gun technology for all future gun models. What a good \nthing to have happen.\n  Next, within a year of the agreement, each firearm would be designed \nso it could not be readily operated by a child under the age of six. \nThis might include increasing the trigger-pull resistance, designing \nthe gun so a small hand could not operate it, or perhaps requiring a \nsequence of actions to fire the gun that could not be easily \naccomplished by a 5-year-old. Who believes the Federal Government \nshould not encourage manufacturers to make weapons so five- and six-\nyear-olds cannot fire them?\n  The agreement includes safety in manufacturing tests, such as minimum \nbarrel length and firing tests to ensure that misfires, explosions, and \ncracks such as those found in Saturday night specials do not occur. A \ndrop test is also included.\n  I remember very well a major robbery in San Francisco where a police \nofficer with a semiautomatic handgun went into the robbery, pulled out \nhis weapon, and the clip dropped out. He was shot and killed. And I \nremember another incident where the gun was dropped and fired \naccidentally.\n  Another provision: each pistol would have a clearly visible chamber \nload indicator, so that the user can see whether there is a round in \nthe chamber.\n  No new pistol design would be able to accept large-capacity \nammunition clips.\n  The packaging of new guns will include a safety warning regarding the \nlist of unsafe storage and use. What a good thing, a gun manufacturer \nthat will put a warning with the gun that says to the prospective gun \nowner: Understand this is a lethal weapon. Here is how to keep it \nsafely. Put it in a cabinet which is secure and locked. Keep the \nammunition separate from the gun.\n  And we are going to prevent anyone who provides this from gaining any \nkind of preference? We give preference with merit pay. There are all \nkinds of preferences in Federal law. Yet we are to deny this to anybody \nwho does the right thing and manufactures safe guns, smart guns, better \nguns.\n  Under the agreement, any dealer wishing to sell Smith & Wesson \nfirearms would comply with a series of commonsense measures. Let me \nstate what they are. Any dealer wishing to sell Smith & Wesson firearms \nfirst agrees not to sell at any gun show unless all the sellers in the \ngun show provide background checks. What a responsible thing to do. \nAgain, this provision would be unnecessary if Congress had simply \npassed the juvenile justice bill and sent it to the President for his \nsignature because all sellers at all gun shows would already be \nperforming background checks. That bill is stalled in conference, and \nthis provision of the agreement is a small step in the right direction.\n  Again, under the agreement, any dealer wishing to sell Smith & Wesson \nfirearms must carry insurance against liability for damage to property \nor injury to persons resulting in firearm sales. The same thing would \napply if you had a swimming pool. You would have some liability \ninsurance if a neighbor fell into the pool and drowned. This isn't \nasking too much.\n  Any dealer wishing to sell Smith & Wesson firearms must maintain an \nup-to-date and accurate set of records and must keep track of all \ninventory at all times.\n  Any dealer wishing to sell Smith & Wesson firearms must agree to keep \nall firearms within the dealership safe from loss or theft, including \nlocking display cases and keeping guns safely locked during off hours.\n  Ammunition must be stored separate from firearms.\n  Any dealer wishing to sell Smith & Wesson must stop selling large-\ncapacity ammunition feeding devices and assault weapons.\n  This gun company has set itself in the vanguard of reform in the gun \nindustry, and the Treasury-Postal bill coming before the Senate \npenalizes them for doing so. What kind of public policy is that? It \nsimply says we are going to try, by law, to lower safety, regulation, \ncareful record keeping, and all the things that are positive to the \nlowest possible denominator. We are not going to commend anybody who \ndoes the right thing. We are going to see they are not given \npreference. We are going to provide a disincentive to gun companies \nthat want to do the right thing.\n  More than any other piece of legislation I have seen, this shows the \ndisingenuousness of those who say they are for some targeted gun \nregulations. This speaks to what this is all about, that there should \nremain one, and one industry only, without regulation, without any \nkinds of standards, and that is the gun industry.\n\n  I think there is no better time to join this debate than in the \nupcoming Treasury-Postal bill. The amendment to strip this language \nfrom Treasury-Postal will be the first item of business of this side.\n  Mr. President, I will make this agreement available to anyone from \neither side of this aisle who wants to inspect it.\n  Mr. President, Senator Kennedy is a cosponsor of the amendment. I \nthank him, as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the Senate will soon be considering the \nTreasury and general government appropriations bill. This is one of the \nimportant funding bills we will have to pass this year to keep the \nGovernment open and running.\n  In addition to the Department of the Treasury, this is the bill that \nprovides moneys for the operation of the White House, the Executive \nOffice of the President, and it also provides funds\n\n[[Page S7598]]\n\nfor the construction of new courthouses, reflecting the priorities of \nthe administrative offices of the courts. It is this third branch of \nour Government that I will take a few minutes to talk about.\n  In 1994, the Senate and the House passed the Violence Against Women \nAct which President Clinton then signed into law. As the author of that \nlegislation, securing its passage had been my highest priority for \nthree sessions of Congress. The cause of eliminating violence against \nwomen remains my highest priority. I have watched the progress of the \nimplementation of my Violence Against Women Act. In that act we \nincluded a provision giving anyone who had been the victim of a crime \nof violence motivated by gender the right to bring a lawsuit seeking \ndamages from the assailant.\n  On May 15 of this year, in a case called United States v. Morrison, \nthe Supreme Court struck down this provision. The Court said that \naddressing the problems of violence against women in this way was \nbeyond the constitutional authority of the elected representatives of \nthe United States. Flat out, they said it was an unconstitutional act \nwe engaged in.\n  In ruling it was beyond the constitutional authority of the Congress, \nthe Court said that it does not matter how great an effect such acts of \nviolence have on interstate commerce. They said gender-based violence \ncould be crippling large segments of our national economy, but, \nnonetheless, even if that were proven--according to the Court--the \nCongress is powerless to enact a law to deter such active violence \nbecause although we have acted this way under the commerce clause of \nthe Constitution before, the Court ruled violence in and of itself is \nnot commerce.\n  I believe this is a constitutionally wrong decision. It is true that \nit does not strike a fatal blow against the struggle to end violence \nagainst women in this country. The other parts of the Violence Against \nWomen Act are unaffected by this decision. I am pleased to report that \nthese other provisions, together with changing attitudes in this \ncountry, are beginning to make a difference in this struggle in the \nlives of women who have been victimized.\n  I have introduced a bill with, now, I think over 60 cosponsors, to \nenhance the provisions of my Violence Against Women Act so that we can \ncontinue to make progress. Nonetheless, the decision in Morrison is a \nwrongheaded decision. It is not just an isolated error. No, it is part \nof a growing body of decisions in which this Supreme Court is seizing \nthe power to make important social decisions that, under our \nconstitutional system of government, are properly made by elected \nrepresentatives who answer to the people, unlike the Court.\n  I said at the time that the case came down, striking down the \nprovisions of the Violence Against Women Act, that the decision does \nmore damage to our constitutional jurisprudence than it does to the \nfight against gender-based violence. Since I said that, a number of \npeople have asked me to explain what I mean by that. Today, since we \nhave the time, I am beginning a series of speeches to do just that by \nplacing the Morrison decision in a larger context of what an \nincreasingly out-of-touch Supreme Court has been doing in recent years.\n  I plan on making two additional speeches on this subject over the \nnext several weeks and months. It is crucial, in my view, that the \nAmerican people understand the larger pattern of the Supreme Court's \nrecent decisions and, to me, the disturbing direction in which the \nSupreme Court is moving because the consequences of these cases may \nwell impact upon the ability of American citizens to ask their elected \nrepresentatives in Congress to help them solve national problems that \nhave national impact.\n  Many of the Court's decisions are written in the name of protecting \nprerogatives of the State governments and speak in the time honored \nlanguage of federalism and States rights. But as my grandmother would \nsay, they have stood federalism on its head. Make no mistake, what is \nat issue here is the question of power, who wants it, who has it, and \nwho controls it--basically, whether power will be exercised by an \ninsulated judiciary or by the elected representatives of the people.\n  In our separation of powers doctrine, upon which our Government \nrests, that power is being wrestled by the Court from the elected \nrepresentatives, for in every case in which the Court has struck down a \nFederal statute, it has invalidated a statute that the people of the \nUnited States have wanted. As a matter of fact, in many of the cases of \nstatutes that have been struck down, the numerous attorneys general of \nthe various States have sided with the Federal Government in briefs \nfiled with the Court, saying that they supported the decision taken by \nthe Congress and the President.\n  Let's give the emerging pattern of Supreme Court decisions a name. In \na speech I gave before the New Hampshire Supreme Court last year, I \nreferred to this pattern as an emerging pattern of an imperial \njudiciary. I meant to describe the judiciary that is making decisions \nand seizing power in areas in which the judgment of elected branches of \ngovernment ought to be the controlling judgment, not the Court's. With \nincreasing frequency, the Supreme Court is taking over the role of \ngovernment for itself.\n  The imperial judging might also be called a kind of judicial \nactivism. ``Judicial activism'' is an overworked expression, one that \nhas often been used by conservatives to criticize liberal judges. Under \nthis Supreme Court, however, the shoe is plainly on the other foot. It \nis now conservative judges who are supplanting the judgment of the \npeople's representatives and substituting their own for that of the \nCongress and the President.\n\n  This is not just Joe Biden talking. The Violence Against Women Act \ncase came to the Supreme Court through the Fourth Circuit Court of \nAppeals, where Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson is the chief judge. Judge \nWilkinson has been on many so-called short lists for possible Supreme \nCourt nominees of Governor Bush and is a well recognized conservative. \nIn the opinion he wrote, agreeing that the civil rights remedy in the \nViolence Against Women Act was unconstitutional, Judge Wilkinson \npraised the result as an example of ``this century's third and final \nera of judicial activism.''\n  He, Judge Wilkinson, acknowledges that the decision represents the \n``third and,'' he says, ``final era of judicial activism.'' And he said \nhe hoped this new activism would be enduring presence in our Federal \ncourts.\n  That was in Brzonkala v. VPI, 169 F.3d 820, 892-893.\n  Or consider Judge Douglas Ginsburg of the Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia, another well recognized conservative. Judge \nGinsburg has quite explicitly criticized the interpretation of the \nConstitution that has prevailed through the better part of this entire \ncentury and, indeed, throughout most of our country's history, an \ninterpretation which correctly recognizes the broad capacity and \ncompetence of the people to govern themselves through their elected \nofficials, not through the court system.\n  According to Judge Ginsburg, the correct interpretation of the \nConstitution produces results that severely restrict the power of \nelected government. He calls the Constitution ``the Constitution in \nExile.'' Under that Constitution, the one that he thinks controls, \nunelected Federal judges would wield enormous power to second-guess \nlegislative bodies on both the State and the Federal levels.\n  When Judge Ginsburg wrote about these ideas in a magazine article in \n1995, he was eagerly awaiting signs that the Supreme Court would begin \nto embrace his notion of a Constitution in exile. Five short years \nlater, much has changed. As Linda Greenhouse recently put it in a New \nYork Times column, Judge Ginsburg's hopes:\n\n       . . . sound decidedly less out of context today than they \n     did even 5 years ago, just before the court began issuing a \n     series of decisions reviving a limited vision of federal \n     power.\n\n  By taking a closer look at these series of decisions referred to in \nthe New York Times, the pattern I have been referring to will become \nquite evident.\n  The first clear step toward an imperial judiciary was taken in the \ncase called Lopez v. United States, which invalidated a Federal law \nmaking it a crime to possess a gun in a school zone. The Supreme Court \nheld that it was not obvious ``to the naked eye'' that the nationwide \nproblem of school violence has a substantial effect on the\n\n[[Page S7599]]\n\nnational economy and interstate commerce, the predicate we have to show \nto have jurisdiction under the commerce clause to pass such a law.\n  In our desire to respond quickly to the epidemic of school violence, \nwhich we all talk about here on the floor, we in the Congress did not \nmake findings--that is, we did not have hearings that said ``we find \nthat the following actions have the following impact on commerce''--we \ndid not make findings to relate school violence to interstate commerce. \nSubsequently, however, we did make such findings and pointed to the \nvoluminous evidence that was before the Congress at the time we passed \nSenator Kohl's Gun-Free School Zone Act.\n\n  Nonetheless, the Court, this new imperial judiciary, ignored our \nfindings and the raft of supporting evidence, and drew its own \nconclusions. They concluded--the Court concluded--that the threat of \nschool violence to national commerce is not substantial enough to \njustify a legislative response on the part of those of us elected to \nthe Congress.\n  The Lopez case startled many people. Numerous law schools sponsored \nconferences to discuss the meaning of this case. Constitutional \nscholars debated how great a departure this case signaled from the \nsettled approach to congressional power that has been taken over the \n20th century, at least the last two-thirds of the 20th century, by all \nprevious Supreme Courts.\n  Immediately after the decision, no consensus emerged. Many scholars \nplausibly concluded that Lopez was, as one put it, just an ``island in \nthe stream,'' a decision that breaks the flow of the river of cases \nbefore it, but which will have no lasting effect of any significance on \nthose that follow it.\n  How wrong he was. It now turns out that if Lopez is an island, it is \none the size of Australia. The Court soon followed Lopez by striking \ndown the Religious Freedom and Restoration Act that Senator Hatch and I \nhad worked so hard to craft and the Senate and House passed and the \nPresident signed.\n  In Boerne v. Flores--that is the name of the case that struck down \nthe Religious Freedom Act we passed--the Congress of the United States \nenacted the Religious Freedom Act in response to an earlier Supreme \nCourt decision.\n  In 1990, the Court ruled in Employment Decision v. Smith that the \nconstitutional freedom of religion is not offended by a State law that \nsignificantly burdens the ability of members of that religion to \npractice their religion, so long as that law applies across the board, \nwithout singling out religious practices of any one denomination in any \nway.\n  For example, under the Smith decision, a dry county which prohibits \nthe consumption of all alcohol could prohibit a church from using \nsacramental wine when they give communion, as they do in my church; I \nam a Roman Catholic; and they do so in other churches as well.\n  Smith broke with the prior line of decisions holding that such laws \nneeded to make reasonable accommodations for religion unless the \nGovernment had a very good reason for applying the law when it offended \nsomeone's sincere religious practices to do so. In other words, unless \nthe Government had an overwhelming reason why in a Catholic Church they \ncould not serve, when they give communion, a sip of wine with the host, \nprior decisions said you cannot pass a law to stop that.\n  The overwhelming majority of both Houses of Congress thought the \nSmith decision was incorrect as a matter of constitutional \ninterpretation and as a matter of policy. We concluded that because \nsection 5 of the 14th amendment authorized the Congress to protect \nfundamental civil liberties by appropriate legislation, we could enact \na statute providing greater protection than the Smith decision did to \naccepted religious practices.\n  After extensive hearings under the leadership of Senator Hatch and \nSenator Kennedy, the so-called RFRA, Religious Freedom and Restoration \nAct, was drafted to require that the application of neutral laws had to \nmake reasonable accommodation to bona fide religious objections.\n  The Supreme Court struck down our effort to extend reasonable \nprotections to religious practices. It held that the 14th amendment \ndoes not authorize the Congress to confer civil rights by statute or to \ngive judicially recognized rights a greater scope than the Court has \nset forth.\n  In the Court's view, the power of section 5 of the 14th amendment \ngives the Congress the power to ``enforce'' the rights established in \nthat amendment, but it only amounts to a power to provide remedies for \nthe violations of the rights that the Court has recognized--not the \nCongress, the Court has recognized--not to protect any broader \nconception of civil rights than the Court has already recognized.\n  In the Flores case, it was another sign that we are on the road to \njudicial imperialism. Recognizing the implications of the decision, the \nRepublican majority on the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on the \nConstitution in the House held a hearing on the Court's refusal to \ndefer to Congress' factual findings and the policy determinations it \nbased on those findings.\n  Judicial deference to congressional findings and congressional \nauthority to enforce civil rights are obviously important questions \nstanding alone, but the Supreme Court raised the stakes even higher in \ntwo decisions relating to what we call State sovereign immunity. In \nthose cases, Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida and Alden v. Maine, \nthe Court declared the Congress may not use its commerce clause powers \nto abrogate State sovereign immunity.\n  What this means, translated, is that when Congress acts under its \nbroad power to improve the national economy, a power granted to it by \nthe Constitution, the Congress, in the Court's view, cannot authorize \nan individual to sue a State even if they are suing over a purely \ncommercial transaction with that State. For example, as the Court held \nin the Alden case, an employee of a State now cannot sue his or her \nemployer for failing to comply with the Fair Labor Standards Act just \nbecause the employer happens to be a State.\n  If it is a business person, a corporation, and they violate the Fair \nLabor Standards Act, which we passed to protect all people who work, \nthey can be held accountable under that act. The Supreme Court came \nalong and said: But, Congress, you can't pass a law that holds a State \naccountable.\n\n  The Seminole Tribe and Alden cases highlight the importance of the \nissue of congressional power under the 14th amendment because the Court \ncontinues to recognize that Congress can authorize individuals to sue \nStates if our legislation is authorized by the 14th amendment rather \nthan by the commerce clause.\n  By limiting Congress' 14th amendment powers, therefore, the Boerne \ndecision, which is the Religious Freedom Act decision, draws into \nquestion our capacity to meaningfully protect civil rights at all \nwhenever remedies directly against a State are being considered.\n  Viewed in its historical context, this is a remarkable development in \nand of itself. The text of the 14th amendment was drafted immediately \nafter the Civil War, and it grants powers to only one branch of the \nGovernment, the only one named in the amendment: the Congress, not the \nCourt. Specifically, the amendment sought to grant the Congress ample \npower to enforce civil rights against the States. That is what the \nCivil War was about. That is why the Civil War amendments were passed: \nto put it in stone. Developments in these recent cases I have cited are \nin profound tension with the sentiments and concerns of the drafters of \nthe 14th amendment.\n  Still, after that case, some might continue to say it is not clear \nwhere the Court was really headed. It was possible to say in the Flores \ncase that it was simply articulating the standard governing the nature \nof Congress' power; namely, that it was purely remedial and not \nsubstantive.\n  Because the legislative record was designed to support an exercise of \nsubstantive power, that record did not so clearly support the exercise \nof the remedial power.\n  On this reading, the Court did not second-guess the congressional \nfindings. It just saw them as answering the wrong question. Subsequent \nevents, however, have confirmed that the Subcommittee on the \nConstitution had a right to be worried about Boerne because Boerne was \nmuch more ominous than that.\n  In one of the last cases decided in the 1998 term, the Court laid \ndown yet another marker, perhaps the most bold\n\n[[Page S7600]]\n\ndecision yet in the trend of the Court usurping democratic authority.\n  In that decision, the Court held unconstitutional a Federal statute, \nthe Patent and Plant Variety Protection Remedy Clarification Act. That \nact provided a remedy for patent holders against any State that \ninfringes on the patent holder's patent. That was in Florida Prepaid \nPostsecondary Education Expense Board v. College Savings Bank.\n  Before enacting this remedial legislation, the Congress had developed \na specific legislative record detailing specific cases where States had \ninfringed a federally conferred patent and evidence suggested the \npossibility of a future increase in the frequency of State \ninfringements of patents held by individuals.\n  Unlike Lopez, the Patent Protection Act did not lack findings or \nlegislative record. Unlike Boerne, the legislative record demonstrated \nthat the statute was remedial and not substantive. Nonetheless, the \nSupreme Court decided, independently, that the facts before the \nCongress, as it, the Court, interpreted them, provided, in the Court's \nwords, ``little support'' for the need for a remedy.\n  Get this: We, up here, concluded, on the record, that States have, in \nfact, infringed upon the patents held by individuals. We laid out why \nwe thought--Democrat and Republican, House, Senate, and President--we \nshould protect individuals from that and why we thought the problem \nwould get worse. We set that out in the record when we passed the \nlegislation.\n  But the Supreme Court comes along and says: We don't think there is a \nproblem. Who are they to determine whether or not there is a problem? \nIt is theirs to determine whether our action is constitutional, not \nwhether or not there is a problem. But they said they found little \nsupport for our concern--the concern of 535 elected Members of the \nCongress and the President of the United States.\n  The Court was not substituting a constitutional principle here. The \nCourt was substituting its own policy views for those of this body that \ndescribed the problem of State infringement on Federal patents as being \nof national import. They concluded it is not that big of a deal.\n  We need to be clear about what the Court did in the patent remedy \ncase. For a long time, it has been accepted constitutional law that \nonce a piece of legislation has been found to be designed to cover a \nsubject over which the Constitution gives the Congress the power to \nact--let me say that again--this has been accepted constitutional \ntheory and law that once a piece of legislation has been found to be \ndesigned by the Congress to cover a subject over which the Congress has \nconstitutional authority, that it then becomes wholly within the sphere \nof Congress to decide whether any particular action is wise or is \nprudent.\n  This has been constitutional law going all the way back as far as \nM'Culloch v. Maryland, written by the then-Chief Justice John Marshall, \nin 1819. There Chief Justice Marshall wrote that the ``government which \nhas the right to act, and has imposed on it the duty of performing that \nact, must, according to the dictates of reason, be allowed to select \nthe means [by which to act].''\n  In the patent remedy case, the Court quite clearly usurped the \nconstitutional authority of Congress to select the means it thinks \nappropriate to remedy a problem that is admittedly within the authority \nof Congress to address.\n  In the patent remedy case, the Court did not hold that Congress has \nexercised a power in an area outside its constitutional authority. \nInstead, it disagreed with our substantive judgment as to whether the \nFederal remedy was warranted.\n  In short, the Court struck down the remedy just because it did not \nthink the remedy was a good idea. Who are they to make that judgment? \nTalk about judicial activism. The cases I have reviewed today--Lopez, \nBoerne, Seminole Tribe, Alden, and Florida Prepaid--bring us up to this \nterm just completed by the Supreme Court.\n  In the next series of speeches, I will show how the trend of judicial \nimperialism continued, and was extended by several cases decided this \npast year, including the Violence Against Women Act, which I began with \ntoday.\n  The bottom line here is, in the opinion of many scholars and \nobservers of the Court, we are witnessing the emergence of what I \nreferred to a year ago as the ``imperial judiciary.'' I just discussed \nfive cases leading up to the just completed term.\n\n  Now I would like to discuss two significant decisions of this term. I \nwill also begin the task of trying to place these decisions in a \nbroader framework of the Constitution's allocation of responsibility \nbetween the elected branches of Government and the judiciary. It is a \nframework that this ``imperial judiciary'' is disregarding.\n  Last December, the Court focused its sight on the Age Discrimination \nin Employment Act. That is the act that protects Americans against \ndiscrimination based on age and is amply justified under our \nConstitution. Not only does it protect the basic civil rights of equal \nprotection and nondiscriminatory treatment--with bipartisan support, I \nmight add--it also promotes the national economy, by ensuring that the \nlabor pool is not artificially limited by mandatory requirements to \nretire.\n  So the Congress had ample constitutional authority to enact the Age \nDiscrimination Act. And the Court did not deny that. Nonetheless, the \nCourt, this last term, gutted the enforcement of the act as the act \napplied to all State government employees.\n  Building on its earlier decisions in the Seminole Tribe and Alden \ncases, which I discussed a moment ago, the Court ruled that the \nConstitution prevents us from authorizing State employees to sue their \nemployers for violation of the Federal Age Discrimination Act. The \nCourt also said, however, that the Constitution does not prevent the \nCongress from applying the law to the States.\n  Now, you have to listen to this carefully. In a thoroughly bizarre \nmanner, in my view, the Supreme Court has now held that the \nConstitution allows the Age Discrimination Act to apply to State \nemployers, but it denies the employees the right to sue the State \nemployers when their rights under the Federal law are violated. We \nlearned in law school that a right without a remedy can hardly be \ncalled a right.\n\n  As a result of this case, called Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents, \nover 27,000 State employees in my State of Delaware are left without an \neffective judicial remedy for a violation of a Federal law that \nprotects them against age discrimination. Across the Nation, nearly 5 \nmillion State employees no longer have the full protection of Federal \nlaw.\n  Recall that in the Boerne decision--the case that invalidated the \nReligious Freedom Restoration Act, which I discussed a moment ago--the \nCourt had begun the process of undermining the ability of the Congress \nunder section 5 of the 14th amendment to enact legislation protecting \ncivil rights. In Kimel, they continued that process.\n  In Kimel, the Court held that Congress' 14th amendment power to \nenforce civil rights refers only to the enforcement of those rights \nthat the Court itself has declared and not to rights that exist by \nvirtue of valid statutes. Because the Court decided that the Age \nDiscrimination Act goes beyond the general protection the Constitution \nprovides when it says that all citizens are entitled to ``equal \nprotection under the law,'' the Court ruled that the right to sue an \nemployer for violations of the act was not ``appropriate'' and so ruled \nthe act unconstitutional.\n  After Kimel, the pattern of the imperial judiciary now emerges with \nsome clarity. First, the Court has repudiated over 175 years of nearly \nunanimous agreement that Congress, not the Court, will decide what \nconstitutes ``necessary and proper'' legislation under any of its, \nCongress', enumerated powers. Then in a parallel maneuver, the Court \nhas announced that it, not the Congress, will decide what constitutes \n``appropriate'' remedial legislation to enforce civil rights and civil \nliberties.\n  Let me return for a moment to the Violence Against Women Act, which I \nbegan earlier in my speech. Prior to the enactment of the Violence \nAgainst Women Act, I held extensive hearings in the Judiciary Committee \nwhen I was chairman, compiling voluminous evidence on the pattern of \nviolence against women in America. The massive legislative record \nCongress generated over a 4-year period of those\n\n[[Page S7601]]\n\nhearings supported Congress' explicit findings that gender-motivated \nviolence does substantially and directly affect interstate commerce. \nHow? By preventing a discrete group of Americans, i.e., women, from \nparticipating fully in the day-to-day commerce of this country. These \nare the types of findings, I might add, that were absent when the \nCongress first enacted the Gun-Free School Zone Act, struck down in the \nLopez case.\n  Let me remind you that Congress, when we enacted the civil rights \nprovision invalidated in Morrison, found:\n\n       [C]rimes of violence motivated by gender have a substantial \n     adverse impact upon interstate commerce by deterring \n     potential victims of violence from traveling interstate, from \n     engaging in employment in interstate business, from \n     transacting with businesses and in places involved in \n     interstate commerce. Crimes of violence motivated by gender \n     have a substantial adverse effect on interstate commerce by \n     diminishing national productivity, increasing medical and \n     other costs, and decreasing the supply of and the demand for \n     interstate products . . .\n\n  I cannot emphasize enough the seriousness of the toll that we found \ngender-motivated violence exacts on interstate commerce. Such violence \ndenies women an equal opportunity to compete in the job market, \nimposing a heavy burden on our national economy.\n\n  Witness after witness at the hearing testified that as a result of \nrape, sexual assault, or domestic abuse, she was fired from, forced to \nquit, or abandoned her job. As a result of such interference with the \nability of women to work, domestic violence was estimated to cost \nemployers billions of dollars annually because of absenteeism in the \nworkplace. Indeed, estimates suggested that we spend between $5 and $10 \nbillion a year on health care, criminal justice, and other social costs \nmerely and totally as a consequence of violence against women in \nAmerica.\n  In response to this important national problem, one to which we found \nthe States did not or could not adequately respond, Congress enacted my \nViolence Against Women Act in 1994, which included provisions \nauthorizing women to sue their attackers in Federal court. This statute \nreflected the legislative branch's judgment that State laws and \npractices had failed to provide equal and adequate protection to women \nvictimized by domestic violence and sexual assault and that the lawsuit \nwould provide an adequate means of remedying these deficiencies. This \nwas no knee-jerk response to a problem. Congress specifically found \nthat State and Federal laws failed to ``adequately provide victims of \ngender-motivated crimes the opportunity to vindicate their interests'' \nand that:\n\n       . . . existing bias and discrimination in the criminal \n     justice system often deprives victims of crimes of violence \n     motivated by gender of equal protection of the laws and the \n     redress to which they are entitled.\n\n  The funny thing about these explicit congressional findings and this \nmountain of data, as Justice Souter in his dissent called it, showing \nthe effects of violence against women on interstate commerce--the funny \nthing about this is that the Supreme Court acknowledged all of it. They \nsaid: We don't challenge that.\n  This is the new height in their imperial judicial thinking. That is \nright. The Court acknowledged all of the findings of my committee. In \nMorrison, the Supreme Court recognized that in contrast to the lack of \nfindings in the legislation on the Gun-Free School Zone case, Lopez, \nthat the civil rights provisions of the Violence Against Women Act were \nsupported by ``numerous factual findings'' about the impact of gender-\nmotivated violence on interstate commerce.\n  But the Court also acknowledged the failure of the States to address \nthis problem--they acknowledged the States had not addressed it before \nwe did--noting that the assertion that there was a pervasive bias in \nState justice systems against victims of gender-motivated violence was \nsupported by a ``voluminous congressional record.'' They acknowledged \nthat there was this great impact on interstate commerce. They \nacknowledged--because I had my staff, over 4 years, survey the laws and \nthe outcomes in all 50 States--that many State courts had a bias \nagainst women.\n  So they acknowledged both those predicates.\n  Instead of according the deference typically given to congressional \nfactual findings, supported by, as they said, a voluminous record, and \nwithout even the pretense of applying what we lawyers call the \n``traditional rational basis test''--that is, if the Congress has a \nrational basis upon which to make its finding, then we are not going to \nsecond-guess it; that is what we mean by ``rational basis''--the Court \nsimply thought it knew better.\n  This marks the first occasion in more than 60 years that the Supreme \nCourt has rejected explicit factual findings by Congress that a given \nactivity substantially affects interstate commerce. The Court justified \nthis abandonment of deference to Congress by declaring that whether a \nparticular activity substantially affects interstate commerce ``is \nultimately a judicial rather than a legislative question.''\n  You got this? For the first time in 60 years, since back in the days \nof the Lochner era, the Supreme Court has come along and said they \nacknowledge that the Congress has these voluminous findings that \ninterstate commerce is affected and the States aren't doing anything to \ndeal with this national problem of violence against women; they are not \ndoing sufficiently enough.\n  There is a bias in their courts. We acknowledge that. But they said, \nnotwithstanding that, the question of whether a specific activity \nsubstantially affects interstate commerce ``is ultimately a judicial \nrather than a legislative question.'' Hang on, here we go back to 1925.\n  As Justice Souter said in his dissent, this has it exactly backwards, \nfor ``the fact of such a substantial effect is not an issue for the \ncourts in the first instance, but for the Congress, whose institutional \ncapacity for gathering evidence and taking testimony far exceeds \nours.''\n  In short, in a decision that reads more like one written in 1930 than \nin 2000, the Court held that the judicial, not the legislative, branch \nof the Government was better suited to making these decisions on behalf \nof the American people--a conclusion that certainly would have \nsurprised Chief Justice Marshall, the author of the seminal commerce \nclause decision in Gibbons v. Ogden in the early 1800s.\n  The judgments that the Congress made in enacting the Violence Against \nWomen Act were, in my view, the correct ones. Even if you disagree with \nme, though, they were the Congress' judgments to make, not the Court's \njudgments to make.\n  When it struck down the Violence Against Women Act, the Court left \nlittle doubt that it was acting outside its proper judicial role. They \nsaid that the commerce clause did not justify the statute because the \nact of inflicting violence on women is not a ``commercial'' act. It \nsaid that section 5 of the 14th amendment also did not justify this act \nbecause creating a cause of action against the private perpetrators of \nviolence is not an ``appropriate'' remedy for the denial of equal \nprotection that occurs when State law enforcement fails vigorously to \nenforce laws that ought to protect women against such violence.\n  Over the course of this speech today, I have discussed seven \nsignificant decisions since 1995: Lopez, the gun-free school zones \ncase; Boerne against Flores, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act \ncase; Seminole Tribe and Alden, the two decisions prohibiting us from \ncreating judicial enforceable economic rights for State employees; \nFlorida Prepaid, the patent remedy case; Kimel, the Age Discrimination \nAct case; and finally, Morrison, the Violence Against Women Act case.\n  None of them deal fatal blows to our ability to address these \nsignificant national problems, but they each, in varying degrees, make \nit much more difficult for us to be able to do so.\n  There are two even more important points to make about these cases.\n  First, together, these cases are establishing a pattern of decisions \nfounded on constitutional error--an error that allocates far too much \nauthority to the Federal courts and thereby denies to the elected \nbranches of the Federal Government the legitimate authority vested in \nit by the Constitution to address national problems.\n  Second, this is a trend that is fully capable of growing until it \ndoes deal telling blows to our ability to address significant national \nproblems. This is not only my assessment; it is shared, for example, by \nJustice John Paul Stevens, who was appointed to the Court\n\n[[Page S7602]]\n\nby Gerald Ford. Dissenting in the Kimel case, Justice Stevens has \nwritten that ``the kind of judicial activism manifested in [these \ncases] represents such a radical departure from the proper role of this \nCourt that it should be opposed whenever the opportunity arises.''\n\n  That is not Joe Biden speaking; that is a sitting member of the \nSupreme Court appointed by a Republican President.\n  It is also shared by Justice David Souter, who was appointed by \nPresident Bush. Dissenting in the Lopez case, Justice Souter has \nwritten that ``it seems fair to ask whether the step taken by the Court \ntoday does anything but portend a return to the untenable jurisprudence \nfrom which the Court extricated itself almost 60 years ago.'' He was \nreferring to the Lochner era.\n  It is shared by Justice Breyer, a Clinton appointee. Dissenting in \nCollege Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid, Justice Breyer has written \nthat the Court's decisions on State sovereign immunity ``threaten the \nNation's ability to enact economic legislation needed for the future in \nmuch the way Lochner v. New York threatened the Nation's ability to \nenact social legislation over 90 years ago.''\n  Significantly, this imperialist trend can continue to grow and flower \nin two different places. The Supreme Court itself can continue to write \nmore and more aggressive decisions, cutting deeper and deeper into the \npeople's capacity to govern themselves effectively at a national level.\n  In the short term, perhaps the odds are that this will not occur. \nMany of the decisions in this pattern have been decided by votes of \nfive Justices to four Justices, and it may be that one or more of the \nconservative majority has gone about as far as he or she is prepared to \ngo at this time.\n  In the longer term, however, we can quite reasonably expect two or \nthree appointments to the Court in the next 4 to 8 years, and if those \nappointments result in replacing moderate conservatives on the Court \nwith activist conservatives, we have every reason to expect that this \ntrend I have outlined for the last 45 minutes would gain momentum.\n  It can also bloom in the lower courts. This may, to some extent, be \nby design of the Justices who are taking the lead in the Court today. \nCertainly, many people have remarked on the proclivity of Justice \nScalia to author opinions containing sweeping language that creates new \nambiguities in the law and which then often provide a hook on which \nlower court judges can hang their judicial activism.\n  Already, opinions have been written by lower court judges overturning \nthe Superfund legislation, challenging the constitutionality of the \nEndangered Species Act, calling into doubt Federal protection of \nwetlands, and eviscerating the False Claims Act, among others. Not all \nof these judicial exercises can be corrected by the Supreme Court, even \nif it were inclined to do so, because the Court decides only 80 or so \ncases a year from the entire Federal system.\n  In concluding, I wish to describe in the most basic terms why the \nimperialist course upon which the Court has embarked constitutes a \ndanger to our established system of government.\n  In case after case, the Court has strayed from its job of \ninterpreting the Constitution and has instead begun to second guess the \nCongress about the wisdom or necessity of enacted laws. Its opinions \ndeclare straightforwardly its new approach: The Court determines \nwhether legislation is ``appropriate,'' or whether it is proportional \nto the problem we have validly sought to address, or whether there is \nenough reason for us to enact legislation that all agree is within our \nconstitutionally defined legislative power.\n  If in the Court's view legislation is not appropriate, or \nproportional, or grounded in a sufficient sense of urgency, it is \nunconstitutional--even though the subject matter is within Congress' \npower, and even though Congress made extensive findings to support the \nmeasure.\n  More significant than the invalidation of any specific piece of \nlegislation, this approach annexes to the judiciary vast tracts of what \nare properly understood as the legislative powers. If allowed to take \nroot, this expanded version of judicial power will undermine the \nproject of the American people, and that project is self-government, as \nset forth in the Constitution.\n  To understand the alarm that Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, and \nothers have sounded about the Court's pattern of activism, we must \nunderstand the way the Constitution structures the Federal Government \nand the reasons behind that structure. We must also understand the \nhistory and the practice that have made the Constitution's blueprint a \nreality and provide a scale to measure when the balance of power has \ngone dangerously awry. These considerations amply support Justice \nStevens's assessment of ``a radical departure from the proper role of \nthis Court.''\n\n  The Constitution (supplemented by the Declaration of Independence) \nsets forth the great aspirations and objects of our nation. It does \nnot, however, achieve them. That is the great project of American \npolitics and government: to achieve the country envisioned in those \nfounding documents. The way to meet our aspirations and establish our \nnational identity and our character as a people is through the process \nof self-government.\n  The Declaration of Independence proclaims our fundamental commitment \nto liberty and equality. These commitments are by no means self-\nexecuting. The history of our nation is in no small part the history of \na people struggling to comprehend these commitments and to put these \nhigh ideals into practice.\n  The Constitution itself was concerned with a more complex function. \nWhereas the Declaration explained the reasons for splitting from Great \nBritain, the Constitution was concerned with explaining why the former \ncolonies should remain united as a single nation. It was also concerned \nwith the task of providing a government that could fulfill the promise \nand purposes of union.\n  The Framers who arrived in Philadelphia to debate and draft the \nConstitution were no longer immediately animated by an overbearing and \noppressive government. In fact, our first national government, under \nthe Articles of Confederation, was the precise opposite.\n  The emergency that brought the leading citizens of the North American \ncontinent together in Philadelphia that Summer of 1787 was the \ninability of the national government to act in any effective way. These \nframers saw the vast potential of the new nation with its unparalleled \nnatural and human resources.\n  They saw as well the danger posed by foreign powers and domestic \nunrest. They realized too that the Confederation could never act \ncredibly to exploit the nation's potential or to quell domestic and \nforeign hostilities. As Alexander Hamilton put it, ``[w]e may indeed \nwith propriety be said to have reached almost the last stage of \nnational humiliation. There is scarcely anything that can wound the \npride or degrade the character of an independent nation which we do not \nexperience.''\n  Hamilton urged that the nation ratify the Constitution and throw off \nthe ability of the states to constrain the national government: ``Here, \nmy countrymen, impelled by every motive that ought to influence an \nenlightened people, let us make a firm stand for our safety, our \ntranquility, our dignity, our reputation. Let us at last break the \nfatal charm which has too long seduced us from the paths of felicity \nand prosperity.''\n  Indeed, Hamilton may have been understating the degree of the crisis. \nGouverneur Morris, a leading delegate from Pennsylvania, warned that \n``This country must be united. If persuasion does not unite it, the \nsword will . . . The scenes of horror attending civil commotion cannot \nbe described . . . The stronger party will then make [traitors] of the \nweaker; and the Gallows & Halter will finish the word of the sword.''\n  The words of the Constitution's preamble are not idle rhetoric. The \nfounding generation ratified the Constitution in order to establish a \ngovernment that could decisively and effectively act to ``provide for \nthe common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the \nblessings of liberty.'' This is a fundamental constitutional value that \nmust always be brought to bear when construing the Constitution.\n  Yet, it is precisely this constitutional value that the Supreme Court\n\n[[Page S7603]]\n\nhas lost sight of. Consider, for example, Justice Kennedy's statement \nin the case striking down the Line Item Veto Act. ``A nation cannot \nplunder its own treasury without putting its Constitution and its \nsurvival in peril.\n  The statute before us then is of first importance, for it seems \nundeniable the Act will tend to restrain persistent excessive \nspending.'' Who is he to make that judgment? Yet, Justice Kennedy \nviewed this as completely irrelevant to the statute's \nconstitutionality. He concurred that the Line Item Veto Act violates \nseparation of powers even though there was no obvious textual basis for \nthis conclusion and no apparent threat to any person's liberty.\n  Justice Kennedy is right about one thing. His statement is premised \non the view that the Court is not particularly well-suited to make \npolicy or political judgments. This is accurate and no mere \nhappenstance. The Constitution itself structures the judiciary and the \npolitical branches differently by design.\n  The Judiciary is made independent of political forces. Judges hold \nlife tenure and salaries that cannot be reduced. The purpose of the \nentire structure of the judiciary is to leave judges free to apply the \ntechnical skills of the legal profession to construe and develop the \nlaw, within the confines of what can be fairly deemed legal reasoning.\n  Outside this realm is the realm of policy. Here Congress and the \nPresident enjoy the superior place, again by constitutional design. The \npolitical branches are tied closely to the people, most obviously \nthrough popular elections.\n  Between elections, the political branches are properly subject to the \npublic in a host of ways. Moreover, the political branches have wide-\nranging access to information through hearings, through studies we \ncommission, and through the statistics and data we routinely gather.\n  This proximity to the people and to information makes Congress the \nmost suitable repository of the legislative power; that is, the power \nto deliberate as agents of the public and to determine what laws and \nstructures will best ``promote the general welfare.''\n  It is much easier to describe the distinction between the judicial \nand the legislative power in the abstract than it is to apply in \npractice. That is why so much of our constitutional history has been \ndevoted to developing doctrines and traditions that keep the judiciary \nwithin its proper sphere.\n  After much upheaval, the mid-twentieth century yielded a stable and \nharmonious approach to questions relating to the scope of Congress's \npowers: these questions are largely for the political branches and the \npolitical process to resolve--not the courts.\n  To be sure, the Court has a role in policing the outer boundaries of \nthis power, but it is to be extremely deferential to the specific \njudgment of Congress that a given statute is a necessary and proper \nexercise of its constitutional powers. When the Court fails to defer, \nas it had during several periods prior to the New Deal, it inevitably \nfinds itself making judgments that are far outside the sphere of the \njudicial power.\n  This is the point of Justice Stevens' warning. The Court is departing \nfrom its proper role in scope of power cases. What was initially \nuncertain, even after Lopez and Boerne, is now inescapable: This \nimperial Court, in case after case, is freely imposing its own view of \nwhat constitutes sound public policy. This violates a basic theory of \ngovernment so carefully set forth in our Constitution. In theory, \ntherefore, there is ample reason to expect that the Supreme Court's \nrecent imperialism will undermine the fundamental value animating the \nConstitution, and that is the ability of the American people to govern \nthemselves effectively and democratically.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Missouri up to \n7 minutes for a statement he wishes to make, and I ask unanimous \nconsent I be allowed to do that without losing my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan for \nhis kindness to me. I certainly am not the one to object to that \nunanimous consent. I appreciate that very much.\n  I express my unequivocal support, and I rise to do so for the many \nefforts that we are making in this Congress to reform U.S. policy on \nembargoes of food and medicine. Now is the time to reevaluate the \npolicies we have engaged in in the past that are perpetuating losses to \nAmerica.\n  Food embargoes can be summed up as a big loss: a loss to the U.S. \neconomy, a loss of jobs, a loss of markets. For example, embargoed \ncountries buy 14 percent of the world's total rice, 10 percent of the \nworld's total wheat purchases, and the list goes on.\n  When we lose those markets for America, we should have a very good \nreason. There should be some benefit if we are going to give up access \nto 14 percent of the world's rice import market, 10 percent of the \nworld's wheat market, for soybean farmers, cattlemen, hog farmers, \npoultry producers, cotton, and corn farmers.\n  The nation of Cuba, for example, imports about 22 million pounds of \npork a year. Someone says that is important to the livestock farmers. \nFeed that pig corn before exporting it, so it is important to the grain \nfarmers, as well.\n  The embargo causes a loss in America's foreign policy. Often we think \nwe will inflict some sort of pressure or injury on another country and, \ninstead of hurting them, we help them. I don't think there was any more \ndramatic case of that than the Soviet grain embargo with 17 million \ntons of grain and those contracts were canceled. Instead of hurting the \nSoviet Union, they replaced the contracts in the world marketplace at a \n$250 million benefit to the Soviet Union. Instead of hurting the former \nSoviet Union, we helped the former Soviet Union. That particular weapon \nwas dangerous. Using food and medicine as an embargo is dangerous \nbecause that weapon backfires. Instead of hurting our opponent, we \nhelped our opponent.\n\n  Who did we hurt? We hurt the American farm agricultural community. We \nhurt the food processing community. We need to make a commitment to \nourselves that we need to reform this area of embargoing food and \nmedicine resources.\n  The provision the Senator from Kansas and I and others will likely \noffer today simply reaffirms what we have been trying to do for some \ntime; that is, to get real reform of humanitarian sanctions. I will \ncosponsor Senator Roberts' and Senator Baucus' amendment. I support it \nfully. However, the amendment should not be necessary. Twice we have \npassed sanctions reform for food and medicine in the Senate. Why is it \nnecessary to do this a third time? My clear preference is to pass \nsanctions reform for all countries, not only for Cuba. We should reform \nthe sanctions regime for all countries, not only Cuba, and we should \nensure that future sanctions will not be imposed arbitrarily.\n  Last year, the Senate accepted overwhelmingly, by a vote of 70-28, \naccepted an amendment that I and many of my colleagues offered. That \namendment lifts food and medicine sanctions across the board, not only \napplying the lifting of the sanctions to Cuba.\n  When we went to the House-Senate conference, the democratic process \nwas derailed. We were not voted down. The conference was shut down \nbecause the votes were there to affect what the Senate had clearly \nvoted in favor of. That is, the reformulation of our policy in regard \nto food and medicine embargoes. The conference was shut down by a \nselect few individuals in the Congress who were outside of the \nconference committee.\n  This reform proposal was then adopted by the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee. I am pleased the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has \nembraced the concept, which the Senate voted 70-28 in favor of, in \nspite of the fact this was shot down when the committee was shut down \nin the conference last year.\n  Once again, this provision passed the Senate this year. Senators \nDorgan and Gorton offered it as an amendment in the agricultural \nappropriations markup, and it was accepted overwhelmingly.\n  Once again, we are faced with a House-Senate conference. It would be \nvery troublesome to me if the democratic process is not allowed to \nwork,\n\n[[Page S7604]]\n\nespecially after we have seen the will of Congress and the American \npeople. That will is clearly expressed as a will to reform and embrace \nthe reform of sanctions imposed by the President. It has passed the \nSenate Foreign Affairs Committee, and it has passed the Senate twice. \nSome version of this effort has now passed the House of Representatives \nand is broadly supported all across America.\n  I hold in my hand a list of about 50 organizations, dozens and dozens \nand dozens of organizations, including the American Farm Bureau, the \nNational Farmers Union, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Gulf Ports of the \nAmericas Association, the AFL-CIO. That is a pretty broad set of groups \nthat want to reform this practice of embargoes.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this list printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n            Groups and Individuals Supporting the Amendment:\n\n       Missouri Farm Bureau, and numerous other Missouri farm \n     organizations, The American Farm Bureau, The National Farmers \n     Union, American Soybean Association, U.S. Rice Producers \n     Association, Wheat Export Trade Education Committee, National \n     Association of Wheat Growers, U.S. Wheat Associates, National \n     Grain Sorghum Producers, Cargill.\n       ConAgra, Riceland, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Grocery \n     Manufacturers of America, Gulf Ports of the Americas \n     Association, The AFL-CIO, Washington Office of Latin America, \n     Resource Center of the Americas, The U.S.-Cuba Foundation, \n     Cuban American Alliance Education Fund.\n       Association for Fair Trade with Cuba, The U.S.-Cuba \n     Friendshipment/Bay Area, Americans for Humanitarian Trade \n     with Cuba, Cuban Committee for Democracy, U.S.A./Cuba \n     InfoMed, USCuBA Trade Association, Cuban Committee for \n     Democracy, Cuban American Alliance Education Fund, Inc., \n     InterAction (the American Council for Voluntary International \n     Action).\n       Latin American and Caribbean Region American Friends \n     Service Committee, World Neighbors, Lutheran World Relief, \n     Church of the Brethren, Washington Office, Bread for the \n     World, Paulist National Catholic Evangelization Association, \n     World Education, Lutheran Brotherhood, PACT, Third World \n     Opportunities Program.\n       Concern America, Center for International Policy, Program \n     On Corporations, Law, and Democracy (POCLAD), Unitarian \n     Universalist Service Committee, Committee of Concerned \n     Scientists, Inc., (which is chaired by Joel Lebowitz, Rutgers \n     University, Paul Plotz, National Institutes of Health, and \n     Walter Reich, George Washington University), Women's \n     International League for Peace and Freedom, Oxfam America, \n     Institute for Food and Development Policy.\n       Paulist National Catholic Evangelization Association, The \n     Alliance of Baptist, Institute for Human Rights and \n     Responsibilities, Chicago Religious Leadership Network on \n     Latin America, Fund for Reconciliation and Development, \n     Guatemala Human Rights Commission, USA, The Center for Cross-\n     Cultural Study, Inc., Mayor Gerald Thompson, City of \n     Fitzgerald, Georgia, Professor Hose Moreno, Professor of \n     Sociology, University of Pittsburgh, Berkeley Adult School, \n     Career Center Director June Johnson, Youngstown State \n     University, Dept. of Foreign Language, Lake Charles Harbor & \n     Terminal District, Catholic Relief Services.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. We are today offering yet another amendment because \nthere is concern that the democratic process in the agricultural \nappropriations House-Senate conference will not be respected.\n  Let me be clear. We would not have to be here today offering this \namendment that says ``don't enforce the law,'' if we in the Congress \nwere allowed to change the law, which is the purpose of Congress.\n  If you don't want to change the law, you don't need a Congress. You \ncan have the same laws all the time. We found a law that is not \nworking; we should change the law. This amendment will be a ``don't \nenforce the law'' amendment, but the truth is, our prior expressions on \nthis are clear. We ought to change the law so we won't have to talk \nabout withdrawing funding for enforcement.\n  My preference is to get this issue resolved in the agricultural \nappropriations conference and pass embargo reform for all countries and \nfor future sanctions. We need to send real embargo reform to the \nPresident's desk this year. That should be our objective. I will \nsupport this amendment today which I am cosponsor of, but real reform, \nand reforming the regime, the framework in which these sanctions are \nproposed, is what we ought to do. It is what we have done. I believe, \nultimately, it is what we will do for the benefit of not only those who \nwork in agriculture and who respect foreign policy but for future \ngenerations and the relations of the United States with other \ncountries.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill \nincludes a provision to establish a special postage stamp called the \nsemipostal, intended to raise funds for programs to reduce domestic \nviolence.\n  I am a very strong supporter of programs to reduce domestic \nviolence--I believe Congress should fully fund those programs--but I do \nnot agree that another semipostal issue should be mandated by the \nCongress.\n  Semipostals are stamps that are sold with a surcharge on top of the \nregular first-class postage rate, with the extra revenue earmarked for \na designated cause. Those causes are invariably causes which I think \nmost, if not all, support. They are very appealing causes that come to \nCongress and ask to require the Postal Service to issue a stamp that \nhas an amount for first-class postage more than the regular 33 cents \namount, with the difference going to their cause.\n  The one and only time that we ever did that was for an \nextraordinarily worthy cause--breast cancer research. The question now \nis whether we are going to continue down that road and, as a Congress, \nmandate the Postal Service to issue those stamps for a whole bunch of \ncauses that are competing with each other for us to mandate the Postal \nService to issue such a stamp.\n  Section 414 of this bill says:\n\n       In order to afford the public a convenient way to \n     contribute to funding for domestic violence programs, the \n     Postal Service shall establish a special rate of postage for \n     first-class mail under this section.\n\n  It then goes on to describe what that rate shall be. It says in part \nof this section that:\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that nothing in this \n     section should directly or indirectly cause a net decrease in \n     total funds received by the Department of Justice or any \n     other agency of the Government, or any component or program \n     thereof below the level that would otherwise have been \n     received but for the enactment of this section.\n\n  I am not sure how this can possibly be enforced. But that is just one \nof the problems, not the basic problem, with this language.\n  As I indicated, the first and only example in American history of a \nsemipostal stamp being issued was the breast cancer research stamp \nwhich required the Postal Service to turn over extra revenue, less \nadministrative costs, to the National Institutes of Health and the \nDepartment of Defense for its breast cancer research programs. That \nstamp broke tradition in Congress, not just because it was the first \nsemipostal in our Nation's history but also because it was the first \ntime that Congress mandated the issuance of any stamp in 40 years. I \nthink our tradition of keeping Congress out of the stamp selection \nprocess has worked with respect to commemorative stamps, and I believe \nwe should follow that with respect to semipostals as well.\n  For the last 40 years, Congress has deferred to the Postal Service \nand to an advisory board which it has set up, nonpartisan, out of \npolitics, objective. That Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee recommends \nsubjects for the commemorative stamp program. That committee, the \nCitizens' Stamp Advisory Committee, was created more than four decades \nago to take politics out of the stamp selection process. Committee \nmembers review thousands of stamp subjects each year and select only a \nsmall number that they believe will be educational and interesting to \nthe public and meet the goals of the Postal Service.\n  Although Congress advises that advisory committee on stamp subjects \nby making recommendations through letters that we send or through \nsense-of-Congress resolutions, until now, for the last 40 years, \nCongress has left the decisionmaking on stamp issuance up to the Postal \nService.\n  This is what the Postal Service says about the role of the Citizens \nStamp Advisory Committee:\n\n       The U.S. Postal Service is proud of its role in portraying \n     the American experience to a world audience through the \n     issuance of postage stamps and postal stationery.\n\n[[Page S7605]]\n\n       Almost all subjects chosen to appear on U.S. stamps and \n     postal stationery are suggested by the public. Each year, \n     Americans submit proposals to the Postal Service on literally \n     thousands of different topics. Every stamp suggestion is \n     considered, regardless of who makes it or how it is \n     presented.\n       On behalf of the Postmaster General, the Citizens' Stamp \n     Advisory Committee (CSAC) is tasked with evaluating the \n     merits of all stamp proposals. Established in 1957, the \n     Committee provides the Postal Service with a ``breadth of \n     judgment and depth of experience in various areas that \n     influence subject matter, character and beauty of postage \n     stamps.''\n       The Committee's primary goal is to select subjects for \n     recommendation to the Postmaster General that are both \n     interesting and educational. In addition to Postal Service's \n     extensive line of regular stamps, approximately 25 to 30 new \n     subjects for commemorative stamps are recommended each year. \n     Stamp selections are made with all postal customers in mind, \n     not just stamp collectors. A good mix of subjects, both \n     interesting and educational, is essential.\n       Committee members are appointed by and serve at the \n     pleasure of the Postmaster General. The Committee is composed \n     of 15 members whose backgrounds reflect a wide range of \n     educational, artistic, historical and professional expertise. \n     All share an interest in philately and the needs of the \n     mailing public.\n       The Committee itself employs no staff. The Postal Service's \n     Stamp Development group handles Committee administrative \n     matters, maintains Committee records and responds to as many \n     as 50,000 letters received annually recommending stamp \n     subjects and designs.\n       The Committee meets four times yearly in Washington, D.C. \n     At the meetings, the members review all proposals that have \n     been received since the previous meeting. No in-person \n     appeals by stamp proponents are permitted. The members also \n     review and provide guidance on artwork and designs for stamp \n     subjects that are scheduled to be issued. The criteria \n     established by this independent group ensure that stamp \n     subjects have stood the test of time, are consistent with \n     public opinion and have broad national interest.\n       Ideas for stamp subjects that meet the CSAC criteria may be \n     addressed to the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee, c/o \n     Stamp Development, U.S. Postal Service, 475 L'Enfant Plaza, \n     SW, Room 4474E, Washington, D.C. 20260-2437. Subjects should \n     be submitted at least three years in advance of the proposed \n     date of issue to allow sufficient time for consideration and \n     for design and production, if the subject is approved.\n       The Postal Service has no formal procedures for submitting \n     stamp proposals. This allows everyone the same opportunity to \n     suggest a new postage stamp. All proposals are reviewed by \n     the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee regardless of how they \n     are submitted, i.e., postal cards, letters or petitions.\n       Afer a proposal is determined not to violate the criteria \n     set by CSAC, research is done on the proposed stamp subject. \n     Each new proposed subject is listed on the CSAC's agenda for \n     its next meeting. The CSAC considers all new proposals and \n     takes one of several actions: it may reject the new proposal, \n     it may set it aside for consideration for future issue or it \n     may request additional information and consider the subject \n     at its next meeting. If set aside for consideration, the \n     subject remains ``under consideration'' in a file maintained \n     for the Committee.\n\n  What is important about all that is that there are very clear \nprocedures where every citizen of this country can make a \nrecommendation to the committee which has certain basic criteria to \ndetermine the eligibility of subjects for commemoration on U.S. stamps. \nThese criteria are set forth for the general public to see--12 major \nareas guide the selection.\n\n       It is a general policy that U.S. postage stamps and \n     stationery primarily will feature American or American-\n     related subjects.\n       No living person shall be honored by portrayal on U.S. \n     postage.\n       Commemorative stamps or postal stationery items honoring \n     individuals usually will be issued on, or in conjunction with \n     significant anniversaries of their birth, but no postal item \n     will be issued sooner than ten years after the individual's \n     death. The only exception to the ten-year rule is the \n     issuance of stamps honoring deceased U.S. presidents. They \n     may be honored with a memorial stamp on the first birth \n     anniversary following death.\n       Events of historical significance shall be considered for \n     commemoration only on anniversaries in multiples of 50 years.\n       Only events and themes of widespread national appeal and \n     significance will be considered for commemoration. Events or \n     themes of local or regional significance may be recognized by \n     a philatelic or special postal cancellation, which may be \n     arranged through the local postmaster.\n       Stamps or stationery items shall not be issued to honor \n     fraternal, political, sectarian, or service/charitable \n     organizations that exist primarily to solicit and/or \n     distribute funds. Nor shall stamps be issued to honor \n     commercial enterprises or products.\n\n  These criteria--I have just read six of them; there are a total of \n12--are set forth for the public to see and for everybody to have a \nfair chance, according to certain criteria set forth in advance to have \na recommendation considered.\n  The stamp advisory committee, however, does not issue semipostals. \nOne of the questions we need to face as a Congress is whether or not, \ngiven the fact we now are beginning to authorize semipostage such as \nthe breast cancer research, semipostal, it would not be better for us \nto authorize the advisory committee of the Postal Service to be \nperforming this important function.\n  The problem is that since the breast cancer research stamp has been \nauthorized, we have had dozens of requests for a semipostal stamp. This \nis a list of some of the bills that have been introduced. These are \njust the bills that have been introduced for semipostal: AIDS research \nand education; diabetes research; Alzheimer's disease research; \nprostate cancer research; emergency food relief in the United States; \norgan and tissue donation awareness; World War II memorial; the \nAmerican Battle Monuments Commission; domestic violence programs; \nvanishing wildlife protection programs; highway-rail grade crossing \nsafety; domestic violence programs--a second bill; another bill on \norgan and tissue donation awareness; childhood literacy.\n  There are not too many of us, I believe, who are about to vote \nagainst a stamp that could raise--could raise, I emphasize--some funds \nbecause the cost of these issues are supposed to be deducted from the \nreceipts, but I do not believe there are too many of us who are in a \nposition where we would want to vote against a stamp or anything else \nthat could assist AIDS research, diabetes research, Alzheimer's \ndisease, prostate cancer research, or organ and tissue donation. Many \nof us have devoted a great deal of our lives to those and other causes \nsuch as the World War II memorial and the National Battle Monuments \nCommission.\n  When the breast cancer research stamp was approved, I voted against \nit. I was one of the few who did. That created for me, and for others \nwho voted no, the prospect that somebody would then say I opposed funds \nfor breast cancer research, which obviously I do not. In a split \nsecond, I would have voted to increase the appropriation for breast \ncancer research by the amount of money which might have been raised by \nthis stamp so we could give to NIH an amount of money at least equal to \nwhat might be raised by such a stamp. Obviously, I am not opposed to \nadditional funds. Indeed, the opposite is true.\n  What does trouble me, however, is that we are now beginning a course \nwhich will politicize the issuance of stamps again in this country. We \nhad taken politics out of it by the creation of an advisory committee. \nFor 40 years this advisory committee, and this advisory committee \nalone, has decided and made the recommendation to the Postal Service \nwhat commemoratives will be issued. They have not issued any \nsemipostals nor were any issued by this country until the breast cancer \nresearch stamp was approved.\n  Now in this bill we have another good cause, money which would go to \nprograms aimed at reducing domestic violence. There is no doubt about \nthe validity of the cause. The problem is that we have no criteria, \nthat we do this ad hoc, helter-skelter.\n  We have already authorized one stamp, which I will get to in a \nmoment, that relates to grade crossing safety. This is on the calendar, \napproved by the Governmental Affairs Committee, not yet approved by the \nSenate. This is going to unleash a politicization process of the \nissuance of stamps which I do not believe will benefit this Nation.\n  I think it will be incredibly difficult for the Postal Service, which \ndoes not want us to require the issuance of semipostals. They are still \nsorting through the breast cancer research stamp costs. We should \nreauthorize the breast cancer research stamp because we have already \nauthorized the stamp and it has been printed, and unless we reauthorize \nit, then this program will run out. This is a very different issue from \nvoting for an additional issue, and the next, and the next.\n\n  I will spend a couple of minutes this afternoon talking about what \nhappened with another semipostal stamp which was proposed in a bill and \nwas approved by the committee. I did not vote for it\n\n[[Page S7606]]\n\nin the Governmental Affairs Committee, not because I oppose its cause, \nbut, again, for what this is going to unleash upon us in terms of \npolitics--issuance of stamps and using the issuance of stamps to raise \nmoney for causes which will then be vying against each other. I do not \nthink that is in anybody's interest.\n  The one example on which I want to focus for a few moments is a \nproposal which has already been approved by the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, and that is what is called the Look, Listen, and Live Stamp \nAct. That bill requires the Postal Service to issue a semipostal stamp \nfor an organization called Operation Lifesaver.\n  Operation Lifesaver is a nonprofit organization which is dedicated to \nhighway and rail safety through education. Operation Lifesaver seems to \nbe a fine organization, but it is not the only organization which is \ncommitted to preventing railroad casualties. As a matter of fact, \nrailway safety advocates are split on the issue of grade crossing \nsafety and the best method to prevent rail-related injuries. Operation \nLifesaver, for example, emphasizes safety through education, while \nother railway safety advocates promote safety by funding automatic \nlights and gates at railway crossings.\n  After the Governmental Affairs Committee reported this stamp \nproposal, railroad safety organizations contacted my office to \nrepresent their disagreement with the ``look, listen, and live stamp'' \nprimarily because of the emphasis that one organization, Operation \nLifesaver, puts on education and education only.\n  The president of a group called the Coalition for Safer Crossings \nwrote me the following letter:\n\n       Dear Senator Levin: I personally find Operation Lifesaver \n     spin on education appalling. Three and a half years ago, I \n     lost a very dear and close friend of mine at an unprotected \n     crossing in southwestern Illinois. Eric was nineteen. I \n     fought to close the crossing where Eric was killed and since \n     helped many families after the loss of a loved one through my \n     organization, the Coalition for Safer Crossings. And now \n     today, we are moving forward with other smaller organizations \n     to form a national organization to combat certain types of \n     education being put out by other groups and to help victims' \n     families and help change the trend of escalating collisions. \n     The National Railroad Safety Coalition is comprised of \n     families and friends of victims of railroad car collisions, \n     unlike Operation Lifesaver.\n\n  Again, Operation Lifesaver is the group that is going to receive the \nnet dollars that will be raised by the issuance of this ``look, listen, \nand live stamp.''\n  Then the head of this competing group says:\n\n       I personally and professionally oppose this measure. If the \n     United States Congress is truly concerned about this issue of \n     railroad crossing safety and is dead set on making stamps, \n     then you should make a railroad safety stamp not a Operation \n     Lifesaver stamp. And rather than have the money go to their \n     type of education, have it go towards the States funds for \n     grade crossing upgrades in that State. A matching dollar \n     scheme comes to mind from the State.\n\n  He concludes:\n\n       I am currently 23 years old. When I was in high school, I \n     received the same driver safety training regarding grade \n     crossings safety as my best friend Eric did. Eric is now \n     gone. The funds from this proposed stamp would not have \n     helped him. Now if this stamp would have been around prior to \n     1996 and funds were allocated to the State of Illinois for \n     hardware and a set of automatic lights and gates were \n     installed at this crossing in question I wouldn't be writing \n     you this letter today. I hope you understand the difference.\n\n  Mr. President, at the time that this stamp was approved in the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, I submitted minority views on this \nissue. In part, this is what I wrote just about a year ago this month:\n\n       For over 40 years, the U.S. Postal Service has relied on \n     the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee to review and select \n     stamp subjects that are interesting and educational. The \n     committee chooses the subjects of U.S. stamps using as its \n     criteria, 12 major guidelines, established about the time of \n     the Postal Reorganization Act. [They] have guided the \n     committee in its decisionmaking function for decades.\n       The tenth criteria guiding [their] selection makes \n     reference to semi-postal stamps, the type of stamp that the \n     Postal Service would be required to issue if the Look, \n     Listen, and Live Stamp Act were enacted. With respect to \n     semi-postals, the guidelines state, ``Stamps or postal \n     stationery items with added values, referred to as `semi-\n     postals,' shall not be issued. Due to the vast majority of \n     worthy fund-raising organizations in existence, it would be \n     difficult to single out specific ones to receive such \n     revenue. There is also a strong U.S. tradition of private \n     fund-raising for charities, and the administrative costs \n     involved in accounting for sales would tend to negate the \n     revenues derived.'' This position was also reflected in a . . \n     . letter from Postmaster General William Henderson.\n\n  He has also cautioned and urged our committee not to mandate the \nissuance of specific semipostals.\n  So I do not believe that we can and should be in the business of \ndeciding to promote one worthy charity over another, one specific \norganization over another. This stamp, the one that is now on the \ncalendar--not the one in this bill; the one on the calendar--for safety \nat railway crossings is, it seems to me, an example of a stamp that may \nnot be workable, and yet the full Governmental Affairs Committee has \nreported this bill out.\n  Then what are we to do? We are going to be presented with a number of \nproposals relative to semipostals. Many of our colleagues have \nintroduced bills. The bill before us has such a provision. I believe \nthe answer comes from Representative McHugh and Representative Fattah, \nwho are the chairman and the ranking member of the House Government \nReform Subcommittee on the Postal Service. They put their views in a \nbill, H.R. 4437, which passed the House of Representatives on July 17.\n  It gives the Postal Service the authority to issue semipostals. It \nrequires the Postal Service to establish regulations, before issuing \nany stamp, relating to, first, which office within the Postal Service \nshall be responsible for making decisions with respect to semipostals; \ntwo, what criteria and procedures shall be applied in making those \ndecisions; and, three, what limitations shall apply, such as whether \nmore than one semipostal will be offered at any one time.\n  The McHugh bill also requires the Postal Service to establish how the \ncosts incurred by the Postal Service as a result of any semipostal are \nto be computed, recovered, and kept to a minimum. One thing we learned \nfrom the breast cancer semipostal is that the Postal Service did not \nestablish an accurate accounting system for tracking the cost of \nsemipostals.\n  According to a recently released GAO report, ``Breast Cancer Research \nStamp, Millions Raised for Research, But Better Cost Recovery Criteria \nNeeded''--that is the title of the report--the Postal Service did not \ntrack all monetary or other resources used in developing and selling \nthe breast cancer research stamp. They kept track of some costs but \nwere not able to determine the full costs of developing and selling the \nstamp. Postal officials obviously should keep track of both revenues \nand their full costs so that the appropriate net can be determined for \ndelivery to that particular cause.\n\n  The McHugh bill is before this body. The McHugh bill, in addition to \nauthorizing the issuance of semipostals by the stamp advisory \ncommittee, also reauthorizes the breast cancer research stamp. It does \nboth things. I hope this body will take up this bill and adopt this \nkind of procedure in order to attempt to take this issue out of \npolitics and not put us in a position where we have to vote between a \nstamp raising money for AIDS research or diabetes research or \nAlzheimer's research or prostate cancer research, organ and tissue \ndonation research, the World War II Memorial, domestic violence, and on \nand on.\n  I doubt very much that we would want to vote no to any of those. Yet \nwe cannot possibly have all of them at once. The Postal Service cannot \npossibly handle the accounting, the delivery, the sale of all those \nstamps. They have urged us very strongly not to be authorizing and \nmandating the issuance of those stamps.\n  So I hope that when the bill comes before us, which I hope will be \nany time, we will reauthorize the breast cancer research stamp. Again, \neven though I voted against it, for the reasons I have given here this \nafternoon, nonetheless I think, given the fact that the stamps have \nbeen printed and that effort is already underway, and the huge number \nof people who have already been involved in promoting the sale, and the \nwomen and men from around this country who have gone out of their way \nto use that stamp are in\n\n[[Page S7607]]\n\nplace--they have been operating; they have been very successful, very \nproductive with millions of dollars that will be raised, the pluses of \ncontinuing to reauthorize that stamp, once it has been issued, and once \nthat effort is underway, outweigh the negatives, which I have outlined \nthis afternoon.\n  At the same time, I hope that the rest of the McHugh bill will be \nadopted by us so that we can put into place criteria which will make it \na lot easier for us to have a sensible system for the issuance of \nsemipostals.\n  Mr. President, on a matter that relates directly to this bill, \nbecause it is a Treasury bill, I want to just spend a few minutes \ntalking about the issue of the budget surplus, and the response of the \nCongress to that budget surplus. I want to use, as my text, and then \nintersperse some comments into it, a memorandum that the Director of \nthe Office of Management and Budget, Jacob Lew, wrote on the effect of \ncongressional legislative action on the budget surplus. This is what \nthe OMB Director wrote:\n\n       This memo is in response to your request that OMB assess \n     the effect of legislative action on the budget surplus. Over \n     the past six months, Congress has passed nine major tax cuts \n     resulting in a cost of $712 billion over ten years. Draining \n     this sum from the United States Treasury reduces the amount \n     of debt reduction we can accomplish, thereby increasing debt \n     service costs by $201 billion over ten years. Therefore, the \n     Congressional tax cuts passed to date will draw a total of \n     $913 billion from the projected surplus.\n       In addition, the Congressional majority has stated clearly \n     that its tax cuts to date represent only a ``down payment'' \n     in a long series of tax cuts it intends to realize. While \n     there has been little specificity about the size and nature \n     of the entire program, the full range of action taken by the \n     106th Congress, both last year and this, provides an \n     indication of the total impact of the Congressional tax cut \n     proposals on the surplus.\n       In the first session of the 106th Congress, the majority \n     passed one large measure, which included a variety of tax \n     cuts totaling $792 billion. Excluding certain individual tax \n     cuts which passed this year as well as last year (such as \n     elimination of the estate tax and the marriage penalty), the \n     cost of tax cuts passed last year amounts to $737 \n     billion, and the additional debt service amounts to $148 \n     billion for a total of $885 billion.\n\n  Jacob Lew goes on as follows:\n\n       The bill-by-bill approach to tax cuts in the absence of an \n     overall framework masks the full impact and risks of the \n     cumulative cost.\n\n  I will repeat that because that is the heart of the matter.\n\n       The bill-by-bill approach to tax cuts in the absence of an \n     overall framework masks the full impact and the risks of the \n     cumulative cost. In the absence of more specific indications \n     about the content and number of future tax cuts the \n     congressional majority has stated it plans to produce, we \n     have used the total costs associated with tax cuts from the \n     106th Congress as an illustration of Republican plans. If \n     their plans remain consistent with the past activity, the \n     full cost of this program would be:\n       --tax cuts of $1.44 trillion\n       --additional debt service of $349 billion\n       --for a total of $1.796 trillion.\n       The effect of such tax cuts would be to completely \n     eliminate the projected non-Social Security/Medicare budget \n     surplus at the end of ten years. Even by the more optimistic \n     projections the entire surplus would be drained. The most \n     recent CBO projections issued earlier this week estimate a \n     ten-year non-Social Security/Medicare surplus of $1.8 \n     trillion. OMB's recent projections estimate a ten-year non-\n     Social Security/Medicare surplus of $1.5 trillion. In either \n     case, because the costs of the tax cuts match or exceed the \n     projected budget surplus, there would be no funds available \n     for any of the nation's other pressing needs, including our \n     proposals to establish a new voluntary Medicare prescription \n     drug benefit, pay an additional $150 billion in debt \n     reduction to pay down the debt by 2012, expand health \n     coverage to more families, provide targeted tax cuts that \n     help America's working families with the cost of college \n     education, long-term care, child care and other needs, or \n     extend the life of Social Security and Medicare.\n\n  Those are the options we are going to be faced with in the next few \nmonths, whether or not we want to take this projected surplus of either \n$1.5 trillion or $1.8 trillion--we are only talking about the non-\nSocial Security, non-Medicare surplus--whether we want to take that \nsurplus, which the CBO estimates is $1.8 trillion and the OMB estimates \nis $1.5 trillion, and use that almost exclusively or exclusively for \nthe tax cuts which have been proposed, or whether we want to use a \nsignificant part of that surplus to pay down the national debt faster, \nto establish a new voluntary prescription drug benefit, to expand \nhealth coverage, to expand opportunity for college education, and to \nextend the life of Social Security and Medicare.\n  I want to put in the Record in a moment the list of the pending tax \ncuts in the 106th Congress which Jack Lew makes reference to, the $934 \nbillion, approximately, in the 10-year cost. These are bills which have \nbeen passed by one body or another or one committee or another in one \nbody: Marriage Penalty Conference Committee, $293 billion; Social \nSecurity tier 2 repeal, $117 billion; estate tax in the House $105 \nbillion; the Patients' Bill of Rights in the House, $69 billion; the \ncommunications excise tax, $55 billion; the Taxpayers Bill of Rights, \n$7 billion; then the subtraction for provisions in multiple bills and \nso forth. Then you have to add the interest costs of these tax cuts. \nThat comes out to be about $900 billion.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print this list in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                 PENDING TAX CUTS IN THE 106TH CONGRESS\n                 [10-year cost, in billions of dollars]\nTax Legislation (Body Passed):\n  Marriage Penalty (Conf.

Mr. President, there are problems with each of the major \ntax bills. I may spend a moment on each of those problems. On the \nestate tax bill, it has problems. There is an alternative which is a \nbetter alternative, which would help more people. For those relatively \nfew people who do pay an estate tax, the alternative Democratic plan \nwould provide immediate relief--100 percent relief to people who have \nless than $8 million per couple for family farms and small businesses; \ntotal and immediate relief for those people in the alternative plan.\n  The bill which has been adopted has a major problem in that it favors \nupper income individuals, the wealthiest among us, and most of its \nbenefits go to those people rather than the people who need this the \nmost, which are individuals and married couples who have estates that \nmight be, in the case of a family farm or small business, $8 million or \nless. But there is a bigger problem, whether we are talking about \nrepeal of the estate tax or the marriage penalty tax. And there--\nregarding the marriage penalty, we have an alternative as well which \nwould benefit a larger number of low and moderate income people with a \ngreater benefit instead of a group of people who are at the upper end \nof the income level. The major problem I have with these tax bills is \nthat when you put them all together, what it means is that we would not \nbe able to apply this surplus to reduction of the national debt.\n  I am out there, as all of us are, in our home States. I talk to \npeople and ask people in all the meetings I have: What do you primarily \nwant us to spend the surplus on? Do you want tax cuts--putting aside \nfor the moment whether they benefit upper income folks or benefit \nworking families, put aside that issue for the moment; that is a major \nissue--do you basically want us to take this $1.8 trillion and pay down \nthe national debt? Or do you want that to go in tax cuts?\n  Overwhelmingly, repeatedly, I hear back from people, they want us to \npay down the national debt. Whether we are talking about younger \npeople, middle-age people, older people, they all come to the same \nconclusion: No. 1, we can't be sure the surplus will be that large so \ndon't spend it all on anything, be it tax cuts or other programs. Spend \nmost of it on protecting the future economy of the United States. Spend \nmost of it on that $6 trillion debt that has been rung up--to reduce \nthe amount of that debt, to try to assure that the economy, which we \nnow have humming, will stay humming; that an economy which we finally \nhave at a\n\n[[Page S7608]]\n\npoint where we don't add to the national debt with annual deficits each \nyear, that is healthy in terms of interest rates and job creation and \nin low inflation, that that economy will be there for us next year, \nnext decade, next generation.\n  I believe that is what the American people overwhelmingly want us to \ndo. We can argue, and we should, and we can debate, and we should, \nwhich estate tax proposal is a better estate tax proposal. That is a \nlegitimate debate. We obviously have an alternative to the one that was \nadopted which is targeted to the people who need it the most, people \nwho have farms and small businesses and estates worth up to $8 million, \npeople who are still paying an estate tax even though it might mean in \nsome cases that they could lose that family farm. Our alternative \nprovides total relief to those families and immediate relief to those \nfamilies, unlike the one that was passed by the Republican majority \nwhich gives most of its cuts to the people who need it the least, \npeople who are in the higher brackets, higher asset levels, and phases \nit in and then only does it partially.\n  We should, and we do, debate those issues: Which alternative plans on \nthe estate tax or on the marriage penalty tax provide the fairest kind \nof tax relief to the people who need it the most. But the underlying \nissue, which is one I hope we will keep in mind, is whether or not we \nwant to commit this projected surplus of almost $2 trillion in 10 years \nto any of these proposals to the extent that we have. Be it tax cuts or \nbe it efforts to improve education or health care or what have you, it \nis my hope and belief that the greatest contribution we can make to our \nchildren and to their children is to protect this economy, to try to \nkeep an economy, which is now doing so well, healthy in future years, \nas it has been in the past few years. That means we need to protect \nthat surplus, not spend it; not use it for tax cuts on the assumption \nthat there is going to be $1.8 trillion or $1.5 trillion over the next \n10 years, because there is too much uncertainty in that, because our \npeople sense--and correctly--that we do not know for certain that that \nbudget surplus will in fact be there.\n\n  There has been recent public opinion polling which seems to me \nilluminating on this subject. When people are asked whether or not they \nwant to protect Social Security and Medicare and pay down the debt, or \nwhether or not they think passing a tax cut is the better way to go, 75 \npercent believe protecting Social Security and paying down the debt is \nthe most important priority we have right now. Only 23 percent favor \npassing tax cuts as an alternative. When asked the question of whether \nor not the trillion-dollar tax cut package that was passed last year, \nwithout a penny for Medicare, and whether or not the tax cuts that are \nbeing added this year to the same amount, still without a penny for \nMedicare, is the better way to go, 63 percent say no, 32 percent say \nyes.\n  So the public senses that with the surplus we have, the proportion we \nproject, the best thing we can do to protect our economy and the best \nthing we can do with that projected surplus is in fact to pay down the \ndebt, protect Medicare, and to target our efforts on some of the needs \nwe have as a country, rather than to provide for the kind of tax cuts \nthat we have seen the Republicans enact.\n  What I have said about the estate tax is also true relative to the \nmarriage penalty bill. We have two alternatives--the one that passed, \nbut we also have an alternative that did not pass, which provides \ntargeted, comprehensive relief and is fiscally more responsible because \nit leaves more for debt reduction and, therefore, overall is a better \nvalue for the American taxpayer. The alternative completely eliminates \nthe penalty in all of its forms, not just in a few, as the marriage tax \npenalty legislation we passed does. The Democratic alternative \neliminates it for couples earning up to $100,000, which is 80 percent \nof all married couples, and it costs $29 billion per year when fully \nphased in.\n  The plan that was adopted, the Republican plan, confers 40 percent of \nits benefits on taxpayers who currently suffer a penalty. In other \nwords, only 40 percent of the benefits of the Republican plan go to \ntaxpayers who currently actually suffer a penalty. The rest of the \npeople who get a benefit in the Republican plan either don't suffer a \npenalty--indeed they received a bonus when they got married--or are \nleft untouched one way or another. And the Republican plan addresses \nonly 3 of the 65 instances of the penalty in the Tax Code, whereas the \nDemocratic alternative plan addresses every place in the Tax Code where \nthe marriage penalty exists. And the Republican plan costs $40 billion \nwhen fully phased in as compared to $29 billion per year for the \nalternative Democratic plan.\n  So, again, it seems to me it is a pretty clear choice that we have: \nDo we want a plan that is targeted to people who earn under $100,000, \nthat confers benefits on people who are truly penalized when they are \nmarried, in terms of the taxes they pay, and a plan that does so at a \ncost significantly less than in the Republican plan that was adopted? \nOr do we want to adopt the more costly plan, most of the benefits of \nwhich go to people who are in the upper income brackets, and then do \nnot address totally the problem that exists for those people who do \nsuffer a tax penalty upon marriage?\n  The same thing is true with the overall tax cut that has been \nproposed. We have basically two alternatives that have been set forth \nto the American people, not yet put in the legislative form, but which \nhave been proposed by Governor Bush and Vice President Gore. According \nto the Citizens For Tax Justice, the distribution of benefits of the \nBush plan basically provides that 10 percent of the taxpayers get 60 \npercent--the upper 10 percent, the top 10 percent of taxpayers, get 60 \npercent of the benefits; the bottom 60 percent of the taxpayers get 12 \npercent of the benefits. That is the tax plan that has been proposed by \nGovernor Bush.\n\n  It would reduce revenues by $460 billion over the first 5 fiscal \nyears, and by $1.3 trillion over 9 fiscal years, plus an additional \n$265 billion in associated interest costs. That is an extraordinarily \nexpensive plan. We haven't seen that yet in legislative form, and I am \nnot sure we will. Nonetheless, the American people are again going to \nbe presented with very different approaches as to how we should use the \nsurplus.\n  Some people say, ``Senator, that is our money you are talking about; \nwhat is wrong with the tax cut?'' My answer is that it is our money, \nyour money. It is also our economy. It is also our Social Security \nprogram. It is also our Medicare program. It is also our education \nprogram. It is our health care program.\n  So the argument that this money belongs to the people of the United \nStates is clearly true. I think it is undeniable. I can't imagine \nanybody suggesting that anything in the Treasury is anything but the \nproperty of the people of the United States. But the other half of \nthat, which is too often left out, is that the economy, which is now \nhealthy, belongs to the people of the United States. They have made it \npossible, through their work, for us to have a strong economy. Keeping \nthat economy healthy is also the job of this Congress, as well as the \njob of the people of the United States.\n  The Social Security system, which has made such a difference for so \nmany that the poverty rate among seniors is now 5 percent, compared to \nthe poverty rate among children, which is 20 percent, mainly because of \nthe existence of Social Security--that program belongs to the people of \nthe United States. Protecting that program is also our responsibility. \nSo to say that, yes, the surplus belongs to the people is true. But the \nMedicare program, Social Security program, health care program, \neducation program also belong to the people of the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss \nmoving to the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill.\n  I agree with the Majority Leader and others who have come to the \nfloor this year to insist that we do the people's business, and that \nthe people's business means completing all of the appropriations bills.\n  There are several very important amendments that will be proposed to \nthis legislation, and we must give them the time and consideration they \ndeserve. I may well vote against the\n\n[[Page S7609]]\n\nTreasury-Postal appropriations bill in the end, but I recognize the \nimportance of taking it up, considering it, and getting it done.\n  We have got to take care of the unfinished business.\n  We have more appropriations bills to consider, and we have other \nbusiness as well, as my colleagues are well aware.\n  I find it interesting to look at some of the other measures we have \nconsidered, and still might consider, this year.\n  I am talking about priorities--what we get done on this floor, and \nwhat gets ignored.\n  As I said, it is essential that we pass these appropriations bills--\nthey are the core of the people's business, because they keep the \ngovernment up and running.\n  But beyond bills like Treasury-Postal, what are we choosing to do?\n  Recently, we chose to consider a repeal of the estate tax. As I said \nduring that debate, the estate tax affects only the wealthiest \nproperty-holders. In 1997, only 42,901 estates paid the tax. That's the \nwealthiest 1.9 percent. People are already exempt from the tax in 98 \nout of 100 cases. Let me repeat that: Already, under current law, 98 \nout of 100 do not pay any estate tax.\n  The Republican estate tax repeal would give the wealthiest 2,400 \nestates--the ones that pay now half the estate tax--an average tax cut \nof $3.4 million each. And remember, 98 out of 100 people would get \nzero, nothing, from this estate tax cut.\n  Now, this doesn't sound like something most Americans are clamoring \nfor.\n  It is of no use to most Americans, in fact. But it is of use to a \nvery small--but wealthy--group of people.\n  Those who are wealthy enough to be subject to estate taxes have great \npolitical power.\n  They can make unlimited political contributions, and they are \nrepresented in Washington by influential lobbyists that have pushed \nhard to get the estate tax bill to the floor.\n  The estate tax is one of those issues where political money seems to \nhave an impact on the legislative outcome. That's why I recently Called \nthe Bankroll on some of the interests behind that bill, to give my \ncolleagues and the public a sense of the huge amount of money at \nstake--not taxes, but political contributions.\n  We considered that bill not because it affected the vast majority of \nAmericans, but because it directly affected the pocketbooks of a \nwealthy few.\n  A similar point can be made about another piece of legislation, the \nH-1B bill.\n  We haven't considered it yet, but we may well yet, and so far a \nterrific effort has been made by both sides to see it taken up.\n\n  Why? Why, when we have more appropriations bills to consider, when we \nhave the real people's business to do, are we pushing so hard to take \nup H-1B?\n  Because the high-tech industry wants this bill to get done.\n  In the case of H-1B, I'm not addressing the merits of the \nlegislation-- I am not necessarily opposed to raising the level of H-1B \nvisas. Instead I want to point out what is on our agenda and why? Why \nis it that we have this set of legislation as part of our agenda?\n  The high tech industry wants to get this bill passed, and they have \nthe political contributions to back it up.\n  American Business for Legal Immigration, a coalition which formed to \nfight for an increase in H-1B visas, offers a glimpse of the financial \nmight behind proponents of H-1Bs. ABLI is chock full of big political \ndonors, and not just from one industry, but from several different \nindustries that have an interest in bringing more high-tech workers \ninto the U.S.\n  Price Waterhouse Coopers, pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly, \ntelecommunications giant and former Baby Bell BellSouth, and software \ncompany Oracle, to name just a few.\n  All have given hundreds of thousands of dollars in this election \ncycle alone, and they want us to pass H-1B.\n  We all know this.\n  This is standard procedure these days for wealthy interests --you \nhave got to pay to play on the field of politics. You've got to pony up \nfor quarter-million dollar soft money contributions and half-million \ndollar issue ad campaigns, and anyone who can't afford the price of \nadmission is going to be left out in the cold.\n  I Call the Bankroll to point out what goes on behind the scenes on \nvarious bills--the millions in PAC and soft money that wealthy donors \ngive, and what they expect to get in return.\n  And yet we don't do anything about it.\n  We took a small but important step toward better disclosure of the \nactivity of wealthy donors earlier this summer when we passed the 527 \ndisclosure bill.\n  But there is a great deal more to do.\n  We are going to keep pushing until we address the other gaping \nloopholes in the campaign finance law.\n  Right now, wealthy interests have the power to help set the political \nagenda.\n  Wealthy interests spend unlimited amounts of money to push for bills \nwhich serve the interests of the wealthy few at the expense of most \nAmericans.\n  We have got to question why consider some bills on this floor while \nwe ignore so many crucial issues the American people care about--like \nincreasing the minimum wage and supporting working families.\n  But instead we are left with an agenda that looks like wealthy \nAmerica's ``to do'' list.\n  How does it happen, Mr. President?--It's all about access, and access \nis all about money.\n  Both parties openly promise, and even advertise, that big donors get \nbig access to party leaders.\n  Weekend retreats and other ``special events'' where wealthy \nindividuals have the chance to talk about what they want done--whether \nthat might be a repeal of the estate tax, or that their company wants \nto see the H-1B bill passed this year.\n  Needless to say, that is the kind of access most Americans can't even \ndream of.\n  And I have to wonder why we aren't doing anything about that.\n  I am all for the doing people's business, and right now the people's \nbusiness should be the Treasury-Postal Appropriations bill, and that's \nwhy I support the motion to proceed, even though I may well vote \nagainst the underlying bill in the end.\n  But I don't think that an issue like the repeal of the estate tax is \nthe people's business--not 98 out of every hundred people, anyway.\n  We need to get at the heart of what is wrong here.\n  Our priorities are warped by the undue influence of money in this \nchamber.\n  We have got to change our priorities, and do it now, by putting \ncampaign finance reform back on the agenda.\n  Because the best way to loosen the grip of wealthy interests is to \nclose the loophole that swallowed the law: soft money.\n  Soft money has exploded over the past few years.\n  Soft money is the culprit that brought us the scandals of 1996--the \nselling of access and influence in the White House and to the Congress. \nThe auction of the Lincoln Bedroom, of Air Force One. The White House \ncoffees. All of this came from soft money because without soft money, \nthe parties would not have to come up with ever more enticing offers to \nget the big contributors to open their checkbooks.\n  Soft money also brings us, time and time again, questions about the \nintegrity and the impartiality of the legislative process. Everything \nwe do is under scrutiny and subject to question because major \nindustries and labor organizations are giving our political parties \nsuch large amounts of money. Whether it is telecommunications \nlegislation, the bankruptcy bill, defense spending, or health care, \nsomeone out there is telling the public, often with justification in my \nview, that the Congress cannot be trusted to do what is best for the \npublic interest because the major affected industries are giving us \nmoney.\n\n  For more than a year now, I have highlighted the influence of money \non the legislative process through the Calling of the Bankroll. And the \nreally big money, that many believe has a really big influence here, is \nsoft money. We have to clean our campaign finance house and the best \nplace to start is by getting rid of soft money. Let's play by the rules \nagain in this country. With soft money there are no rules, no limits. \nBut we can restore some sanity to our campaign finance\n\n[[Page S7610]]\n\nsystem. When I came to the Senate, I will confess, I didn't even really \nknow what soft money was. After a tough race against a very well \nfinanced opponent who spent twice as much as I did, I was mostly \nconcerned with the difficulties that people who are not wealthy have in \nrunning for office. My interest in campaign finance reform derived from \nthat experience. Soft money has exploded since I arrived here, with far \nreaching consequences for our elections and the functioning of the \nCongress. Now I truly believe that if we can do nothing else on \ncampaign finance reform, we must stop this cancerous growth of soft \nmoney before it consumes us.\n  I will take a few minutes to describe to my colleagues the growth of \nsoft money in recent years. It is a frightening story. Soft money first \narrived on the scene of our national elections in the 1980 elections, \nafter a 1978 FEC ruling opened the door for parties to accept \ncontributions from corporations and unions, who are barred from \ncontributing to federal elections. The best available estimate is that \nthe parties raised under $20 million in soft money in that cycle. By \nthe 1992 election, the year I was elected to this body, soft money \nfundraising by the two major parties had risen to $86 million. Eighty-\nsix million dollars is clearly a lot of money; it was nearly as much as \nthe $110 million that the two presidential candidates were given in \n1992 in public financing from the U.S. Treasury. And there was real \nconcern about how that money was spent. Despite the FEC's decision that \nsoft money could be used for activities such as get out the vote and \nvoter registration campaigns without violating the federal election \nlaw's prohibition on corporate and union contributions in connection \nwith federal elections, the parties sent much of their soft money to be \nspent in states where the Presidential election between George Bush and \nBill Clinton was close, or where there were key contested Senate races.\n  Still, even then, even with that tremendous increase in the use of \nsoft money, soft money was far from the central issue in our debate \nover campaign finance reform in 1993 and 1994. In 1995, when Senator \nMcCain and I first introduced the McCain-Feingold bill, our bill \nincluded a ban on soft money, but it was not particularly controversial \nand no one paid that much attention to it at that time.\n  Then came the 1996 election, and the enormous explosion of soft \nmoney, fueled by the parties' decision to use the money on phony issue \nads supporting their presidential candidates. Remember those ads that \neveryone thought were Clinton and Dole ads but were actually run by the \nparties? That was the public debut of soft money on the national scene. \nThe total soft money fundraising skyrocketed as a result. Three times \nas much soft money was raised in 1996 as in 1992. Let me say that \nagain--soft money tripled in one election cycle. The reason was the \ninsatiable desire of the parties for money to run phony issue ads, and \nthat desire has only increased since 1996. Both political parties are \nraising unprecedented amounts of soft money for ad campaigns that are \nalready underway this year. Soft money is financing our presidential \ncampaigns, and this Congress stands by doing nothing about it.\n  Fred Wertheimer, a long time advocate of campaign finance reform said \nit well in an op-ed in the Washington Post on Monday: He wrote,\n\n       Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush and their \n     presidential campaigns are living a lie. The lie is this: \n     that the TV ads now being run in presidential battleground \n     states across America are political party ``issue ads.'' In \n     fact, everyone--and I mean everyone--knows that these ads are \n     presidential campaign ads being run for the unequivocal \n     purpose of directly influencing the presidential election.\n\n  Wertheimer goes on to say:\n\n       The ``issue ad'' campaigns now underway blatantly promote \n     and feature Gore and Bush, are designed and controlled by the \n     Gore and Bush presidential campaigns and are targeted to run \n     in key battleground states. The political parties are merely \n     conduits for the scheme and cover for the lie.\n\n  He continues:\n\n       What's the significance of all of this? Well, for starters \n     we are living this lie in the election for the most important \n     office in the world's oldest democracy. The lie will result \n     in some $100 million or more in huge corrupting contributions \n     being illegally used by Gore and Bush in the 2000 \n     presidential election. (Many millions more will be illegally \n     used in the 2000 congressional races.)\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of Mr. \nWertheimer's article, ``Gore, Bush, and the Big Lie'' be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 24, 2000]\n\n                      Gore, Bush, And the Big Lie\n\n                          (By Fred Wertheimer)\n\n       Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush and their \n     presidential campaigns are living a lie. The lie is this: \n     that the TV ads now being run in presidential battleground \n     states across America are political party ``issue ads.'' In \n     fact, everyone--and I mean everyone--knows that these ads are \n     presidential campaign ads being run for the unequivocal \n     purpose of directly influencing the presidential election.\n       The presidential campaigns and political parties know it, \n     the media know it and so do the viewers of the ads, which are \n     indistinguishable from other presidential campaign ads being \n     run.\n       As such, the ``issue ads'' are illegal, because, among \n     other things, they are being financed with tens of millions \n     of dollars of soft-money contributions that the law says \n     cannot be used to influence a federal election. The ``issue \n     ad'' campaigns now underway blatantly promote and feature \n     Gore and Bush, are designed and controlled by the Gore and \n     Bush presidential campaigns are targeted to run in key \n     battleground states. The political parties are merely \n     conduits for the scheme and cover for the lie.\n       What's the significance of all of this? Well, for starters \n     we are living this lie in the election for the most important \n     office in the world's oldest democracy. The lie will result \n     in some $100 million or more in huge corrupting contributions \n     being illegally used by Gore and Bush in the 2000 \n     presidential election. (Many millions more will be illegally \n     used in the 2000 congressional races.)\n       The lie makes a mockery of the common-sense intelligence of \n     voters and the honesty of the presidential race. And, to \n     date, no one in authority is prepared to do anything about \n     it.\n       How did it happen that this lie came to rest at the core of \n     our national elections? Well, in good part we have \n     Presidential Clinton to thank. It was Clinton who, more than \n     anyone else, developed and ``perfected'' the lie, and the \n     legal fiction on which it is based.\n       Soft money had been a problem prior to 1995, but no \n     presidential candidate had ever tried to use soft money to \n     finance a TV ad campaign promoting his candidacy. That's not \n     because politicians weren't clever enough to think of this, \n     but because everyone understood it was illegal.\n       Then President Clinton and his staff invented a scam for \n     the 1996 election: They would use the Democratic Party as a \n     front for running a ``second'' presidential campaign. This \n     $50 million second campaign would use soft money--funds that \n     the law does not allow in a presidential campaign--to finance \n     Clinton campaign ads that would be labeled Democratic Party \n     ``issue ads.''\n       It didn't take long for the Republican presidential \n     candidate, Bob Dole, to follow suit. Today, four years later, \n     the ``issue ads'' lie is standard political practice in \n     presidential and congressional races.\n       The lie is built on the legal fiction that under Supreme \n     Court rulings, political party ads are not covered by federal \n     campaign finance laws unless they contain such magic words as \n     ``vote for'' or ``vote against'' a specific federal \n     candidate. That's supposed to be true even if the party ads \n     promote a specific federal candidate and even if the ads are \n     coordinated with or controlled by the candidate.\n       But the reality is that neither the Supreme Court nor any \n     other federal court has ever said anything of the kind \n     regarding political party ads. When the Supreme Court \n     established the ``magic words'' test in Buckley v. Valeo, it \n     made explicit that it was for outside groups and non-\n     candidates only and did not apply to communications by \n     candidates or political parties. And in any case, the ``magic \n     words'' test is not applicable when an ad campaign is \n     conducted in coordination with a federal candidate, as a \n     Washington federal district court confirmed last year.\n       The Justice Department, in its failure to pursue the 1996 \n     Clinton soft-money ads, never found the ads to be legal. \n     Instead, Attorney General Reno closed the case based on the \n     Clinton campaign's reliance on its lawyers' advice, which she \n     said was ``sufficient to negate any criminal intent on their \n     part.''\n       The general counsel of the Federal Election Commission did \n     find that the 1996 soft-money ads were illegal. The \n     commission, however, by a 3 to 3 tie vote, refused to proceed \n     with an enforcement action. Thus we are left today with \n     enforcement authorities that refuse to act against these soft \n     money ads and, at the same time, refuse to say they are \n     legal. And the lie goes on.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the big lie led to the transformation of \nour two great political parties into soft money machines. And what was \nthe effect of this explosion of soft money, other than the millions of \ndollars available for ads supporting presidential candidates who had \nagreed to\n\n[[Page S7611]]\n\nrun their campaigns on equal and limited grants from the federal \ntaxpayers? Soft money is raised primarily from corporate interests who \nhave a legislative axe to grind. And so the explosion of soft money \nbrought an explosion of influence and access in this Congress and in \nthe Administration.\n  Here are some of the companies in this exclusive group. We know they \nhave a big interest in what the Congress does--Philip Morris, Joseph \nSeagram & Sons, RJR Nabisco, Walt Disney, Atlantic Richfield, AT, \nFederal Express, MCI, the Association of Trial Lawyers, the NEA, Lazard \nFreres & Co., Anheuser Busch, Eli Lilly, Time Warner, Chevron Corp., \nArcher Daniel's Midland, NYNEX, Textron Inc., Northwest Airlines. It's \na who's who of corporate America, Mr. President. They are investors in \nthe United States Congress and no one can convince the American people \nthat these companies get no return on their investment.\n  They have a say, much too big a say, in what we do. It's that simple, \nand it's that disturbing. That's why our priorities are so out of \nwhack, Mr. President. We should be going to the Treasury-Postal \nappropriations bill, and that's why I support the motion to proceed, \ndespite the fact that I may vote against it when all is said and done. \nI recognize we have to focus on what people want, not what wealthy \ninterests want.\n  As I said when I first began Calling the Bankroll last year, we know, \nif we are honest with ourselves, that campaign contributions are \ninvolved in virtually everything that this body does. Campaign money is \nthe 800-pound gorilla in this chamber every day that nobody talks \nabout, but that cannot be ignored. All around us, and all across the \ncountry, people notice the gorilla. Studies come out on a weekly basis \nfrom a variety of research organizations and groups that lobby for \ncampaign finance reform that show what we all know: The agenda of the \nCongress seems to be influenced by campaign money. But in our debates \nhere, we are silent about that influence, and how it corrodes our \nsystem of government.\n  I have chosen not to remain silent, but I know there are those who \nwish that I would stop putting the spotlight on facts that reflect \npoorly on our system, and in turn on the Senate, and on both the major \npolitical parties.\n  I wish our campaign finance system wasn't such an embarrassment.\n  I wish wealthy interests with business before this body didn't have \nunlimited ability to give money to our political parties through the \nsoft money loophole, but they do.\n  I wish these big donors weren't able to buy special access to our \npolitical leaders through meetings and weekend retreats set up by the \nparties, but they can.\n  I wish fundraising skills and personal wealth weren't some of the \nmost sought-after qualities in a candidate for Congress today, but \neveryone knows that they are.\n  Most of all I wish that these facts didn't paint a picture of \nGovernment so corrupt and so awash in the influence of money that the \nAmerican people, especially young people, have turned away from their \ngovernment in disgust, but every one of us knows that they have.\n  It is our unwillingness to discuss it or even acknowledge the \ninfluence of this money in this body that makes it even worse.\n  It goes on and on, and it just gets worse.\n  Last year was another record-breaker in the annals of soft money \nfundraising--the national political party committees raised a record \n$107.2 million during the 1999 calendar year--81 percent more than they \nraised during the last comparable presidential election period in 1995, \naccording to Common Cause.\n  An 81 percent increase is astounding, especially considering that the \nyear it's compared with--1995, the last off-election year preceding a \npresidential election--which was itself a record-breaking year for soft \nmoney fundraising.\n  This year one of the most notable fundraising trends hits very close \nto home, or to the dome, as the case may be: Congressional campaign \ncommittees raised more than three times as much soft money during 1999 \nas they raised during 1995--$62 million compared to $19.4 million.\n  That is a huge increase, Mr. President.\n  Three times as much soft money--much of it raised by members of \nCongress.\n  Now the latest news reports show record-breaking soft money figures \nfor the first quarter of this year as well.\n  How should the public view this?\n  What can we expect them to think as Members of Congress ask for these \nunlimited contributions from corporations, unions and wealthy \nindividuals, and then turn around and vote on legislation that directly \naffects those donors that they just asked for all this money?\n  Frankly, it is all the more reason for Americans to question our \nintegrity, whether those donations have an impact on our decisions or \nnot.\n  They question our integrity, and we give them reason. Why aren't we \ngetting their business done? I say let's get the business done--let's \nagree to move to Treasury-Postal, whether we'll support that bill in \nthe end or not. And then let's move on to the other pressing issues \nbefore us--not tax cuts for the wealthy, but real priorities like \ncampaign finance reform.\n  Let's put a stop to the soft money arms race that escalates every \nday, and involves more and more Members of Congress.\n  I do not know how many of my colleagues are actually picking up the \nphones across the street in our party committee headquarters to ask \ncorporate CEOs for soft money contributions. But no one here can deny \nthat our parties are asking us to do this. It is now part of the \nparties' expectations that a United States Senator will be a big \nsolicitor of soft money.\n  Consider the soft money raised in recent off-year elections. In 1994, \nthe parties raised a total of $101.7 million. Only about $18.5 million \nof that amount was raised by the congressional and senatorial campaign \ncommittees. In 1998, the most recent election, soft money fundraising \nmore than doubled to $224.4 million. And $107 million of that total was \nraised by the congressional and senatorial campaign committees. That's \nnearly half of the total soft money raised by the parties.\n  Half the soft money that the parties raised in the last election went \nto the campaign committees for members of Congress, as opposed to the \nnational party committees. And I and many of my colleagues know from \npainful experience that much of that money ended up being spent on \nphony issue ads in Senate races. The corporate money that has been \nbanned in federal elections since 1907 is being raised by Senators and \nspent to try to influence the election of Senators. This has to stop.\n  The growth of soft money has made a mockery of our campaign finance \nlaws. It has turned Senators into panhandlers for huge contributions \nfrom corporate patrons. And it has multiplied the number of corporate \ninterests who have a claim on the attention of members and the work of \nthis institution.\n  I truly believe that we must do much more than ban soft money to fix \nour campaign finance system. But if there is one thing more than any \nother that must be done now it is to ban soft money. Otherwise the soft \nmoney loophole will completely obliterate the Presidential public \nfunding system, and lead to scandals that will make what we saw in 1996 \nseem quaint. Virtually no one in this body has stepped up to defend \nsoft money. So let's get rid of it once and for all. Now is the time. \nLet's move to the Treasury-Postal Appropriations bill, vote yes or no, \nand then let's do what we have to get done.\n  When we define what we need to get done this year, let's get serious. \nIt is not the estate tax, and it's not the H-1B bill. It's banning soft \nmoney.\n  Now there is more support for banning soft money than ever before.\n  I think it is important to talk on this floor about just who those \nAmericans are who want to clean up this campaign finance system, \nbecause today calls for reform are coming from an incredible range of \npeople in this country, including some very unlikely places.\n  One of the most interesting places you can find demands for reform is \ncorporate America, where one group of corporate executives, tired of \nbeing shaken down for bigger and bigger contributions, has said enough \nis enough.\n\n[[Page S7612]]\n\n  This organization, called the Committee for Economic Development, \nissued a report and proposal urging reform, including the elimination \nof soft money.\n  One might guess that this group of people, who are in the position to \nuse the soft money system to their advantage, would not dream of \ncalling for reform.\n  But the soft money system cuts both ways--it not only allows for \nlegalized bribery of the political parties, it also allows legalized \nextortion of soft money donors, who are being asked to give more and \nmore money every election cycle to fuel the parties' bottomless \nappetite for soft money.\n  But it isn't just weariness at being shaken down that led CED members \nto call for reform of our broken campaign finance system. Let me quote \nfrom the CED report, which stated their concern so well:\n\n       Given the size and source of most soft money contributions, \n     the public cannot help but believe that these donors enjoy \n     special influence and receive special favors. The suspicion \n     of corruption diminishes public confidence in government.\n\n  The bigger soft money contributions get--and the amounts are truly \nskyrocketing--the more damaging the effect on the public's perception \nof our democracy.\n  I applaud CED for its commitment to restoring the public's faith in \ngovernment by calling for a soft money ban.\n  And CED is just one part of a growing movement to call on this body \nto clean up our campaign finance system.\n  One of the most inspiring leaders of the movement for reform is not \nany business leader, or political figure for that matter. She is a \ngreat grandmother from Dublin, New Hampshire named Doris Haddock. \nDoris, known affectionately as Granny D, walked clear across the United \nStates at age 90 to insist that Congress pay attention to reform \nissues.\n  She walked across mountains and desert, in sweltering heat and \nfreezing cold, to make her point. And along the way she inspired \nthousands of others to speak up about the corrupting influence of money \nin politics, and demand action from Congress. I was proud to have her \nsupport for the McCain-Feingold bill, and I am thrilled to have such a \ndevoted ally on this issue.\n  The fight for reform is also gaining tremendous strength from \nreligious organizations that are reaching out to educate and mobilize \ntheir congregations about the issue.\n  Support from religious organizations includes: The Episcopal Church, \nChurch Women United, the Lutheran Office for Governmental Affairs, the \nEvangelical Lutheran Church of America, the Church of the Brethren's \nWashington Office, the Mennonite Central Committee's Washington Office, \nthe National Council of the Churches of Christ in the USA, the Union of \nAmerican Hebrew Congregations, the United Church of Christ's Office for \nChurch in Society, the United Methodist Church's General Board of \nChurch and Society, and NETWORK--a national Catholic social justice \nlobby.\n  Reform has the vital support of environmental groups like the \nEnvironmental Defense Fund, Friends of the Earth and The Sierra Club, \nand the backing of seniors groups like AARP and the Gray Panthers.\n  The support for reform in this country is strong, it is vocal, and is \ntruly broad-based. We also have the support of consumer watchdogs like \nthe Consumer Federation of America, health organizations like the \nAmerican Heart Association, children's groups such as the Children's \nDefense Fund, and of course the support of groups like Common Cause and \nPublic Citizen, which have been fighting a terrific fight against the \nundue influence of money in politics for decades.\n  And I could go on. We are talking about people from every walk of \nlife, every income level and every political affiliation. But they all \nhave one simple thing in common: They are demanding an end to the soft \nmoney system that has made a mockery of our campaign finance laws, has \ndeepened public cynicism about this body, and darkened the public \nperception of our democracy.\n  The public is watching us right now. That is why I want us to move to \nthe Treasury-Postal Appropriations bill, whether we support it or not--\nso that they can have faith that we are doing what we should be doing. \nNot serving wealthy interests, but doing their business, and doing it \nresponsibly.\n  And being responsible means acting on campaign finance reform.\n  That is what people want--their voices can be heard loud and clear in \npolls on the campaign finance issue:\n  Two out of three Americans think money has an ``excessive influence'' \non elections and government policy, according to Committee for Economic \nDevelopment's March 1999 report on campaign finance reform.\n\n  Another CED poll question revealed that two-thirds of the public \nthink ``their own representative in Congress would listen to the views \nof outsiders who made large political contributions before a \nconstituent's views'';\n  74.5 percent of respondents believe the Government is pretty much run \nby a few big interests looking out for themselves, according to a poll \nfrom the Center for Policy Attitudes;\n  78 percent of respondents believe ``the current set of laws that \ncontrol congressional campaign funding needs reform,'' in a Hotline \npoll.\n  These numbers are even more disturbing than the numbers of the soft \nmoney donations themselves.\n  These numbers tell us that it's a given today that people think the \nworst of us and the work we do--they believe that we are on the take, \nand who could possibly blame them?\n  What is it that they do not understand, that they are misinterpreting \nabout this system and how it affects us? Nothing; the public has not \nmissed a thing.\n  The public has got it exactly right. It is this body that has it \nwrong every time a minority of my colleagues block the majority of the \nSenate and will of the American people by trying to kill reform.\n  The public deserves a Congress that can respond to the concerns of \nall Americans, not a wealthy few.\n  The public deserves a responsible Congress that does its job by \nmoving to the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill, whether we choose to \nvote yes or no, and the same goes for the other remaining approps bills \nthat deserve our attention.\n  Most of all, the public deserves a Congress that can set priorities \nthat represent the concerns of the American people, and not just soft \nmoney donors, not just those who can afford to attend weekend getaways \nwith party leadership, and not just those who have estates of more than \n$100 million dollars.\n  That is our challenge. Let's address the people's real priorities. \nLet's do the people's business, and let's get started right now.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Is there further debate on the motion?\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Under the rules, once a quorum is called off, if nobody \nseeks the floor, is it the requirement that the Chair put the question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, do I have the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I simply cannot understand what is going on \nhere. I wish someone would tell me. I think we had a unanimous vote a \nlittle earlier here on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to \nproceed to the consideration of the Treasury-Postal Service \nappropriations bill.\n  Why don't we vote? Why don't we vote?\n  As the ranking member on the Appropriations Committee, I can say to \nmy colleagues that Senator Ted Stevens and I--the chairman and I--and \nthe various chairmen and ranking members of the subcommittees on \nAppropriations have worked hard--have worked hard--to bring these \nappropriations bills to the Senate floor. We need\n\n[[Page S7613]]\n\nto get on with acting on these appropriations bills so that we can send \nthem to the President.\n  I can tell you what is going to happen. I have seen it happen all too \noften in recent years. We don't get the appropriations bills down to \nthe President one by one, so that he can sign them or veto them, which \nhe has a right to do. What we do is delay and delay and delay. As a \nresult, when the time comes that the leaders and Senators have their \nbacks to the wall, and there is a big rush on to finalize the work so \nSenators can go home and the Senate can adjourn sine die, then \neverything is crammed into one big bill, one omnibus bill.\n  I am telling you, you would be amazed at what happens in the \nconferences. You would be amazed to see what occurs in those \nconferences. Entire bills are sometimes put into the conference \nreport--entire bills, bills that may or may not have passed either \nHouse. And the administration is there also. The executive branch has \nits representatives there. They are there for the purpose of getting \nadministration measures or items that the executive branch wants put \ninto those conference reports. The items may not have had a word of \ndebate in either House. Neither House will have had an opportunity to \noffer amendments on bills or to debate measures, and yet those measures \nwill be put, lock, stock, and barrel, into the conference reports.\n  Then the conference report comes back to the Senate, where Senators \ncannot vote on amendments to that conference report. So Senators, as a \nresult, have no opportunity to debate these matters that are crammed \ninto the conference reports in those conferences. They will have had no \nopportunity to debate them. They will have had no opportunity to amend \nthem. They will have had no opportunity to vote on parts thereof. Yet \nSenators in this Chamber are confronted, then, with one package, and \nyou take it or you leave it. You vote for it or you vote against it.\n\n  We have experienced that on a number of occasions. When we were \nconsidering the fiscal year 1997 appropriations, we had a conference \nreport on the Defense Appropriations Bill and five additional \nappropriations bills were crammed into that conference report in \nconference, five appropriations bills. I believe two of them had never \nbeen taken up in the Senate. I believe two of them had had some debate, \nhad been brought up, but had not been finally acted upon.\n  I intend at a future time to have all of this material researched so \nI can speak to it. Today, I recall there were five appropriations bills \ncrammed into that conference report on the DOD Appropriations Bill. It \nwas brought back to the Senate where Senators were unable to amend it \nand have votes on parts of it. And if Senators think that was bad, in \nfiscal year 1999, eight different appropriations bills were put into \nthe final omnibus package. In addition thereto, a tax bill was put into \nthat package in the conference. I believe that tax bill involved about \n$9.2 billion. That was put into the conference report. It had never had \na day, an hour, or a minute of debate in this Senate. There were no \namendments offered to it. Eight appropriations bills and a tax bill \nwere all wrapped into one conference report in FY 1999, tied with a \nlittle ribbon, and Senators were confronted with having to vote for or \nagainst, that conference report--take it or leave it!\n  That was right at the end of the session when many Senators wanted to \ngo home. They had town meetings scheduled; they wanted to go home. When \nthat kind of circumstance arises, we are faced with a situation of \nhaving to vote on a bill that may contain thousands of pages which we \nhave not had an opportunity to read. As I remember, there were 3,980 \npages in that conference report. Imagine that. If the people back home \nknew what we were doing to them, they would run us all out of town on a \nrail. And we would be entitled to that honor, the way we do business \nhere. All we do is carry on continual war in this body, continual war, \neach side trying to get the ups on the other side. It isn't the \npeople's business we are concerned with. It is who can get the best of \nwhom in the partisan battles that go on in this Chamber.\n  A lot of new Members come over from the House where they are \naccustomed, I suppose, to being told by their leaders what to do and \nhow to do. Others come here fresh from the stump. I suppose they feel \nthis is the way it has always been done. They don't know how it used to \nbe done. They don't know that there was a day when we used to have \nconferences, and it was the rule that only items could be discussed in \nconference which had passed one or the other of the two bodies. Nothing \ncould be put into a conference report that had not had action in one or \nthe other of the two bodies. Otherwise, a point of order would lie \nagainst it.\n  I can assure you, those of you who are not on the Appropriations \nCommittee, you ought to see what goes on in the conferences. Bills that \nhave never passed either body, measures that have never passed either \nbody, measures, in many instances, which are only wanted by the \nadministration, are brought to that conference and are crammed into \nthat conference report. The conference report comes back to the Senate. \nIt is unamendable, and we have to take it or leave it. That is no way \nto do business.\n  I regret that it has come to this, and we are getting ready to do it \nagain. I see the handwriting on the wall.\n\n  Those of you who have read the book of Daniel will remember \nBelshazzar having a feast with 1,000 of his lords. They drank out of \nthe vessels that had been taken from the temple in Jerusalem and \nbrought to Babylon. And as they were eating and drinking and having \nfun, Belshazzar saw a hand appear over on the wall near the \ncandlestick. And he saw the handwriting: mene, mene, tekel, upharsin. \nSo he sent for his wise men, his astrologers, and wanted them to tell \nhim what this writing meant. They couldn't do it. But the Queen told \nBelshazzar that there was a young man in the kingdom who could indeed \nunravel this mystery. As a result, Daniel was sent for. He told the \nKing what was meant by the handwriting on the wall: ``God hath numbered \nthy kingdom, and finished it. Thou art weighed in the balances, and art \nfound wanting. Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and the \nPersians.'' And that night, Belshazzar was slain and the Medes and the \nPersians took the kingdom.\n  I see the handwriting on the wall: mene, mene, tekel, upharsin. I see \nthe handwriting. We have voted unanimously in this body today to \nproceed to take up the appropriations bill making appropriations for \nthe Department of Treasury-Postal Service and so forth, but we are not \ngoing to vote on that. I have asked questions around: When are we going \nto vote? There is no intention to vote on that today. We have another \ncloture vote coming up within a few minutes. If that cloture motion is \napproved, the Senate will then take on that subject, and the Treasury-\nPostal appropriations bill will go back to the calendar. We are not \ngoing to take it up. There is no intention of voting on that bill, no \nintention. It will go back on the calendar.\n  Then what will happen? I see the handwriting on the wall. We will go \nto conference one day when we get back from the August recess. We will \ngo to conference one day on another appropriations bill, and everything \nwill go on that appropriations bill. I wish Daniel were here today so \nhe could tell me exactly what the handwriting on this wall really \nmeans, but I think I know what it means. It means this bill isn't going \nto see the light of day until after the recess, and probably not then. \nIn all likelihood, the Treasury-Postal Service bill will be put on a \nconference report, maybe on the legislative appropriations bill. This \nbill will go on that. As time passes, more and more appropriations \nbills will likely go on that in conference.\n  So we will get another conference report back here that is loaded--\nloaded--with appropriations bills. We won't know what is in them. We \nSenators won't know what is in those bills. We didn't know what was in \nthe 3,980-page conference report in fiscal year 1999. We voted for it \nor against it blindly. I voted against it. I didn't know what was in \nit. That is what we are confronted with.\n  The American people, I think, are going to write us off as being \nirrelevant. We don't mean anything. We just stay here and fight one \nanother and try to get the partisan best of one another.\n\n[[Page S7614]]\n\nDemocrats versus Republicans, Republicans versus Democrats. Who can get \nthe ups on the other side. The people will say we can go to hell. That \nis the attitude here. Hell is not such a bad word. I have seen it in \nthe Bible, so I perhaps will not be accused of using bad language here. \nBut that is what we are in for. That is the handwriting on the wall. We \nare going to replay the same old record and have these monumental \nconference reports come back here, unamendable, and we take them hook, \nline, and sinker, one vote. No amendments. We won't know what is in the \nbill.\n  How is that for grown up men and women? We won't know what is in the \nbill because we are playing politics all the time. We are playing \npolitics. That is why we are not getting our work done. I am not \nblaming that side or this side. I am just blaming both sides. We are \nall caught in this. I am sure the American people can't look at this \nbody, or this Congress, and get much hope because we play politics all \nthe time. I am sorry that things have come to this. But Congress \ndoesn't work by the rules; the Senate doesn't operate under the rules \nit operated under when I came here and that existed up until a few \nyears ago. This game has been going on and it is getting worse. It is \ngetting worse.\n  Mr. President, I don't intend to hold the floor any longer. I will \nhave more to say about this. If you want to know the truth, what is \nsaid is exactly the truth. We are absolutely working a fraud on the \nAmerican people. They look to this body and expect us to legislate on \nthe problems of the country, and we are just tied in knots. We only \nseem to think about partisanship. I am sick and tired of that. I am \nsure we have to have a little of that as we go along, but it has become \nall partisan politics. Who can win this? If they come up with \nsomething, we have to come up with an alternative.\n  I don't think the American people want that. I think they know more \nthan we think they know, and I believe they are pretty aware of what is \ngoing on. We are just playing politics. That is exactly why we can't \nget this Treasury-Postal Service Appropriations Bill up and get it \npassed and send it to conference. Mark my words; we are going to play \nthe same old game over and over again that we have played all too many \ntimes now, not passing appropriations bills, but having them all in \nconference put into one monumental, colossal conference report, and it \nis sent back here and we will vote on it and we won't know what is in \nthe conference report. Shame! Shame on us!\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the current posture \nof the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill on the floor. It seems to me \nthat we are in the doldrums. Our sails are unfurled, the crew is at \ntheir positions, but the ship is not moving. There are many reasons for \nthat. But I suggest one of the principal reasons is that over the last \nseveral months--indeed, throughout this entire Congress--the leadership \nhas taken it upon themselves to essentially try to nullify the \nPresident's constitutional authority to appoint judges to the Federal \ncourts.\n  Article II, section 2 of the Constitution is quite clear that the \nPresident has the right to appoint Federal judges, subject to the \nadvice and consent of the Senate. But what has happened with increasing \nenthusiasm is that these appointments arrive here and then languish \nmonth after month after month after month. At some point, this type of \nnullification, this avoidance of responsibility under the Constitution, \nsubverts what I believe the Founding Fathers saw as a relatively \nroutine aspect of Government: Presidential appointment and \nconsideration within a reasonable time by the Senate of these \nappointments.\n  It has not been a reasonable time in so many cases. Repeatedly, \nappointments to the Federal bench have been made by the President. They \nhave come to the Senate and have been virtually ignored month after \nmonth. At some point, we have to be responsible not only to the \nConstitution, but to the people of the country and act on these \nappointments. Now, that doesn't mean confirm every appointment. But it \ncertainly, in my mind, means to have a reasonable deliberation, a \nhearing, and then bring it to a vote. It is far better, both \nconstitutionally and in terms of the lives of individual Americans, to \ndecide their fate, decide whether or not they will serve on the bench \nin a reasonable period of time than to let them twist slowly in the \nwind--some for upwards of a year or more. That is what has been \nhappening. It is a reflection of a deeper paralysis within the system.\n  The Senate is not operating as it traditionally has, as a forum for \nvigorous debate, amendment, and discussion, and after a vigorous \ndebate, a vote. We have seen a situation in which measures are brought \nto the floor only after concessions are made about the number of \namendments, the scope of amendments, and the type of amendments. That \nis operational procedure that is frequently associated with the other \nbody but which defies the tradition of this body, where we pride \nourselves on our ability to debate and amend, to be a place in which \nserious discussions about public policy take place routinely and just \nas often decisions are made by the votes of this body. We haven't seen \nthat.\n  We introduced on this floor for consideration--and it has been the \npending business now since May--the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct. Every 5 years, we reauthorize the education policy of the Federal \nGovernment--the education policy with respect to elementary and \nsecondary schools throughout this country: the title I program, \nProfessional Development Program, and the Eisenhower Program that \nassists professional development. Yet this major piece of legislation \nhas come to this floor and then, like judges, has been languishing in \nthe shadows for months now. Why? Well, some suggest it is because the \nmajority doesn't want to consider amendments with respect to school \nsafety and gun violence. Those amendments might cause difficult votes. \nBut in any case, we are likely, this year, not to discharge our routine \nduty of every 5 years reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act. We are going to--using a sports metaphor--punt.\n  All of these things together have caused us to stop and essentially \nask why can't we refocus our operations, refocus our emphasis, and \nbegin to renew the tradition in this body of debate, wide-open \namendment leading to votes with respect to substantive legislation and \nwith respect to appointments by the President to the judiciary and \nother appointments.\n  That is why I believe we are here in these doldrums. The lights are \non. We are assembled, but we are not moving forward. I think we have to \nbegin to look at what we are doing and why we are doing it. Perhaps \nthat is the most useful aspect of this discussion this afternoon--\nbecause I hope that eventually we can emerge from these doldrums and \nbegin to, once again, take up the people's business in a reasonable and \ntimely fashion leading to votes after debate. Some may go the way we \nwant. Some may not. But in the grand scheme of things, when we are \ndebating and bringing the principles of the debate to conclusion by \nvoting, we are discharging the responsibility that the American people \nentrusted to us when they elected us to the Senate.\n  There are many examples of what we could be doing if we adopted this \napproach. For example, I have an amendment which I would like to \nintroduce with respect to this Treasury-Postal bill regarding the \nenforcement of our firearms laws in the United States.\n  We hear time and time again--particularly by the opponents of \nincreased gun safety legislation--that all we have to do is enforce the \nlaws. Yet in the past we have seen the erosion of funds going to the \nATF for their enforcement policies. I must say that this year's \nTreasury-Postal appropriations bill has moved the bar upwards in terms \nof funding appropriate gun safety programs, and I commend the Chairman \nand Ranking Member for their effort. But there are two areas in which \nthey have failed to respond. One is the youth crime gun interdiction \ninitiative by the ATF.\n  I would request in my amendment an additional $6.4 million, which \nwould bring it up to the funding requested by the President. This, to \nme, is an absolutely critical issue--not only in the sense of making \nsound public policy, but critical because in every community in this \ncountry we are astonished\n\n[[Page S7615]]\n\nby the ease of access to firearms by youngsters. We are horrified by \nthe results of this access to firearms.\n  A few weeks ago in Providence, RI, we were absolutely devastated by \nthe murder of two young people. They had been in Providence on Thursday \nevening at a night club. They left. One youngster was working and the \nother was a college student. They were chatting by their car, waiting \nto go to their homes that evening when they were carjacked by five or \nsix young men. They were driven to a golf course on the outskirts of \nProvidence. Then they were brutally killed with firearms.\n  Where did these accused murderers get these firearms? It is a \nconfused story. But there was an adult, apparently, who had lots of \nweapons. Either they were stolen from this individual, or he lent the \nfirearms to one of these young men. But, in any case, this is one of \nthose searing examples of young people having firearms being desperate, \nbeing homicidal, and using those weapons to kill two innocent people.\n  The program, which is underfunded in this appropriations bill, would \nauthorize the ATF to work with local police departments to develop \ntracing reports to determine the source of firearms in juvenile crimes.\n  There was some suggestion initially and anecdotally that most of \nthese firearms were stolen, but then preliminary research suggested \nnot; that, in fact, there is an illegal market for firearms and that \ntoo many weapons used by juveniles in these heinous crimes are obtained \nin this illegal firearms market.\n  This type of information is extremely useful in terms of designing \nstrategies to interdict access to firearms by youth perpetrators. We \nneed this kind of intelligence in the Nation, if we are going to \nconstruct appropriate programs that are going to deal with this \nproblem.\n  This, again, is a reflection of what I sense happened in Providence. \nIt is unclear precisely what happened. But here you have the \npossibility that the individual with the firearms either sold them or \nlent them, got them into the hands of young people who, in turn, used \nthem to kill other young people.\n\n  It would be extremely useful if we knew collectively and not only \nindividually how these weapons moved through our society, because \nwithout this knowledge it is very hard to create counterstrategies.\n  That is one important aspect--these trace reports--for appropriations \nthat I will seek to move today with respect to appropriations.\n  Indeed, the Senate Appropriations Committee report emphasizes the \nimportance of the partnerships that are underlying this initiative, and \nunderlying also the ability to deal with the incidents of youth firearm \ncrimes. In their words:\n\n       The partnership between ATF and local law enforcement \n     agencies in these communities--\n\n  The communities that are already participating in this program--\n\n     is invaluable to the mutual effort to reduce gun-related \n     crimes. The tracing information provided by ATF not only \n     allows local jurisdictions to target scarce resources to \n     investigations likely to achieve results, but also gives ATF \n     the raw data to be able to investigate and prosecute the \n     illegal source of these crime guns. The Committee continues \n     to believe that there are significant disruptions in these \n     illegal firearms markets directly due to investigative leads \n     arising from this regional initiative.\n\n  Frankly, the committee recognizes that this is a useful initiative. I \nwould like to see it fully funded. That is something we could be \ntalking about. Indeed, I hope we can move to incorporate that within \nthe appropriations bill that is before us.\n  There is another important firearms enforcement measure that was not \nfunded by the committee which I would like to see funded, and that is \nthe national integrated ballistics information network. I would like to \nsee that appropriation moved up by $11.68 million to meet the \nPresident's request. This would integrate two systems that try to \nidentify bullets based upon their ballistic characteristics so they can \nbe more useful in investigating crimes.\n  The ATF has an integrated ballistics identification system, which is \ncalled in shorthand IBIS. The FBI has what they call the ``drugfire'' \nballistic system. I have seen demonstrations of these systems. They are \nremarkable. They recover a slug at a crime scene. They take it to a \nlab, which has the computer equipment that is designed to run this \nsystem. They are able to identify the characteristics of the particular \nslug that is being examined and then, through their data banks, match \nit up with a known group of slugs, make a positive identification, and \nthe positive identification leads, in many cases, to the arrest, or \ncertainly to the identification of the weapon that was used. It is very \nsimilar to fingerprinting, with which we are all familiar.\n  We have these two systems. They work very well independently. But \nthey would work much better if their databases were combined; if the \nsource was engineered to cooperate and work interdependently. That is \nwhat this appropriation would do.\n  We have seen success already. Both of these systems, working \nindependently, have produced more than 8,000 matches and 16,000 cases. \nFor the first time we can take a slug from a crime scene, match it up \nwith known weapons, leading, hopefully, to arrests and ultimately \nconviction. In a way, it is not only like fingerprints, it is like DNA, \nlike all the scientific breakthroughs we are able to use to more \neffectively enforce the laws and bring lawbreakers to justice.\n  I hope we can use this system more effectively by integrating the two \nprograms, the ATF program and also the FBI program.\n  One of the reasons I am offering this amendment is to ensure we have \nthe money this year. There is a 24-month proposed schedule for the \ndeployment of this system. The work has been done, the plans have been \ndone, but if we do not appropriate sufficient money in fiscal years \n2001 and 2002, then we will fall short of this scheduled deployment. We \nwill create a situation in which, again, when we ask why the American \npeople get so frustrated with government, the situation in which we \nhave been planning, we have been expending money, we are all ready to \nmove forward on an initiative that will materially aid law enforcement \nauthority, and then we stop short and go into a hiatus for a year, and \nmaybe at the end of the year start again. But, more than likely, it \nwill be more expensive, and we have lost months or years in terms of \nhaving effective tools for our law enforcement authorities. That is one \nof the frustrations. It is frustration based upon our inability to be \nable to move efficiently and promptly to do the people's business.\n  I hope we can deal with this issue of both the youth crime gun \ninterdiction initiative and the national integrated ballistics \ninformation network. These are the types of appropriations measures we \nshould not only be talking about, but we should be voting for. Again, \nwe are in this predicament because there has been such a conscious, \novert effort on the part of the leadership to deflect consideration, \ndeliberation, and decision on so many important issues that are \ncritical to the future of America. Lifetime tenure on Federal courts is \nbeing withheld because there is a hope, an expectation on one side, \nthat these judges will go away, these nominees will go away, in 6 or 9 \nmonths.\n  I don't think that is what the American people want Congress to do. \nThey want Congress to either approve or disapprove, but they want \nCongress to act.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REED. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, the Senator has talked about the present \nsituation we are in. Is the Senator aware that the majority leader \ntried to move the Senate toward consideration of this bill as long ago \nas last Friday and it was objected to by the minority?\n  Mr. REED. I am aware of that. It is one of the situations where, \nafter months and months of cooperating, of trying to accommodate, \nmutually, the desire and the recognition of getting things done, at \nsome point when we see no movement with respect to our constitutional \nobligation to confirm judges, no real movement, when we see the \nelementary and secondary education bill that has been put out to \nlanguish and perhaps not to see the light of day for the rest of the \nyear, when we see a process in which the price of bringing a bill to \nthe floor is an agreement to surrender the rights of individual \nSenators to amend that legislation, to make that amendment\n\n[[Page S7616]]\n\nprocess subject to the approval of the majority leader, when we see all \nthose things, what I think we have to do and what we must do is insist \nthat we get back, away from that process of majority oppression. \nPerhaps that is too melodramatic. We have to get back to the rules of \nthe Senate, the spirit of the Senate, which, I believe, is open debate, \nopen amendment, and a vote.\n  Frankly, if that were the rule that was forthcoming from the majority \nleader, if the majority leader said, bring ESEA back, open up the \namendment process, vote; when we finish the amendments, if the debate \ngoes too long, in my prerogative, after long debate, I will enter a \ncloture motion--that is the way the Senate should operate. I suggest \nthat is not the way this Senate is operating. That is why we are here \ntoday.\n\n  There is responsibility for every individual Senator for what happens \non the floor of the Senate. Certainly the management of the Senate is \nwithin the grasp and the control immediately of the majority leader and \nthe majority. That control has been deliberately, I think, to thwart \nthe nomination and the confirmation of judges and deliberately to \nfrustrate legislation important to the American people because there \nmight be amendments that are uncomfortable for consideration by some in \nthis body.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REED. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Is the Senator aware the majority leader has an \nagreement with the minority leader whereby a number of judges would, in \nfact, be confirmed and that the agreement was accepted by both sides, \nonly to have the minority leader come forward and say that he wanted to \nidentify the specific judges, and the numbers were not acceptable? The \nminority leader wanted to pick specific people, in contradiction of the \nnormal pattern of the Judiciary Committee.\n  Is the Senator aware of the fact the minority leader has taken that \nstand?\n  Mr. REED. Reclaiming my time, essentially what the Senator is \narguing, by implication, is that the majority leader has the sole \nresponsibility and sole prerogative to pick who will come to this floor \nfor consideration as a judge.\n  I am amazed at this whole process. Look at judges who have been \npending for almost a year and their names are not coming to the \nsurface. That is something more at work than the breaks of the game. \nThat is a deliberate attempt by the majority to suppress the nomination \nof individual judges.\n  Frankly, an offer to bring some judges to the floor is, in my view, \ninsufficient unless that offer was transparent, saying we will begin to \nwork down the judges who have been pending longest, with perhaps other \ncriteria, such as districts or circuits that need judges.\n  But that is not how it is working. These magnanimous offers of \nbringing up a couple of judges--I believe I saw yesterday where three \njudges from Arizona were just nominated by the President, and they \nalready have hearings scheduled. We have other judges who were \nnominated over a year ago, and they have not even had a hearing, a year \nlater. Some magnanimous gestures by the majority leader are self-\nserving and ultimately had to be rejected by the minority.\n  I respect the Senator, but I will continue my discussion on some \nother points.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I will respond at a later time.\n  Mr. REED. The youth crime gun interdiction initiative and the \nnational integrative ballistics information network are important \nissues. Those are the issues we are talking about. They are a subset of \nwhat I argue is the larger issue.\n  The larger issue: Is the Senate going to be the Senate? Or is it some \ntype of smaller House of Representatives where the leadership dictates \nwhat is coming to the floor, what judge's name might come up, what bill \nmight come up, what amendment might come up, when it all comes about? \nThat, I think, is the key point.\n  Let me take up another key point in terms of the demonstration of why \nwe are not doing our duty. We have before the Senate a very difficult \nvote on extending permanent normal trade relations to China. It is a \nvery difficult vote. We know that. It is a vote that bedeviled the \nHouse of Representatives. It was controversial. It was difficult. But \nafter intense pressure and vigorous debate, the House of \nRepresentatives brought it to a conclusion and voted.\n  Now that measure is before the Senate. It is controversial. It is, \nlike so many other things, languishing. It could have been accomplished \nweeks ago. The business community would argue vociferously it should \nhave been accomplished weeks ago. It has been couched in many terms, \nbut one term I think is most compelling is that it is a critical \nnational security vote. It is a critical national security vote. Yes, \nit is about trade. Yes, it is about economic impacts within the United \nStates and around the world. But it is also about whether or not we \nwill continue to maintain a relationship of engagement with China, or \nif we reject it, or if we delay it indefinitely and open up the \ndistinct possibility of confrontation and competition with China.\n  Yet this critical national security vote, this critical vote which is \nprobably the No. 1 objective of the business community in this country, \nagain languishes.\n  Some would say there are reasons. We want to talk about Senator \nThompson's and Senator Torricelli's amendment about proliferation. But, \nagain, it is symptomatic of a situation in which the Senate is not \nresponding as it should to its constitutional and to its public \nresponsibilities because of the political calculus.\n  Our side is not immune to political calculation. But the leadership \nof this body has created a situation in which avoidance of difficult \nissues, nullification of constitutional responsibilities and \nobligations to confirm judges, and deferment of critical national \nsecurity issues for short-run advantages, is the standard of \nperformance. I believe that is not the role the Senate should play and \nthat is the heart of this discussion today.\n  Let me suggest one other point with respect to the business of the \nbody. We confront a range of issues that deal with those world-shaking, \nmomentous issues like China trade policy; issues with respect to \ndomestic tranquility; the safety of our streets; the funding of the \nappropriations bills for law enforcement when it comes to firearms.\n  Then there are issues that are not important to the vast number of \nAmericans in the sense it doesn't affect them directly but are \ncritically important to many Americans. One is a measure I have been \ntrying to find the opportunity to bring to the floor, and that is to \nsomehow help the Liberian community in this country who came here in \n1990, in the midst of their violent civil war, and who for the last \ndecade have been in the United States. They have been residing here. \nThey have been contributing to our communities. Many of them have \nchildren who are American citizens. Yet they are in a position where \nthey face deportation October 1. The clock is ticking.\n  This is not an issue that is going to galvanize parades through every \nMain Street in America. But for these roughly 10,000 people who are \ncaught up in this twilight zone while they are here, they want to \nremain here with their children, many of whom, as I said, are \nAmericans, but they face a prospect of being deported back to a country \nthat is still tumultuous, still dangerous, still threatening to them \nand many others.\n  This is legislation that has been supported by Senator Chafee, my \ncolleague from Rhode Island, Senator Hagel, Senator Wellstone, Senator \nKennedy, Senator Landrieu, Senator Kerry, and Senator Durbin, \nlegislation that will materially assist these individuals. But, once \nagain, we are not moving with the kind of rapidity that allows for the \neasy accommodation of this type of legislation on the floor. I hope it \ndoes come up soon, but I think it represents the cost of this \novercontrol and this inflexibility, perhaps, that we are seeing as the \nmanagement leadership style here today.\n  Let me just briefly set the stage about the need for this \nlegislation. Liberia is a country that has the closest ties of any \nAfrican nation to the United States--it was founded by freed slaves in \nthe middle 1800s. Its capital is Monrovia, named after President \nMonroe. It is a country that did its utmost\n\n[[Page S7617]]\n\nthroughout its existence in the 1800s and the 1900s, to emulate \nAmerican Government structure, at least. But it erupted into tremendous \nviolence in 1989 and 1990. Over the next several years, 150,000 people \nfled to surrounding countries. Many of them came to the United States--\nmany being about 14,000. In March 1991, the Attorney General recognized \nthat these individuals needed to be sheltered, so he granted temporary \nprotected status, or TPS.\n  Under TPS, the nationals of a country may stay in the United States \nwithout fear of deportation because of the armed conflict or \nextraordinary conditions in their homeland. People who register for TPS \nreceive work authorizations, they are required to pay taxes--and this \nis precisely what the Liberian community has done in the United States. \nThey went to work. They paid taxes. However, they do not qualify for \nbenefits such as welfare and food stamps. Not a single day spent in TPS \ncounts towards the residence requirement for permanent residency. So \nthey are in this gray area, this twilight zone. They have stayed there \nnow for 10 years because the situation did not materially change for \nmany years.\n\n  Each year, the Attorney General must conduct a review. The Attorney \nGeneral did conduct such a review and continued to grant TPS until a \nfew years ago, until the fall of 1999, when the determination was made \nthat the situation in Liberia had stabilized enough that TPS was no \nlonger forthcoming.\n  At that, many of us leaped to the fore and said the situation has \nchanged. The situation has changed in Liberia, but it has also changed \nwith respect to these individuals here in the United States. They have \nestablished themselves in the community. They have become part of the \ncommunity. Their expectations of a speedy return to Liberia long ago \nevaporated and they started to accommodate themselves--indeed many of \nthem enthusiastically--to joining the greater American community.\n  The situation changed in Liberia. The change there was more \nprocedural than substantive. What happened was the situation in which \nthere was an election, which was monitored by outsiders, which elected \na President, the former warlord, Charles Taylor.\n  Based upon this procedural process change, the State Department and \nothers ruled, essentially, that the situation was now ripe for the \nreturn of Liberians from the United States and surrounding countries to \nLiberia. But at the heart, the chaos, the economic disruption, the \nviolence within Liberia did not subside substantially. As a result, \nLiberians here in the United States have genuine concerns about their \nreturn to Liberia. What has happened most recently, because this is an \nevolving situation, is that Charles Taylor, the President, again, duly \nelected President, has not renounced all of his prior behaviors because \nit is strongly suggested that he has been one of the key forces who is \ncreating the havoc in the adjoining nation of Sierra Leone.\n  All of us have seen horrific photographs of the violence there, of \nchildren whose arms and hands have been cut off by warring factions in \nSierra Leone. The Revolutionary United Front is one of the key \ncombatants in that country. Part of this is an unholy alliance between \nTaylor and the Revolutionary United Front for the purpose of creating, \nnot only mischief, but also for exploiting diamond resources within \nSierra Leone for the benefit of Taylor and the benefit of others. But \nall of this, this turmoil, once again, suggests that Liberia is not a \nplace that is a stable working democracy where someone, after 10 years \nof living in the United States, could return easily and gracefully and \nimmediately.\n  Last year at this time, after being approached by myself and others, \nthe Attorney General determined that she could not grant TPS again \nunder the law. But she did grant Deferred Enforced Departure, or DED, \nto Liberians, which meant the Liberians could remain in the United \nStates for another year but essentially they are being deported. It is \njust stayed, delayed for a while. They have been living in this further \nuncertainty for the last year.\n  My legislation would allow them to begin to adjust to a permanent \nresidency status here in the United States, and hopefully, ultimately, \nafter passing all of the hurdles, to become citizens of this country.\n  They arrived here, as I said, about 10 years ago. They came here with \nthe expectation that they would have a short stay and would be home, \nback in their communities, back in Liberia, but that expectation was \nfrustrated, not by them but by the violence that continued to break out \nthroughout Liberia.\n  Now they have established themselves here. They are part and parcel \nof the community, and they are extremely good neighbors in my State of \nRhode Island, as well as in other parts of this country. I believe \nequity, fairness, and justice require that we offer these individuals \nthe opportunity to become permanent resident aliens and ultimately, as \nI said, I hope they will take the opportunity to become citizens of \nthis country.\n  Our immigration policy is an interesting one, idiosyncratic in many \ncases, but it is important to point out there are several other \ncountries around the globe that have already dealt with a problem like \nthis: Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Spain, and Great Britain. After \na certain length of time, even if you are there temporarily--certainly \n10 years is a sufficient time--you can, in fact, adjust your status to \nsomething akin to permanent resident of the United States and pursue \ncitizenship.\n  We have done this before. We have made these types of adjustments for \nother national groups that have been here and for many of the same \nreasons: Simple justice, length of stay, connections to the community \nof America, continued turmoil in their own countries. For example, in \n1988 we passed a law to allow the Attorney General to adjust to \npermanent status 4,996 Polish individuals who had been here for 4 \nyears, 387 Ugandans who had been here for 10 years, 565 Afghanis who \nhad been here for 8 years, and 1,180 Ethiopians who had been here for \n11 years.\n  The 102nd Congress passed a law which allowed Chinese nationals who \nhad been granted deferred enforced departure after Tiananmen Square to \nadjust to permanent residency. Over the next 4 years, 52,968 Chinese \nchanged their status.\n  In the last Congress, we passed legislation known as NACARA. Under \nthis law, 150,000 Nicaraguans, 5,000 Cubans, 200,000 El Salvadorans, \nand 50,000 Guatemalans who had been living in the United States since \nthe eighties were eligible to adjust to permanent residency status. A \nseparate law allows Haitians who were granted DED to adjust to \npermanent residency.\n  As one can see, we are not setting a precedent. We are doing what we \nhave done before in response to similar motivations: fairness, length \nof stay here, turmoil in the homeland to which we propose to deport \nthese individuals.\n  Another important point is why we believe we have a special \nobligation to Liberia. As my colleagues know--and I have mentioned \nbefore--this is a country that shares so much with the United States.\n  In 1822, a group of freed slaves in the United States began to settle \nthe coast of western Africa with the assistance of private American \nphilanthropic groups and at the behest of the U.S. Government. In 1847, \nthese settlers established the Republic of Liberia, the first \nindependent country in Africa. Five percent of the population of \nLiberia traces their ancestry to former American slaves. They modeled \ntheir constitution after ours. And they used the dollar as their \ncurrency.\n  Before the 1990 civil war, the United States was Liberia's leading \ntrading partner and major donor of assistance. When Liberia was torn \napart by civil war, they turned to the United States for help. We \nrecognized that special relationship, and we offered aid to Liberia. We \noffered it, as I said, to assist those who were fleeing destruction and \ndevastation. We should continue to do that. We have had a special \nrelationship with Liberia over history, and we have formed a special \nrelationship throughout this country with those communities of \nLiberians who have been here for a decade and who seek to stay.\n  Again, this is some of the legislation we could be considering, some \nof the legislation with which we could be dealing if we had a process \nthat allowed that free flow of legislation to the floor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two letters be printed in \nthe\n\n[[Page S7618]]\n\nRecord: A letter from Bill Gray, President of the College Fund, and a \nletter from the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             The College Fund,\n\n                                      Fairfax, VA, April 19, 2000.\n     Hon. Jack Reed,\n     U.S. Senator, Senate Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reed: I write to let you know of the great \n     importance I attach to the passage of legislation that would \n     allow Liberian nationals already in the U.S. for almost ten \n     years to become permanent residents. Your legislation, S. \n     656, the Liberian Immigration Fairness Act, would accomplish \n     this important goal.\n       The United States has always shared a special relationship \n     with Liberia, a country created in 1822 by private American \n     philanthropic organizations for freed American slaves. In \n     December 1989, civil war erupted in Liberia and continued to \n     rage for seven years. USAID estimates that of Liberia's 2.1 \n     million inhabitants, 150,000 were killed, 700,000 were \n     internally displaced and 480,000 became refugees. To date, \n     very little of the destroyed infrastructure has been rebuilt \n     and sporadic violence continues.\n       When the civil war began in 1989, thousands of Liberians \n     fled to the United States. In 1991, the Attorney General \n     granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to these Liberians, \n     providing temporary relief from deportation since ongoing \n     armed conflict prevented their safe return home. For the next \n     seven years, the Attorney General annually renewed this TPS \n     status. Last summer, Attorney General Reno announced that \n     this TPS designation would end on September 28, 1999. \n     Throughout 1999, Liberians faced the prospect that they would \n     be uprooted and forced to return to a country still ravaged \n     by violence and repression. However, on September 27, 1999, \n     President Clinton granted non-citizen Liberians living in the \n     United States a reprieve, allowing them to remain in the \n     country and work for one additional year.\n       The Department of Justice estimates that approximately \n     10,000 Liberians are living in the United States under \n     protection of our immigration laws. There are significant \n     Liberian populations in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, Maryland, \n     Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Georgia, Minnesota, Rhode \n     Island, and North Carolina. For the past decade, while \n     ineligible for government benefits, Liberians have been \n     authorized to work and are required to pay taxes. They \n     married, bought homes, and placed their children, many of \n     whom were born in this country, in school. Despite their \n     positive contributions to our communities, their immigration \n     status does not offer Liberians the opportunity to share \n     fully in our society by becoming citizens.\n       When they first arrived, these nationals of Liberia hoped \n     that their stay in this country would indeed be temporary. \n     But ten years have passed and they have moved on with their \n     lives. Liberians have lived in this immigration limbo longer \n     than any other group in the United States. More importantly, \n     other immigrant groups who were given temporary haven in the \n     United States for much shorter periods have been allowed to \n     adjust to permanent residency: Afghans, Ethiopians, Poles and \n     Ugandans after five yeas and 53,000 Chinese after just three \n     years. It is time to end the uncertainty that Liberians have \n     lived with for so long. It is time to allow them the \n     opportunity to adjust to permanent residency as our nation \n     has allowed others before them.\n       Following our Nation's tradition of fairness and decency, I \n     am pleased to add my personal support to S. 656 in order to \n     offer Liberians the protection they deserve.\n           Sincerely,\n     William H. Gray III.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          Lutheran Immigration and\n\n\n                                              Refugee Service,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 7, 2000.\n     Hon. Jack Reed,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reed: On behalf of the undersigned \n     organizations, we urge your support of the Liberian Refugee \n     Immigration Fairness Act of 1999 (S. 656). This Act would \n     provide relief and protection for some 15,000 Liberian civil \n     war refugees and their families now residing in the United \n     States.\n       Since March of 1991, over 10,000 Liberian civil war \n     refugees have resided in the United States. Recently, they \n     were granted an extension of their temporary exclusion from \n     deportation when President Clinton ordered the Attorney \n     General to defer their enforced departure. Granted for one \n     year, the order is set to expire in September of this year. \n     Against this general background, legislation has been \n     introduced by Senator Jack Reed (D-RI) to adjust the status \n     of certain Liberian nationals to that of lawful permanent \n     residence. We strongly support Senator Reed's proposed \n     legislation, S. 656. We view this bill as being vital to the \n     basic protection of and fairness towards Liberian civil war \n     refugees.\n\n\n                             justifications\n\n       The Liberian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act of 1999 would \n     protect Liberian refugees and their families from being \n     forcibly returned to a nation where their life and freedom \n     may still be threatened. Even the Human Rights reports from \n     the U.S. Department of State and Amnesty International have \n     called attention to the continuing pattern of abuses against \n     citizens by the Liberian government. Additionally, the \n     legislation would protect against the dissolution of families \n     as Liberian parents are forced to choose between leaving \n     their American born children in the U.S. or taking them back \n     to Liberia if they are deported. Further, after nearly a \n     decade of living in the U.S., Liberians have established real \n     ties in their local communities and as such, forced \n     deportation would simply be wrong. Finally, it is imperative \n     that Liberian civil war refugees be accorded the same \n     favorable treatment as other refugee groups seeking relief in \n     the United States.\n       We remain appreciative to Congress for its continued \n     attention paid to the general issue of immigration relief for \n     those in need, and we trust the same will be devoted to the \n     Liberians. We appreciate your consideration of these \n     comments.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Ralston H.

Mr. President, let me conclude my overall remarks by \nsaying, as I began, that we are in the doldrums. We are here but we are \nnot moving. I do not think it is sufficient to simply, on a day-by-day \nbasis, make a little concession here and a little concession there.\n  I think to get this Senate under full sail again, moving forward, \nproudly, purposefully, is to once again summon up the spirit which I \nalways thought was inherent in this body, the spirit of vigorous and \nfree and open debate, of vigorous and wide-ranging amendment, \nunfettered by the individual proclivities of the leader, whoever the \nleader may be, and then, ultimately, doing our job, which is to vote.\n  This afternoon, I have tried to suggest several areas where we have \nneglected that obligation. With respect to Federal judges, it seems to \nme that there has been an attitude adopted here that our advice and \nconsent is sort of an optional thing. If we do not choose to do it, \nthen no judges will be confirmed. In a way, it is very subversive to \nthe Constitution.\n  Frankly, I don't think anyone would object if judges were brought to \nthis floor and voted down. That is a political judgment, a policy \njudgment, a judgment based upon their jurisprudence, their character, a \nhost of issues. But what is so objectionable is this notion of stymying \nthe Constitution by simple nonaction, by pushing it off into the \nshadows, allowing individual nominees to languish, hoping that no one \npays attention to it, and that at the end of the day these judges will \ngo away and more favorable judges will be appointed. I do not think \nthat is the way to operate this Senate.\n  We have legislation, such as the ESEA, which has been permanently--or \napparently permanently--shelved, not because there is something \ninherently wrong with the bill as it has been presented--we can debate \nthe merits of that--but because to bring it back to the floor would \ninvite amendments that might be uncomfortable. I think that is also \nwrong.\n  Then I think we have a measure which everyone claims is critical to \nour economy, critical to our future national security, critical to our \nrelationships with Asia and China, particularly, over the next several \ndecades. That, too, has been shunted aside, not because of substance, \nbut because of political calculation. Once again, I think that is \nwrong.\n  In return, what has been suggested, is: Why don't you take a little \nof this and a little of that, and we will give you an amendment here, \nand we just might bring up two judges, but we don't know who they are. \nThat, in comparison, is not an appropriate response to the basic \nquestion of: Will the Senate be the Senate?\n  I would hope that we would return to that spirit, that spirit which I \nthink drew us all here initially, with the hope and the expectation \nthat we would debate and we would vote--we would win some; we would \nlose some--but ultimately, by debating and by voting, and by \nshouldering our responsibilities--not avoiding them--the American \npeople would ultimately be the great victors in this Democratic \nprocess.\n  I hope we return to that spirit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments from the \nSenator from Rhode Island. I will have some responses to them in a \nmoment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/26/senate-section/article/S7619-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7619]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--S. 2912\n\n  Mr. BENNETT.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4018) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, passage of the Global AIDS and Tuberculosis \nRelief Act is a priority for this Administration, but that is not why I \nsupport it. I am aware of the calamity inflicted by HIV/AIDS on many \nThird World countries, particularly in Africa.\n  Children are the hardest hit and they, Mr. President, are the \ninnocent victims of this sexually transmitted disease. In fact, the \nofficial estimate of 28 million children orphaned in Africa alone could \neasily prove to be a low estimate. This is among the reasons why \nSenator Bill Frist wrote the pending amendment, which is based on S. \n2845, with solid advice from and by Franklin Graham, president of \nSamaritan's Purse and son of Billy and Ruth. That is why I support it.\n  Several items in the pending bill should be carefully noted. First, \nauthorization for appropriations for the World Bank Trust Fund is \nscaled back from the House proposal of five years to two years. There \nis no obligation for the U.S. Government to support the trust fund \nbeyond two years.\n  If the trust fund performs as expected, Congress may decide at that \ntime to make additional funds available. However, if the Trust Fund is \nnot transparent, if there is not strict accountability--and if money is \nsquandered on second rate or politicized projects--I intend to do \neverything in my power to ensure that Congress does not provide another \nfarthing.\n  The pending bill requires that twenty percent of U.S. bilateral \nfunding for HIV/AIDS programs be spent to support orphans in Africa. \nThat could be as much as $60 million. This is one of the provisions on \nwhich I insisted, and I wish it could have been an even higher \npercentage.\n\n[[Page S7620]]\n\n  I suggest that A.I.D. get together with Nyumbani Orphanage in \nNairobi, Kenya, Samaritan's Purse, and the other groups working in the \nfield to develop a plan to address the crisis.\n  Finally, I insisted that the lions share of bilateral funding, \nspecifically, 65 percent--or as much as $195 million, be available to \nfaith-based groups and I am gratified that my colleagues have consented \nto this. At last, it has dawned on Senators that HIV/AIDS legislation \nand programs designed to address the spread of AIDS are worthless \nunless they recognize and address seriously the moral and behavioral \nfactors associated with the transmission of the disease.\n  There is only one 100 percent effective way to stop the spread of \nAIDS, and that, of course, is abstinence and faithfulness to one's \nspouse. And it is through churches that this message will be \neffectively promoted and accepted, not through government \nbureaucracies. It is no exaggeration to say that policymakers refusing \nto face up to this obvious fact will be culpable in the deaths of \nmillions.\n  Mr. President, approval of this bill will be an important \naccomplishment, and if its provisions are properly implemented it will \nsave lives. The Foreign Relations Committee will work diligently over \nthe next two years to ensure that the intent of Congress is understood \nand carried out.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I cannot tell you how pleased I am that the \nSenate will finally pass the Global AIDS and Tuberculosis Relief Act. \nHIV/AIDS has been acknowledged as the 21st century's bubonic plague. It \nis having a devastating impact in Sub-Saharan Africa, destroying the \nvery fabric of African societies. And while Africa is the present day \nepicenter, there is no guarantee that the disease will not spread \nthroughout the world in a manner that is just as devastating. No corner \nof the globe is immune.\n  HIV/AIDS is the only health related issue that has ever been the \nsubject of a meeting of the United Nations Security Council, and the \nonly one that has been the subject of a Security Council Resolution. \nWhy? Because it poses a severe risk to every nation in the \ninternational community, but most especially to developing nations \nwhich do not have the means to either treat those living with the \ndisease, or to educate those at risk of contracting the disease about \nhow to avoid infection.\n  I believe that it is past time for the United States to step forward \nand lead the way in efforts aimed at stopping the spread of the HIV/\nAIDS. This bill does just that. The funding levels this bill authorizes \nsignificantly increase the level of U.S. assistance to combat HIV/AIDS. \nOne of the key elements of this legislation is an authorization for the \nSecretary of the Treasury to enter into negotiations with the World \nBank to create a Trust Fund, the purpose of which is the eradication \nand prevention of the spread of the virus.\n  The Trust Fund will allow donations and contributions from \ngovernments--the bill authorizes $150 million as the U.S. \ncontribution--as well as the private sector, so that all sectors in \nsociety are working together at an international level to address this \ncrisis. It is truly the best way to do so. The statistics are grim. \nAccording to UNAIDS, in 1999 alone 5.4 million people were infected \nwith HIV/AIDS, bringing the total to 34.4 million infections world \nwide. 2.8 million people died of the disease last year. This does not \nhave to be. We know how to prevent the spread of the disease. We have \nthe means to treat the virus and the opportunistic diseases that kill \nthose infected with HIV/AIDS. Millions of lives can be saved through \nboth treatment and prevention. Through cooperation we can be \nsuccessful. We must challenge other donors to dedicate the necessary \nresources to achieve our aim.\n  The bill also authorizes $300 million in bilateral assistance to stop \nthe spread of the disease, and to treat it. While I strongly believe \nthat a multilateral approach must be developed to respond to the HIV/\nAIDS epidemic, I also believe that the United States should do all it \ncan right now to deliver targeted assistance to specific regions and \nspecific treatment programs. The problem of HIV/AIDS is urgent. \nBilateral assistance programs can be funded and programs carried out \nright away, and they should be.\n  Assistance is desperately needed, for example, in Africa. The \ncountries in the sub-Saharan region cannot wait for the negotiation of \na Would Bank Trust Fund; they must have help now. The news which came \nout of the International AIDS Conference in Durban was grim. Gross \nDomestic Product could be cut by as much as 20% due to the impact of \nHIV/AIDS in some African countries, according to a study released at \nthe conference. African countries are among the poorest in the world. \nThey cannot afford to have their incomes diminished to such a degree. \nAccording to the World Bank,\n\n       AIDS is now the fourth leading cause of death worldwide and \n     the leading cause of death in Sub-Saharan Africa. At all \n     levels, the impact of AIDS in Africa is staggering: At the \n     regional level, more than 13 million Africans have already \n     died, and another 23 million are now living with HIV/AIDS. \n     That is two-thirds of all cases on earth. At the national \n     level, the 21 countries with the highest HIV prevalence in \n     the world are in Africa. In Botswana and Zimbabwe, one in \n     four adults is infected. In at least 10 other African \n     countries, adult prevalence rates exceed 10 percent. At the \n     individual level, a child born in Zambia or Zimbabwe today is \n     more likely than not to die of AIDS at some point in her \n     lifetime. In many other African countries, the lifetime risk \n     of dying of AIDS is greater than one in three. The HIV/AIDS \n     epidemic is not only an unparalleled public health problem \n     affecting large parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, it is an \n     unprecedented threat to the region's development. In many \n     countries, the disease is reversing decades of hard-won \n     development progress.\n\n  We cannot ignore these facts. The time to act is now. The sooner we \naddress this crisis in Africa as well as the rest of the developing \nworld, the better. The directives in this bill represent the best of \nthe current proposals to do so. The World Bank and the Export-Import \nBank of the United States both recently announced that they would make \nfunds available for loans to African countries to help them purchase \ndrugs to treat HIV/AIDS. While I welcome any efforts to procure drugs \nfor this purpose, I do not believe that extending more loans to nations \ncurrently facing crippling debt burdens will, in the long run, prove to \nbe the most useful strategy. Grants and no strings attached assistance, \nthe aid provided in this bill, are what is needed.\n  I want to make it clear that this bill represents only the beginning \nof the United States' commitment to fighting HIV/AIDS. Sustained \ndedication of resources will be needed to continue the fight, and we in \nthe Senate must ensure that such resources continue to be channeled \ntowards eliminating the threat of HIV/AIDS. This bill is a good first \nstep in our efforts.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, a bipartisan group of members of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee have today sent to the Senate for \nconsideration a landmark legislative initiative to combat one of the \ngreat human tragedies of our time, the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The Global \nAIDS and Tuberculosis Relief Act of 2000 reflects the combination of \nmany initiatives proposed by members of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee. All initiatives share a common purpose of arresting the \nprogress of the disaster and caring for the victims so far.\n  The initiative cannot come too soon. The cost in human life and \nproductivity, as well as the potential societal and economic \ndisruptions AID has and will cause assure us of one distinct \npossibility: All goals of the United States in Africa and the \ndeveloping world--goals we share with them--will be seriously \ncompromised, if not completely undermined, by AIDS. Growing trade, \nbetter education and health, stronger democracies, efforts toward \npeace--all will be undermined by a disease that is positioned to sap \nthe life from the most promising and productive generations.\n  Two characteristics of this pandemic that distinguish it from the \nother great killers have impressed me the most and shaped the Senate's \nrecent initiative to support the efforts to combat HIV/AIDS worldwide.\n  The first is the fact that AIDS affects the younger members of a \ncommunity in their most productive years. It thus contorts and \neventually turns on its head the already strained economic equation by \neffectively reversing the proposition of dependants to productive \nmembers of a family. In short, it has struck at the heart of the \nextended families, changing the breadwinners from a source of needed \nfood or income to a burden. That is to say nothing of the grief, \npersonal loss and often shame associated with death from AIDS.\n\n[[Page S7621]]\n\n  The second is that the estimated number of orphans from AIDS in \nAfrica, for example, already exceeds 10 million, and is expected to \napproach 40 million in coming years. Many of those children will \nthemselves be HIV-positive. The prospect of 40 million children without \nhope, health and often without any support whatsoever is as dangerous \nas it is tragic. These children are susceptible to substance abuse, \nprostitution, banditry or, as we have seen so often on the continent, \nchild soldiery. It will be an economic strain on weakening or \ncompletely broken economies, and an extremely volatile element in \nstrained societies.\n  The human cost of AIDS is already alarmingly high, and the trends are \nincreasingly terrifying--even apocalyptic.\n  Sub-Saharan Africa has been far more severely affected by AIDS than \nany other part of the world. It is our greatest challenge. I have seen \nthe effects of its ravages on the people of that continent firsthand. \nThe potential is clearly written in the appalling statistics of the \ndisease today.\n  According to December 1999 United Nations data, some 23.3 million \nadults and children are infected with the HIV virus in the region, \nwhich has about 10 percent of the world's population but nearly 70 \npercent of the worldwide total of infected people. In Botswana, \nNamibia, Zambia, and Zimbabwean estimated 20 percent to 26 percent of \nadults are infected with HIV, and 13 percent of adults in South Africa \nwere infected as the end of 1997.\n\n  An estimated 13.7 million Africans have lost their lives to AIDS, \nincluding 2.2 million who died in 1998. The overall rate of infection \namong adults in sub-Saharan Africa is about 8 percent compared with a \n1.1 percent infection rate worldwide.\n  AIDS has surpassed malaria as the leading cause of death in sub-\nSaharan Africa, and it kills many times more people than Africa's armed \nconflicts.\n  Sub-Saharan Africa is the only region in which women are infected \nwith HIV at a higher rate than men. According to UNAIDS, women make up \nan estimated 55 percent of the HIV-positive adult population in sub-\nSaharan Africa, as compared with 35 percent in the Caribbean, the next \nhighest-ranking region, and 20 percent in North America. Young women \nare particularly at risk. A U.N. study found girls aged 15-19 to be \ninfected at a rate of 15 percent to 23 percent, while infection rates \namong boys of the same age were 3 percent to 4 percent.\n  The African AIDS epidemic is having a much greater impact on children \nthan is the case in other parts of the world. An estimated 600,000 \nAfrican infants become infected with HIV each year through mother to \nchild transmission, either at birth or through breast-feeding.\n  At least 7.8 million African children have lost either their mother \nor both parents to AIDS, and thus are regarded by UNAIDS as ``AIDS \norphans.'' South Africa is expected to have one million AIDS orphans by \n2004. An estimated 10 million or more African children will have lost \neither their mother or both parents to AIDS by the end of the year \n2000. In some urban areas of Africa, orphans comprise up to 15 percent \nof all children. Many of these children are themselves infected with \nHIV/AIDS and often face rejection from their extended families and from \ntheir communities.\n  In its January 17, 2000 issue. Newsweek projected that there will be \n10.4 million African AIDS orphans by the end of 2000. UNAIDS reports \nthat AIDS orphans, suspected of carrying the disease, generally run a \ngreater risk of being malnourished and of being denied an education.\n  At current infection and growth rates for HIV/AIDS, the National \nIntelligence Council estimates that the number of AIDS orphans \nworldwide will increase dramatically, potentially increasing three-fold \nor more in the next ten years, contributing to economic decay, social \nfragmentation, and political destabilization in already volatile and \nstrained societies. Children without care or hope are often drawn into \nprostitution, crime, substance abuse or child soldiery.\n  The majority of governments in areas of sub-Saharan Africa facing the \ngreatest burden of AIDS orphans are largely ill-prepared to adequately \naddress the rapid growth in the number of children who have no means of \nsupport, no education nor access to other opportunities.\n  Donors must focus on adequate preparations for the explosion in the \nnumber of orphans and the burden they will place on families, \ncommunities, economies, and governments. Support structures and \nincentives for families, communities and institutions which will \nprovide care for children orphaned by HIV/AIDS, or for the children who \nare themselves infected by HIV/AIDS, will become increasingly important \nas the number of AIDS orphans increases dramatically.\n\n  By providing a knowledge, skills, and hope orphaned children might \nnot otherwise have, education is an especially critical part of a long \nterm strategy. Education is the key to providing opportunity and \nfighting poverty, and education is essential to winning the battle \nagainst the HIV/AIDS epidemic.\n  The legislation does not focus solely on Africa, but reflects the \nfact that the grip of the disease is tightening around the developing \nworld. Some of the mechanisms are new and yet untested. But in their \ndesign, their potential for being the most effective tools at our \ndisposal is clear.\n  We need to be mindful that the United States can be a great force for \ngood in the world. Certainly, Americans are very charitable and \ncompassionate people, and the political will exists to take a more \naggressive posture toward combating AIDS.\n  However, our job is to determine how best to use our limited \nresources to maximize their potential for good on the African \ncontinent. These are life and death decisions which cannot be addressed \nsimply by allocating more funds, confident that we have thus done our \npart. How we direct or allocate those resources has the potential to \nsignificantly affect the situation.\n  Questions and issues involved in life and death decisions are not \neasy. They are decisions based on the understanding that you cannot \nhelp or save all in need in a situation, but must make decisions based \non the best information and understanding of your strengths and \nlimitations.\n  Over the next two years, the legislation authorizes $300 million per \nyear for ongoing HIV/AIDS programs worldwide. That represents a \nsignificant increase in our commitment and is well above the \nPresident's request. The United States has been a leader in AIDS \nprevention programs and in AIDS treatment and programs to mitigate the \ndevastating societal and economic effects of the epidemic. We should \ncontinue that leadership and even strengthen it.\n  Additionally, the legislation authorizes $100 million to the Global \nAlliance for Vaccines Initiative, know by its acronym, GAVI, which \nreceives both public and private funding to provide existing vaccines \nto children worldwide, and to provide incentives for the development of \nnew vaccines. Often, companies determine that it is not possible to \ncommit the capital to research and development toward developing \nvaccines for diseases such as malaria. While the potential number of \nrecipients is great, the potential number of purchasers is very small. \nBy providing a clear purchaser for the future, GAVI addresses much of \nthe questions involving the risks of investing in such research.\n  The legislation goes beyond incentives alone. Over two years, it \ncommits $20 million to the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, or \nIAVI, a group which is committed to developing the ultimate weapon \nagainst the continued spread of HIV: a vaccine.\n  The legislation does not seek to act unilaterally, but has two \ncritical elements which will help use our leadership position to \nleverage greater cooperation to combat the epidemic.\n  First, it seeks to establish a global trust for programs to combat \nthe transmission of HIV and to respond to the devastation of AIDS. \nUnder the legislation, the United States can contribute up to $150 \nmillion per year for two years to capitalize the fund. Of that, $50 \nmillion annually is specifically targeted to address the great human \ntragedy and most daunting challenge of AIDS orphans. Undoubtedly, the \ninitial generous contribution of the United States will spur many more \ncommitments from other nations.\n  The legislation does not leave the question of orphans to the trust \nfund alone. It also directs the United States\n\n[[Page S7622]]\n\nto begin coordinating a global strategy to address the orphans crisis, \nespecially in caring for them and educating them. This is in addition \nto the specific focus on education and care of orphans in Africa \nmandated in the initial authorization of ongoing programs and in the \ntrust fund. Only education can provide the tools for these children to \nescape the poverty, violence and exploitation that they will often \nface. The strong emphasis on this explosive and frightening problem is \none of the most forward looking approaches to international health yet \nconsidered by Congress. I cannot overemphasize the importance of these \nprovisions.\n  The legislation also addresses the increasing threat of tuberculosis \nworldwide. The diseases' resurgence is a clear and direct threat to the \nUnited States' public health. Astonishingly, the World Health \nOrganization estimates that one third of the world's population is \ninfected with tuberculosis. With the increasingly drug resistant \nstrains of the disease emerging yearly, the urgency of the initiative \nis critical. The legislation authorizes $60 million each year for two \nyears for programs to combat the disease. That figure represents a \nsubstantial increase in our efforts to ensure our own safety and health \nand to combat the scourge worldwide.\n  Overall, this legislation represents a clear recognition of the \nimportance to our own health and security to combating infectious \ndisease worldwide. More significantly, though, it is a monumental new \ncommitment by the United States to combat the death and suffering of \nour fellow humans. It is a great demonstration of America's generosity \nand our hope to improve the lives and potential of all people.\n  Mr. KERRY. I am pleased to join the distinguished chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee, Mr. Helms, and the Chairman of the Africa \nSubcommittee, Dr. Frist, in bringing this very important bill to the \nSenate.\n  Mr. President, the human toll of the AIDS crisis in Africa is \nstupefying. More than 30 million people now live with AIDS and annual \nAIDS-related fatalities hit a record 2.6 million last year. Ninety-five \npercent of all cases are found in the developing world. AIDS is now the \nleading cause of death in Africa and the fourth leading cause of death \nin the world. In at least 5 Africans countries, more than 20 percent of \nadults are HIV-positive.\n  The AIDS epidemic is more devastating than wars: in 1998 in Africa, \n200,000 people died from armed conflict; 2.2 million died from AIDS--\nmore than 5,000 Africans died every day from the disease.\n  This week, the U.S. Census Bureau announced new demographic findings \nfor Africa. Because of AIDS, Botswana, Zimbabwe and South Africa will \nexperience negative population growth in the next five years. Without \nAIDS, these countries would have experienced a 2-3 percent increase in \npopulation. Children born within the past 5 years in Namibia, Swaziland \nand Zimbabwe can expect to die before the age of 35. Without AIDS, \ntheir life expectancy would have been 70. In addition, a new and very \ntroubling statistic was announced this week: UNAIDS reported that 55 \npercent of all HIV-infections were in women. So AIDS is not only \nrobbing societies of young women but also of the child they might have \nhad.\n  It is not hyperbole to say that this is Africa's worst social \ncatastrophe since slavery, and the world's worst health crisis since \nthe bubonic plague.\n  Other parts of the world are going down the same path as Africa. \nInfection rates in Asia are climbing rapidly, with several countries, \nespecially India, on the brink of large-scale expansion of the \nepidemic. When I was in India in December, epidemiologist from our \ngovernment as well as Indian officials admitted that the number of \ncases in Asia could surpass those of Africa by the year 2010.\n  In addition, countries of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe \nare especially vulnerable, as Russia is experiencing one of the highest \nincreases in infection rates of any single country in the world last \nyear. Is this the kind of world we want for the 21st century? In this \nage of remarkable biotechnical and biomedical breakthroughs, when we \nhave cures of impotence and treatments for depression, do we want to \nignore a public health crisis of biblical proportions? When we're \ntalking about the democratization of the developing world, when we're \ntalking about the triumph of capitalism and open markets, when we're \ntalking about the benefits of globalization, we cannot remain silent--\nas rich as we are in talent, technology and money--about the threat \nAIDS poses to our national security.\n  Mr. President, last week, the 13th annual International Conference on \nAIDS was taking place in Durban, South Africa. It was the first time \nthis international conference is being held in a country in the \nepicenter of the AIDS pandemic in the developing world.\n  A number of important breakthroughs have been announced from the \nConference and the Senate should be aware of them:\n  Pharmaceutical companies have announced that they are prepared to \noffer their life-extending therapies to the developing world at no cost \nor at a very discounted rate. Merck will provide Botswana with $100 \nmillion in medicine over the next five years. Abbott Laboratories \nconfirmed that it will initiate a charitable program in Tanzania, \nBurkina Faso, Romania and India. Boehringer Ingelheim will give away \none of the most important drugs in preventing the transmission of HIV \nfrom mother to child--Viramune--to developing countries over the next 5 \nyears. Similarly, Pfizer recently promised to give South Africa its \neffective product--Diflucan--which is used for treating a deadly brain \ninfection associated with AIDS.\n  These are all important developments. Access to these pharmaceutical \nproducts has historically been prevented by high price, and these \ncompanies should continue to work with governments and philanthropies \nlike the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation--which today is announcing \nanother $90 million in grants to combat AIDS in the developing world. \nThe contribution made by Bill and Melinda Gates to fighting infectious \ndiseases cannot be overstated. Through their philanthropy, they have \ngiven countries which are being ravaged by disease a fighting chance.\n  Fighting and winning the war against AIDS is more than just giving \naway medicine. We must continue to bolster the research into a cure. To \nthis end, a number of significant biomedical breakthroughs have come \nout of Durban. The most significant is the announcement by the \nInternational AIDS Vaccine Initiative of human trials of a new vaccine \ncandidate against AIDS. Development of an effective AIDS vaccine is \ncritical especially in Africa where preventive measures--such as \nencouraging change in high-risk behaviors and debunking deadly myths--\nwill do little to slow the spread of HIV in countries which have a 20 \nor 25 percent infection rate. It is clear that the only hope for these \ncountries is a cure: that means, developing an effective vaccine and \nassuring its affordable distribution.\n  And, we have a responsibility to act in this increasingly intertwined \nworld because, together with all the benefits associated with \nglobalization, we also now are facing a range of new threats that know \nno borders and move without prejudice--international crime, cyber-\nterrorism, drug-trafficking and infectious diseases.\n  We are seeing a rise in the number of previously unknown lethal and \npotent disease agents identified since 1973--the ebola virus, hepatitis \nC, drug-resistant tuberculosis, West Nile virus and HIV. These diseases \naffect all of us, including American citizens. New Yorkers know the \nscare associated with these heretofore unknown diseases--last summer \nNew York City was held captive by an encephalitis scare and new \noutbreaks this year have already been spotted in pigeons. There was a \nshock in the scientific community when it was discovered that outbreak \nof the mosquito-borne disease in New York was not, as scientists had \nbelieved, St Louis encephalitis: instead, it was a deadly variant of \nWest Nile virus, a disease hitherto found only in Africa, the Middle \nEast and parts of West Asia. United States health officials now fear \nthat the disease may now become prevalent in the Americans. Similarly, \nit is foolhardly and dangerous to believe that any infectious disease \ncan be adequately contained in one region. We are all at-risk.\n\n  Militaries are not immune; in fact, they are in some cases even more \nsusceptible to upheaval and instability\n\n[[Page S7623]]\n\nfrom infectious diseases, especially AIDS. Some militaries in Africa \nhave HIV-infection rates which top 40 percent. These military forces \ncould be part of the solution for democratization in Africa in terms of \npeacekeeping and conflict prevention; instead, African armed services \nare losing their military effectiveness and adding to the social \ninstability.\n  It is projected that Africa will be home to 40 million children, \norphaned by AIDS, by the year 2010. Zambia is a country of 11 million \npeople--half a million of them will be AIDS orphans. We know from other \nregions of the world--like Cambodia and Burma--that exploited children \nare common targets by rogue militias and narco- and other criminal \norganizations. It is clearly in our interest to stem this activity.\n  Likewise, economies are not immune. In fact, development of the last \n20 years is being reversed in the countries hardest-hit by AIDS. AIDS \ncost Namibia almost 8 percent of its GDP in 1996. Tanzania will \nexperience a 15 to 25 percent drop in its GDP because of AIDS over the \nnext decade. Over the next few years, Kenya's GDP will be 14.5 percent \nless than it would have been absent AIDS. AIDS consumes more than 50 \npercent of already meager health budgets. In many African countries, \nthe total annual per capita health-care budget is $10. 80 percent of \nthe urban hospital beds in Malawi are filled with AIDS patients--all is \na direct threat on evolving democratic development and free-market \ntransition. Mozambique and Botswana have two of the world's fastest \ngrowing economies but this economic growth cannot be maintained when \nthose countries' workforces are being decimated with the daily deaths \nof hundreds of people in their most productive years. In the Cote \nd'Ivoire, a teacher dies of complications associated with AIDS every \nschool day. In South Africa, businesses owners often hire and train two \nemployees for one job, knowing that one will probably die from AIDS.\n  As we celebrated the passage this year of the Africa Trade bill, how \ncan we seriously think that a vibrant market for products or investment \ncan be formed on a continent which will lose up to 20 percent of its \npopulation in the next decade? To lure investors, the continent has \nalready had to battle underdevelopment and racism, but now, some people \nin the developed world will see Africa as only as a place of disease. \nThis is wrong and it is a direct threat to our national economic \ninterests.\n  Governments are not immune. This epidemic is causing leadership \ncrises in some African countries. President Benjamin Mkapa of Tanzania \nreported last week that ``some ministries lose about 20 employees each \nmonth to AIDS.''\n  African governments are grappling with the devastation wrought by HIV \non their economies and their societies. It is difficult to fathom the \nchallenges they face with this public health crisis, and some of the \nactions sometimes baffle western observers. Some critics have recently \npointed to the questions raised by President Thabo Mbeki of South \nAfrica as to the origins of AIDS and as to the proper course of \ntreatment. When it comes to dealing with AIDS, there are moral \nquestions, there are budgetary constraints, there are political \ndecisions. But there are also some biomedical truths. Senator Frist and \nI have discussed these issues with the distinguished ambassador from \nSouth Africa and followed up with President Mbeki when he came to \nWashington on a state visit. Leadership is necessary from both the \nUnited States and from Africa--this issue cannot be solved by one \nnation alone. But no one country can ignore it either. President Mbeki \nhas focused his attention on fighting the AIDS epidemic by fighting \npoverty. In his remarks in Durban, he missed an opportunity by refusing \nto state unequivocally that HIV causes AIDS. And, I fear, his questions \nwill allow those who engaged in risky and unsafe practices to continue. \nOnly bashing pharmaceutical companies is not helpful in the fight \nagainst AIDS, and the participants at the International Conference on \nAIDS rightly passed a resolution in support of the tested science of \nAIDS.\n  One can argue--and I do not at all subscribe to that argument--that \nAfrica does not matter to the security interests of the United States. \nSome even mock the suggestion. I believe that this is not an issue of \nwhich any decent rational human being can be dismissive. One \nhumanitarian terms, on political terms, on cultural terms, on economic \nterms, on historical terms, no one should dare be dismissive. We are \nlinked to everything that is happening in Africa, starting back to our \nnation's and civilization's earliest history, and we are now tied by \nthe new forces of globalization and technology. And I hope that we will \nalways be tied by who we are and what we are as nation. This really \ntests the fiber of our country, in a sense, and questions whether we \nare prepared to deal with this threat.\n  But even if you subscribe to the view that the AIDS disaster in \nAfrica is not a threat to our national security, you have to at least \nrecognize that unfettered spread of this horrendous virus to other \nregions of the world--including North America--is certainly a threat. \nAs goes Africa, so goes India and China--and no one in this Senate can \nmake the argument that an India or a China, destabilized by a public \nhealth catastrophe, can be ignored in terms of our national security \ninterests.\n  The window of opportunity is now open to making a real difference in \nAfrica and improving global health, and that is why I am so pleased \nthat the Senate is acting with all dispatch to make a significant \ncontribution to fighting the epidemic in Africa. This bill builds upon \nthe work of many of our most thoughtful and distinguished colleagues. \nIt includes initiatives that Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi, Senator Frist \nand I began many months ago to speed vaccine development, to deal with \nAIDS orphans and to alleviate the suffering of those infected with HIV \non the African continent. It also incorporates the plan Senator Frist, \nCongressman Leach and I have devised to inaugurate AIDS prevention \ngrants from the World Bank. Senator Durbin and I proposed a plan to \nassist AIDS orphans, and the spirit of that legislation is found \nthroughout this bill. Senator Boxer and Senator Gordon Smith have \ncalled for funding increases to AIDS prevention programs in Africa; \nSenator Moynihan and Senator Feingold have a proposal to target money \nto prevent further infection among infants. Their contributions can be \nseen in this bill.\n  The work of the appropriators has been and will continue to be vital \nin funding programs to assist Africa. I commend Senator Leahy and \nSenator McConnell for increasing funding for the existing \nappropriations accounts on global health in the Foreign Operations bill \nand I am very grateful that they have agreed to fund the Global \nAlliance for Vaccines and Immunizations (GAVI) which I have been urging \nfor a year now.\n  I would also like to acknowledge the significant contribution of the \ndistinguished Senator from North Carolina, Mr. Helms. I commend the \nChairman and our ranking member, Senator Biden, for their leadership. \nThey have ensured that this session will not close until we have passed \nthe largest single response by our Nation to the global AIDS epidemic.\n  It is my hope that the other body will move to pass these vital \nproposals with all necessary speed. It is clearly in our national \ninterests--security, economic, political, health and moral--to do all \nwe can to solve this crisis. Let me be clear on this, Mr. President, my \ncommitment to this issue is not transitory. I will not rest on this \nlegislative victory. I will be back next year and every year after that \nuntil this public health disaster is over.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Global AIDS and \nTuberculosis Relief Act of 2000. This bill recognizes the awesome and \nterrible scope of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and responds with what is \ntruly required to address it--a program far more comprehensive and \nsubstantial than what is entailed in the status quo.\n  The numbers one must use to describe the crisis are numbing. More \nthan 70 percent of all people living with AIDS live in sub-Saharan \nAfrica, and as the ranking member of the Senate Subcommittee on Africa, \nI have seen firsthand the devastating toll that the disease has taken \nin the region. In Africa alone, 15,900,000 people have died because of \nAIDS, and the World Bank has identified the disease as the fastest-\ngrowing threat to development in the region. Life expectancies are \ndropping dramatically, and the social fall-\n\n[[Page S7624]]\n\nout from this horrific upheaval has forced us to confront the disease \nnot just as an epidemiological threat, but as a security threat as \nwell. Nearly 4,500,000 children have HIV and more are being infected at \nthe rate of one child every minute. According to UNAIDS, by the end of \n1999, AIDS had left 13,200,000 orphaned children in its wake.\n  This bill is a serious effort to confront this monstrous crisis. It \nwill provide hundreds of millions of dollars in assistance to \nstrengthen prevention efforts, to combat mother-to-child transmission, \nto improve access to testing, counseling, and care, and to assist the \norphans left in the wake of the disease. Through a new AIDS trust fund, \nit will leverage U.S. assistance with a multilateral approach and \nthrough innovative partnerships with the private sector. The bill \nprovides support to the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations \nand to the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, so that even as we \naddress the urgent needs of the present, we work toward a solution in \nthe future. The bill insists that AIDS education be provided to troops \ntrained under the auspices of the African Crisis Response Initiative. \nIt recognizes the inextricable link between HIV/AIDS and the resurgence \nof tuberculosis. It goes beyond the President's request and beyond \nanything that this Congress has contemplated since the epidemic began.\n  The bill is not perfect, of course. The needs are great and the \nproblem multi-faceted. I would still like to see this Congress address \nthe important issue of access to pharmaceuticals, and to put strong \nlanguage into statute that would prohibit the executive branch from \npressuring countries in crisis to revoke or change laws aimed at \nincreasing access to HIV/AIDS drugs, so long as the laws in question \nadhere to existing international regulations governing trade. This bill \ndoes not absolve this Senate of a continued responsibility to address \nthe global AIDS crisis. But it is remarkable, all the same.\n  This bill has the unanimous support of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee. Senators Helms, Boxer, Frist, Kerry, and Biden have worked \non it tirelessly. It includes provisions originally drafted in the \nMother-to-Child HIV Prevention Act, a bill authored by Senator Moynihan \nof which I was proud to be an original co-sponsor. It reflects the \nadmirable work of the House and in particular of Congresswoman Barbara \nLee and Congressman Leach, and it should reach the President's desk \nquite quickly. Rarely does such a substantive, ground-breaking bill \nenjoy this degree of bipartisan consensus. It is a tribute to my \ncolleagues and a testimony to the undeniable magnitude and urgency of \nthe crisis that the Senate stands ready to pass this legislation today.\n  Just days ago, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Richard \nHolbrooke testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. When \nhe was speaking about the AIDS crisis, he spoke of its impact and of \nthe place the epidemic has already taken in history, and said, ``All of \nus will have to ask ourselves, when our careers are done, did we \naddress this problem?'' This bill is an important part of the answer to \nthat question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today the Senate is taking a big step \nforward in the fight against international AIDS and Tuberculosis. \nToday's passage of H.R. 3519, the Global AIDS and Tuberculosis Relief \nAct of 2000, will help those throughout the world who are suffering \nfrom these deadly infectious diseases.\n  I am particularly pleased that this legislation includes two bills \nthat I introduced earlier in the 106th Congress. In February, I \nintroduced the Global AIDS Prevention Act (S. 2026). This legislation \nauthorizes $300 million in bilateral aid for those nations most \nseverely affected by HIV and AIDS. It calls on the United States Agency \nfor International Development to make HIV and AIDS a priority in its \nforeign assistance program and undertake a comprehensive, coordinated \neffort to combat HIV and AIDS. This assistance will include primary \nprevention and education, voluntary testing and counseling, medications \nto prevent the transmission of HIV and AIDS from mother to child, and \ncare for those living with HIV or AIDS.\n  H.R. 3519 also includes legislation I introduced last year, the \nInternational Tuberculosis Control Act (S. 1497). This bill authorizes \n$60 million in aid to fight the growing international problem of \ntuberculosis. With this legislation, the United States Agency for \nInternational Development will coordinate with the World Health \nOrganization, the Centers for Disease Control, the National Institutes \nof Health, and other organizations toward the development and \nimplementation of a comprehensive tuberculosis control program. This \nbill also sets as a goal the detection of at least 70 percent of the \ncases of infectious tuberculosis and the cure of at least 85 percent of \nthe cases detected by 2010.\n  H.R. 3519 has other important provisions as well. The bill includes a \n$10 million contribution to the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative \nand a $50 million contribution to the Global Alliance for Vaccines and \nImmunizations. It also contains provisions calling for the \nestablishment of a World Bank AIDS Trust Fund with the Secretary of the \nTreasury authorized to provide $150 million for payment to the fund.\n  I want to thank all of the members of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee for their work on this legislation. I am particularly \ngrateful for the efforts of Chairman Helms in pushing this bill \nforward.\n  This is an important step in the fight against AIDS and TB. I have no \ndoubt that greater resources will be needed in future years to continue \nthis effort. I am hopeful that the Senate will continue to treat the \nissue of infectious diseases with the seriousness it deserves.\n  There are 34 million people today living with HIV/AIDS, and one-third \nof the world's population is infected with tuberculosis. Much more \nneeds to be done, and I am proud of the Senate for taking this action \ntoday.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and passed, as amended, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 3519), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/26/senate-section/article/S7624-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7624-S7629]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TREASURY AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT OF 2001--MOTION TO \n                           PROCEED--Continued\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I will now turn to the subject that has \nbeen raised today and yesterday and last week and repeatedly in the \nlast few weeks. That is the subject of why the Senate is not proceeding \non the pace and with the vigor we all think it should. We have heard \nfrom the Senator from Rhode Island and others today about how the \nmajority leader has somehow dictatorially brought everything to a \nterrible halt and wouldn't it be wonderful if we went back to the great \nspirit of cooperation and comity that allows us to get things done. I \nagree absolutely that it would be wonderful to return to the spirit of \ncooperation and comity that would allow things to be done, but I think \nit is pointing the finger in the wrong place to attack the majority \nleader.\n  Let me share with you my experience this last week. Monday of this \nweek was July 24, which in my home State is the biggest day of the \nyear. July 24 happens to be the day that Brigham Young and the first \ngroup of Mormon pioneers entered Salt Lake Valley and put down roots \nthat have now become not only Salt Lake Valley but the State of Utah. \nEvery year we celebrate that historic event with a major parade. It is \none of the requirements for a politician to be in that parade. Senator \nHatch and I always confer about whether or not we will be able to make \nthe parade because we don't want to miss votes. There have been times \nwhen we have had to miss the parade to be here to do our appropriate \nduty.\n  On Friday of last week, I went to the staff of the leadership and \nsaid: What is going to happen on Monday? I was told: We will be on \nenergy and water. There will be amendments and there will be votes.\n  I then went to the subcommittee chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee and said to him--this being Senator Domenici--how important \nwill the votes be and how many will there be?\n\n[[Page S7625]]\n\n  Senator Domenici said: Well, there will be several votes, but I think \nthey will be relatively unimportant ones. They will not be close.\n  I said: Well, Senator, I think under those circumstances, I will go \nto Utah and ride in the July 24 parade. If you can assure me that it \nwill not create an undue hardship for you with respect to passing \nimportant amendments that my vote would not be absolutely essential, I \nthink I will go to Utah.\n  He told me: Senator, you can go to Utah. I will see to it that the \namendments that we vote on on Monday will not be so close that your \nvote would have made that much of a difference.\n  So I went to Utah. When I got back, I said to my staff: How many \nvotes did I miss and how important were they? I found out I didn't miss \nany votes. The Senate didn't vote. Why? The Senate didn't take up the \nbill. Why? Because the minority objected to the motion to proceed, and \nthe majority leader was required to file a cloture motion on the motion \nto proceed to consider the bill.\n  I have made the statement in this Chamber before that based on my \nexperience, I can remember a time when no one ever objected to a motion \nto proceed. A filibuster on the issue of the motion to proceed was \nsomething that was unheard of from either side. We have been told this \nafternoon ``couldn't we go back to the time when people got along with \neach other'' from the same side of the aisle that has said: We will \nfilibuster the motion to proceed.\n\n  So the majority leader had to file a cloture petition. He filed the \ncloture petition. We voted on it. When we voted on it, it was passed \noverwhelmingly, if not unanimously. That raises the question: Why did \nwe go through this exercise? Why couldn't we have been on the bill at \nthe time we were scheduled to be on the bill? Why are we in this \nsituation now when we are under a cloture situation running off 30 \nhours on the clock so we can then finally get around to voting on the \nbill, knowing that as soon as we get through with this one, there will \nbe another one where there will be objection to the motion to proceed, \nthe requirement that a cloture petition be filed, and the running off \nthe clock again?\n  There are various ways to defeat legislation. One of them is to delay \nit. I said once before, I worry this Chamber has started to move from \nbeing the world's greatest deliberative body to being the world's \ngreatest campaign forum. I am distressed by reports in the popular \npress that say that the Vice President and his party intend to run \nagainst a do-nothing Congress. We are doing everything we can to make \nthis a do-something Congress, but there are forces at work to try to \ncreate the prophecy of a do-nothing Congress into a self-fulfilling \nprophecy.\n  It can be done in such a way that the public at large doesn't \nunderstand what is going on. The public at large doesn't know what \ncloture means. I go home to my constituents and I try to explain what \nis going on. They don't understand what the motion to proceed is. They \ndon't understand the rules of the Senate. You talk to them about \nunanimous consent agreements that are not being agreed to, agreements \nthat are made between the two leaders that then get set aside and \ncloture petitions, their eyes glaze over when you start talking like \nthat. They come back to you--these are my constituents--and they say: \nWhy aren't you getting your work done?\n  When you have to make these kinds of explanations, the public gets \nimpatient, which plays into the hands of those whose electoral strategy \nis run against a do-nothing Congress. I have started to use that \nlanguage, as I explain to my constituents why we are not getting the \npeople's work done. I say to them very deliberately--and it pains me \nbecause I do not want to cast clouds over this institution, but I \nbelieve I have to say it anyway--there are those who want to run \nagainst a do-nothing Congress who are determined to create a do-nothing \nCongress. And in the Senate, the rules are such that you can do that. \nThe rules are such that even if you are in the minority, if you want to \nbring this place to its knees and bring it to a halt, you can do that.\n  I have been in the minority. I have heard some of my fellow party \nmembers in the minority say: We have to bring this place to a halt; we \nhave to shut it down. I am glad I didn't participate in the attempts on \nthe part of the minority to shut this place down when George Mitchell \nwas the majority leader; when George Mitchell did many of the things \nthat Trent Lott is now being accused of doing; when George Mitchell \nsaid: We have to do the people's business, even if it means, as \nmajority leader, I exercise something of an iron fist to make sure we \ndo the people's business; I will do it and we will get the people's \nbusiness done. Those on this side of the aisle who said in my hearing, \n``let's shut this place down,'' did not prevail.\n  I did not participate with them, and I am proud of that fact, that we \ndid not attempt to shut this place down. Were we frustrated? \nAbsolutely. Were we upset? Absolutely. Did we engage in filibusters, \nyes, straight up. My assigned time was from 1 to 2 o'clock in the \nmorning in a filibuster, when George Mitchell said: If the Republicans \nare going to filibuster us, let's go around the clock. I was very up \nfront about it. I believed the bill that we were talking about was \nsufficiently bad that I was willing to take my turn from 1 to 2 o'clock \nin the morning to see to it that the bill didn't pass.\n  That is part of the game around here. That is the way the rules are \nstructured. I have no problem with that. But objecting to the rule to \nproceed, which is the kind of thing the public doesn't understand, but \nthat all of us understand, is a stealth filibuster. It is an attempt to \nslip under the public awareness, shut this place down, and create a \nsituation where you can then run against a do-nothing Congress.\n  I remember the first person to run against a do-nothing Congress--\nHarry Truman. I remember what Harry Truman did. It was very different \nfrom what is being done here. Let's get a little history here.\n  Harry Truman was President of the United States by virtue of Franklin \nRoosevelt's death. He had not run for President, he had not been \nelected, and he was not very popular in the country. The Republicans \ncontrolled both Houses of Congress as a result of Harry Truman's lack \nof popularity, and they were absolutely sure they were going to win the \n1948 election. So they were determined they were not going to pass any \nlegislation that Harry Truman could veto. They were going to wait until \nThomas Dewey became President of the United States, and then they were \ngoing to pass their legislation for a President who would sign it.\n  They held the Republican National Convention, and in the convention \nthey outlined all of the things they were going to do, once they were \nin power, in both the Congress and the executive branch. Well, Harry \nTruman called their bluff. Harry Truman said: If that's what the \nRepublicans really will do when they are in charge, let them do it now. \nHe called the Congress back into session after the Republican \nconvention and said to them: Here is your opportunity. Here is your \nplatform. Pass your platform.\n  Well, Robert Taft, who was the dominant Republican--the man whose \npicture graces the outer lobby here as one of the five greatest \nSenators who ever lived--made what I think was a miscalculation. He \nthought Harry Truman was so unpopular in the country at large that the \nCongress could thumb its nose at the President of the United States, \nand he said: We are not going to do anything in this special session \nthat the President has called us into. We are not going to play his \ngame.\n  So the Republican Congress adjourned after that special session \nwithout having done anything--deliberately, without having done \nanything. Harry Truman then went out and ran against the do-nothing \n80th Congress and got himself elected in his own right as President of \nthe United States. It was one of the great political moves of this \ncentury.\n  That is not what we are dealing with here. We are not dealing with a \nRepublican Party that doesn't want to act. We are not dealing with a \nRepublican Party that doesn't want to solve the people's problems. We \nare dealing with a Republican Party that is trying desperately to \nperform the one absolutely required constitutional function that the \nCongress has, which is to fund the Government. We are trying to pass \nappropriations bills to fund the Government, so that there will not be \na Government shutdown, there will not be a continuing resolution, there \nwill not be a crisis at the end of the fiscal year.\n\n[[Page S7626]]\n\nWhen we try to move to the bills that will fund the Government, we run \ninto procedural roadblocks on the part of those who are then talking \nabout running against a do-nothing Congress. That is what is going on \nhere.\n  If we have to say it again and again and again, so that \nour constituents finally begin to understand it, I am willing to say it \nagain and again and again. We have discovered that one of the \nstrategies being played out in this great campaign forum is to take an \namendment that is seen as a tough political vote, bring it up, see it \ndefeated, and then the next week bring it up again, and then complain \nwhen the Republicans say we have already voted on that; we don't need \nto vote on it again. Oh, yes, you do, says the leadership on the other \nside; let's vote on it again.\n\n  If we vote on it again and defeat it, thinking, OK, we have had a \ndebate and we have taken our tough political votes and we have made it \nclear where we stand on this issue, let's move forward, no, we are told \nsomehow when you want to move forward without bringing up this \namendment again: You are thwarting the will of the Senate; you are \nturning the Senate into another version of the House of Representatives \nif you won't let us vote on this controversial amendment a third time.\n  If it gets voted on a third time, then it comes up a fourth time. If \nit gets voted on a fourth time, it comes up a fifth time. Every time \nthe majority leader says: We have done that, we have debated that, we \nhave voted on that, he is told: No, if you take a position that \nprevents us from voting on it again, you are destroying the sanctity of \nthis institution.\n  Well, now we are being told we are interfering with the President's \nconstitutional right to appoint judges. I find that very interesting \nbecause this Congress has confirmed more judges in an election year \nthan previous Congresses. Quoting from my colleague, the chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee, and therefore in a position to have the \nstatistics, there are fewer vacancies in the Federal judiciary now than \nwhen the Democrats controlled the Congress and the Republicans \ncontrolled the White House in an election year. If I may quote from \nSenator Hatch:\n\n       Democrats contend that things were much better when they \n     controlled the Senate. Much better for them, perhaps. It was \n     certainly not better for many of the nominees of Presidents \n     Reagan and Bush. At the end of the Bush administration, for \n     example, the vacancy rate stood at nearly 12 percent. By \n     contrast, as the Clinton administration draws to a close, the \n     vacancy rate stands at just 7 percent.\n\n  Well, turning it around, the vacancy rate we are facing now is \nroughly half that which a Democratic Senate gave to President Bush as \nhe was facing reelection. Oh, but we are being told: No, there are \njudges who have languished for a long time; therefore, we should have a \nvote on the judges whose names have been before us the longest before \nwe have a vote on the judges who may have been nominated more recently, \nand it is terrible to hold a judge or any nominee for a long period of \ntime. We need to give him or her a vote. We need to bring the names to \nthe floor of the Senate, and the minority leader should decide which \nname is brought to the floor of the Senate.\n  I remember when I first came to this body, I was assigned to the \nBanking Committee. There was a nominee sent forward by President \nClinton whom the chairman of the Banking Committee didn't like. The \nchairman of the Banking Committee at the time was, of course, a member \nof President Clinton's own party. But his objection, as I understood \nit--and I may be wrong--was that this particular nominee had too much \nRepublican background on his resume, that this particular nominee had \nnot been ideologically pure enough for the chairman of the Banking \nCommittee.\n  As I say, that is my memory, and I could be wrong. But that was the \nvery strong position on the part of the chairman of the Banking \nCommittee. That nominee didn't come up for a hearing before the Banking \nCommittee for the entire 2 years that the Democrats controlled the \nBanking Committee and that man was the chairman. Any attempt on the \npart of anybody else to get that particular nomination moving was \nthwarted by the chairman.\n  Now, what if the then-minority leader, Senator Dole, had come to the \nfloor and said we will not allow anything to go forward until this \nnominee comes to the floor for a vote?\n  How would people have reacted to that kind of action on the part of \nthe minority leader if the entire minority had gathered around him, and \nsaid: We will stand with you, we will filibuster the motion to proceed, \nand we will do everything we can to bring the Senate to a complete halt \nuntil this nominee that has languished in the Banking Committee for \nalmost 2 years is brought forward? I am pretty sure I know what George \nMitchell would have told Bob Dole. I am pretty sure I know what the \nmajority leader would have said under those circumstances. It probably \nwould not be as mild as the comments Trent Lott is currently making \nabout the present demands that are being made with respect to specific \njudges by name--not the agreement that the minority leader and the \nmajority leader made where the majority leader said: All right, we will \nmove forward on judges; we will bring a determined number of judges \nforward--but to say, no, we are now changing, and we are demanding a \nspecific name be brought forward or we will shut the whole place down, \nand then come to the floor and say somehow the work of the people is \nnot getting done.\n  I am willing to take the tough votes that are being referred to on \nthe floor. I have taken the votes on guns. I have taken the votes on \nabortion. I have taken the votes on minimum wage. I have taken the \nvotes on Patients' Bill of Rights. I have taken the votes on \nprescription drugs for seniors. I have a record now that I will have to \nstand and defend before my constituents. Those votes have been taken \nbecause the minority has had the right to bring up every one of those \nissues and demand a rollcall vote.\n  I don't apologize for the fact that I backed the majority leader in \nhis position that we don't need to take those votes again. While we are \nin the process of trying to fund the Government and discharge our \nconstitutional responsibility, we don't need to sidetrack that business \nto go over old ground. If there is an election that has come up so that \nthere are new people here and the electoral balance has shifted, it \nobviously makes sense to take those votes against. But to have the same \npeople in the same Chamber in the same Congress in the same session \nrepeat the votes again and again and again doesn't make any sense when \nthe process of debating each one of those votes again and again and \nagain delays the whole legislative process to the point that we get to \nwhat I sadly have come to the conclusion is the goal here, which is to \ncreate a do-nothing Congress so that some people can run against a do-\nnothing Congress.\n  If it means the majority leader has to get as tough as George \nMitchell, if it means the majority leader has to be as firm as his \npredecessors, who were Democrats who were firm in order to move the \npeople's business, I support the majority leader. It does not disgrace \nthis body. It does not take this body away from its traditions. It is \nin the tradition of the body to move legislation forward and get the \npeople's business done.\n  I applaud Senator Lott for his courage and his leadership in moving \nus in that direction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a leadership \nmotion?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon has the floor.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I yield to the Senator to make a request.\n\n\n                      unanimous consent agreement\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the hour \nof 5 p.m. the Senate proceed to adopt the motion to proceed to the \nTreasury/Postal appropriations bill; that immediately after that the \nSenate vote on cloture on the motion to proceed to the intelligence \nauthorization bill; that immediately after that vote, regardless of the \noutcome, the Senate proceed to a period for morning business until the \nSenate completes its business today, and that the preceding all occur \nwithout any intervening action or debate.\n  I announce that the cloture vote regarding the motion to proceed to \nthe\n\n[[Page S7627]]\n\nintelligence authorization bill which will occur at 5 p.m. this evening \nwill be the last vote today. We would then go into a period for morning \nbusiness and conclude the session for the day with the exception of any \nconference reports or wrap-up items that may be cleared for action.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its \nbusiness today it stand in adjournment until the hour of 9:30 a.m. \ntomorrow; that the call of the calendar be waived and the morning hour \nbe deemed to have expired; that there then be a period for eulogies for \nour former colleague Senator Coverdell as previously ordered; that \nfollowing the swearing in of our new colleague, Zell Miller, at 11 a.m. \nand his eulogy of Senator Coverdell, the Senate adopt the motion to \nproceed to the intelligence authorization bill, if its pending, and \nthen vote on the cloture vote on the motion to proceed to the energy/\nwater appropriations bill, and that the preceding all occur without any \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is their objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I want to say \nto my friend from Utah, for whom I have the highest regard, he is a \ngreat Senator. I have personal feelings toward him that he understands. \nBut I want to just say a couple of things before we settle this little \nbit here.\n  I served under George Mitchell. Never did Senator Mitchell prevent \nthe minority from offering amendments. That is our biggest complaint in \nthis body--that the majority will not allow the minority to offer \namendments. We believe the Senate should be treated as it has for over \n200 years. If that were the case, we wouldn't be in the situation we \nare in now.\n  I also say to my friend that the percentage on the judges doesn't \nwork because we are dealing with a larger number. Of course, if you \nhave a larger number of judges, which has occurred since President \nReagan was President, you could have a smaller percentage. That means a \nlot more judges. As we know, you can prove anything with numbers.\n  I also say that one of the problems we have with judges is my friend \nfrom Michigan has one judge who has waited 1,300 days. That is much \nshorter than the 2 years my friend talked about in regards to the \nBanking Committee. In fact, I think the majority is protesting too \nmuch.\n  I withdraw my objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, in light of this agreement, a rollcall \nvote will occur at 5 p.m. today on the motion to proceed to the \nintelligence authorization bill. Another rollcall vote will occur at \napproximately 11:30 a.m. on Thursday on the motion to proceed to the \nenergy and water appropriations bill.\n  I thank the Senator from Oregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon has the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I would be happy to yield for a unanimous \nconsent request.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenator from Oregon finishes his remarks, the Senator from Iowa be \nrecognized to make some remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I thank you for the time. I am \nhere today at the request of my leader. I am here today to talk to the \npeople of Oregon and to the American people.\n  I am often asked in townhall meetings why it is that we don't seem to \nbe getting much done. Every time people turn on C-SPAN they see \nRepublicans and Democrats bickering. I have said to them: I know it is \nfrustrating. I know you do not like it. I know it sometimes isn't \npleasant. But, frankly, rather than criticize it, we ought to celebrate \nit because this is the way we go about the business of government of a \nfree people--of exchanging ideas, and using words as our weapons and \nnot actually bullets.\n  This contest between Republicans and Democrats is not an unhealthy \nthing. But I must admit to the American people and to the people of \nOregon that what I see happening on the Senate floor right now is \nnothing to be celebrated.\n  I came to the Senate looking for solutions--not looking for a fight. \nI don't mind a good debate. I don't mind differences of opinion. I \ndon't mind taking tough votes. Frankly, I have learned that the tough \nvotes are sometimes the most memorable because they are difficult. They \nset you apart. They make you come to a choice. Like Senator Bennett \nsaid, I have taken all of these tough votes that my Democratic friends \nhave wanted me to take, and they have taken some that we wanted them to \ntake. However, I have to say that now is not a moment to be celebrated \nbecause of what I have been hearing since I came back from this last \nweekend.\n  I have heard from colleagues on both sides of the aisle that this \nsession of Congress is essentially over, that right now politics is \ngoing to prevail over policy, and that there will be gridlock until the \nelection so that the greatest political advantage can be made out of \nthe Congress.\n  I am disappointed in that. I didn't come here for that. I didn't \nfight as hard as I did to win a seat in this body to just play that \nkind of a game.\n  I find on the Democratic side people of honor and good will. I hope \nthey find that in Republicans. Frankly, I think we are allowing the \nworst of our natures to take over right now. I am disappointed. I am \nvery disappointed.\n  I understand that the White House is now telling our leaders that \nunless we accede to every one of the President's demands, that we will \nbe blamed for shutting the Government down because he won't sign any \ntax cut, he won't sign any appropriations bill. We are just going to be \nmade the victims of this. I say to my friends in the White House, this \nis an overreach. This goes too far.\n  The American people will judge this for what it is. I think we owe \nthe American people something better than that. I think we owe them the \ntruth. I think we owe them our best efforts. I think the politics \nshouldn't be so blatantly transparent that it brings shame upon the \nSenate.\n  I am here with a heavy heart because I want to get something done. I \nhave sat in the chair many times and begun to see this filibuster \nmentality build up among the minority that rails against these tax cuts \nthat we have passed, to eliminate estate taxes, to eliminate the \nmarriage penalty. They don't have to like it, they voted against it.\n  I will say why I voted for them. There is an overarching reason why I \nvote for tax cuts. I believe in times of surplus and prosperity there \nis a point when we can say we are taking too much and we believe it can \ndo more good in the general economy and we will put some back. Tax cuts \ngo to taxpayers. When it comes to specific taxes, for example, the \nestate tax, I will state why I voted to change the nature of that tax, \nto eliminate the incidence of debt as the tax, and to shift it over to \nthe sale of an asset as the incidence of taxation. I don't believe it \nis any of the Government's business how my heirs receive my estate. I \nthink that is about freedom. I think that is about people saying: I am \ngoing to work hard and I will accumulate what I can, and I want to \ndetermine how my sons and my daughters receive my estate. Then if my \nheirs are unwise, the marketplace will redistribute that income because \nof poor choices.\n  I don't think it is the Government's business to say we are going to \ndetermine how this money is redistributed. It is a difference of who \nyou trust. Do you trust Government? Or do you trust freedom? Do you \ntrust people? Or do you trust central planning? That is why I am on \nthis side of the aisle-- not because I think there are bad people over \nthere; I know otherwise. There are good people there. But we have a \ndifference of belief in how the public is best served. I think they \nwant more equality. I think we want more liberty. That is the context \nof the debate here.\n  I want the American people to know I will defend my vote to my own \ngrave to eliminate the estate tax. I believe the way we have shifted it \nto a capital gains as the incidence of taxation is far more consistent \nwith notions of freedom than reaching into somebody's grave and saying \nwe are going to distribute it a new way, a Government way. That is not \nthe America that I believe in.\n\n[[Page S7628]]\n\n  When it comes to the marriage penalty tax cut, they are complaining \nagain that too few people will benefit. You say it affects people \ndisproportionately. But many married people will benefit. Again, it is \nhard to give tax cuts to those who don't pay taxes. I am not ashamed of \nvoting to cut taxes for married people. Some people say that is unfair. \nHowever, I think we ought to incentivize marriage. It is a cornerstone \nof our society. Take religion out of it. Sociologists and psychologists \nwill say for a child to have the best chance in life they need a mom, \nthey need a dad. Those are the kinds of things we ought to be \nincentivizing--not penalizing.\n  Without any embarrassment, I am proud to have voted to end the \nmarriage tax penalty and the death tax penalty. These are bad tax \npolicies. We have voted to end them. If they don't like \nthe distribution of them, fine. But we have cast these votes. They \nvoted one way; we voted another. We have taken their tough votes. As \nSenator Bennett said, we have taken the gun votes. We have taken the \nvotes on abortion. We have taken a whole range of votes. We have taken \na vote against their prescription drug plan.\n\n  Let me go to prescription drugs for a minute. I am a member of the \nBudget Committee. I have sensed in the people of Oregon a real desire \nfor a prescription drug benefit. I want to deliver for that. Because of \nthat, I went into the Budget Committee when we created this template in \nthe U.S. budget, determined to stand with my colleague, Ron Wyden, to \naccede the President's request for a prescription drug benefit. The \nPresident requested $39 billion. Ron, Olympia Snowe, and I decided \ntogether we have a majority if the Democrats will vote with us. We felt \nstrongly that we should deliver on this promise and this need.\n  We got the Budget Committee to exceed the President's request of $39 \nbillion. We went to $40 billion. However, I was a little bit \ndiscouraged--even felt somewhat betrayed--when a few months later the \nPresident says, just kidding, we need $80 billion. Double? From where \ndid the original $39 billion come? Why all of a sudden, $80 billion? \nDon't the American people want Congress to be responsible for this? I \nput everyone on notice, I am being told in the Budget Committee that \n$80 billion won't even begin to cover this. Now what we are looking at \nunder the President's program, is a one size fits all plan. A \nGovernment bureaucrat will be in your medicine cabinet and making \nchoices for your health. A plan, by the way, that doesn't even take \neffect when we pass it--3 years hence. How is that keeping faith with \nthe American people? They cannot even begin to tell you what it costs.\n  This is not the way we should make these fundamental decisions about \nthe health of the American people and the health of our Government's \nbudgets. I hope everybody understands that. I am being told that come \nOctober 6, when we are supposed to sine die, if we haven't passed the \nPresident's version we are going to be put in a position that we are \nmade to look as if we are shutting the Government down.\n  People of America, you do not want Congress making these fundamental \nirreversible decisions on such a basis. These are important issues. We \nshould not be giving in to this kind of political pressure for \nexpediency, for an election. We should do it carefully. We should do it \nright. When it comes to prescription drugs, I will spend what I have to \nmake sure you have a choice, that it is voluntary, and that it is \naffordable.\n  Under the President's plan, I bet there is better than half of the \nAmerican people who would be eligible for it, who would not pay less \nfor prescription drugs, yet would be forced to pay more. Is that what \nwe want? That is not voluntary. That is about Government central \nplanning. That is about a bureaucrat in your medicine cabinet. That is \na plan for which I will not vote.\n  I believe in the marketplace. I believe in freedom. I believe \nGovernment has a role. I believe we ought to have a safety net. But I \ndon't believe we ought to be going to a system that says the Government \nknows best and a bureaucrat can tell you what pill you need to take.\n  I have talked about taxes. I have talked about the budget. I have \ntalked about prescription drugs.\n  Let me end by talking a little bit about this other great frustration \nI hear from the people of Oregon and that is the cost of gas, the cost \nof energy.\n  There is plenty of blame to go around, I am sure. I am not defending \nbig oil. I am not defending the Government, either. But what I am \ntelling you is our country has an enormous trade deficit because we are \nspending over $100 billion per year on foreign oil. When President \nCarter was the President, we had gas lines and we had shortages. I \nremember waiting over an hour every time I went to get gasoline. When \nthat occurred, our country was 36-percent dependent on foreign oil. We \nare 56-percent dependent now. Do you know why? Because in the life of \nthis administration we have had over 30 oil refineries close; we have \nhad leases canceled; we have had no development; and we have had an \nincreasing dependence--not less--on foreign oil. I tell the American \npeople, that is why you are paying too much. That is why you are paying \nmore than you need to, because we are being held hostage to a cartel of \nforeign nations--many that wish us ill, many that would like to put us \nover an oil barrel and push us over.\n  I am saying I don't like drilling for oil. Every one of us drives a \ncar and for a lot of us, the oil that drives that car is refined in \nTexas. Everyone of us likes the freedom of an automobile. Frankly, I \nwould rather say to the American people: Let your sons and daughters \ndrill for oil so they do not have to die for oil. We are setting them \nup to die for oil if we do not figure out some better balance between \nproduction and conservation.\n  Conservation is important. I vote for conservation initiatives. But \nit is not the whole answer. You have to produce something. A third of \nour trade deficit is due to foreign oil. If you want an independent \ncountry, if you want an independent foreign policy, you cannot be \ntotally dependent, as we are becoming, on foreign oil. But there you \nhave it. That has been the policy of this administration.\n  Finally, our Vice President said he wants to outlaw or get rid of the \ninternal combustion engine. In my neck of the woods, we have the \nincredible benefit of hydroelectric power. We have low energy rates \nbecause of hydroelectric power. But, guess what, they are talking about \ntearing them down. They want to tear out the most clean, most \nrenewable, most affordable energy supply that we have. Guess what \nhappens when you do that. You lose--the recreation is gone, but, more \nimportantly, you lose the irrigation for farmers, you lose the \ntransportation of goods from the interior all the way from Montana, \nIdaho, Washington, Oregon to the Port of Portland and around the \nPacific rim. You lose the ability to use this system of locks to move \nvast quantities of agricultural and other commodities.\n  I don't think we want to do that. I think it is very unwise. If you \nwant to get rid of the internal combustion engine --let's examine this \nbriefly. Right now, to move about a half a million bushels of grain, \nyou need four barges that move through these locks. Four barges use \nvery little energy. It just floats and makes its way to the Port of \nPortland. Get rid of the locks or dams, guess what, you have to truck \nthem or rail them. How many railcars does it take to replace the four \nbarges? It takes 140 jumbo railcars to move the same volume.\n  The tracks, the infrastructure is not there to do all the railing. So \nthen you go to trucks, internal combustion engines. Guess how many \ntrucks it takes: Four barges versus 539 large ``semi'' trucks. Guess \nwhat creates pollution. Guess what creates damage to your roads. That \nwill do it.\n  I want to be fair about this. When we are becoming so dependent on \nforeign oil, so dependent upon foreign energy, so dependent as a \nsuperpower on others, I think it is very imprudent to begin tearing out \nour energy infrastructure.\n  So I will close, and I say again with a heavy heart, I think right \nnow politics is prevailing over good policy. I think that is too bad. \nBut let me tell you, the real losers will be the American people if the \nRepublican majority caves in to the kind of tactics that say if you \ndon't take everything we want we are going to make you look like you \nshut the Government down.\n\n[[Page S7629]]\n\n  There are a lot of us who are earnestly striving to do our duty, as \nis incumbent upon the majority, to move the business of the people \nwhile at the same time being fair to the minority. But how many times \ndo we have to cast the same votes? Please, help us here. I plead with \nthe President. Let's get something done. Let's deal in good faith. We \ndon't have to let politics prevail. Because if we do, the legacy of \nthis President and this Congress will be the words ``it might have \nbeen.''\n  It ought to be better than that. But I, for one, believe in our \nRepublic. I believe in our separation of powers. I will be very \ndisappointed in my leaders if we cave in to a King. We cannot do that. \nWe are not going to cave in to a King. We need to stand up for our \ninstitution. Moreover, we need to pay attention to the details of our \npolicy. Because if we work it out with civility, we will work it out \nright for the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, this morning we voted on cloture on the \nmotion to proceed to the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill. I rise to \naddress an issue that will certainly arise in the debate. The issue is \nthe U.S. embargo on Cuba as it relates to food and medicine.\n  Earlier this month, I traveled to Havana along with Senators Roberts \nand Akaka. It was a brief trip, but it gave us an opportunity to meet \nwith a wide range of people. We met with Cuban Cabinet Ministers and \ndissidents, with the head of the largest NGO in Cuba, and also with a \ngood number of foreign ambassadors, and with President Fidel Castro \nhimself. I might say that was a marathon 10-hour session, about half of \nit dining.\n\n  I left those meetings more convinced than ever that it is time to end \nour cold war policy towards Cuba. We should have normal trade relations \nwith Cuba. Let me explain why.\n  First, this is a unilateral sanction. Nobody else in the world \nsupports it. Not even our closest allies. Unilateral economic \nsanctions, don't make sense unless our national security is at stake. \nForty years ago Cuba threatened our national security. The Soviet Union \nplanted nuclear missiles in Cuba and aimed them at the United States. \nTwenty years ago, Cuba was still acting as a force to destabilize \nCentral America.\n  Those days are gone. The missiles are gone. The Soviet Union is gone. \nCuban military and guerilla forces are gone from Central America. The \nsecurity threat is gone. But the embargo remains.\n  My reason for my opposing unilateral sanctions is entirely pragmatic. \nThey don't work. They never worked in the past and they will not work \nin the future. Whenever we stop our farmers and business people from \nexporting, our Japanese, European, and Canadian competitors rush in to \nfill the gap. Unilateral sanctions are a hopelessly ineffective tool.\n  The second reason for ending the embargo is that the US embargo \nactually helps Castro.\n  How does it help Castro? I saw it for myself in Havana. The Cuban \neconomy is in shambles. The people's rights are repressed. Fidel Castro \nblames it all on the embargo. He uses the embargo as the scapegoat for \nCuba's misery. Without the embargo, he would have no one to blame.\n  For the past ten years I have worked towards normalizing our trade \nwith China. My operating guideline has been ``Engagement Without \nIllusions.'' Trade rules don't automatically and instantly yield trade \nresults. We have to push hard every day to see that countries follow \nthe rules. That's certainly the case with China.\n  I have the same attitude towards Cuba. Yes, we should lift the \nembargo. We should do it without preconditions and without demanding \nany quid pro quo from Cuba. We should engage them economically. But we \nshould do so without illusions. Once we lift the embargo, Cuba will not \nbecome a major buyer of our farm goods or manufactured products \novernight.\n  We need to be realistic. With Cuba's failed economy and low income, \nending the embargo won't cause a huge surge of U.S. products to Cuba. \nInstead, it will start sales of some goods, such as food, medicine, \nsome manufactures, and some telecom and Internet services.\n\n[[Page S7630]]\n\n  In addition, ending the embargo will increase Cuban exposure to the \nUnited States. It will bring Cubans into contact with our tourists, \nbusiness people, students, and scholars. It will bring Americans into \ncontact with those who will be part of the post-Castro Cuba. It will \nspur more investment in Cuba's tourist infrastructure, helping, even if \nonly a little, to further develop a private sector in the economy.\n  In May of this year, I introduced bipartisan legislation that would \nrepeal all of the Cuba- specific statutes that create the embargo. That \nincludes the 1992 Cuban Democracy Act and the 1996 Helms-Burton Act. I \nlook forward to the day when that legislation will pass and we have a \nnormal economic relationship with Cuba.\n  Until that day, I support measures such as this amendment which \ndismantle the embargo brick by brick. The sanctions on sales of food \nand medicine to Cuba are especially offensive.\n  Last year, legislation to end unilateral sanctions on food and \nmedicine passed the Senate by a vote of 70 to 28. That legislation was \nhijacked by the House in conference. This year we passed similar \nlegislation again as part of the Agriculture appropriations bill. I \nhope our conferees stand firm and ensure its passage this year, with \none correction.\n  This year the sanctions provisions of the Agriculture appropriations \nbill contain a new requirement. The bill requires farmers who want to \nsell food to foreign governments of concern to get a specific license. \nThat is needless red tape which will make it harder to export. Last \nyear the bill we passed had no such licensing requirement. We should \nstrike that provision in the Agriculture appropriations conference this \nyear.\n  When we begin debate on the bill, one of my colleagues will offer an \namendment to address unilateral sanctions on food and medicine from a \ndifferent angle. The amendment will cut off funding to enforce and \nadminister them. The House passed a similar measure by a substantial \nmajority. We should do the same in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I hope that all of my colleagues will vote in favor of \nthis amendment and will support the ultimate lifting of the entire Cuba \ntrade embargo.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Balkans, with Gavrilo Princip's \nassassination of Austrian Archduke Francis Ferdinand in Sarajevo, \nBosnia in 1914, started the devastation of World War I. World War II \nhad deep ties to the region as well. The Truman doctrine, the basis of \nAmerican policy throughout the cold war, began with President Truman's \ndecision to support anti-Communist forces in Greece and Turkey, again, \nin the Balkans. To deal with the historic threat to peace, security and \nprosperity the Balkans poses, the United States and Europe made a \ncommitment in the aftermath of the Kosovo crisis to integrate the \nregion into the broader European community. This commitment is \nconsistent with the pillar that has bound the United States and Europe \nsince the end of World War II--a belief in the peaceful influence of \nstable democracies based on the rule of law, respect for human rights \nand support for a market economy in Europe.\n  However, the Balkans continue to be unstable. Slobodan Milosevic \nconstantly stirs trouble in Kosovo and Montenegro. The minority \ncommunities of Kosovo are suffering under a systematic effort by \nextremist ethnic Albanians to force them out. Moderate Albanians in \nKosovo are threatened for simply selling bread to a member of the Serb \ncommunity. As long as this instability remains, the shared European and \nAmerican goal of a whole and free Europe will not become a reality.\n  Inclusion of the Balkans in the European community of democracies \nwould promote our Nation's strategic interests. By providing a series \nof friendly nations south from Hungary to Greece and east from Italy to \nthe Black Sea, we would be in a much better position to deter regional \ncrises and respond to them should they occur. The link to the Black Sea \nwould also provide a link into central Asia in the event that the \nprotection of our national security interests were ever threatened in \nthis area.\n  The U.S. and the EU account for more than 30 percent of world trade. \nThe EU receives nearly 25 percent of our total exports and is our \nlargest export market for agricultural products. The nations of the \nBalkans, due to their proximity to the EU's common market, have \ntremendous potential for American investors and businesses to expand \nthese trading ties. Additionally, many in the Balkans have excellent \neducational backgrounds and work experience that would be invaluable to \nan American investor. Many nations currently being considered for EU \nmembership began their transition from command economies in a much \nworse position than the nations of southeastern Europe. If these \nnations can make enough progress to be considered for EU membership in \nthe short-term, surely Croatia, Macedonia, Romania, and Bulgaria can as \nwell.\n  While we have done much as a country to respond to human suffering \naround the world in recent years, these efforts are made after the \nfact. This is a mistake that reflects the Clinton administration's lack \nof foresight. In Kosovo, for example, our lack of preparation for the \nrefugees created by Milosevic's aggression was inexcusable. To prevent \nthis type of tragedy in the Balkans again--the refugees, the \nhomelessness, the starvation--we must remain involved in the region.\n  I believe that the following steps should be taken to advance our \ngoal of an integrated, whole, and free Europe:\n  NATO and EU membership--The nations of southeastern Europe must be\n\n[[Page S7631]]\n\ninvolved in these institutions to ensure their long-term peace, \nsecurity, and prosperity. However, invitations for membership should \nonly be offered once the nations have met the established membership \ncriteria;\n  Implementation of the Stability Pact--The Pact, initiated by the \nEuropeans to encourage democracy, security, and economic development in \nthe region, must be fully implemented. There has been much talk and \npromises made about the Pact. Now is the time for action. The Europeans \nmust begin to build the infrastructure projects they have promised in \nthe region.\n  Open European markets--The Europeans have made a commitment to \nintegrate the region into the broader European community. Lowering \ntariffs on the import of goods from the region would do much to \nencourage needed foreign investment. Investment, in turn, would speed \ndevelopment which would lead to the integration for which the Europeans \nhave called.\n  To make these initiatives work, the Clinton administration must show \nmore leadership than they have since the Kosovo crisis began. With the \ndebacle of Bosnia in its background, coupled with the failed policies \nfor the region over the last 18 months, our record in the region has \nbeen dismal. Implementing the above plan will begin to better this \nrecord.\n\n\n                      the situation in the balkans\n\n  Mr. President, over the Fourth of July recess, I traveled with a \ndelegation of my House and Senate colleagues to Southeast Europe where \nI attended the annual Parliamentary assembly Meeting of the \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in Bucharest, \nRomania.\n  In addition, while I was in Southeast Europe, I joined several of my \nHouse colleagues on a trip to Kosovo and Croatia to get an update on \nthe situation there. I met with UN officials, Serb and Albanian \nleaders, KFOR commanders, and our American troops, and particularly \nsoldiers from Ohio who are stationed in Kosovo.\n  I have traveled to the Balkans region three times this year to assess \nthe situation in the region from a political, military and humanitarian \npoint of view.\n  Besides my most recent trip, I traveled to Croatia, Macedonia, Kosovo \nand Brussels, Belgium in February and in May, I attended the annual \nmeeting of the NATO Parliament Conference in Budapest, Hungary, and \nvisited Slovenia as well. Based on the observations that I made, I \nwould like to bring the Senate up to date on the current situation in \nsoutheastern Europe, particularly in Croatia and Kosovo.\n  While I was in Croatia this past February, I had the privilege to be \nthe first Member of the United States Congress to personally \ncongratulate Mr. Stipe Mesic on his being elected President of Croatia. \nDuring my trip earlier this month, I had a chance to spend time with \nPresident Mesic, along with my colleagues from the House of \nRepresentatives, and, again, hear his vision for the future of Croatia.\n  We also had an opportunity to meet with Prime Minister Racan, who \nalong with President Mesic, is committed to providing to the Croatian \npeople, a government that abides by the rule of law; respects human \nrights--particularly minority rights; adheres to the goals of a market \neconomy; seeks the ultimate entrance into the European Union and NATO; \nand pledges to return minority refugees that were ethnically cleansed \nout of Croatia. This commitment was supported by members of the \nCroatian Parliament and acknowledged by members of the Serb minority, \nwho are anxious to see the commitment carried out.\n  I am optimistic about the future of Croatia with its new leadership. \nFollowing the December, 1999 death of Croatia's ultra-nationalist \nPresident, Franjo Tudjman, Croatia's future was uncertain as far as the \nWest was concerned.\n  However, the changes that have occurred since the establishment of a \nnew government less than six months ago are stunning. I believe that \nthe new government of President Mesic and Prime Minister Racan will \nultimately be successful in guiding Croatia to EU and NATO membership. \nHowever, the legancy of Tudjman and his ruling elite--who we are just \nnow learning were a bunch of thieves--poses some serious challenges for \nthe ``new'' Croatia.\n  Tudjman drove Croatia deep into debt to a variety of international \nfinancial institutions while he and his henchmen ``cleaned-out'' the \nnational treasury for their own personal gain. Because of Tudjman's \nmismanagement, President Mesic and Prime Minister Racan are facing a \nsituation where their nation's economy is struggling, and they have \nlittle help available from outside creditors because of Tudjman's \naction.\n  These economic problems have an impact on another major challenge the \nnew government is facing--the return of refugees. As my colleagues may \nremember, the Balkan wars of the 1990s created hundreds of thousands of \nrefugees.\n  These refugees left their homes, abandoned nearly all of their \npossessions and took to the roads to avoid the bloodshed of ethnic \nhatred. In order for these people to go back and reclaim their homes \nand get on with their lives, there must be something to go back to--\njobs, especially. There are few areas of Croatia today where jobs are \nplentiful enough to absorb thousands of returning refugees, which \nunderscores the importance of reinvigorating the Croatian economy.\n  Despite these problems, I am very optimistic about the future of \nCroatia if President Mesic and Prime Minister Racan continue to lead \ntheir nation towards European integration. I am pleased that the United \nStates is supporting the new Croatian leadership with financial, \ndiplomatic and military assistance. I am also pleased that NATO has \ninvited Croatia to become a member of the ``Partnership for Peace'' \nprogram.\n  Mr. President, as I think back to last year, to the time when this \nnation was engaged in an air war over Kosovo, the President, the \nSecretary of State, world leaders and the international media all \nbrought to our attention the ethnic cleansing that was being \nperpetrated by Slododan Milosevic's Serbian military and paramilitary \nforces against the Albanian people in Kosovo.\n  During the height of the air war, President Clinton, in the Times of \nLondon, was quoted as saying ``we are in Kosovo because Europe's worst \ndemagogue has once again moved from angry words to unspeakable \nviolence.'' Further, the President stated, ``the region cannot be \nsecure with a belligerent tyrant in its midst.''\n  Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, before the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee claimed ``there is a butcher in NATO's backyard, \nand we have committed ourselves to stopping him. History will judge us \nharshly if we fail.''\n  Words such as these were meant to back-up our actions in Kosovo and \nexplain to the American people the moral imperative of engaging in a \nU.S.-led NATO air war over Kosovo.\n  In this effort to protect the innocent civilian Kosovo Albanian \ncommunity from the devastation of Slobodan Milosevic and his Serb \nforces, few realized at the time that the United States had stumbled \nacross a civil war in progress. A minority of Kosovo Albanians, under \nthe leadership and flag of the Kosovo Liberation Army, the KLA, were \npursuing their dream of an ethnically pure Kosovo, dominated by \nAlbanians and independent from Serbia. These extremists were willing to \nresort to violence to achieve this dream.\n  On the other hand, Serbia and Slobodan Milosevic did not want to let \nthis province break away, because Kosovo is very important to their \nhistory, culture, and religion.\n  Let me be clear on this. None of these circumstances in any way \nexcuses the devastation the Serb forces brought to the ethnic Albanian \ncommunity of Kosovo. The systematic plan, hatched by Milosevic, his \nwife and their inner circle of thugs, to instill fear through rape, \ntorture, and murder was designed to drive the ethnic Albanian community \nout of Kosovo. Their plan was evil in its inception and execution.\n  The United States and our NATO allies vowed to put an end to this \ntragedy. Through our combined military strength, we were able to force \nMilosevic to withdraw his troops from Kosovo, making it safe for \nKosovar Albanians to return to their homes.\n  And now that the air war in the Balkans has been over for a little \nmore than a year, most Americans assume that the situation in \nYugoslavia is now\n\n[[Page S7632]]\n\nunder control and that Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo have put aside \ntheir differences, declared peace and are working towards establishing \na cooperative society.\n  How I wish that was true.\n  In fact, the reason I have come to the floor today is to make my \ncolleagues and this nation aware what many in the European community \nalready know, and that is, ethnic cleansing is being carried out in \nKosovo today.\n  In the wake of the air war, a backlash of violence is now being \nperpetrated against minority groups in Kosovo, including Serbs, Romas, \nand moderate Albanians who are now trying to rebuild Kosovo. They have \nbeen attacked and killed by more radical, revenge-driven elements in \nthe Albanian community, their homes and businesses have been burned and \nSerbian Orthodox churches and monasteries--some hundreds of years old--\nhave been desecrated and destroyed.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a document which \nsummarizes the incidents of arson and murder that have occurred in \nrecent months in Kosovo. These numbers were prepared by the OSCE, which \nis known for its independence.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       A report released on June 9, 2000 provides recent numbers \n     associated with violent crime that continues to threaten \n     peace and reconciliation efforts in Kosovo. The report, \n     UNHCR/OSCE Update on the Situation of Ethnic Minorities in \n     Kosovo, provides details on the three most prevalent crimes \n     affecting minorities in Kosovo since January 2000. They are \n     as follows:\n\n\n                             Arson, against\n\n     Serbs, 105 cases\n     Roma, 20\n     Muslim Slavs, 5\n     Albanians, 73\n     Persons of unknown ethnicity, 40\n\n\n                      Aggravated assault, against\n\n     Serbs, 49 cases\n     Roma, 2\n     Muslim Slavs, 2\n     Albanians, 90\n     Persons of unknown ethnicity, 9\n\n\n                            Murder, against\n\n     Serbs, 26 cases\n     Roma, 7\n     Muslim Slavs, 2\n     Albanians, 52\n     persons of unknown ethnicity, 8\n\n       According to the report, lack of security and freedom of \n     movement remain the fundamental problems affecting minority \n     communities in Kosovo. Though the Serbian population has been \n     the minority group most affected by criminal activity, the \n     ethnic Albanian community continues to be subject to serious \n     violent attacks on a regular basis.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, in addition, Bishop Kyr Artemije, a \nleader of the Kosovar Serbs, presented similar statistics documenting \nthe violence and bloodshed that has been carried out in Kosovo since \nthe end of the war in testimony he gave before the Helsinki Commission \nthis past February. His statistics were updated and verified at a \nrecent meeting that I and several of my House colleagues had with the \nBishop over the Fourth of July recess in Kosovo.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Bishop Artemije's February testimony be \nprinted in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, in addition, a July 3 article written \nby Steven Erlanger for the New York Times, discusses the observations \nDennis McNamara, the U.N. special envoy for humanitarian affairs in \nKosovo, had regarding the status of the situation in Kosovo today, \nparticularly how minorities have been treated since the end of the air \nwar and how minorities are being pushed out of Kosovo in a continuous \nand organized manner.\n  McNamara is quoted as saying that:\n\n       (this) violence against the minorities has been too \n     prolonged and too widespread not to be systematic.\n\n  McNamara goes on to say;\n\n       We can't easily say who's behind it, but we can say we have \n     not seen any organized effort to stop it or any effort to \n     back up the rhetoric of tolerance from Albanian leaders with \n     any meaningful action.\n\n  The genocide that was inflicted upon thousands of Albanians is \nabsolutely inexcusable and totally reprehensible. Crimes that are \nperpetrated against innocent civilians must always be condemned and \nthose who carry out such acts must be prosecuted. That is why I do not \nunderstand why the President, the Secretary of State, and others in \nthis administration have not been as vocal about the ethnic cleansing \nthat is now being perpetrated as they were last year.\n  In fact, the condemnation for the ethnic cleansing that is now \noccurring in Kosovo is virtually nonexistent on the part of this \nadministration. I am deeply troubled by their silence.\n  Because I have been following this matter so closely since the \nconclusion of the air campaign, I have had the opportunity to have a \nnumber of off-the-record, informal conversations with people both \ninside and outside of our Government. While I am reluctant to share \nthis with my colleagues, I feel that I must. There is a feeling by many \nwho are following the ongoing ethnic cleansing in Kosovo that there are \nsome in our Administration who believe that the Serb community in \nKosovo is simply getting what they are due.\n  In other words, the murders, arson, harassment and intimidation that \nextremist members of the Kosovo Albanian community are committing \nagainst the Kosovo Serb community should be expected and accepted given \nwhat the Serbs did to the Albanians.\n  A July 17 article written by Steven Erlanger of the New York Times \nmakes this point as well. It describes how U.N. director of Kosovo \nadministration, Bernard Kouchner, has been working to foster peace and \nstability among Albanians and Serbs in Kosovo. He points out that no \none is paying much attention now that the tables have turned.\n  Kouchner says:\n\n       I'm angry that world opinion has changed so quickly. They \n     were aware before of the beatings and the killings of \n     Albanians, but now they say, ``There is ethnic cleansing of \n     the Serbs.'' But it is not the same--it's revenge.\n\n  And McNamara makes the same point. He says:\n\n       There was from the start an environment of tolerance for \n     intolerance and revenge. There was no real effort or interest \n     in trying to deter or stop it. There was an implicit \n     endorsement of it by everybody--by the silence of the \n     Albanian political leadership and by the lack of active \n     discouragement of it by the West.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these two New York Times \narticles be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. The United States must not now--nor ever--condone this \nrevenge approach in Kosovo in either thought, word or deed. We must \nmaintain and promote our values as a nation--a respect for human \nrights, freedom of religion, freedom from harassment, intimidation or \nviolence.\n  If this administration, and the next, does not acknowledge and \nseriously address the plight of Kosovo Serbs and other minorities in \nKosovo, then I think that within a year's time there will not be any \nminorities still in Kosovo. To prevent this, I believe we should be \nmore aggressive towards protecting minority rights in Kosovo \nimmediately.\n  If we do not, I am concerned that the extremist members of the Kosovo \nAlbanian community will continue to push out all minority groups until \nthey have achieved their dream of an Albanian-only Kosovo. In other \nwords, if we do nothing, there will be many who will argue that the \nethnic cleansing of Kosovo was tacitly endorsed by the lack of \nleadership in the international community.\n  It is important to note that the problem does not rest with our KFOR \ntroops, for they have been restricted in what they can and cannot do. \nThese men and women are doing a terrific job under difficult \ncircumstances. I know what they're going through because, last \nFebruary, I walked through the village of Gnjilane with some of our \nsoldiers, and saw first-hand the restrictions they were under.\n  While I was in Kosovo over the 4th of July recess, I had the \nopportunity to visit our troops at Camp Bondsteel. Every soldier that I \nspoke with talked of their commitment to their mission and ensuring the \nsafety of the citizens of Kosovo. I fully believe that it is because of \nthese troops that there is not further violence.\n  I do have hope that we can bring an end to the bloodshed in \nSoutheastern\n\n[[Page S7633]]\n\nEurope, and I believe that there are some within the Kosovo Albanian \ncommunity who can prevail upon the better instincts of their fellow man \nin a commitment towards peace.\n  Earlier this year, at the headquarters of the United Nations Mission \nin Kosovo, UNMIK, in Pristina, Kosovo, I had the opportunity to sit \ndown and meet with several key leaders of the Kosovo Albanian community \nand representatives on the Interim Administrative Council--Dr. Ibrahim \nRugova, Mr. Hashim Thaci, and Dr. Rexhep Qosja.\n  All three leaders made a very clear promise to me that they were \ncommitted to a multi-ethnic, democratic Kosovo, one that would respect \nthe rights of all ethnic minorities. I was heartened to hear these \ncomments. This commitment could serve as the basis for long-term peace \nand stability in Kosovo.\n  I said that they could go down in history as truly great men were \nthey to make this commitment a reality. I explained that the historic \ncycle of violence in Kosovo must end and minority rights must be \nrespected--including the sanctity of churches and monasteries.\n  I also point out to them that ``revenge begets revenge'' and unless \nAlbanians and Serbs learned to live in peace with one another, violence \nwould continue to plague their children, their grandchildren and \ngenerations yet unborn.\n  It is my hope that they will realize that they and their actions will \nbe keys to the future of Kosovo.\n  We all want peace to prevail in the Balkans, but we have a long way \nto go for that to happen. I believe we should listen to the words of \nHis Holiness, Patriarch Pavle, the head of the Serbian Orthodox church, \nwho states, ``in Kosovo and Metohija there will be no victory of \nhumanity and justice while revenge and disorder prevail. No one has a \nmoral right to celebrate victory complacently for as long as one kind \nof evil replaces another, and the freedom of one people rests upon the \nslavery of another.''\n  The Patriarch's call for leadership in protecting all citizens in \nKosovo is one that this nation should heed if peace and stability in \nKosovo is our goal.\n  At the OSCE meeting in Bucharest, I introduced a resolution on \nSoutheastern Europe that had the support of several of my legislative \ncolleagues from the U.S. The main point of the resolution that I \noffered was to call to the attention of the OSCE's Parliamentary \nAssembly the current situation in Kosovo and Serbia, and made clear the \nimportance of removing Slobodan Milosevic from power.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the entire text of the \nresolution, as passed by the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, be printed in \nthe Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 3.)\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. My resolution put the OSCE, as a body, on record as \ncondemning the Milosevic regime and insisting on the restoration of \nhuman rights, the rule of law, free press and respect for ethnic \nminorities in Serbia. I was pleased that the resolution passed--despite \nstrong opposition by the delegation from the Russian Federation--and I \nam hopeful that it will help re-focus the attention of the \ninternational community on the situation in the Balkans.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I believe that we are approaching a \ncrossroads in Kosovo with two very different directions that we can \nchoose.\n  The first direction--the wrong direction--involves more of the same \nof what we have seen in recent months. More bloodshed, more grenade \nattacks on elderly minorities as they sit on their porch. More land-\nmines on roads traveled by parents taking their children to school. \nMore intimidation, threats and harassment of minorities walking the \nstreets in mixed villages and towns. All this would lead to the \ncontinued fleeing of minorities from Kosovo and the establishment of an \nAlbanian-only Kosovo. Again, ethnic cleansing carried-out under the \nnose of NATO and the U.N.\n  The second direction--the right direction--involves the international \ncommunity, led by the United States, protecting the human rights of the \nminority communities of Kosovo. With this protection, the minority \ngroups would feel safe in their homes and be comfortable enough to be \ninvolved in UNMIK municipal elections this fall, a key priority for \nUNMIK. Places of historical significance, especially Serbian Orthodox \nmonasteries, would be safe from destruction from extremists.\n  Minorities would be safe to travel to the market in their own \ncommunities without needing KFOR protection, something that does not \nhappen today. Kosovo Albanians who sell goods to minorities would not \nbe threatened, harmed or killed, again, something that does not happen \ntoday. In short, bloodshed would stop under the watch of the \ninternational community.\n  And there is encouraging news.\n  Just this last weekend, at Airlie House in Virginia, leaders of \nKosovo's Serb and Albania communities met under the auspices of the \nUnited States Institute for Peace.\n  Among other provisions, the representatives agreed to launch a new \ninitiative--a Campaign Against Violence--whereby the representatives of \nboth communities agreed to a Pact Against Violence to promote \ntolerance, condemn violence, prevent negative exploitation of ethnic \nissues, and enable physical integration and political participation by \nall. In addition, the communities agreed on two key provisions to help \nreduce the power of extremist elements by calling on KFOR and UNMIK to \nguard and control more effectively all entry into Kosovo, and \nrequesting that UNMIK move immediately to start-up a functioning court \nand prison system.\n  Also, the Serb and Albanian representatives agreed on several items \nregarding the return of displaced persons and refugees to their homes, \nincluding the recognition that the return of such individuals is a \nfundamental right and essential to the future of Kosovo. In order to \nfacilitate such returns, the parties insist that UNMIK and KFOR pursue \nfresh efforts to provide greater security for individuals to return to \ntheir homes, and to expand aid for reconstruction and economic \nrevitalization in those communities.\n  They further agreed that a new model of security and law enforcement \nis needed, and that the international community must overcome its \ndifferences to that UNMIK and KFOR can take much stronger measures to \ncarry out their security and law enforcement responsibilities.\n  Last but not least, the representatives recognize that the \ninternational community will not support a Kosovo cleansed of some of \nits ethnic communities. Rather, all these communities must work \ntogether to build a multi-ethnic Kosovo respecting the rights of all \nits citizens.\n  I say ``Amen and Hallelujah'' to the fact that these two communities \ncan come together and develop such an outline for peace.\n  There should be a loud voice coming out from this administraiton--the \nsame loud voice that we heard last year--to the United Nations, to the \nUNMIK, and to our NATO Allies that we cannot allow ethnic cleansing of \nany kind to continue.\n  And I just want the administration to know that I am holding them \nresponsible to make the same commitment to Kosovo now that they made \nduring the war, specifically, to go in and make sure that NATO, UNMIK, \nand KFOR give the same priority to protecting minority rights today.\n  It is up to the United States to provide the leadership to make sure \nthat the items that the representatives at Airlie House identified as \nimportant are actually carried out by the UNMIK and by KFOR in \ncooperation with the Serb and Albanian communities in Kosovo.\n  Individually, none of these entities can guarantee peace and \nstability in Kosovo. It is only by working together that peace will \noccur, and it is the primary reason that the U.S. needs to re-commit \nitself to Kosovo.\n  We, the United States, with our strength and commitment to the \nprotection of human rights, can largely determine which direction is \ntaken in Kosovo. It is in our hands to live up to that potential.\n  It is in our national security interest. It is in our economic \ninterest in Europe. It is in the interest of peace in the world that we \nmake that commitment.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S7634]]\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n Statement of Bishop Artemije, Helsinki Commission, Hearing, February \n                        28, 2000, Washington, DC\n\n       Mr. Chairman, respected members of Congress, ladies and \n     gentlemen. It is my distinct pleasure and privilege to be \n     here with you today and speak about the latest developments \n     in Kosovo. The last time I spoke here was in February 1998, \n     just before the war in Kosovo began and on that occasion I \n     strongly condemned both Milosevic's regime and Albanian \n     extremists for leading the country into the war. \n     Unfortunately the war came and so many innocent Albanians and \n     Serbs suffered in it. Many times we have strongly condemned \n     the crimes of Milosevic's regime in Kosovo while our Church \n     in Kosovo supported suffering Albanian civilians and saved \n     some of them from the hands of Milosevic's paramilitaries.\n       After the end of Kosovo war and return of Albanian refugees \n     the repression of Milosevic's undemocratic regime was \n     supplanted by the repression of extremist Kosovo Albanians \n     against Serbs and other non-Albanian communities in full view \n     of international troops. Freedom in Kosovo has not come for \n     all equally. Therefore Kosovo remains a troubled region even \n     after 8 months of international peace.\n       Kosovo Serbs and other non-Albanian groups in Kosovo live \n     in ghettos, without security; deprived of basic human \n     rights--the rights of life, free movement and work. Their \n     private property is being usurped; their homes burned and \n     looted even 8 months after the deployment of KFOR. Although \n     Kosovo remained more or less multiethnic during the ten years \n     of Milosevic's repressive rule, today there is hardly any \n     multiethnicity at all--in fact the reverse is true. Ethnic \n     segregation is greater now than almost at any other time in \n     Kosovo's turbulent history. Not only are Serbs being driven \n     out from the Province but also the Romas, Slav Moslems, \n     Croats, Serb speaking Jews and Turks. More than 80 Orthodox \n     churches have been either completely destroyed or severely \n     damaged since the end of the war. The ancient churches, many \n     of which had survived 500 years of Ottoman Moslem rule, could \n     not survive 8 months of the internationally guaranteed peace. \n     Regretfully, all this happens in the presence of KFOR and UN. \n     Kosovo more and more becomes ethnically clean while organized \n     crime and discrimination against the non-Albanians is \n     epidemic.\n       Two thirds of the pre-war Serb population (200,000 people) \n     fled the province under Albanian pressure. In addition more \n     than 50,000 Romas, Slav Moslems, Croat Catholics and others \n     have also been cleansed from Kosovo. More than 400 Serbs have \n     been killed and nearly 600 abducted by Albanian extremists \n     during this same period of peace. Tragically, this suffering \n     of Serbs and other non-Albanians proportionally (with respect \n     to population) represents more extensive suffering in \n     peacetime than the Albanian suffering during the war. This is \n     a tragic record for any post war peace mission, especially \n     for this mission in which the Western Governments and NATO \n     have invested so much of their credibility and authority.\n       Despite the sympathy for all of the suffering of Kosovo \n     Albanians during the war, retaliation against innocent \n     civilians cannot be justified in any way. It is becoming more \n     and more a well-orchestrated nationalist ideology directed \n     towards achieving the complete ethnic cleansing of the \n     Province. The extremists believe that without Serbs and their \n     holy sites in Kosovo independence would then become a fait \n     accompli. The present repression against non-Albanians is \n     carried out with the full knowledge of the Albanian leaders. \n     Sometimes these leaders formally condemn repressive actions \n     but in reality have not done anything to stop the ongoing \n     ethnic violence and discrimination. Even more, some of them \n     are instigating rage against Serbs developing the idea of \n     collective Serb guilt and branding all remaining Serb \n     civilians as criminals. There is much evidence that the KLA \n     leaders bear direct responsibility for the most of the post-\n     war crimes and acts of violence committed in Kosovo. As soon \n     as KFOR entered the Province KLA gunmen took over the power \n     in majority of cities and towns and immediately organized \n     illegal detention centers for Serbs, Romas and Albanian \n     ``collaborators.'' They began killing people listed as \n     alleged criminals and seized a large amount of property \n     previously owned by Serbs and other non-Albanians. KLA groups \n     and their leaders are directly linked with Albanian mafia \n     clans and have developed a very sophisticated network of \n     organized crime, drug smuggling, prostitution, white slavery, \n     and weapons trading. According to the international press \n     Kosovo has become Colombia of Europe and a main heroin \n     gateway for Western Europe. The strategy behind the KLA purge \n     of Serbs was very simple--quarter by quarter of a city would \n     be cleansed of Serbs and their property would be either \n     burned or sold for a high price to Albanian refugees \n     (including Albanians from Albania and Macedonia who flowed \n     into the province through unprotected borders along with the \n     hundreds of thousands of Kosovo refugees). The KLA, although \n     officially disbanded is still active and their secret police \n     are continuing their intimidation and executions. Now more \n     and more of their victims are disobedient Kosovo Albanians \n     who refuse to pay their ``taxes'' and ``protection money'' to \n     extremists. The Albanization of Kosovo is proceeding in a way \n     many ordinary Albanians did not want. The gangsters have \n     stepped into the vacuum left by the slowness of the West to \n     adequately instill full control over the Province. Kosovo is \n     becoming more like Albania: corrupt, anarchic, and ruled by \n     the gun and the gang.\n       Serbs and many non-Albanians still do not have access to \n     hospitals, the University and public services, simply because \n     they cannot even freely walk in the street. They are \n     unemployed and confined to life in poverty of their rural \n     enclaves out of which they can move only under the KFOR \n     military escort. The Serbian language is completely banished \n     from the public life. All Serb inscriptions, road signs and \n     advertisements have been systematically removed and the usage \n     of Serbian language in Albanian dominated areas is reason \n     enough for anyone to be shot right on the spot. Thousands of \n     Serb books in public libraries have been systematically \n     burned while all unguarded Serb cultural monuments and \n     statues have been torn down and destroyed.\n       The Serbs who remain in major cities are in the worst \n     situation of all. Out of 40,000 pre-war Serb population in \n     Pristina today there remain only 300 elderly people who live \n     in a kind of house arrest. They cannot go into the street \n     without military protection and only thanks to KFOR soldiers \n     and humanitarian organizations do they receive food and \n     medicines, which they are not allowed to buy in Albanian \n     shops. Almost all Serb shops are now in Albanian hands. In \n     other areas Albanians are greatly pressuring Serbs to sell \n     their property under threats and extortion. Those who refuse \n     usually have their houses torched or are killed as an example \n     to other Serbs. Grenade attacks on Serb houses; on few \n     remaining Serb shops and restaurants force more and more \n     Serbs to leave Kosovo. If this repression and persecution is \n     continued unabated it is likely that soon most of the \n     remaining Serbs will also be forced to flee Kosovo.\n       On one hand, KFOR's presence in Kosovo has given Albanian \n     extremists free hands to do what that want because one of \n     KFOR priorities has been so far to avoid direct confrontation \n     with the extremists in order to escape possible casualties. \n     On the other hand we cannot but say that if KFOR had not been \n     in Kosovo during this rampage of hatred, not a single Serb or \n     Serb church would have survived. We sincerely appreciate the \n     efforts of many men and women from all over the world who are \n     trying to bring peace to Kosovo even with in a rather narrow \n     political framework in which KFOR must act.\n       An especially volatile situation is in Kosovska Mitrovica \n     the only major city where a substantial number of Serbs \n     remain. During the most intensive wave of ethnic cleansing in \n     June and July many Serb internally displaced persons from the \n     south found refuge in the north of the province in the \n     Mitrovica area. In order to survive they organized a kind of \n     self-protection network and prevented the KLA and mafia to \n     enter the northern fifth of the city together with civilian \n     Albanian returnees. KFOR, aware that the free access of \n     Albanian extremist groups of Mitrovica would cause a Serb \n     exodus, blocked the bridge connecting the southern and \n     northern part of the city. Albanian extremists have since \n     then made many attempts to make their way into the northern \n     part of Mitrovica saying that they wanted undivided and free \n     city. Serbs on the other hand state that they are ready for a \n     united city only if Serbs would be allowed to go back to \n     their homes in the south and elsewhere in Kosovo. Serbs also \n     hold that only Kosovo residents be allowed to return to their \n     homes. A few weeks ago, after two terrorist attacks against a \n     UNHCR bus and a Serb cafe, in which a number of Serbs were \n     killed and injured, radicalized Serbs began retaliatory \n     actions against Albanians in the northern part of the city \n     causing the death of several Albanian innocent citizens and \n     served to broaden the crisis.\n       The Mitrovica crisis is not playing out in a void by itself \n     and must be approached only in the context of the overall \n     Kosovo situation. The fact remains that after the war \n     extremists Albanians have not been fully disarmed and have \n     continued their repression and ethnic cleansing of Serbs and \n     other non-Albanians wherever and whenever they have had \n     opportunity to do so. Unfortunately, such a situation as we \n     have now in Kosovo has opened a door for the Belgrade regime, \n     which is ow trying to profit from this situation and \n     consolidate the division of Mitrovica for their own reasons. \n     Each Serb victim in Kosovo strengthens Milosevic's position \n     in Serbia. Albanian extremists on the other hand want to \n     disrupt the only remaining Serb stronghold in the city in \n     order to drive the Serbs completely out of Kosovo. \n     Regretfully, the international community seems not to be \n     fully aware of the complexity of the Mitrovica problem and \n     has despite all Albanian crimes and terror in the last 8 \n     months one-sidedly condemned Serbs for this violence.\n       This skewed view of the problem will only serve to \n     encourage Albanian extremism, confirm Milosevic's theory of \n     anti-Serb conspiracies that he uses to solidify his hold on \n     power and will eventually lead to final exodus of the Serb \n     community in Kosovo. Milosevic obviously remains at the core \n     of the problem but he is not the greatest cause of the \n     current round of violence and purges--the international \n     community must find ways for controlling Albanian extremists.\n       We maintain our belief that the present tragedy in Kosovo \n     is not what Americans wanted when they supported the policy \n     of\n\n[[Page S7635]]\n\n     the Administration to intervene on behalf of suffering \n     Albanians. In fact international community now faces a \n     serious failure in Kosovo because it has not managed to \n     marginalize extremist Albanians while at the same time \n     Milosevic has been politically strengthened by the bombing \n     and sanctions (which ordinary Serbs understand as being \n     directed against innocent civilians). Therefore we expect now \n     from the international community and primarily from United \n     States to show more determination in protecting and \n     supporting Kosovo Serbs and other ethnic groups who suffer \n     under ethnic Albanian extremists. A way must be found to \n     fully implement UNSC Resolution 1244 in its whole.\n       We have a few practical proposals for improving the \n     situation in Kosovo:\n       1. KFOR should be more robust in suppressing violence, \n     organized crime and should more effectively protect the non-\n     Albanian population from extremists. This is required by the \n     UNSC Resolution.\n       2. More International Police should be deployed in Kosovo. \n     Borders with Macedonia and Albania must be better secured, \n     and UNMIK should establish local administration with Serbs in \n     areas where they live as compact population. Judicial system \n     must become operational as soon as possible. International \n     judges must be recruited at this stage when Kosovo judges \n     cannot act impartially due to political pressures.\n       3. International community must build a strategy to return \n     displaced Kosovo Serbs and others to their homes soon while \n     providing better security for them and their religious and \n     cultural shrines. Post war ethnic cleansing must not be \n     legalized nor accepted--private and Church property has to be \n     restored to rightful owners. Law and order must be \n     established and fully enforced. Without at least an initial \n     repatriation of Serbs, Romas, Slav Moslems and others Kosovo \n     elections would be unfair and unacceptable.\n       4. The International Community, especially, US, should make \n     clear to Kosovo Albanian leaders that they cannot continue \n     with the ethnic cleansing under the protectorate of Western \n     democratic governments. Investment policy and political \n     support must be conditioned to full compliance by ethnic \n     Albanian leaders with the UNSC Resolution 1244. KLA militants \n     must be fully disarmed. The ICTY should launch impartial \n     investigations on all criminal acts committed both by Serbs \n     and Albanians.\n       5. The international community should also support moderate \n     Serbs in regaining their leading role in the Kosovo Serb \n     community and thus provide for the conditions for their \n     participation in the Interim Administrative Kosovo Structure. \n     Since the cooperation of moderate Serb leaders with KFOR and \n     UNMIK has not brought visible improvement to the lives of \n     Serbs in their remaining enclaves, Milosevic's supporters are \n     gaining more confidence among besieged and frightened Serbs, \n     which can seriously obstruct the peace process. Moderate \n     Serbs gathered around Serb National Council need their own \n     independent media; better communication between enclaves and \n     other forms of support to make their voice better heard and \n     understood within their own community. International \n     humanitarian aid distribution in Serb inhabited areas \n     currently being distributed more or less through Milosevic's \n     people who have used this to impose themselves as local \n     leaders, has to be channeled through the Church and the Serb \n     National Council humanitarian network.\n       6. The last but not least, the issue of status must remain \n     frozen until there is genuine and stable progress in \n     eliminating violence and introducing democratization not only \n     in Kosovo but also in Serbia proper and the Federal Republic \n     of Yugoslavia. It is our firm belief that the question of the \n     future status of Kosovo must not be discussed between \n     Kosovo's Albanians and Serbs only, but also with the \n     participation of the international community and the future \n     democratic governments of Serbia and FRY and in accordance \n     with international law and the Helsinki Final Act.\n       We believe in God and in His providence but we hope that US \n     Congress and Administration will support our suffering \n     people, which want to remain where we have been living for \n     centuries, in the land of our ancestors.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n           U.N. Official Warns of Losing the Peace in Kosovo\n\n                          (By Steven Erlanger)\n\n       As the humane ``pillar'' of the United Nations \n     administration in Kosovo prepares to shut down, its job of \n     emergency relief deemed to be over, its director has some \n     advice for the next great international mission to rebuild a \n     country: be prepared to invest as much money and effort in \n     winning the peace as in fighting the war.\n       Dennis McNamara, the United Nations special envoy for \n     humanitarian affairs, regional director for the United \n     Nations high commissioner for refugees and a deputy to the \n     United Nations chief administrator in Kosovo, Bernard \n     Kouchner, leaves Kosovo proud of the way the international \n     community saved lives here after the war, which ended a year \n     ago.\n       Mr. McNamara helped to coordinate nearly 300 private and \n     government organizations to provide emergency shelter, food, \n     health care and transport to nearly one million Kosovo \n     Albanian refugees who have returned.\n       Despite delays in aid and reconstruction, including severe \n     shortages of electricity and running water, no one is known \n     to have died here last winter from exposure or hunger. Up to \n     half of the population--900,000 people a day--was fed by \n     international agencies last winter and spring, and a program \n     to clear land mines and unexploded NATO ordnance is \n     proceeding apace.\n       But Mr. McNamara, 54, a New Zealander who began his United \n     Nations refugee work in 1975 with the exodus of the \n     Vietnamese boat people, is caustic about the continuing and \n     worsening violence against non-Albanian minorities in Kosovo, \n     especially the remaining Serbs and Roma, or Gypsies. He says \n     the United Nations, Western governments and NATO have been \n     too slow and timid in their response.\n       ``There was from the start an environment of tolerance for \n     intolerance and revenge,'' he said. ``There was no real \n     effort or interest in trying to deter or stop it. There was \n     an implicit endorsement of it by everybody--by the silence of \n     the Albanian political leadership and by the lack of active \n     discouragement of it by the West.''\n       Action was needed, he said, in the first days and weeks, \n     when the old images of Albanians forced out of Kosovo on \n     their tractors were replaced by Serbs fleeing Kosovo on their \n     tractors, and as it became clear that the effort to push \n     minorities out of Kosovo was continuing and organized.\n       ``This is not why we fought the war,'' Mr. McNamara said. \n     He noted that in recent weeks there had been a new spate of \n     comments by Western leaders, including President Clinton, \n     Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and the NATO \n     secretary general, Lord Robertson, warning the Albanians that \n     the West would not continue its support for Kosovo if \n     violence against minorities continued at such a pace and in \n     organized fashion.\n       But previous warnings and admonitions have not been \n     followed by any action, Mr. McNamara noted. In general, he \n     and others suggested, there is simply a tendency to put an \n     optimistic gloss on events here and to avoid confrontation \n     with former guerrillas who fought for independence for Kosovo \n     or with increasingly active gangs of organized criminals.\n       ``This violence against the minorities has been too \n     prolonged and too widespread not to be systematic,'' Mr. \n     McNamara said, giving voice to views that he has made known \n     throughout his time here. ``We can't easily say who's behind \n     it, but we can say we have not seen any organized effort to \n     stop it or any effort to back up the rhetoric of tolerance \n     from Albanian leaders with any meaningful action.''\n       In the year since NATO took over complete control of Kosovo \n     and Serbian troops and policemen left the province, there \n     have been some 500 killings, a disproportionate number of \n     them committed against Serbs and other minorities.\n       But there has not been a single conviction. The judicial \n     system is still not functioning, and local and international \n     officials here say that witnesses are intimidated or killed \n     and are afraid to come forward, pressure has been put on some \n     judges to quit and many of those arrested for murder and \n     other serious crimes have been released, either because of \n     lack of prison space or the inability to bring them to trial.\n       Only recently has the United Nations decided to bring in \n     international prosecutors and judges, but finding them and \n     persuading them to come to Kosovo has not been easy. And \n     foreign governments have been very slow to send the police \n     officers they promised to patrol the streets.\n       Now, some 3,100 of a promised 4,800 have arrived, although \n     Mr. Kouchner wanted 6,000. The big problem, Mr. McNamara \n     said, is the generally poor quality of the police officers \n     who have come, some of whom have had to be sent home because \n     they could neither drive nor handle their weapons. And \n     coordination between the police and the military has been \n     haphazard and slow.\n       ``The West should have started to build up institutions of \n     a civil society from Day 1,'' Mr. McNamara said. ``And there \n     should have been a wide use of emergency powers by the \n     military at the beginning to prevent the growth of this \n     culture of impunity, where no one is punished. I'm a human \n     rights lawyer, but I'd break the rules to establish order and \n     security at the start, to get the word out that it's not for \n     free.''\n       Similarly, the NATO troops that form the backbone of the \n     United Nations peacekeeping force here were too cautious \n     about breaking down the artificial barrier created by the \n     Serbs in the northern Kosovo town of Mitrovica, Mr. McNamara \n     said.\n       Northern Mitrovica is now inhabited almost entirely by \n     Serbs, marking an informal partition of Kosovo that extends \n     up to the province's border with the rest of Serbia, creating \n     a zone where the Yugoslav government of President Slobodan \n     Milosevic exercises significant control, infuriating Kosovo's \n     Albanian majority.\n       ``Having allowed Mitrovica to slip away in the first days \n     and weeks, it's very hard to regain it now,'' Mr. McNamara \n     said. ``Why wasn't there strong action to take control of \n     Mitrovica from the outset? We're living with the consequences \n     of that now.''\n       In the last two months, as attacks on Serbs have increased \n     again in Kosovo, Serbs in northern Mitrovica have attacked \n     United Nations aid workers, equipment of offices, causing Mr. \n     McNamara to pull aid workers temporarily out of the town. \n     After promises from the effective leader of the northern \n     Mitrovica Serbs, Oliver Ivanovic, those workers returned.\n\n[[Page S7636]]\n\n       Another significant problem has been the lack of a \n     ``unified command'' of the peacekeeping troops, Mr. McNamara \n     said. Their overall commander, currently a Spanish general, \n     cannot order around the troops of constituent countries. \n     Washington controls the American troops, Paris the French \n     ones and so on.\n       And there are no common rules of engagement or behavior in \n     the various countries' military sectors of Kosovo.\n       ``The disparities in the sectors are real,'' Mr. McNamara \n     said. And after American troops were stoned as they tried to \n     aid French troops in Mitrovica last spring, the Pentagon \n     ordered the American commander here not to send his troops \n     out of the American sector of Kosovo.\n       While the Pentagon denies a blanket ban, officers in the \n     Kosovo peacekeeping operation support Mr. McNamara's \n     assertion. They say no commanders here want to risk their \n     troops in the kind of significant confrontation required to \n     break down the ethnic barriers of Mitrovica.\n       The United Nations has had difficulties of organization and \n     financing, Mr. McNamara readily acknowledges. ``but \n     governments must bear the main responsibility,'' he said, \n     ``Governments decide what the United Nations will be, and \n     what resources governments commit to the conflict they won't \n     commit to the peace.''\n       Governments want to dump problems like Kosovo onto the \n     United Nations to avoid responsibility, he said. The United \n     Nations should develop ``a serious checklist'' of \n     requirements and commitments from governments before it \n     agrees to another Kosovo, Mr. McNamara said, ``and the U.N. \n     should be able to say no.''\n\n             U.N. Chief in Kosovo Takes Stock of Tough Year\n\n                          (By Steven Erlanger)\n\n       Bernard Kouchner, the emotional chief of the United Nations \n     administration in Kosovo, has made it through a tumultuous \n     year.\n       Last November, when the province's water and power were \n     almost nonexistent, the West was not providing the money or \n     personnel it promised and the cold was as profound and bitter \n     as the ethnic hatred, Mr. Kouchner was in a depression so \n     deep that his staff thought he might quit.\n       He spoke darkly then of ``how hard it is to change the \n     human soul,'' of the quick fatigue of Western leaders who \n     prosecuted the war with Serbia over Kosovo and had no \n     interest in hearing about its problematic aftermath, of the \n     impenetrability of the local Serbs and Albanians, with their \n     tribal, feudal passions.\n       ``I've never heard an Albanian joke,'' he said sadly, \n     looking around his dreary office, the former seat of the \n     Serbian power here. ``Do they have a sense of humor?''\n       Now, in a blistering summer, Mr. Kouchner's mood has \n     improved. A French physician who founded Doctors Without \n     Borders because he became fed up with international \n     bureaucracy, he is not an international bureaucrat, sometimes \n     uneasy in his skin. He still goes up and down with the \n     vagaries of this broken province, with its ramshackle \n     infrastructure, chaotic traffic and lack of real law or \n     justice. And without question, he admits, some of those \n     problems can be laid at his door.\n       ``Of course I'm not the perfect model of a bureaucrat and \n     an administrator,'' he said. ``But we have succeeded in the \n     main thing'': stopping the oppression of Kosovo's Albanians \n     by Belgrade, bringing them home and letting them restart \n     their lives in freedom.\n       And yet, he said, ``I have not succeeded in human terms'' \n     with a traumatized population. ``They still hate one another \n     deeply.''\n       He paused, and added: ``Here I discovered hatred deeper \n     than anywhere in the world, more than in Cambodia or Vietnam \n     or Bosnia. Usually someone, a doctor or a journalist, will \n     say, `I know someone on the other side.' But here, no. They \n     had no real relationship with the other community.''\n       The hatred, he suggested, can be daunting and has plunged \n     him and his colleagues into despair. ``Sometimes we got tired \n     and exhausted, and we didn't want a reward, not like that, \n     but just a little smile,'' he said wanly. ``I'm looking for \n     moments of real happiness, but you know just now I'm a bit \n     dry.'' But he is proud that everyone has persisted \n     nonetheless.\n       As for himself, he said, ``my only real success is to set \n     up this administration,'' persuading Albanian and some \n     Serbian leaders to cooperate with foreign officials and begin \n     to share some executive responsibility.\n       When the head of the local Serbian Orthodox Church, Bishop \n     Kyr Artemije, and the leaders of perhaps half of Kosovo's \n     Serbs decided to join as observers, ``we were very happy \n     then,'' he said. ``We were jumping in the air. We believed \n     then that we were reaching the point of no return.\n       But even those Serbs left the executive council set up by \n     Mr. Kouchner, only to return after securing written promises \n     for better security that have prompted the Albanian Hashim \n     Thaci, former leader of the separatist Kosovo Liberation \n     Army, to suspend his own participation.\n       Bishop Artemije's chief aide, the Rev. Sava Janjic, said \n     carefully: ``Kouchner has not been serious in his promises, \n     and the efforts to demilitarize the Kosovo Liberation Army \n     are very inefficient. But he is sincere, and this written \n     document is important on its own.''\n       A senior Albanian politician said Mr. Kouchner was ``the \n     wrong man for the job,'' which he said required more \n     forcefulness and less empathy. ``After a year, you still \n     can't talk of the rule of law.'' Still, the politician said, \n     ``Kouchner's instincts are good--he knew he had to co-opt the \n     Albanians, that the U.N. couldn't run the place alone.''\n       Less successful, most officials and analysts interviewed \n     here said, is Mr. Kouchner's sometimes flighty, sometimes \n     secretive management of the clumsy international bureaucracy \n     itself in the year since Secretary General Kofi Annan sent \n     him here to run the United Nations administration in Kosovo.\n       Alongside the bureaucrats are the 45,000 troops of the \n     NATO-led Kosovo Force, known as KFOR, responsible to their \n     home governments, not to Mr. Kouchner or even to the force's \n     commander. And while Mr. Kouchner was able to persuade the \n     former commander, Gen. Klause Reinhardt of Germany, to do \n     more to help the civilian side, they were both less \n     successful with Washington, Paris, Bonn, Rome and London.\n       The affliction known here as ``Bosnian disease''--with \n     well-armed troops unwilling to take risks that might cause \n     them harm--has settled into Kosovo, say Mr. Kouchner's aids \n     and even some senior officers of the United Nations force.\n       Consequently, some serious problems--like the division of \n     the northern town of Mitrovica into Serbian and Albanian \n     halves that also marks the informal partition of Kosovo--\n     appear likely not to be solved but simply ``managed,'' no \n     matter how much they embolden Belgrade or undermine the \n     confidence of Kosovo Albanians in the good will be of their \n     saviors. It was on the bridge dividing Mitrovica--not in \n     Paris--that Mr. Kouchner chose to spend his New Year's Eve, \n     making a hopeful toast, so far in vain, to reconciliation.\n       Nor will the peacekeeping troops do much to stop organized \n     crime or confront, in a serious fashion, organized, Albanian \n     efforts to drive the remaining Serbs out of Kosovo and \n     prevent the return of those who fled, the officials say.\n       The discovery last month of some 70 tons of arms, hidden \n     away by the former Kosovo Liberation Army and not handed over \n     as promised to the peacekeepers, took no one here by \n     surprise.\n       ``It was a success,'' Mr. Kouchner said, ``not a \n     surprise.''\n       In fact, senior United Nations and NATO officials say, the \n     existence of the arms cache was known and the timing of the \n     discovery was a message to the former rebels, who had \n     recently used some of the weapons, to stop their organized \n     attacks on Serbs and moderate Albanian politicians.\n       But few here expect the arrest of former rebel commanders \n     who are widely suspected of involvement in corruption or \n     political violence. The reaction may be volatile, \n     officials say: troops could be attacked and the shaky \n     political cooperation with the Albanians undermined.\n       Is the United Nations peacekeeping force too timid? Mr. \n     Kouchner paused and shrugged. ``Of course,'' he finally said. \n     ``But what can we do? Everything in the international \n     community works by compromise.''\n       Foreign policemen are also too timid and take too long with \n     investigations that never seem to be finished, Mr. Kouchner \n     says. But at least now, more than 3,100 of the 4,800 \n     international police officers he has been promised--even if \n     not the 6,000 he wanted--are here, and a Kosovo police \n     academy is turning out graduates.\n       One of Mr. Kouchner's biggest regrets is the slow arrival \n     of the police, which bred a culture of impunity. More than \n     500 murders have taken place in the year since the United \n     Nations force took complete control of the province, and no \n     one has yet been convicted.\n       There are still only four international judges and \n     prosecutors in a province where violence and intimidation \n     mean neither Serbs nor Albanians can administer fair justice.\n       What depresses him most, Mr. Kouchner says, is the \n     persistence of ethnic violence even against the innocent and \n     the caregivers. One of his worst moments came last winter, he \n     said, when a Serbian obstetrician who cared for women of all \n     ethnic groups was murdered by Albanians in Gnjilane, in the \n     sector of Kosovo patrolled by American units of the United \n     Nations force.\n       ``He was a doctor!'' Mr. Kouchner exclaimed, still \n     appalled. ``It was the reverse of everything we did with \n     Doctors Without Borders.''\n       While Mr. Kouchner says he has put himself alongside ``the \n     new victims,'' the minority Serbs, he carries with him his \n     visit to the mass graves of slain Albanians.\n       ``I'm angry that world opinion has changed so quickly,'' he \n     said. ``They were aware before of the beatings and the \n     killings of Albanians, but now they say, `There is ethnic \n     cleansing of the Serbs.' But it is not the same--it's \n     revenge.''\n       He does savor the international military intervention on \n     moral and humane grounds. ``I don't know if we will succeed \n     in Kosovo,'' he said. ``But already we've won. We stopped the \n     oppression of the Albanians of Kosovo.''\n       Mr. Kouchner paused, lost in thought and memory. ``It was \n     my dream,'' he said softly. ``My grandparents died in \n     Auschwitz,'' he said, opening a normally closed door. ``If \n     only the international community was brave enough just to \n     bomb the railways there,'' which took the Nazis' victims to \n     the death camp. ``But all the opportunities were missed.''\n       That, he said, is why he became involved, early on, in \n     Biafra, the region whose secession touched off the Nigerian \n     civil war of\n\n[[Page S7637]]\n\n     1967-70, in which perhaps one million people died. And it was \n     what drives him in Kosovo.\n       Mr. Kouchner, now 60, holds to the healing power of time. \n     He points to the reconciliation now of Germany and Israel, \n     and of France and Germany.\n       ``Working with Klaus Reinhardt is a good memory,'' he said. \n     ``He called me his twin brother.'' They both came of age in \n     the Europe of 1968. ``I'm a Frenchman and he's a German,'' \n     and 50 years ago, he said, ``no one could imagine this.''\n       ``It's much easier to make war than peace,'' Mr. Kouchner \n     said. ``To make peace takes generations, a deep movement and \n     a change of the spirit.'' He smiled, looked away. ``It's why \n     I sometimes want to believe in God.''\n\n                             Exhibit No. 3\n\n                   Resolution on Southeastern Europe\n\n       The OSCE Parliamentary Assembly,\n       1. Recalling that conflicts in the former Yugoslavia since \n     1991 have been marked by open aggression and assaults on \n     innocent civilian populations, have been largely instigated \n     and carried out by the regime of Slobodan Milosevic and its \n     supporters, and have caused the deaths of hundreds of \n     thousands of people; the rape, illegal detention and torture \n     of tens of thousands; the forced displacement of millions; \n     and the destruction of property on a massive scale, including \n     places of worship;\n       2. Viewing the overall rate of return of refugees and \n     displaced persons throughout the region to their original, \n     pe-conflict homes, especially where these persons belong to a \n     minority ethnic population, has been unacceptably low;\n       3. Reaffirming the necessity of fulfilling in good faith \n     UNSC resolution 1244 for the settlement of the situation in \n     Kosovo, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia;\n       4. Condemning the continuing violence in Kosovo against \n     members of the Serb and other minority communities, including \n     hundreds of incidents of arson and damaged or destroyed \n     Serbian Orthodox church sites, and dozens of aggravated \n     assaults and murders;\n       5. Reaffirming the commitment to the sovereignty and \n     territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, \n     as stipulated by UNSC resolution 1244;\n       6. Noting that the OSCE and the United Nations High \n     Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) have jointly reported that \n     a lack of security, freedom of movement, language policy, \n     access to health care and access to education, social welfare \n     services and public utilities are devastating the minority \n     communities of Kosovo;\n       7. Expressing concern for the situation of missing \n     Albanians, Serbs and people of other nationalities in Kosovo \n     and for ethnic Albanians kept in prisons in Serbia;\n       8. Noting that reports indicate that hundreds, and perhaps \n     thousands, of ethnic Albanians, transferred from Kosovo to \n     jails in Serbia proper around the time of the entry of \n     international forces into Kosovo, have not been released in \n     the year since, that several have received harsh sentences in \n     show trials, and that problems regarding access to and \n     treatment of such prisoners continue;\n       9. Recalling that the people and governments of the former \n     Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Slovenia have positive \n     records of respect for the rights of persons belonging jto \n     national minorities, the rule of law and democratic \n     traditions since independence;\n       10. Welcoming the commitment of the newly elected \n     leadership of Croatia to progress regarding respect for human \n     rights, refugee returns and the elimination of corruption;\n       11. Believing that the people of Serbia share the right of \n     all peope to enjoy life under democratic institutions;\n       12. Viewing democratic development throughout Serbia and \n     Montenegro as essential to long-term stability in the region, \n     including the implementation of agreements regarding Bosnia \n     and Herzegovina and Kosovo;\n       13. Noting that the regime of Slobodan Milosevic has been \n     engaged in a planned effort both to repress independent \n     media, and to crush political opposition, in Serbia, through \n     the use of unwarranted fines, arrests, detentions, \n     seizures, blackouts, jamming, and possibly assassination \n     attempts, and also engaged in an effort to stop student \n     and other independent movements;\n       14. Recognizing the importance of the Stability Pact to the \n     long-term prosperity, peace and stability of southeastern \n     Europe;\n       15. Supporting OSCE Missions throughout the region in their \n     efforts to ensure peace, security and the construction of \n     civil society; and\n       16. Recalling the legally binding obligation of States to \n     cooperate fully with the International Criminal Tribunal for \n     the former Yugoslavia, contained in UN Security Council \n     Resolution 827 or 25 May 1993, including the apprehension of \n     indicted persons present on their territory and the prompt \n     surrender of such person to the Tribunal;\n       17. Insists that all parties in the region make the utmost \n     effort to ensure the safe return and resettlement of all \n     displaced persons and refugees, regardless of ethnicity, \n     religious belief or political orientation, and to work \n     towards reconciliation between all sections of society;\n       18. Encourages members of all ethnic groups in southeastern \n     Europe, especially in Kosovo, Bosnia and Serbia, to respect \n     human rights and the rule of law;\n       19. Reiterates its call upon all authorities of the Federal \n     Republic of Yugoslavia, in accordance with international \n     humanitarian law, to continue to provide for the ICRC ongoing \n     access to all ethnic Albanians kept in prisons in Serbia, to \n     ensure the humane treatment of such prisoners, and to arrange \n     for the release of prisoners held without charge;\n       20. Encourages the newly elected leadership of Croatia to \n     continue their efforts to reform and modernize their country \n     in a manner that reflects a commitment to human rights, the \n     rule of law, democracy and a market-based economy;\n       21. Condemns the repressive measures taken by the regime of \n     Slobodan Milosevic to suppress free media, to stop student \n     and other independent movements, and to intimidate political \n     opposition in Serbia, all in blatant violation of OSCE norms;\n       22. Urges the regime of Slobodan Milosevic to immediately \n     cease its repressive measures and to allow free and fair \n     elections to be held at all levels of government throughout \n     Serbia and monitored by the international community;\n       23. Calls upon Slobodan Milosevic to respect human rights \n     and other international norms of behaviour in Montenegro;\n       24. Calls upon the international community to fully \n     implement the Stability Pact, under OSCE auspices, in an \n     effort to integrate the nations of South-Eastern Europe into \n     the broader European community, and to strengthen those \n     countries in their efforts to foster peace, democracy, \n     respect for human rights and economic prosperity, in order to \n     achieve stability in the whole region;\n       25. Encourages all representatives of the international \n     community operating in southeastern Europe, including the \n     OSCE, the United Nations, the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization and other non-governmental organizations to \n     actively promote respect for human rights and the rule of \n     law;\n       26. Urges participating States to provide sufficient \n     numbers of civilian police to those international policing \n     efforts deployed in conjunction with peacekeeping efforts in \n     post-conflict situations such as Kosovo;\n       27. Calls upon the international community to target \n     assistance programmes to help those persons returning to \n     their original homes have the personal security and economic \n     opportunity to remain;\n       28. Calls upon the participating States to organize, \n     including through the OSCE and its Office for Democratic \n     Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) programmes that can \n     assist and promote democratic change in Serbia, and protect \n     it in Montenegro; and\n       29. Reiterates its condemnation of any effort to provide \n     persons indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for \n     the Former Yugoslavia, and its support for sanctioning any \n     State which provides such persons with any form of protection \n     from arrest.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/26/senate-section/article/S7637-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7637-S7641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask the indulgence of the Senate to do \nsomething that I did 10 years ago; that is, to recognize the 10th \nanniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act by doing what I did \non the floor 10 years ago. I will do a little bit of sign language with \nrespect to that.\n  (Signing.)\n  Mr. President, what I just said in sign language was that 10 years \nago I stood on the floor of the Senate and spoke in sign language when \nwe passed the Americans with Disabilities Act. The reason I did that \nwas because my brother Frank was my inspiration for all of my work here \nin Congress on disability law.\n  That was the reason that I became the chief sponsor of the Americans \nWith Disabilities Act. I further said that I was sorry to say that my \nbrother passed away last month. Over the last 10 years, he always said \nme that he was sorry the ADA was not there for him when he was growing \nup, but that he was happy that it was here now for young people so they \nwould have a better future. Mr. President, we do celebrate today the \ntenth anniversary of the Americans With Disabilities Act, which has \ntaken its place as one of the greatest civil rights laws in our \nhistory.\n  When you think about it, ten years ago, on July 25, 1990, a person \nwith a disability saw an ad in the paper for a job for which that \nperson was qualified, and went down to the business to interview for \nthe job. The prospective employer could look at that person and say: we \ndon't hire people like you, get out of here. On July 25, 1990, that \nperson was alone. The courthouse door was closed. There was no recourse \nfor that person because there was no ban on discrimination because of \ndisability. We banned it on the basis of race, sex, religion, national \norigin, but not disability. So on July 25, 1990, a person\n\n[[Page S7638]]\n\nwith a disability held the short end of the stick.\n  But one day later, on July 26, 1990, the courthouse doors were \nopened. A person with a disability could now go down to that courthouse \nand enforce his or her civil rights. On July 26th, that one person who \nwas alone the day before became 54 million people, and now that short \nend of the stick became a powerful club by which a disabled American \ncould defend his or her rights.\n  Ten years ago, we as a Nation committed ourselves to the principle \nthat a disability does not eliminate a person's right to participate in \nthe cultural, economic, educational, political and social mainstream. \nTen years ago, we said no to exclusion, no to dependence, no to \nsegregation. We said yes to inclusion, yes to independence, and yes to \nintegration in our society to people with disabilities. That is what \nthe ADA is all about.\n  For me, the ADA, as I have just said, was a lot about my brother \nFrank. He lost his hearing at an early age. Then he was taken from his \nhome, his family and his community and sent across the State to the \nIowa State school for the deaf. People often referred to it as the \nschool for the ``deaf and dumb.'' I remember one time my brother \ntelling me, ``I may be deaf, but I am not dumb.''\n  While at school, Frank was told he could be one of three things: a \ncobbler, a printers assistant, or a baker. When he said he didn't want \nto be any one of those things. They said, OK, you are a baker. So after \nhe got out of school, he became a baker. But that is not what he wanted \nto do. So he went on to do other things, obviously.\n  Everyday tasks were always hard. I remember, as a young boy, going \nwith my older brother Frank to a store and how the sales person, when \nshe found out that he was deaf, looked through him like he was \ninvisible and turned to me to ask me what he wanted; or how when he \nwanted to get a driver's license, he was told that ``deaf people don't \ndrive.'' So his life was not easy because the deck was stacked against \nhim. He truly held the short end of the stick.\n  I remember when my brother finally changed jobs. He got out of baking \nand got a job at a plant in Des Moines. He had a good job at Delavan's. \nMr. Delavan decided he wanted to hire people with disabilities, and so \nmy brother went to work there. He had a great job. He became a drill \npress operator making jet nozzles for jet engines. He was very proud of \nhis work. Later on, I was in the Navy, in the military. I remember when \nI came home on leave for Christmas, and I was unmarried at the time. I \ncame home to spend it with my brother Frank, who was also unmarried, \nand the company he worked for had a Christmas dinner. So I went with my \nbrother to it, not knowing that anything special was going to happen. \nIt turned out that they were honoring Frank that night, because in 10 \nyears of working there he had not missed one day of work and hadn't \nbeen late once. Mr. President, that is during Iowa winters. So, again, \nthat is an indication of just how hard-working and dedicated people \nwith disabilities are when they do get a job. He worked at that plant \nfor 23 years, and in 23 years he missed 3 days of work. And that was \nbecause of an unusual blizzard.\n\n  Another little funny aside. In ADA, we mandated a nationwide relay \nsystem for the deaf, so that a deaf person could call a hearing person, \nand a hearing person could call a deaf person without having to use the \nTTY. One of the first calls made on the nationwide relay system was \nfrom the White House in 1993, when President Clinton put in a call to \nmy brother Frank. We had it all set up. President Clinton called the \nnumber, and the line was busy. All the national press was there and \neverything. He waited a few seconds and the line was busy again. It was \nbusy three or four times. Finally, I called my neighbor in Cumming, \nIowa, and I said, ``Go over and find out what is going on.'' My brother \nwas so excited that he had been on the phone talking to his friends. He \nforgot that the President was going to call him. President Clinton \nrelated that story at the FDR memorial this morning in celebration of \nthe Americans With Disabilities Act and reminded me again of what the \nADA was all about. As President Clinton so eloquently said this \nmorning, it is about ensuring that every American can just do ordinary \nthings, such as use the phone, go shopping, use public transportation. \nIt is also about ensuring that every American has access to resources \nas fundamental as health insurance, a job, an education--things that we \ntake for granted.\n  The ADA is about designing our policies and physical environment so \nthat we as a Nation can benefit from the talent of every citizen. It is \nabout acknowledging that it costs much more to squander the potential \nof millions of people than to make the modest accommodations that let \nall Americans contribute fully. It is about tearing down the false \ndichotomy of abled and disabled, and realizing that each of us has a \nunique set of abilities.\n  Mr. President, a few weeks ago, in anticipation of this tenth \nanniversary celebration of ADA, I announced ``A Day in the Life of the \nADA Campaign.'' I asked people from across America to send stories \nabout how their lives are different because of ADA. I wanted to find \nout just what the ADA meant to other people in ordinary life.\n  Based on these stories, I have learned that the ADA is truly changing \nthe face of America.\n  A woman from Vinton, Iowa who uses a wheelchair wrote to tell me that \nbecause of the ADA, she now can travel around the country. She said:\n\n       You can't understand until you've been there, searching for \n     a hotel room, a restroom to stop in, a room to accommodate \n     you, your spouse and your wheelchair. Oh, the joy of now \n     knowing there are rest areas where we can stop, enter in \n     without great difficulty, and then travel on to a waiting \n     accessible motel room! What a good feeling to call ahead, \n     make reservations and know that when we arrive there we'd \n     find a clean room, ready to accommodate my needs.\n\n  A man from St. Paul, Minnesota who is visually-impaired wrote to say \nthat because of accommodations required by the ADA, he can use city \nbuses with dignity, hear the audible traffic signals, and work. He said \nthat the ADA also enables him to enjoy cultural activities, because he \ncan listen to narrations of plays through earphones and basketball \ngames through special radio receivers. In his words:\n\n       [The ADA] has made my life 1000 times better than my \n     father's who was also totally blind.\n\n  And, a woman from Corpus Christi, Texas, whose daughter is hearing \nimpaired told me that her daughter is able to join her schoolmates in \nclasses and activities because of relay services and interpreters. The \nmother also told me that because of the ADA-required relay services, \nher daughter was able to speak with her father for the first time.\n\n       When my daughter was just 4 years old, she got to call her \n     real father for the first time. I wish you could have seen \n     the sparkle in her eyes and the tears in mine as she `talked' \n     with her daddy. It took forever (she couldn't type) but the \n     relay service was friendly and patient. I believe that Relay \n     has played a part in keeping their relationship strong. Every \n     little girl needs her daddy.\n\n  Mr. President, I have a whole stack of these stories. I will not ask \npermission for all, but I ask unanimous consent to have some of the \nmore poignant stories that I received from around the country be \nprinted in the Record. They are very short.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Success Stories From U.S. Senator Tom Harkin's ``A Day in the Life of \n             the Americans with Disabilities Act'' Campaign\n\n\n                                New York\n\n       Summary: According to a man in New York with cerebral \n     palsy, the ADA-required ramps, elevators, automatic doors, \n     curb cuts, and accessible transportation have allowed him to \n     be more independent in his life. Thanks to the ADA, he is now \n     able to do his own banking, go to the post office or shop by \n     himself, or enjoy a meal at a restaurant. Reasonable \n     accommodation requirements have allowed him to work as an \n     advocate for people with disabilities and earn money to \n     contribute to his household expenses. In his words, the ADA \n     has allowed him to ``show my community that I am willing and \n     able to be like anyone else in ways like getting a job and \n     being independent.''\n       Quotation: [Prior to the ADA,] I felt that I was not a real \n     human being because people with disabilities . . . were not \n     supposed to be seen or heard . . . [The ADA] opened the door \n     to freedom for people with all types of disabilities . . . \n     The ADA is a step toward reaching equal ground for EVERYONE! \n     . . . Doing things on my own makes me feel like I am a PERSON \n     and gives me a lot of confidence in myself''.\n\n[[Page S7639]]\n\n                               Tennessee\n\n       Summary: A man from Tennessee has been quadriplegic since \n     an automobile accident in 1990, the very year that the ADA \n     was signed. According to him, the ADA has helped him pursue \n     his academic, as well as employment, dreams. The ADA helped \n     him to earn an undergraduate degree and was even the subject \n     of his master's thesis during graduate school at a Tennessee \n     state university.\n       Quotation: [With the passage of the ADA], my physical \n     impairments that had recently been introduced to a cold world \n     now had a blanket. A blanket provided by my country . . . My \n     disability and the ADA were born together and this year we \n     celebrate 10 years of success, for the both of us.\n\n\n                                Maryland\n\n       Summary: A woman from Maryland is the mother of three \n     autistic children--all of whom have benefitted from the ADA. \n     Because of the ADA, she looks forward to her children \n     graduating from school and working in the community when they \n     grow up.\n       Quotations: Ten years ago before the ADA my boys would have \n     been wrenched with heart ache as they walked with their heads \n     hung down in shame. They would feel the pain of having a \n     disorder that would make them stand and learn apart from the \n     other children at school. I am not sure what their future \n     holds in store. I know that the supports are in place.\n\n\n                         Sacramento, California\n\n       Summary: A man with muscular dystrophy from Sacramento, \n     California, cannot imagine what his life would be like \n     without the ADA and celebrates July 26 as the ``Other \n     Independence Day.'' He credits the ADA with making his life \n     ``full and independent'' by requiring stores, restaurants, \n     parks, and theaters to be accessible to all people.\n       Quotation: The ADA embodies what people with disabilities \n     really want, to be viewed as people first, not judged or \n     excluded because of our disabilities. We want to earn a \n     living, raise families, go to restaurants, churches and live \n     our lives as independently as possible with dignity and \n     respect and not be excluded because of barriers--be they \n     architectural, communication or attitudinal barriers.\n\n\n                        Moss Point, Mississippi\n\n       Summary: A woman from Moss Point, Mississippi has been in a \n     wheelchair since 1997. The ADA makes it possible for her to \n     do her own grocery shopping, attend events at her \n     grandchildren's school, go to dinner ``anywhere,'' travel, \n     and stay in a handicapped room at a motel with the ``greatest \n     shower [she has] ever seen''.\n       Quotation: No one plans to become handicapped, but I am \n     grateful the ADA Program planned for me.\n\n\n                        Arroyo Grand, California\n\n       Summary: A man from Arroyo Grand, California who uses a \n     wheelchair says that he has benefitted from the ADA in a \n     variety of ways. Because of the ADA, he is able to watch his \n     nieces play basketball in an accessible gymnasium, to play \n     chess in accessible recreation rooms, even to attend a Bob \n     Dylan concert and to shut his own apartment door.\n       Quotation: The success of the Americans with Disabilities \n     Act over the last ten years was caused by its enormous power. \n     Knowledge of its power brings improvement. The reason the ADA \n     is powerful is that all businesses know about it, and people \n     with disabilities can communicate with that powerful \n     knowledge . . . Everywhere I go today I can seriously say \n     ``ADA'' and get a response.\n\n\n                             Salem, Indiana\n\n       Summary: A woman from Salem, Indiana, uses a wheelchair and \n     has limited use of one arm. She credits the ADA for the \n     construction of buildings where her disability ``never occurs \n     to [her]''--with aisles wide enough to accommodate a \n     wheelchair, bathrooms that are accessible, and drinking \n     fountains at chair level. She writes of the joy of being \n     allowed access, via outside elevators and ramps, to such \n     historical sites as Thomas Jefferson's Monticello and the \n     Lincoln Memorial.\n       Quotation: Dear ADA, Thank you for being there when we need \n     you, the curb cuts, low-incline ramps, the grab bars and the \n     list goes on and on . . . ADA, what life has done to us, you \n     have equalized it, with accessibility.\n\n\n                          Greenbelt, Maryland\n\n       Summary: A man who lives in Greenbelt, Maryland and is \n     hearing impaired thanks the ADA for increasing public \n     awareness of the abilities the ``disabled'' have. He praises \n     the ADA for helping him become an attorney and allowing him \n     to help other people with disabilities ``achieve their \n     dreams.'' According to him, the ADA has impacted almost every \n     aspect of his daily life, from the time he turns on the \n     television with closed-captioning in the morning, to the time \n     he attends a city advisory meeting with an interpreter at \n     night.\n       Quotation: The impact of the ADA is felt throughout my \n     daily life. When I turn on the TV in the morning, I can watch \n     captions and public service announcements because of the ADA. \n     When I go to work and make phone calls, I use the \n     telecommunication relay services enacted by the ADA. I talk \n     with my friends who are given accommodations on the job as \n     required by the ADA. In the afternoon I go to the doctor's \n     office and am able to communicate with my doctor because the \n     ADA has required the presence of a sign language interpreter. \n     After the doctor's office, I decide to go shopping and am \n     able to find a TTY (as required by the ADA) in the mall to \n     call my family and let them know that I will be a bit late \n     arriving home. After dinner with my family, I go to [city \n     meeting] . . . and am able to participate fully . . . because \n     the ADA allows me to receive the services of a sign language \n     interpreter. In short, the ADA has had a major impact on \n     almost every facet of my life.\n\n\n                           Waukegan, Illinois\n\n       Summary: A 25-year-old social worker who is sight impaired \n     writes from Waukegan, Illinois. According to her, Title III \n     of the ADA has allowed her to receive bank statements in \n     Braille and to balance her checkbook. She is now able to \n     enjoy a level of privacy that many Americans take for \n     granted.\n       Quotation: I now receive my statements in the mail every \n     month, as do other bank customers. This might seem like a \n     small victory to some. Obviously such people have never been \n     denied the ability to read something so personal as a bank \n     statement.\n\n\n                         Las Cruces, New Mexico\n\n       Summary: A woman from Las Cruces, New Mexico, uses a \n     wheelchair and credits the ADA for allowing her to ``pick up \n     and make a move across the country'' to a new home. She says \n     that the ADA has given her her life back and made her a \n     ``possibility-thinker'' again.\n       Quotation: I know that things are made possible for the \n     disabled now because IT'S THE LAW. We have greater options, \n     self-respect and better public awareness because of the ADA . \n     . . My independence and free will are intact.\n\n\n                                 Texas\n\n       Summary with Quotation: A woman from Texas is hearing-\n     impaired and writes of how the ADA has allowed her to return \n     to academia. After teaching for 20 years, she was forced to \n     quit teaching college-level English when she could no longer \n     hear her students in the classroom. In her words ``it tore my \n     heart out to give it up.'' Now, because of services for \n     disabled students required by the ADA, she can attend \n     literature courses at a university by wearing a headset that \n     amplifies her professor's voice. In her words, ``[it] was \n     sheer heaven to be in the classroom again.''\n\n\n                          Glen Ellyn, Illinois\n\n       Summary and Quotations: A man in Glen Ellyn, Illinois who \n     is sight impaired regards the ADA as ``a necessary civil \n     rights law.'' Because of the ADA's employment provisions, he \n     has been able to ask his employer to make materials--such as \n     benefits information, texts for training courses, and time \n     sheets--in an alternative format. Because of the ADA's \n     transportation provisions, he has been able to travel on \n     public transportation, because bus drivers now call out \n     individual stops. Because of the ADA's public accommodation \n     requirements, he is able to order what he wants at \n     restaurants and to attend hotels and movie theaters \n     independently.\n\n\n                        Brookline, Massachusetts\n\n       Summary and Quotations: A hearing-impaired man from \n     Brookline, Massachusetts, writes to praise the ADA. Having \n     grown up in Trinidad without the benefits of disability \n     legislation, he appreciates being able to attend open-\n     captioned movie theaters, use the Boston subways, which have \n     visual displays announcing stops, and have access to \n     interpreting services for work-related meetings and training \n     sessions. He writes of the ``growing respect'' people give to \n     individuals with disabilities and ``awareness'' that is \n     motivated by more than ``just a legal obligation.''\n\n\n                      Rocky Mount, North Carolina\n\n       Summary: A man in Rocky Mount, North Carolina who has been \n     a paraplegic all his life thanks the ADA for allowing him \n     ``to become as independent as others.'' He now has access to \n     a variety of school, shopping malls, and sports and \n     entertainment events. Because of the ADA, he has job \n     opportunities that he never could have dreamed of growing up.\n       Quotation: ``When I was growing up I had to go to certain \n     schools and shopping malls that were accessible. Sports and \n     entertainment was something you dreamed about, but was never \n     able to participate in. . . . But now things are different, \n     thanks to the [ADA] . . . [The ADA] has made us . . . able to \n     say, ``Don't look at my disability, but look at my ability.' \n     ''\n\n\n                         Arkadelphia, Arkansas\n\n       Summary: A sight-impaired student in Arkadelphia, Arkansas, \n     credits the ADA for making her first year at a state \n     university a ``beautiful experience and resounding success.'' \n     Because the ADA requires colleges to ensure equal access to \n     educational information, she is able to get a quality college \n     education.\n       Quotation: [The ADA] has really helped the disabled people \n     that are present on our campus to get as good an education as \n     possible and also to make their college career a beautiful \n     experience and a resounding success.\n\n\n                        South Amboy, New Jersey\n\n       Summary: A woman from South Amboy, New Jersey who has \n     mental, behavioral, and learning disabilities says that the \n     ADA has made her feel included in community life. Through her \n     local independent living center, a psycho-social \n     rehabilitation program, an anger management workshop, and \n     other support and advocacy groups, she has learned to accept \n     her disabilities and ``welcome them as a dimension to [her \n     life].''\n\n[[Page S7640]]\n\n       Quotation: Most importantly, I strongly believe that the \n     ADA is breaking both physical and attitudinal barriers in the \n     community and society so citizens with all disabilities are \n     able to live, inclusive, full, productive, and independent \n     lives.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the ADA, of course, ultimately is about \nour children. They will be the first generation to grow up with the \nADA--the first generation in which children with and without \ndisabilities play together on the playground, learn together in school, \nhang out together at the mall and the movie theater, and go out \ntogether for pizza. These children who will grow up as classmates and \nfriends and neighbors will now see each other as neighbors and \ncoworkers--no longer segregated. That is what the ADA is about. It has \nopened up new worlds for people with disabilities--where people with \ndisabilities are participating more and more in their communities, \nliving fuller lives as students, as coworkers, as taxpayers, as \nconsumers, voters, and neighbors.\n  But we must never forget that prohibiting discrimination is not the \nsame as ensuring equal opportunity. President Johnson understood this \nwhen he said: ``[Y]ou cannot shackle men and women for centuries, then \nbring them to the starting line of a race and say, `You see, we're \ngiving you an equal chance.'\"\n  That is why we all work so hard for the Ticket to Work and Work \nIncentives Improvement Act because we had to set the stage to change \nthe employment rate for people with disabilities. That is why we all \nwork so hard to defend the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, \nbecause there is no equal opportunity without education.\n  I am proud that this morning President Clinton announced a new effort \nby the Federal Government to open up an additional 100,000 jobs in the \nFederal Government for people with disabilities. That is leadership. I \nthank President Clinton for providing that leadership.\n  Again, that is why we have to fight against genetic discrimination. \nThat is why we have to add people with disabilities to the Hate Crimes \nAct that passed the Senate, and to make sure it becomes law.\n  That is why we have to fight to make sure we don't lose in the \nSupreme Court what we gained in Congress. There is a case now pending \nbefore the Supreme Court in which a State has argued that title II of \nthe ADA which applies to State governments should be held \nunconstitutional because the Federal Government does not have the power \nto enforce the ADA against the States in the way other civil rights \nlaws are.\n  The Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the \nbasis of race, applies to all the States and State governments. Now a \nState is arguing that the ADA, a civil rights law for people with \ndisabilities, should not apply to States. They are saying: Don't worry. \nThe State says: Leave it to us. We will make sure that people aren't \nsubject to employment discrimination. We will make sure that people \naren't forced to live inside institutions or carried up the steps in \norder to get into the local courthouse.\n  Some of us remember after the 1964 civil rights bill was passed that \nStates were arguing the same thing: Leave it to the States; they will \ntake care of civil rights; we don't need the Federal Government coming \nin.\n  What I think we are forgetting is that this is a civil rights law \nthat covers the citizens of America. We are all in this together. We \nare talking about citizens'--Federal, national--constitutional rights \nto equal protection under the law. It is up to this Federal Congress to \nensure that citizens with disabilities get that equal treatment. That \nis why we have title II of the ADA.\n  In sign language, there is a wonderful sign for America. It is this: \nThis is the sign for America, all of the fingers put together, joining \nthe hands in a circle. That describes America for all. We are all \ntogether. We are not separated out. We are all within one circle; a \nfamily--the deaf sign. It is not separate and apart. It is not one \nState and another State when it comes to civil rights and ensuring \nequal protection of the law. We will not let the Supreme Court rewrite \nhistory and erase civil rights--the national civil rights for people \nwith disabilities.\n\n  Finally, we have to close the digital divide to make sure that people \nwith disabilities have full access to the new technologies.\n  Last night, Vice President Gore held a reception at the Vice \nPresident's house for literally hundreds and hundreds of people with \ndisabilities from all over America. It was a great event to celebrate \nthe 10th anniversary. In one tent, they set up a wide variety of new \ntechnologies to assist people with disabilities. I was particularly \ntaken with one new device that had a cathode ray tube, CRT. It was \nhooked up to a PC. There was a little device under the net, a CRT that \nlooked up at your eyes. You sat there for a second and it calibrated \nit. With your eye movement alone, you could turn on lights, turn off \nlights, make phone calls, talk to people, type letters, get on the \nInternet, only by moving your eyes.\n  Think about what that means for people who have Lou Gehrig's disease \nor severe cerebral palsy. There are a lot of disabled people who can't \ndo anything but move their eyes. But their mind is perfect.\n  One perfect example that Vice President Gore always uses is Stephen \nHawkins, perhaps the smartest individual in the world, who is fully \nimmobile because of his disability. Yet here is a machine that will \nallow him to more rapidly access information and to write his wonderful \nbooks about the universe. That is what I mean when I say we ought to \nclose the digital divide because there is so much out there that can \nhelp people with disabilities.\n  Lastly, I say that the next step we have to do is fight and win \nagainst the continued segregation of people with disabilities from \ntheir own communities. That is why we have to move forward on the bill \ncalled MiCASSA, S. 1935, a bill that is pending in the Senate right \nnow--the Medicaid Community Attendant Services and Supports Act--a \nbipartisan bill that will eliminate institutional bias in the Federal \nMedicaid program and give people with disabilities and the elderly a \nreal choice to live in their communities. Right now, Medicaid is biased \ntoward institutionalization.\n\n  Why shouldn't we give a person with a disability the right to decide \nwhere he or she wants to live and how they want to live? Let them live \nin their own home, in their own community settings. That is what S. \n1935 is about. The disability community all over this country \nunderstands personal attendants are sorely needed. No individual should \nbe forced into an institution just to receive reimbursement for \nservices that can be effectively and efficiently delivered in the home \nof the community. Individuals must be empowered to exercise real choice \nin selecting long-term services and supports that meet their unique \nneeds and allow them to be independent. Federal and State Medicaid \npolicies should be responsive to and not impede an individual's choice \nin selecting services and supports.\n  This bill eliminates the bias toward institutional care. It would \nhelp deliver services and supports consistent with the principle that \npeople with disabilities have the right to live in the most integrated \nsetting appropriate to meeting that individual's unique needs.\n  In last year's Olmstead decision, the Supreme Court found that to the \nextent that Medicaid dollars are used to pay for a person's long-term \ncare, that person has a civil right to receive those services in the \nmost integrative settings. Therefore, we in Congress have a \nresponsibility to help States meet the financial costs associated with \nserving people with disabilities who want to leave institutions and \nlive in the community. MiCASSA, as the bill is known, S. 1935, will \nprovide that help.\n  A lot of people say this will cost money. Actually, it will save \nmoney. Medicaid spending on long-term care in 1997 totaled $56 billion, \nbut only $13.5 billion was spent on home and community-based services. \nThat $13.5 billion paid for the care of almost 2 million people.\n  In contrast, the $42.5 billion we spent on institutional care paid \nfor just a little over 1 million people.\n  The average annual cost of institutional care for people with \ndisabilities is more than double the average annual cost of providing \nhome and community-based services. Right now, all across the country, \nhundreds of thousands of people are providing unpaid\n\n[[Page S7641]]\n\nsupport to sons and daughters, mothers, fathers, sisters and brothers, \nto allow them to remain in the community. Yet when they turn to the \ncurrent long-term care system for relief, all too often all they can do \nis add their name to a very long waiting list. That is not right. That \nis not just. That is not fair. These family care givers are sacrificing \ntheir own employment opportunities and costing the country millions in \ntaxable income.\n  Lastly, I take a moment to remark on the surplus. Lately that is all \nwe are hearing about is how much surplus we will have over the next 10 \nyears. I hear now it is up to $2 trillion and counting. We have some \nvery important decisions to make about what we do with the surplus. \nEveryone is lining up--tax breaks here, tax cuts here, tax breaks here, \nfor business, for corporations, for this group, for that group--all \nlining up to get some of that surplus.\n  I believe we have to make some important decisions. I believe we have \nto use that money to pay down the debt, shore up Social Security, make \nsure that our seniors get what they need under Medicare. With all these \ngroups lining up to get a piece of the action on the surplus, I am \nasking: What about the disability community? What about the Americans \nall over our country who want to live in their own communities, who \nwant supportive services in their homes, who want personal assistance \nservices so they can go to work every day? I believe we should use some \nof that surplus to make sure that all Americans have the equal right to \nlive in the community--not just in spirit, but in reality.\n  As I said, our present Medicaid policy has an institutional bias. We \nneed to use some of this surplus to get people in their own homes and \ncommunities. There may be some transitional cost, but we know later on \nwhen these people start going to work, when their families and the \nfamily care givers who are at home now and underemployed, are employed, \nwhen they go to work they are working, making money, paying taxes.\n\n  Yes, when we are talking about what we are going to do with that \nsurplus, let's not forget we have millions of Americans far too long \nsegregated, far too long kept out of the main stream of society, far \ntoo long denied their rights as American citizens to full integration \nin our society. It is time we do the right thing. It is time when we \nmake decisions about the surplus, we use some of that to make sure that \npeople with disabilities are able to live and work and travel as they \nwant.\n  ADA may stand for the Americans with Disabilities Act, but it stands \nfor more than that. It really stands for the American dream for all.\n  In closing, as I said earlier, my brother, Frank, passed away last \nmonth. I miss him now and I will miss him forever. He was a wonderful \nbrother to me. He was a great friend. He was my great inspiration. He \nwas proud of what the ADA meant for people with disabilities. For 10 \nyears he and millions of people across our country lived out its \npossibilities. So I thank my brother, Frank. I thank everyone else in \nthe entire disability community who was an inspiration for me, who \nworked so hard for the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n  I include in that many of my fellow Senators and Representatives. \nThis was never a partisan bill. It is not now a partisan bill. It will \nnever be a partisan bill. Too many good people on both sides of the \naisle worked hard. Senator Weicker, who led the charge early on, before \nI even got to the Senate; Senator Dole, who worked so hard, so long, to \nmake sure we got ADA through; Boyden Grey, Counsel to the President who \nworked with us every step of the way; Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, \nwhat a giant he was, hung in there, day after day, working to make sure \nwe got it through. On our side of the aisle, Senator Kennedy, who made \nsure we had all the hearings, got the people there, made the record, to \nensure that ADA was on solid ground; Tony Coehlo from the House of \nRepresentatives, and Representative Steny Hoyer in the House; \nCongressman Steve Bartlett, another great giant, Republican leader in \nthe House at that time, later on became mayor of Dallas. He was there \nthis morning, too.\n  At that time, there weren't Democrat and there weren't \nRepublicans. We were all in that same boat together, and we were all \npulling together. We were, as I said earlier, Mr. President--the deaf \nsign for Americans is this (signing)--all of us together, fingers \nintertwined, all of us in that same family circle. That is what ADA is \nabout. It is about this deaf sign. We are all in this together.\n\n  We want to make sure the ADA really does stand for the American dream \nfor all.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). Under the previous order, \nSenator DeWine is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I believe the Senator from Ohio will yield \nto me, and I ask unanimous consent to be recognized for a few remarks \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/26/senate-section/article/S7641-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7641-S7642]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING SENATOR PAUL COVERDELL\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, all last week I deferred coming to the \nfloor to speak about my friend, Paul Coverdell, on the ground that it \nmight be easier to do so this week. It is not. It is not, but it is \nvitally important to memorialize such a friend.\n  Every Monday evening or Tuesday morning, Paul Coverdell and I sat at \nthe end of the table during leadership meetings in the majority \nleader's office, with an opportunity to comment on all of the issues \nthat came before that group. Frequently, however, at the end of the \ntable, we would exchange whispered remarks on some of the other people \nor subject matter, either present or not present. Paul Coverdell had a \nwonderful sense of humor, there and elsewhere: Dry, gentle, always to \nthe point. It was a delightful pleasure to share those moments, \nsometimes stressful, sometimes marvelously relaxed, with such a man.\n  If you sought advice on a matter of vitally important public policy, \nPaul Coverdell was one of the first you would seek out. You knew that \nanything he would discuss with you would be filled with wisdom and \ncommon sense, and that stacking your remarks against his would focus \nand sharpen your own thoughts and your own ideas. It hardly mattered \nwhat the subject was--education, taxes, national security, a dozen \nothers; the advice was always good and always relevant.\n  If you then sought tactics or advice on how to accomplish a shared \ngoal, Paul Coverdell was a man whom you sought out. Particularly if \nthere were an individual in your own party, or in the other party, whom \nyou might be reluctant, for one reason or another, to approach, you \ncould ask Paul Coverdell to do it for you, and he would. There was no \ntask, there was no detail that was too small for him, none that he \nthought was beneath him, if it was constructive, if it would help the \ncause in the long term.\n\n  One way in which you can determine individuals' reactions to other \nindividuals is in a group. At the Republican conference meeting \nimmediately before the Fourth of July recess, Paul Coverdell, as the \nSecretary of the conference, presented us a little plastic note card, \nthe top of which read ``Republican Policy.'' I no longer remember the \nparticular subject, but I do remember that first one or two people \nsaid, ``I don't agree with point 3.'' Pretty soon, everyone was piling \non. Finally, one of our colleagues wrote across the top of this, ``One \nRepublican's Policy,'' and handed it back to Paul Coverdell, who just \nwent back to perfect his message.\n  Whom you tease, you generally love. That in many respects was an \nexpression of the love and respect his Republican colleagues had for \nPaul Coverdell.\n  Paul Coverdell made us all proud of our profession, a profession \noften criticized, in fact a profession rarely praised. When a State \nsends a Paul Coverdell to the Senate, it is proof positive that our \nsystem works. And when the Senate of the United States listens to and \nrespects and follows a Paul Coverdell, that, too, is proof that our \nsystem works. When, as was my privilege, you come to know and be \nbefriended by a Paul Coverdell, you are especially privileged and \nespecially honored. I was so privileged. I was so honored.\n  I will not know his like again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n[[Page S7642]]\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I congratulate my colleague from \nWashington State on very eloquent comments about our dear friend, Paul \nCoverdell. I had the chance a few days ago to make some more extensive \ncomments than I will tonight about Senator Coverdell. But I just want \nto add, I had the opportunity, as many Members of the Senate did, to \ntravel to Atlanta this past weekend to participate in that very \nwonderful service for our dear friend. I don't think it really hit me \nthat he was really gone until I got back this week to Washington and \nstarted contemplating this Senate body without Paul Coverdell and all \nthat he meant to each and every one of us. He was our friend. We loved \nhim very much. This body, this institution, is a poorer place because \nhe is gone.\n  Each one of us is richer because we were privileged to know this very \ngentle, this very kind, this very sweet, this very good man.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/26/senate-section/article/S7642-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7642]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING VIRGINIA ``GINNY'' GANO\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, on a happy note, I rise this evening to \nhonor someone who has spent the last 30 years of her life serving the \npeople of this country, of this Congress, of the State of Ohio; \nspecifically, of the Seventh Congressional District in Ohio.\n  I am talking about a dear friend of mine, Virginia ``Ginny'' Gano. I \nhad the great pleasure and honor to work with her during my years as \nCongressman from the Seventh Congressional District in Ohio. Ginny is \nnow in her 31st year of service to the people. She is truly an \nambassador for the Seventh district and for the entire State of Ohio.\n  Ginny grew up in Springfield, OH. She started working for Congressman \nBud Brown at a very young age in 1969. In 1982, when I was elected to \nthe House of Representatives, I asked Ginny if she would come work with \nme. I became the Congressman. Ginny agreed to stay on and work in our \noffice. During that time, Ginny Gano was really invaluable to me and \ninvaluable to our office and to the people of the district. She had and \nhas an unbelievable wealth of knowledge and institutional memory. If \nyou want something done, if you want to know something, you ask Ginny \nGano.\n  In 1991, she joined current Seventh District Congressman David \nHobson's team. This evening--I am sure at this very moment--knowing \nGinny, she is still at work in the Longworth Building serving the \npeople in the district.\n  Ginny is one of the hardest working people whom I have ever met. With \nher resources, her experience, and her knowledge, she can answer any \nquestion or just about any request made of her. She never says no. She \nis that good. She gets the job done. She just knows how to get it done. \nWhatever you want, Ginny will figure out a way of getting it done.\n  One of the many things that Ginny has done over the years has been to \nwork with interns in a Congressman's office. She goes to great lengths \nto make sure these young people who come out from Ohio to serve the \npeople and to learn have meaningful experiences in Washington, that \nthey feel at home, that they have someone to look out for them.\n  Ginny has spent the last 30 years helping people in our district and \nhas truly gotten to know the people of the Seventh District, and they \nknow that she cares about them. She is the one constant in the office \nof the Congressman from the Seventh Congressional District. Whether it \nwas Bud Brown, Mike DeWine, or Dave Hobson, Ginny Gano has been there. \nGinny Gano is making a difference.\n  One of the things I appreciate about Ginny so much is that she has a \nway about her that makes everyone feel at ease. Whether it is a group \nof schoolchildren from Greene County or maybe someone whom she bumps \ninto in the Rotunda of the Capitol, a total stranger, it does not \nmatter; Ginny is there to help them and she makes everyone feel welcome \nin our Nation's Capitol. Ginny is a caring and compassionate human \nbeing. Being around Ginny Gano just makes you happy. She is that type \nof person. Her smile, her spirit, her energy--you just feel good when \nyou are around Ginny Gano.\n  Ginny has dedicated some of her free time--the little free time she \nhas--to something she loves: music. For years she has participated with \na great deal of enthusiasm in the Capitol Hill Choral Society. She also \nhas been a driving force behind the Ohio State society's selection of \nthe cherry blossom princess every spring.\n  My wife Fran and I are just so proud to call Ginny Gano a friend. I \nthank her for over 30 years of dedicated service to the people of the \nSeventh Congressional District of the State of Ohio.\n  Ginny, thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/26/senate-section/article/S7642-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7642-S7643]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      P.L. 480 ASSISTANCE IN HAITI\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I want to talk this evening about an issue \nabout which I have spoken before on the floor of the Senate, and that \nis the situation with the children in the poor country of Haiti. I rise \ntonight to remind my colleagues of a very important feeding program \nthat is crucial to these children. The program I am talking about, of \ncourse, is the Public Law 480 title II Food Assistance Program which, \naccording to the USAID mission in Port au Prince in Haiti, helps feed \nroughly 500,000 Haitian schoolchildren and almost 10,000 orphaned \nchildren through its Orphan Feeding Program.\n  As we know, funding for the P.L. 480 title II program was included in \nthe Senate fiscal year 2001 Agriculture appropriations bill, which we \nin the Senate recently passed. I commend and thank the chairman and \nranking member on the subcommittee, Senator Cochran and Senator Kohl, \nand also the chairman and ranking member on the full committee, Senator \nStevens and Senator Byrd, for their continuing ongoing support of \nPublic Law 480.\n  I am very pleased the committee included language in the Agriculture \nappropriations bill that will maintain the same level of USAID \nresources for the Orphan Feeding Program in Haiti as were provided for \nour current year. I urge my colleagues in conference to continue this \nlanguage and continue this program.\n  The reality is that the country of Haiti is a great human tragedy. \nThe nation is in turmoil on a political, economic, and humanitarian \nlevel. Though the small island nation finally did hold its \nparliamentary elections in May after three previous postponements, and \nthough voter turnout was certainly acceptable and the citizens were \nvoting, the openness of these elections remains in serious question. \nThe violence against opposition party members and supporters leading up \nto the May election cast serious doubt on the legitimacy of this \nelection.\n  Leon Manus, the president of the electoral council, resigned after \nthe first round of elections and had to flee the country fearing for \nhis life after having accused the Haitian Government of pressuring him \nto approve the questionable election results.\n  The international community has severely and justifiably criticized \nboth rounds of elections, with the European Union threatening economic \nsanctions. In spite of widespread criticism, in spite of OAS refusal to \nrecognize the contested election results, Haitian officials proceeded \nwith the runoff elections on July 9, and, as expected, a handful of \nHaitians turned out to vote, just a handful of people for the few \nlegislative and local offices that were not already won by the ruling \nLavalas Party.\n  Prior to these elections, I spoke on the Senate floor about Haiti's \ndistressing political and economic situation. I talked at that time \nabout how it was incumbent upon the political elite and the ruling \nparty in Haiti, the Fanmi Lavalas Party, to make and to take reforms \nseriously. As I said then, and I have said many times before, Haiti \nsimply will not progress until its political leaders and the elite in \nthat country take responsibility for their situation and commit to true \ndemocratic reform.\n  Regardless of the recent election outcome, Haiti can succeed as a \ndemocracy if and only if the leaders of the nation, the political \nelite, the ruling elite, the economic elite, resolve to develop a free \nmarket system, resolve to reduce corruption, resolve to improve Haiti's \njudicial system and its election process, resolve to respect human \nrights and develop a sustainable agricultural system that can feed its \npeople, and especially the poor children of Haiti.\n\n  Despite the success--I have seen it; and there has been success--of \nsome\n\n[[Page S7643]]\n\nUSAID programs to promote growth in Haiti's agricultural sector, past \ndeforestation and a lack of education about how best to use the land \nfor both short-term and long-term economic gain have slowed, almost to \na standstill, any improvement in the agricultural sector.\n  Because of that, I firmly believe that the United States should \ncontinue efforts aimed at teaching Haitian farmers viable ways to \nfarm--agriculture that produces food for the Haitian people now and \nconserves the land for production in the future by generations to \ncome--agriculture that shows farmers how sustainable agriculture is \nreally in their best economic interest, both in the short run and in \nthe long run.\n  Efforts to work directly with farmers provide the greatest hope of \npreventing Haitians from abandoning agriculture for urban areas, such \nas Port-au-Prince. One of the biggest problems in Haiti is that so many \npeople who are not making it in agriculture at all, who can't feed \ntheir family, understandably flee the countryside and go into one of \nHaiti's big cities, only to face worse poverty and create a more dire \nsituation for their family. The only way that will stop is if Haiti can \ndevelop, with our assistance, with the assistance of the international \ncommunity, a viable, sustainable agricultural program.\n  As I have said, I have visited Haiti eight or nine times. My wife and \nI have seen many of these programs and have seen that they do, in fact, \nwork. But until sustainable improvements are made in the Haitian \nagricultural sector, I believe we have a responsibility--I believe we \nhave an obligation--to ensure that humanitarian and food assistance \ncontinues to reach this tiny island nation and most particularly, most \nimportantly, continues to reach these children.\n  That is why it is vital that we maintain current funding levels for \nthe Public Law 480 title II assistance program for Haiti and other \nparts of the world as well. The simple fact is, this program is \nessential to the survival--literally the survival--of many thousands of \nHaitian children, especially those living in overcrowded orphanages.\n  There are currently 114 orphanages throughout Haiti receiving USAID \nfunds and caring for a vast number of children. Quite candidly, these \nrepresent just a small fraction of the total number of orphanages on \nthis island.\n  My wife Fran and I have traveled to Haiti repeatedly--eight times in \nthe past 5 years. We visited many of these orphanages. We have seen the \ndire and dismal conditions. We have held the children and felt their \nmalnourished bodies. But we have also seen what can happen with these \nchildren, and how so many dedicated people working in these orphanages \ncan literally nurse these children back to life.\n  The orphanages of Haiti feed and take care of thousands upon \nthousands upon thousands of orphaned and abandoned children. The flow \nof desperate children into these orphanages is constant, and these \nfacilities face the increasing challenge of accommodating these \nchildren.\n  It is these children who need our help the most. It is these children \nwho are not capable of providing for themselves. That is why I am \nconvinced that the Public Law 480 title II feeding program is \nabsolutely essential. This low-cost program guarantees one meal per day \nto orphan children who otherwise would not receive any food at all.\n\n  The school feeding program is also essential because the title II \nassistance program--the offer of a free meal to these children, and the \nparents who send their children to school--helps keep Haitian children \nin school.\n  I again thank the committee for its support for and its commitment to \nPublic Law 480 title II assistance for these children in Haiti.\n  I urge my colleagues on the conference committee--and throughout this \nyear, and into the next--to continue their support for this program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/26/senate-section/article/S7643-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7643]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    COMMENDING AMBASSADOR TIM CARNEY\n\n  Mr. DeWINE.

Mr. President, I rise this evening to celebrate the life \nof a great man from my home State of Ohio, a true renaissance man. I am \ntalking about Erv Nutter, who died on January 6 of this year at the age \nof 85.\n  I am honored to have known Erv and am humbled to have the chance this \nevening to say just a few words about what his friendship has meant to \nme and my family, to my community, and to my State.\n  Ervin John Nutter was born in Hamilton, OH, on June 26, 1914, to \nparents he described as ``a Kentucky schoolteacher and a Wyoming \ncowboy.'' He was a running guard on the State championship Hamilton \nHigh School football team and later graduated from there. He attended \nMiami University in Oxford, OH, and then transferred to the University \nof Kentucky where, at the age of 21, he dropped out to take the Ohio \nexamination for stationary engineers. Following that test, he became \nthe youngest licensed engineer in Ohio, and then took a job at Proctor \n& Gamble in Cincinnati.\n  In 1943, Erv returned to the University of Kentucky to earn his \ndegree in mechanical engineering. After graduation, he took a job in \nthe engineering division of the Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force \nBase, where he was put in charge of aircraft environmental testing.\n  Then in 1951, Erv Nutter founded the Elano Corporation, which \nfabricates metal parts for jet engines. He started the business in a \nGreene County, OH, garage. Elano grew and grew, and it grew ultimately \ninto a multimillion-dollar business that has influenced aviation \nworldwide, through precision forming and bending of tubular assemblies \nfor fuel, and lubrication and hydraulic systems for jet aircraft and \nmissiles.\n  I met Erv Nutter for the first time in 1973. I was right out of law \nschool, on my first job, as an assistant county prosecutor in Greene \nCounty. I remember Sheriff Russell Bradley and then-county prosecutor \nNick Carrera, and I were conducting a major drug investigation. It was \ngoing well. The only problem was, we had run out of money.\n  So we went to some people in the community. One of the first people \nwe went to was Erv Nutter. To keep that investigation going, we simply \nhad to have some financial assistance. So we asked Erv if he would \nhelp. Without any hesitation, as Erv would always do--he didn't ask \nanything--he just said: Sure. If you boys think it's a good idea, if \nyou think we need to do it, I'll do it.\n  When it came to his community, Erv was always ready to lend a hand, \nwhether with his financial resources or his time and energy. That was \njust Erv Nutter.\n  Erv has been a role model for so many people throughout the years. \nThrough his kindness and extreme generosity, he has taught invaluable \nlessons, such as the importance of giving back to our communities, the \nimportance of building and trusting our neighbors, and the economic \nfuture of our villages and our cities.\n\n  Through the years, he donated millions of dollars to the University \nof Kentucky and Wright State University. Today, two buildings at the \nLexington campus bear Erv's name, as does Wright State University's \nindoor athletic complex.\n  Erv Nutter was a blunt man. He was an open man. He was a man who \nwould tell you what he thought, never afraid in any way to express his \nconvictions or his strong beliefs.\n\n[[Page S7644]]\n\n  That is one of the things that made Erv Nutter so endearing. It has \nbeen said that the greatness of a man can be measured by the extent and \nthe breadth of his interests and how he acts on those interests to make \na difference in this world. Surely by that test, Erv Nutter was a great \nman. He was so passionate about his interests, and what interests he \nhad: agriculture, technology, wild game conservation, education, \nsports, history, aviation, or working for a better government. Whatever \nErv was interested in, he cared passionately about and he acted upon. \nAnd in each area, he made a difference. Sure, he helped financially \nbut, more importantly, Erv gave his time and he gave his energy. He was \na man of great passion.\n  In 1981, Erv Nutter was named Greene County Man of the Year. He \nserved as business chairman of the American Cancer Society, chairman of \nthe Fellow's Committee at the University of Kentucky, member of the \nPresident's Club at both Ohio State and Wright State University, past \npresident and trustee of the Aviation Hall of Fame--one of his great \npassions and his wonderful wife, Zoe Dell's great passions; the work \nwith Zoe Dell continues to this day--as former chairman of the Ohio \nRepublican Finance Committee, and former chairman of the Beavercreek \nZoning Commission.\n  In 1995, at the age of 80, Erv was inducted into the Ohio Senior \nCitizens Hall of Fame, an honor for outstanding contributions and \nexceptional achievements begun or continued after the age of 60. Erv \nalways was there for our community. Erv always was there for our State. \nIn all that he did, he made a positive difference. Erv Nutter was a \nremarkable person, a person who affected countless lives for the \nbetter. His family knows that probably better than anyone else because \nthere were so many things Erv Nutter did that he didn't tell anybody \nabout. He just was there to be supportive and to make a difference. He \njust quietly helped out whenever his community asked. And many times \nwhen his community didn't ask, he did it anyway.\n  The only thing Erv wanted was to make the world a better place for \nhis children, his grandchildren, and for all of us. Erv Nutter took \ngreat pleasure in sharing his personal success with the whole \ncommunity. I was particularly struck by Erv's humility. I remember that \nhe once told the Xenia Daily Gazette he was the luckiest man in the \nworld. He was lucky because he had had the opportunity to do so many \nthings he had never, ever, in his wildest dreams, thought he would be \nable to do. He told the paper:\n\n       No one can achieve success by himself. I think this is one \n     of the most important things for people to remember today.\n\n  Erv didn't seek credit. Rather, he appreciated his success and \nunderstood that his community was a great part of that success. We all \nadmired Erv Nutter. We all respected him.\n  As Chesterton once said:\n\n       Great men take up great space, even when they are gone.\n\n  Erv Nutter will continue to take up great space on this Earth, not \njust in buildings but in lives touched and lives changed. Erv Nutter \nwill continue to live on through the great work he has done. He also \nwill live through his wonderful family: his wife Zoe Dell, Joe, Bob and \nMary, Ken and Melinda, Katie and Jonathan.\n  We pay tribute to Erv tonight for what he has meant to our community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/26/senate-section/article/S7644-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7644]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ROCCO SCOTTI--A GREAT AMERICAN\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise to recognize tonight Rocco Scotti, \na talented and patriotic singer from my home State of Ohio, who is a \nfixture in Cleveland and Cuyahoga County, northeast Ohio, a fixture at \nCleveland Indians baseball games and just about any public event in our \ncommunity that matters.\n  Rocco, because of the countless times he has sung our national anthem \nat local, national, and international events, has truly earned the \ntitle of ``Star-Spangled Banner Singer of the Millennium.''\n  Rocco, an Italian American whose family is from Italy's east coast, \ngrew up in Cleveland and started his vocal training in opera. He first \nperformed the national anthem publicly in 1974 at an Indians-Orioles \ngame.\n  Since that time, he has become a regularly featured national anthem \nsinger for both American and National League baseball games, games \nplayed in Cincinnati, Cleveland, New York, for the Baltimore Orioles, \nOakland A's, Kansas City Royals, Toronto Blue Jays, LA Dodgers. The \nlist goes on and on. Rocco has also had the honor of performing the \nnational anthem for Presidents Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan.\n  Rocco's list of accomplishments doesn't end there. He was awarded the \nUnited States civilian Purple Heart for inspiring patriotism for his \nexceptional performance of the national anthem, and he has performed \nthe anthem on national television for events such as the NBC game of \nthe week, an American League playoff game, the 1981 All Star game, and \ncountless other televised sporting events. Dubbed by People's magazine \nas one of the best anthem singers in America, he is the first singer to \nperform the national anthem for the Baseball Hall of Fame \nin Cooperstown, NY. He is a featured singer for the Indians, Cleveland \nCavaliers, and Cleveland Force, and he is the permanent singer of the \nanthem for the Football Hall of Fame ceremonies in Canton, OH.\n\n  While Rocco is most known for his rendition of the national anthem, \nhe is also a featured singer of other nations' anthems. He has sung the \nPolish national anthem for Polish boxing team matches, the Hungarian \nnational anthem for Hungarian basketball games, the Italian national \nanthem for Italian soccer team contests, and the Israeli national \nanthem for the appearance of the Assistant Prime Minister of Israel in \nCleveland.\n  Needless to say, Rocco Scotti is an American icon. His voice, indeed, \nis a national treasure. What impresses me most about Rocco isn't so \nmuch his beautiful voice, although it is beautiful, but his amazing \nattitude about his heritage, his life here in this great country. Rocco \nsaid the following to me once:\n\n       I am very, very proud that with my Italian heritage, God \n     has given me the honor of performing our country's greatest \n     and most meaningful song.\n\n  For that kind of patriotism, love of country, I wish to say thank you \nto Rocco. I am proud to call him the Star-Spangled Banner Singer of the \nMillennium.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/26/senate-section/article/S7644-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7644-S7645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    TRIBUTE TO THE GENERAL DANIEL ``CHAPPIE'' JAMES AMERICAN LEGION \n                           AUXILIARY UNIT 776\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I would like to honor a great \nvolunteer organization from my home state of Ohio--The General Daniel \n``Chappie'' James American Legion Auxiliary Unit 776. Based in the city \nof Dayton, this organization and its members were recognized recently \nby USA Weekend magazine for their participation in the ``Ninth Annual \nMake a Difference Day,'' which is the largest national day of helping \nand volunteerism.\n  To be recognized by USA Weekend, an organization must demonstrate \ngreat efforts and achievements in the areas of volunteerism and \ncommunity service. The General Daniel ``Chappie'' James American Legion \nAuxiliary Unit 776 certainly has done that. One of its members, Mrs. \nOla Matthews, heard that foster children around the Dayton community \nmust carry their belongings through the foster care system in plastic \ntrash bags. This worried her greatly. So, she set about to help these \nchildren. Under her leadership, the members of Unit 776 conducted \nfundraisers to buy luggage and collected luggage from community donors. \nOn October 23, 1999, the members of Unit 776 delivered the fruits of \ntheir effort--over 1,000 pieces of luggage, plus toiletries, \nunderclothes, and baby supplies--to the Montgomery County Children's \nServices in Dayton. This is a remarkable achievement and one \ndemonstrating great selflessness and generosity. It is actions like \nthese--an organization helping those in its community--that makes \nDayton such a great city.\n  Mr. President, one young member of this organization, in particular, \nhas made outstanding contributions to her community. Shatoya Hill, who \nhas been involved in Unit 776 most her life,\n\n[[Page S7645]]\n\nhas just been awarded a $6,000 scholarship for her community service \nand academic achievements. She has been Junior President of the \norganization for over 5 years. During this time, she has organized and \nparticipated in many fundraisers, from helping veterans to delivering \nfood baskets to the needy during Christmas.\n  The Dayton Alumnae Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta, a public service \nsorority, awarded the scholarship, which is presented to young women \nwho have excellent academic records, possess high moral character, \nparticipate in their church and community, and have interest in higher \neducation. Shatoya certainly exhibits all of these positive qualities. \nIt is great to see Ohio youths working hard for their communities and \nbeing recognized for their achievements.\n  Congratulations Unit 776 and congratulations Shatoya!\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

As recently as this morning, upon Chairman Arafat's \narrival back in Gaza, Arafat said:\n\n       There is an agreement between us and the Israeli government \n     made in Sharm-El-Sheikh that we continue negotiations until \n     Sept. 13th, the date for declaring our independent state, \n     with Jerusalem as its capital, whether people like it or not.\n\n  By itself, the threat undermines confidence in the Palestinians' \ncommitment to the peace process and, in effect, would abrogate the \nfoundation of the Oslo accords that all outstanding final status issues \nwill be resolved through negotiations.\n  Allow me, for a moment, to review the history here. More than 50 \nyears ago, the United Nations created two states: Israel and Palestine. \nThe creation of a homeland for the Jews in Israel was unacceptable to \nthe Arabs, and five Arab states attacked the newly created state. When \nall was said and done, Israel was a reality, and the nominal Palestine \nended up in the hands of Jordan. We never heard about Jerusalem then.\n  In fact, when the PLO was created in 1964, Jerusalem was never even \nmentioned.\n  When Jordan lost the West Bank and Jerusalem in 1967, then the \nquestion of Palestine and Jerusalem became important once again. In \nfact, we are told that the reason Yasser Arafat walked out of Camp \nDavid was because he did not get all of east Jerusalem and the Old \nCity. In other words, when Arafat did not get through the peace process \nwhat he could not get through war, he decided to walk away from peace.\n  One thing has become clear to me in the last few years. The Oslo \nagreement was nothing less than an admission on the part of the \nPalestinians and the PLO that Israel would never be defeated in war. \nThe Palestinians entered into a peace process because they had no other \nchoice. Now I am forced to question just how committed they are to that \nprocess. If the aim is to win through negotiations what they could not \nthrough war, then what kind of a process is it?\n  There are no ambiguities here: Either the Palestinians are committed \nto the process, and to a negotiated outcome, or they are not. Arafat's \nthreat to declare a Palestinians state on September 13, 2000 is an \nabrogation of the peace process, and as such, an abrogation of any \nunderstanding with the United States regarding the PLO and Mr. Arafat \nas negotiating partners.\n  U.S. assistance to the Palestinians is predicated upon good faith \nnegotiations in a peace process. Nothing else. Nothing. For those that \nhave some doubt, I remind them that as far as U.S. law is concerned, \nthe Palestine Liberation Organization is a terrorist organization.\n  I and many of my colleagues have always stood ready to accept the \noutcome of a negotiated peace between Israel and the Palestinians. We \nhave done so reluctantly, because of fears about what a Palestinian \nstate would do, how it would survive, about the commitment to \ndemocracy, and real fears about terrorism.\n  We will not stand idly by and accept a non-negotiated solution, \ncontrary to the Oslo Accords, contrary to the spirit of a peace \nprocess. Should Mr. Arafat go forward and declare a Palestinian state, \nthe bill that Senator Schumer and I are offering today will preclude \nthe expenditure of funds to recognize that state and preclude further \nassistance to any Palestinian governing entity. It instructs the \nPresident to use the voice and vote of the United States in the United \nNations bodies to stop recognition or admission of a Palestinian state.\n  I hope Chairman Arafat chooses the path of peace. However, if he does \nnot, this legislation makes very clear that the relationship between \nthe U.S. government and the Palestine leadership will change.\n  We will not recognize the unilaterally declared Palestinian state and \nwe will strongly urge all others not to do so. Either there is peace \nthrough a process or there can be no peace. If that is what Yasser \nArafat wants, it is a terrible crime against the Palestinians, and a \nmistake that history will not forget.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/26/senate-section/article/S7645-3", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7645-S7646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  CELEBRATING THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES \n                       ACT: A DECADE OF PROGRESS\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, over the past month and a half, a brightly \nlit torch has made its journey through nineteen cities, carrying with \nit each step of the way the passionate and able spirit of the \ndisability community. Today the torch arrives at its 20th stop along \nthe way, our Nation's Capital, to mark the tenth anniversary of the \nsigning of the Americans with Disabilities Act. It is indeed an \nimportant day in our Nation's long history.\n  President Franklin Roosevelt once said, ``No country, no matter how \nrich, can afford to waste its human resources.'' I am proud to say that \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act lives up to President Roosevelt's \nobjective. For 10 years now, this momentous, landmark civil rights \nlegislation has opened new doors to the disability community. It has, \nat long last, allowed handicapped individuals the opportunity and the \naccess to have their potential recognized both inside the workplace and \noutside in the community. It has brought the American dream within \nreach for the millions of American families with disabled members.\n  Over the past decade of the ADA, we have seen dramatic changes \nthroughout the nation in equal opportunity--from new and advanced \ntechnology allowing for greater public accommodation at places of \nbusiness and in commercial establishments, to state and local \ngovernment services and activities, to transportation and \ntelecommunications technology for disabled Americans. Look around \ntoday--people with disabilities are participating to a far greater \nextent in their communities and are living fuller, more productive \nlives as students, workers, family members, and neighbors. They are \ndining out; cheering at football games and other sporting events, often \neven playing sports themselves; going to the movies; participating in \nstate, local, and Federal Government; and raising families of their \nown.\n  It is evident that that the capability of this community far \noutshines the challenges of a disability. I am proud that the ADA has \nbeen particularly instrumental in removing many of the barriers that \nwould otherwise impede the ability and success of the disability \ncommunity. Take the example of Casey Martin, the professional golfer \nfrom Orgeon with a rare disability that substantially limits one's \nability to walk.\n\n[[Page S7646]]\n\nCasey had long dreamed of playing in a PGA tour, but, because of his \ndisability, Casey encountered a huge barrier. In these tournaments in \nwhich Casey wanted to play, the tour would not allow the use of a golf \ncart. When a Federal trial court in Oregon found that the PGA tour is a \n``public accommodation'' and should modify their policy of no golf \ncarts to accommodate Casey's disability, his vision became a reality. \nAccording to Casey, ``Without the ADA I never would have been able to \npursue my dream of playing golf professionally.''\n  While for Casey Martin the ADA has meant achieving his most far-\nreaching goal, for other disabled Americans, the ADA has simply allowed \nthem to live each new day with a little more ease and comfort. To name \njust a few areas in which the ADA has facilitated progress--access to \nrestaurants and public restrooms, modifications to the aisles and \nentrances of supermarkets, assistive listening systems at places like \nDisney World and many theaters for the deaf and hard of hearing, and \nlarge print financial statements for those with vision impairments. Mr. \nPresident, these are the kind of simplicities in life that those \nwithout disabilities expect and take for granted, and because of the \nADA, they have now come to be a part of the disability community's life \ntoo.\n  Just as the barriers that continue to face each of us in life take \nmany years to craft, they take many years to conquer. Together, we must \nfind the strength and the courage to pick our battles. I commend the \ndisability community today on their passion and their vigilance, and I \ncelebrate with you on this 10th anniversary of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act for all that this day has brought to your community, \nand for all that it will continue to bring in the years ahead. Let \ntoday recommit each of us to the ADA for all Americans.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, 10 years ago today Congress passed \nlandmark civil rights legislation, based on the fundamental principle \nthat people should be measured by what they can do, not what they can't \ndo. With the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act, America \nbegan a new era of opportunity for the 47 million disabled citizens who \nhad been denied full and fair participation in society.\n  We continue to build in Congress on the bipartisan achievements of \nthe ADA. I'm gratified by President Clinton's strong endorsement today \nof the Grassley-Kennedy Family Opportunity Act now pending in Congress. \nThe goal of our legislation is to remove as many of the remaining \nbarriers as possible that prevent families raising children with \ndisabilities and special health needs from leading full and productive \nlives. No family in this country should ever be put in a position of \nhaving to choose between a job and the healthcare their disabled child \nneeds. The Family Opportunity Act ensures that no family raising a \nchild with special needs would be left out and left behind.\n  For generations, people with disabilities were viewed as citizens in \nneed of charity. Through ignorance, the nation accepted discrimination \nand succumbed to fear and prejudice. The passage of the ADA finally \nmoved the nation to shed these condescending and suffocating \nattitudes--and widen the doors of opportunity for people with \ndisabilities.\n  Today we see many signs of the progress that mean so much in our \nongoing efforts to see that persons with disabilities are included--the \nramps beside the stairs, the sidewalks with curbs to accommodate \nwheelchairs, the lifts for helping disabled people board buses.\n  Whether they are family members, friend, neighbors, or co-workers, \npersons with disabilities are no longer second class citizens. They are \ndemonstrating their abilities and making real contributions in schools, \nin the workplace, and in the community. People with disabilities are no \nlonger left out and left behind--and because of that, America is a \nstronger, better and fairer country today.\n  As the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the many disabled persons \nwho worked so long and hard and well for its passage continue to remind \nus, equal opportunity under the law is not a privilege, but a \nfundamental birthright of every American.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/26/senate-section/article/S7646-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7646-S7647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    INFECTIOUS DISEASE SURVEILLANCE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to briefly discuss a GAO report that \nwas released earlier this week to be sure that other Senators are aware \nof.\n  The report, entitled ``Global Health: Framework for Infectious \nDisease Surveillance,'' was commissioned by Senator McConnell and \nmyself, and Senators Frist and Feingold. It investigates the existing \nglobal system, or network, of infectious disease surveillance, and will \nbe followed by a second report which analyzes the strengths and \nweaknesses of this network and make recommendations for strengthening \nit.\n  We requested this report in response to a growing concern among \npublic health officials about the inability of many countries to \nidentify and track infectious diseases and respond promptly and \neffectively to disease outbreaks. In fact, the World Health Assembly \ndetermined in 1995 that the existing surveillance networks could not be \nconsidered adequate.\n  By way of background, the term ``surveillance'' covers four types of \nactivities: detecting and reporting diseases; analyzing and confirming \nreports; responding to epidemics; and reassessing longer-term policies \nand programs. I will touch on these categories in a bit more detail, as \nthey illustrate the need for reform.\n  In the detection and reporting phase, local health care providers \ndiagnose diseases and then report the existence of pre-determined \n``notifiable'' diseases to national or regional authorities. The \naccurate diagnosis of patients is obviously crucial, but it can be very \ndifficult as many diseases share symptoms. It is even more difficult in \ndeveloping countries, where public health professionals have less \naccess to the newest information on diseases.\n  In the next stage of surveillance, disease patterns are analyzed and \nreported diseases are confirmed. This process occurs at a regional or \nnational level, and usually involves lab work to confirm a doctor's \ndiagnosis. From the resulting data, a response plan is devised. \nOfficials must determine a number of other factors as well, such as the \ncapability of a doctor to make an accurate diagnosis. Unfortunately, in \nmany developing countries this process can take weeks, while the \ndisease continues to spread.\n  When an epidemic is identified, various organizations must determine \nhow to contain the disease, how to treat the infected persons, and how \nto inform the public about the problem without causing panic. Forty-\nnine percent of internationally significant epidemics occur in complex \nemergency situations, such as overcrowded refugee camps. Challenges in \nresponding to epidemics are mainly logistical--getting the necessary \ntreatment to those in need.\n\n  Finally, in assessing the longer-term health policies and programs, \nsurveillance teams can provide information on disease patterns, health \ncare priorities, and the allocation of resources. However, information \nfrom developing countries is often unreliable.\n  I want to emphasize two points. The first is that all the activities \nthat I have just described are done by what WHO calls a ``network of \nnetworks.'' There is, in fact, no global system for infectious disease \nsurveillance. Let me repeat, for anyone who thinks there is some \ncentrally-managed, well-organized global system, there is not. Rather, \nwhat exists is a loose network, a patch-work quilt of sorts, involving \nthe UN, non-governmental organizations, national health facilities, \nmilitary laboratories, and many other organizations, all of which \ndepend upon each other for information, but with no standardized \nprocedures.\n  The second point is that in countries where a tropical climate \nfosters many infectious diseases, one also finds the least amount of \nreliable data. If we as a country, or we as a global community, are \ncommitted to eradicating the deadliest diseases, building the capacity \nfor effective surveillance in the developing countries is where we need \nto focus our attention.\n  The sequel to this report is due to be released by the GAO in a few \nmonths. It will assess the strengths and weaknesses of this loosely-\norganized surveillance system, and make recommendations for \nstrengthening it. We need to\n\n[[Page S7647]]\n\nbe able to accurately diagnose diseases, and quickly transmit the \ninformation to the global health community.\n  I urge other Senators to read this first report. This is an issue \nthat has received far too little attention, and which directly affects \nthe health of every American. Any disease, whether HIV/AIDS, malaria, \nTB, or others as yet unknown, which could infect and kill millions or \ntens of millions of people, is only an airplane flight away.\n  Accurate surveillance, which is the first step to an effective \nresponse, is critical. Yet today we are relying on a haphazard network \nof public, private, official, and unofficial components of varying \ndegrees of reliability, patched together over time. It is a lot better \nthan nothing, but the world needs a uniformly reliable, coordinated \nsystem with effective procedures that apply the highest standards. I \nlook forward to GAO's next report, and its recommendations for action.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/26/senate-section/article/S7647-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7647-S7648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. As chairman of the Senate Rules Committee, which has \njurisdiction over the campaign finance issue, and one who has been \nrather closely identified with the spirited debate in this arena over \nthe past decade, I wholeheartedly support putting S. 1816, the Hagel-\nKerrey bill, on the Senate Calendar.\n  That is not to say I would vote ``aye'' were there a rollcall vote on \nthe bill as it is currently drafted.\n  Senator Hagel's legislation was the backdrop for a comprehensive \nseries of hearings held by the Senate Rules Committee between March and \nMay of this year. The final hearing featured the testimony of Senator \nHagel, Senator Kerrey, Senator Abraham, Senator Hutchison, and Senator \nLandrieu. An impressive, to say the least, bipartisan lineup of \nSenators bravely stepping into the breach separating those who persist \nin trotting out the old, blatantly unconstitutional campaign finance \nschemes of the past, from others like myself who firmly believe that \nthe first amendment is America's greatest political reform and must not \nbe sacrificed to appease a self-interested editorial board at the New \nYork Times.\n  The Senator from Nebraska has taken what for the past couple of years \nhas been the biggest bone of contention in the campaign finance fight \nin the Senate--party soft money--and essentially split the difference \nbetween the opposing camps. Rather than an unconstitutional and \ndestructive provision to entirely prohibit non-federal activity by the \nnational political parties, Senator Hagel has crafted a middle ground \nin which the party so-called ``soft'' money contributions would be \ncapped. Yet, even a cap raises serious constitutional questions and \nwould surely be challenged were one to be enacted into law. \nNevertheless, the Hagel-Kerrey approach is more defensible and \npracticable than outright prohibition.\n  Coupled with the party soft money cap in the Hagel-Kerrey bill is an \nameliorative and common sense provision to update the hard-money side \nof the equation by simply adjusting the myriad hard money limits to \nreflect a quarter-century of inflation. An inflation adjustment of the \nhard money limits is twenty-five years overdue. Candidates, especially \npolitical outsiders who are challenging entrenched incumbents, are put \nat a huge disadvantage by hard money limits frozen in the 1970s.\n  The lower the hard money limits are, the more that insiders with \nlarge contributor lists are advantaged. Incumbents and celebrities who \nbenefit from the outset of a race with high name recognition among the \nelectorate also start way ahead of the unknown challenger. The greatest \nbeneficiary of low hard money limits are the millionaire and \nbillionaire candidates who do not have to raise a dime for their \ncampaigns because they can mortgage the family mansion, cash out part \nof their stock portfolio and write a personal check for the entire cost \nof a campaign.\n  As hard money limits are eroded through inflation and non-wealthy \ncandidates are further hampered, election outcomes are ever more likely \nto be determined by outside groups whose independent expenditures and \nissue advocacy are completely unlimited. That is ``non-party soft \nmoney.''\n  Mr. President, absent from the attacks on party soft money is any \nacknowledgement by reformers that the proliferation is linked to \nantiquated hard money limits which control how much the parties can \ntake from individuals and PACs to pay for federal election activities. \nIt stands to reason that hard money limits frozen in 1974 and thereby \ndoomed to antiquity are going to spawn an explosion of activity on the \nsoft money side of the party ledger.\n  It also is not coincidence that increased soft money activity in the \npast decade corresponded to vastly increased competition in the \npolitical arena. We are amidst the third fierce battle for control of \nthe White House in the past decade And every two years America has \nwitnessed extremely spirited contests over control of the Congress. \nDemocrats who had been exiled from the White House since Jimmy Carter's \nadministration at long last got to spend some quality time at 1600 \nPennsylvania Avenue and are not keen to give that up. Republicans, \nafter four decades in the minority, got to savor the view from the \nSpeaker's office in the House of Representatives and would like very \nmuch to keep it. And we have seen more than a little action on the \nSenate-side of the Capitol.\n  Reformers look upon all this activity over the past decade in abject \nhorror, seeing only dollar signs and venal ``special interests.'' I \nsurvey the same era and see an extraordinary period in which every \nelection cycle featured a tremendous and beneficial national war of \nideas over the best course for our nation to pursue in the coming years \nand which party could best lead America on that path.\n  All signs, Mr. President, of a competitive, healthy, and vibrant \ndemocracy.\n  While I strongly support the hard money adjustments in the Hagel-\nKerrey bill, I remain concerned by the bill's silence in an area sorely \nin need of reform: Big Labor soft money. The siphoning off of \ncompulsory dues from union members for political activity with which \nmany of them do not agree is a form of tyranny which must not be \npermitted to continue. Senate Republicans have fought hard, and \nunsuccessfully, to protect union workers from this abuse. Democrats are \nunderstandably and predictably loathe to risk any diminution of Big \nLabor's contributions which may result from freeing the rank-and-file \nunion members from forced support of Democratic candidates and causes, \nbut the absence of reform in this area is unacceptable. Big Labor soft \nmoney and involuntary political contributions must be part of any \ncomprehensive reform package which ultimately passes Congress.\n  With those provisos and a few others, I will close by again \ncommending the Senator from Nebraska from his willingness to wade in a \nbig way into one of the most contentious issues before Congress--an \nissue in which all Members of Congress have a vested personal interest \nbut that affects not just us but every American citizen and group that \naspires to participate in the political process. That is why the U.S. \nSupreme Court will be the final arbiter of any campaign finance bill of \nconsequence. And those are the reasons we should continue to be \ncautions and deliberative as the effort continues for a nonpartisan, \nconstitutional campaign reform package.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, today we have moved a step closer to \nimplementing comprehensive campaign finance reform. With the help of \nSenator Mitch McConnell, Chairman of the Senate Rules Committee, the \nOpen and Accountable Campaign Financing Act of 2000 will soon be placed \non the Senate Calendar, ready for debate by the full Senate.\n  I introduced the Open and Accountable Campaign Financing Act of 2000 \nalong with Senators Bob Kerrey, Spence Abraham, Mike DeWine, Slade \nGorton, Mary Landrieu, Craig Thomas, John Breaux, Kay Bailey Hutchison, \nand Gordon Smith as a bi-partisan approach to campaign finance reform \nbecause we felt it was a common sense, relevant and realistic approach. \nWe offered it as a bipartisan compromise to break the deadlock on \ncampaign finance reform and to bring forth a vehicle that could address \nthe main holes in the net of our current system.\n  The purpose of our legislation is to place more control and \nresponsibility\n\n[[Page S7648]]\n\nfor the conduct of campaigns directly in the hands of the candidates. \nOur legislation is not the solution for all of the problems now facing \nus, but I believe it is a good solid beginning to accomplish meaningful \ncampaign finance reform.\n  After a series of hearings in the Senate Rules Committee this spring \non campaign finance reform, we will now be able to put a bill on the \nSenate Calendar that has bipartisan support. If we are to accomplish \ncomprehensive reform this year, bipartisan support is essential and our \nbill has that support.\n  While I was very pleased with the recent vote in Congress to require \ndisclosure for the `527' organizations, that bill is not a substitute \nfor more comprehensive campaign finance reform. It is a solution for a \nsmall problem. We need to continue to fight for campaign finance reform \nthat is broader and more comprehensive.\n  I am hopeful that the full Senate will be able to debate \ncomprehensive campaign finance reform legislation, including the Open \nand Accountable Campaign Financing Act of 2000, this year. We have an \nopportunity to achieve something reasonable and responsible this year.\n  Again, I would like to thank Senator McConnell for holding hearings \nin the Rules Committee on campaign finance reform and helping move the \nprocess along. I look forward to working with him and all Senators \ninterested in advancing campaign finance reform.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/26/senate-section/article/S7648-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. WYDEN.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss two issues of \ngreat importance to our national security and our energy security--the \nagreement between the United States and the Russian Federation which \nprovides for the conversion of Russian highly enriched uranium (HEU) \nderived from the warheads into fuel for civilian nuclear power plants, \nand the need for the United States to maintain a viable uranium \nenrichment capability.\n  First, let me give you a bit of history.\n  In 1992, the Energy Policy Act established the United States \nEnrichment Corporation as a wholly-owned government corporation to take \nover the Department of Energy's uranium enrichment enterprise. The \nCorporation was to operate as a business enterprise on a profitable and \nefficient basis and maximize the long-term valuation of the Corporation \nto the Treasury of the United States. The objective was to eventually \nprivatize the Corporation as a viable business enterprise able to \ncompete in world markets. Subsequently, the Corporation was selected as \nExecutive Agent for, and entrusted with, the responsibility for \ncarrying out the Russian HEU Agreement.\n  Enactment of the 1992 Act was the culmination of a decade of \nbipartisan effort spearheaded by Senators Domenici and Ford. Extensive \nhearings were held in both the House and the Senate and the legislation \ngarnered the strong support of the Bush Administration.\n  Recognizing the complexity of privatization and the national security \nimplications of the Russian HEU Agreement, Congress enacted the USEC \nPrivatization Act of 1996. The Act provided the mechanics for \nprivatization, clarified the relationship between a private USEC and \nthe U.S. Government, and addressed concerns related to the \nimplementation of the Russian HEU Agreement. The Corporation was sold \nin July of 1998.\n  Implementation of the Russian HEU Agreement has been important for \nthe government and USEC. This government-to-government agreement \nfacilitates Russian conversion of highly enriched uranium taken from \ntheir dismantled nuclear weapons into fuel purchased by USEC and resold \nfor use in commercial nuclear power plants. The program is financed as \na commercial transaction.\n  Every day, new warnings are heard about the ability of one rogue \nstate or some well-financed terrorist to obtain weapons-grade nuclear \nmaterials on the black market. The Russian HEU Agreement addresses \nthose concerns by converting thousands of nuclear warheads into fuel \nfor electric power plants--the quintessential swords to plowshares \nconcept. In spite of some start-up problems, implementation of the \nAgreement has resulted in the conversion of the equivalent of nearly \n4,000 nuclear warheads into fuel for U.S. commercial power plants. The \nprocess, as well as purchases and shipments to USEC, continues.\n  From the outset, many felt there were built-in contradictions between \nthe objectives of maintaining a viable domestic uranium enrichment \ncapability while controlling the disposal of former Soviet nuclear \nweapons. But, all things considered, the program to date has been a \nsuccess. Without question our Nation's national security--our most \nimportant charge as lawmakers--has been enhanced by implementation of \nthis Agreement.\n\n  Mr. President, the Russian HEU Agreement contributes to our Nation's \nsecurity, but the Agreement also adversely affects the enterprise that \nmakes this commercial solution to a national security problem possible. \nThis difficulty was understood when the government adopted this \nprogram. Purchases of large quantities of Russian weapons derived \nmaterial result in growing effects on the companies in the private \nsector domestic nuclear fuel cycle. Our uranium mining, conversion, and \nenrichment industries have been affected. The result has been steadily \ndeclining market prices for all phases of the nuclear fuel cycle. USEC, \nits plant workers, and the communities dependent upon those plants are \nbeing hit especially hard. As Executive Agent, USEC has suffered \nsubstantial losses due to fixed price purchases from Russia as well as \nincreased costs due to reduced levels of domestic production resulting \nfrom introduction of the Russian material into the market.\n  Earlier this year, and with the support of the Administration, USEC \nhad been negotiating with Russia to amend the Agreement to include \nmarket-based pricing. I have been advised that USEC closely coordinated \nits plans and intentions with the President's Interagency Enrichment \nOversight Committee at all phases of its discussions with the Russians. \nYet, as USEC and the Russians were meeting in Moscow to sign the new \nAgreement, the Department of Energy, a member of the Oversight \nCommittee, prevented the signing at the last minute.\n  I can not understand why the Energy Department would prevent the \nadoption of an amendment that would stabilize the Agreement through the \nremaining thirteen years of the program. Reportedly the terms were \nacceptable to both parties. In addition, the Agreement would have \nprotected the interests of our own domestic nuclear fuel industry. As \npart of the Agreement, Russia wanted USEC to purchase commercially \nproduced enrichment in addition to the weapons derived enrichment. USEC \nnegotiated terms consistent with a previous Administration approved \nprogram making it mandatory that this additional quantity be matched \nwith domestically produced enrichment. In addition, no additional \nnatural uranium would be brought into the domestic market. The \namendment to the Agreement was specifically crafted so that no damage \nwould be inflicted upon the domestic nuclear fuel cycle as a result of \npurchasing the additional material.\n  The Department of Energy's action threatens to destabilize the \nagreement.\n\n[[Page S7649]]\n\nWho knows how long the Russians will sit by without this Agreement. The \nNational Security Council and the State Department and others on the \nEnrichment Oversight Committee have endorsed the signing of this \nAgreement. I strongly urge that it be completed. I suggest that those \nof us in the Congress who believe in the vital importance of this \nAgreement express our concern to the Administration and demand that the \nEnergy Department withdraw its objection and that the Agreement be \nspeedily signed.\n  As I mentioned, higher production costs, decreased demand, and lower \nworld prices have hit USEC, our Nation's sole domestic uranium \nenricher, particularly hard. USEC's Form 10-Q filed with the Securities \nand Exchange Commission for the quarter ended March 31, 2000 noted \nthat: ``In February 2000, Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors \nService revised their credit ratings of USEC's long-term debt to below \ninvestment grade. The revised rating gives USEC the ability to \ndiscontinue its uranium enrichment operations at a plant. USEC is \nevaluating its options; however, a decision has not been made as to \nwhether to close a plant, which plant would be selected or the timing \nof any closure.'' Finally, on June 21, the Board of Directors of USEC \nInc. voted to cease uranium enrichment operations in June 2001 at the \nPortsmouth gaseous diffusion plant in Piketon, Ohio, and to consolidate \nall enrichment operations at its Paducah, Kentucky production plant. \nUSEC maintained that it could not sustain current operations at two \nproduction plants, each of which is currently operating at only 25 \npercent of capacity. The company said that its production costs were \ntoo high and that the termination of operations at Portsmouth would \nsave upwards of $55 million in fixed costs annually.\n\n  USEC's decision to close a plant comes as no surprise. For over a \nyear, there has been speculation within the Clinton Administration, the \nenergy industry, the media and on Capitol Hill that USEC would be \nforced to consolidate its uranium enrichment production.\n  Mr. James R. Mellor, Chairman of USEC's Board of Directors was quoted \nin a news release as saying: ``The decision to cease enrichment at one \nof our facilities was necessary given the business challenges facing \nthe uranium enrichment industry . . . Mr. Mellor went on to say: \n``Choosing to close the Portsmouth plant was an extremely difficult \ndecision because of the impact it will have on the lives of many of our \nworkers, their families and the communities surrounding the plant.''\n  USEC cited multiple factors in determining which plant would close. \nKey elements in USEC's analysis included ``long-term and short-term \npower costs, operational performance and reliability, design and \nmaterial condition of the plants, risks associated with meeting \ncustomer orders on time, and other factors relating to assay levels, \nfinancial results, and new technology issues.''\n  I know that my colleagues from Ohio are deeply disturbed by USEC's \ndecision to close the Portsmouth plant. I also know that if the company \nhad chosen to cease operations at Paducah, my friends from Kentucky \nwould be equally distraught. Plant closures are serious matters, \nparticularly when they are the mainstay of the local economy. The \npublic record is clear that technological advances in uranium \nenrichment were rapidly overtaking the gaseous diffusion process as an \neconomic method of enriching uranium. Make no mistake, the Portsmouth \nand Paducah gaseous diffusion plants were and continue to be \nextraordinary engineering, design, and construction achievements--\nmatched only by the dedication and skill of the men and women who have \nmade the plants work--work, 24 hours a day--work, seven days a week--\nwork, continuously for over 45 years without a stop, without a break in \nservice--until now. It was inevitable that this would happen someday, \nbut knowing that it will happen does not make it any easier.\n  The only person who seemed to be caught by surprise and unprepared to \ndeal with the closure was the Secretary of Energy. Certainly, he must \nhave known that USEC was preparing to make an announcement. He must \nhave been aware that, as part of the 1996 USEC Privatization Act, the \nDepartment of Energy--not the company--would be responsible for \ndecommissioning, decontamination and clean-up of the plants and the \nsites as well as for workforce disposition.\n  In fact, in a June 19, 2000 letter to Mr. William H. Timbers, USEC's \npresident and chief executive officer, the Secretary of Energy asked if \nthe company was planning to close either one of its uranium production \nfacilities. In response, Mr. Timbers wrote on June 20, 2000, that \n``during our last meeting, I indicated to you, and reiterated in \nsubsequent meetings with your staff, that it is inevitable that USEC \nmust close one of its enrichment facilities.'' Mr. Timbers added that \n``During the last eight months, we have presented numerous proposals--\nstill pending before you--to accomplish [transition]. But, DOE has yet \nto make a decision. We have also engaged in discussions with PACE union \nleadership aimed at advancing these efforts. We are still ready and \neager to translate these discussions into actions and look forward to \nthe prospect of working with DOE to adopt a program to minimize the \nemployment disruption associated with ensuring a financially sound USEC \nunder today's market conditions.''\n\n  The next day, when USEC announced that its Board of Directors had \nvoted to close the Portsmouth facility, the best the Nation's Secretary \nof Energy could come up with was the following statement: ``I am \nextremely disappointed by [USEC's] decision today to close the uranium \nenrichment plant at Portsmouth. First and foremost, I am very concerned \nabout the effect this closure will have on USEC workers. Many of these \nmen and women spent their entire working lives helping our nation win \nthe Cold War. They deserve better treatment. . .''\n  For once, Secretary Richardson and I agree. The workers do deserve \nbetter. But rather than threatening USEC, as the Secretary of Energy \ndid when he recommended ``serious consideration of replacing USEC as \nexecutive agent'' for the Russian HEU Agreement, he should have been \ndrafting a plan to assist the workers in Portsmouth to make the \ntransition from operating the Department of Energy owned gaseous \ndiffusion plant to cleaning up the site. This is an environmental \nrestoration mission that is likely to take many years. We are all aware \nof the environmental contamination at the plants and the desperate need \nfor action to restore them to reasonable environmental condition.\n  When Congress created the United States Enrichment Corporation as \npart of the 1992 Energy Policy Act, and when we later passed the 1996 \nUSEC Privatization Act, we recognized that a privately owned USEC could \nbetter respond to the needs of the marketplace and thereby sustain a \nviable domestic uranium enrichment capability. Now that USEC has taken \nwhat it believes is a necessary step to ensure that it can compete in \nthe world uranium enrichment marketplace, the first response by the \nSecretary of Energy is to second-guess the company's intentions and \nactions. Apparently the Secretary would keep facilities open regardless \nof the fundamental laws of economics that are evident to even the most \nmodest businesses.\n  It has been suggested that the solution is to nationalize USEC--to \nhave the government buy it back. I have no sympathy for such a \nproposal. While I am sympathetic to those who will be affected by the \nclosure of Portsmouth, I do not believe that a return to the past is \nthe remedy that will provide for a competitive domestic uranium \nenrichment capability in the future. I do not favor an appropriation of \nsubstantial sums, perhaps well over a billion dollars to buy USEC back, \nnor do I favor the then obligatory commitment to annually appropriate \nfunds to make up for uneconomic operations.\n  It has been only two years since we privatized USEC. On the one hand \nthe Congress and the Administration made an extraordinary effort to \nprovide a private USEC with a strong foundation for a successful \nprivate enterprise competing in world markets--in the words of the '96 \nAct `` . . . in a manner that provides for the long-term viability of \nthe Corporation . . .'' But at the same time, contradictory restraints \nimposed on the Corporation detract from its ability to compete. In \nretrospect, perhaps Congress and the Administration should not have \nplaced so many burdens on USEC as it faced private sector\n\n[[Page S7650]]\n\ndynamics and demands. Ensuring that the vital national security \ninterests of the United States are protected is paramount, but \npreserving the competitiveness of our domestic uranium enrichment \ncapability--at minimal costs to the federal government--is important \ntoo. We need to stop thinking of USEC as a Federal agency and respect \nit for what it is--a private business enterprise.\n  Challenges remain in the implementation of the Russian HEU Agreement \nand the long-term viability of the domestic uranium enrichment \nenterprise. These have proven to be complex, and at times conflicting \ntasks, but I believe that the National interest more than justifies our \ncontinued efforts to see these programs through to a successful \nconclusion. As part of these efforts we should encourage the Clinton \nAdministration to approve the market-based pricing amendment to the \nRussian HEU Agreement. Now is also the time to secure a future for the \nworkers in Portsmouth who face plant closure. We need to help them \nachieve their third transition--from Cold War patriots, to peacetime \nproducers of fuel, to the task of environmental restoration\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/26/senate-section/article/S7650-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   OMNIBUS LONG-TERM CARE ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor of the \n``Omnibus Long-Term Care Act of 2000.'' This bill brings together very \nimportant initiatives for making long-term care more affordable for \nAmericans. In particular, this bill contains a $3,000 tax credit for \ncaregivers and a tax deduction for the purchase of long-term care \ninsurance.\n  There are over 22 million people providing unpaid help with personal \nneeds or household chores to a relative or friend who is at least 50 \nyears old. In Indiana alone, there are 568,300 caregivers. The \ngovernment spent approximately $32 billion in formal home health care \ncosts and $83 billion in nursing home costs. If you add up all the \nprivate sector and government spending on long-term care it is dwarfed \nby the amount families spend caring for loved ones in their homes. As a \nstudy published by the Alzheimers Association indicated, caregivers \nprovide $196 billion worth of care a year.\n  As a member of the Special Committee on Aging, I held a field hearing \nin Indiana on making long-term care more affordable. At this hearing, I \nlearned first hand the importance of this tax credit. Jerry and Sue \nCahee take care of Jerry's mother who has Alzheimers. At the hearing \nJerry Cahee shared the following: ``Mother is a wonderful and friendly \nperson to everyone--except her caregivers. We have discovered that \nlife, aging, and illness are not fair. We have discovered that love is \nhard--that love is not enough to make the difference. We know that \nmemories are all that we have left of the happy times in Mother's life. \nTo care for her, make her last days comfortable, to meet her ever \nincreasing medical needs, to offer her the security of a loving safe \nhome, and to let her know that she is loved--these things have become \nour purpose for living. The financial drain has been difficult, the \nemotional strains are enormous.''\n  Paul Severance, the Director of United Senior Action, a senior \nadvocacy group in Indiana represented his constituency at the hearing \nwhen he stated ``The burden on families who are trying to provide long-\nterm care at home is tremendous; they typically face substantial \nexpenses for special care, such as nursing visits, they often have lost \nwages because of the demands of caring for a loved one; and there can \nbe a great cost to their own health as a result of the constant demands \nof caregiving.''\n  In addition to the tax credit, a deduction for the purchase of long-\nterm care insurance makes it more affordable for Americans to purchase \nlong-term care policies that can provide them with the coverage they \nwill need. Congress needs to continue to explore ways in which to \nensure long-term care options are available for all Americans.\n  I am encouraged by the introduction of this bill and the bipartisan \nsupport it has received. It is my hope that we can work together to \nimplement this legislation and make it more affordable for seniors to \nreceive long-term care. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/26/senate-section/article/S7650-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7650-S7651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FCC REGULATION OF PAY PHONES\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, in the four years since the passage of the \nTelecommunications Act of 1996, dramatic changes have occurred in our \ntelecommunications markets. We have seen competitive environments in \nsuch areas as wireless communication and long distance service. \nAdvanced telecommunications services have great potential for \ndeployment in the near term, if only the Federal Communications \nCommission would more aggressively promote them. All of this change is \noccurring in the context of an explosion of information technologies \nand the Internet.\n  Yet the '96 Act dealt with much more than the high tech changes we \nread so much about these days. The legislation was designed to \ntransform the entire telecommunications industry under the leadership \nof the FCC, to the benefit of all consumers. And the Act was designed \nto ensure that all Americans could have access to the vast array of \nservices the Act will stimulate.\n  Today I would like to briefly address one aspect of the '96 Act that \nis often overlooked in the glamour of ``high-tech.'' Public payphones \nare a critical piece of this access. For millions of Americans, public \npayphones are the only access to the telecom network. And when the \nbatteries or the signal for the wireless device fail, public payphones \nare a reliable source of inexpensive access, in an emergency or \notherwise. Public payphones are emerging as public information portals, \ntrue on-ramps to the information highway, available to anyone at \nanytime.\n  In order to ensure that these instruments of public access would \ncontinue serving as gateways of last resort and continue evolving using \nnew technologies, the issue of adequate compensation for pay phone \noperators was addressed by the '96 Act. This requirement of the '96 Act \nwas designed to promote fair competition and benefit consumers by \neliminating distorting subsidies and artificial barriers. However, the \nlaw has not been successfully implemented, and I am calling on the FCC \nto act expeditiously to address this regulatory oversight. Payphones \nare an important segment of the telecommunications industry, especially \nin low income neighborhoods and in rural areas like those in my home \nstate of Montana.\n  Local telephone companies operated payphones as a legal monopoly \nuntil 1984, when an FCC ruling mandated that competitors' payphones be \ninterconnected to local networks. Still, local telephone companies were \nable to subsidize their payphone service in competition with \nindependent payphones. The '96 Act was designed to change all of this. \nIt was designed to create a level playing field between all competitors \nand to encourage the widespread deployment of payphones. It did this by \nrequiring local telephone companies to phase out subsidies; by \nmandating competitive safeguards to prevent discrimination by the ILECs \nand ensure fair treatment of competitors when they connect to local \nsystems; and by assuring fair compensation for every call, including \nso-called ``dial around'' calls which bypass the pay phones' \ntraditional payment mechanism.\n  Yet the basic requirements of the '96 Act are not being implemented \nby the FCC to assure fair competition. Pay phone operators are not \nbeing compensated for an estimated one-third of all dial-around calls, \nparticularly when more than one carrier is involved on long distance \nconnections. An industry proposal to remedy this situation has been \npending at the FCC for more than a year without any action being taken. \nAnd the FCC also needs to bring to a hasty resolution the issue of the \nappropriate line rate structure for payphone providers. Today, there \nare about 2.3 million pay phones nationwide. While all payphones are \nthreatened by the gaps in dial-around payments, 600,000 of them are \nindependently owned and are under particularly intense pressure; many \nsmall payphone operators now find themselves being forced to pull \npayphones or go out of business altogether. They are also in need of \ncertainty regarding the rates they pay the telephone companies. This \nsituation should not exist more than four years after the enactment of \nthe 1996 legislation.\n\n[[Page S7651]]\n\n  I hope the FCC will act quickly to assure adequate compensation for \neach call. I hope the FCC will take immediate steps to enforce the \nrequirement for non-discriminatory and fair line rates. I hope the FCC \nwill take those basic steps required by the 1996 law. Fair \ncompetition--and the resulting benefits to consumers envisioned by \nCongress--will not occur until these actions are taken. As Chairman of \nthe Senate Communications Subcommittee, I will be carefully monitoring \nactions taken by the FCC on these important issues in the weeks and \nmonths ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/26/senate-section/article/S7651-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           THE BULLETPROOF VEST PARTNERSHIP GRANT ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wanted to inform the Repubican leadership \nthat the House of Representatives today passed the Bulletproof Vest \nPartnership Grant Act of 2000, H.R. 4033, by an overwhelming vote of \n413-3. I hope that the Senate will quickly follow suit and pass the \nHouse-passed bill and send it to the President. President Clinton has \nalready endorsed this legislation to support our nation's law \nenforcement officers and is eager to sign it into law.\n  Senator Campbell and I have introduced the Senate companion bill, S. \n2413. Unfortunately, someone on the other side of the aisle has a hold \non our bill. We have been working for the past week to urge the Senate \nto pass the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000, S. 2413. \nThe Senate Judiciary Committee passed our bill unanimously on June 29. \nIt has been cleared by all 45 Democratic Senators.\n  But it still has not passed the full Senate. This is very \ndisappointing to our nation's law enforcement officers who need life-\nsaving bulletproof vests to protect themselves. Protecting and \nsupporting our law enforcement community should not be a partisan \nissue.\n  Senator Campbell and I worked together closely and successfully with \nthe Chairman of the Judiciary Committee in the last Congress to pass \nthe Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 1998 into law. Senator \nHatch is an original cosponsor this year's bill to reauthorize this \ngrant program. Senators Schumer, Kohl, Thurmond, Reed, Jeffords, Robb, \nReid, Sarbanes, Bingaman, Ashcroft, Edwards, Bunning, Cleland, \nHutchison, and Abraham are also cosponsors of our bipartisan bill.\n  But for some reason a Republican senator has a hold on this bill to \nprovide protection to our nation's law enforcement officers. According \nto the Federal Bureau of Investigation, more than 40 percent of the \n1,182 officers killed by a firearm in the line of duty since 1980 could \nhave been saved if they had been wearing body armor. Indeed, the FBI \nestimates that the risk of fatality to officers while not wearing body \narmor is 14 times higher than for officers wearing it.\n  To better protect our nation's law enforcement officers, Senator \nCampbell and I introduced the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of \n1998. President Clinton signed our legislation into law on June 16, \n1998. Our law created a $25 million, 50 percent matching grant program \nwithin the Department of Justice to help state and local law \nenforcement agencies purchase body armor for fiscal years 1999-2001.\n  In its two years of operation, the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant \nProgram has funded more than 180,000 new bulletproof vests for police \nofficers across the country.\n  The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000 builds on the \nsuccess of this program by doubling its annual funding to $50 million \nfor fiscal years 2002-2004. It also improves the program by \nguaranteeing jurisdictions with fewer than 100,000 residents receive \nthe full 50-50 matching funds because of the tight budgets of these \nsmaller communities and by making the purchase of stab-proof vests \neligible for grant awards to protect corrections officers in close \nquarters in local and county jails.\n  More than ever before, police officers in Vermont and around the \ncountry face deadly threats that can strike at any time, even during \nroutine traffic stops. Bulletproof vests save lives. It is essential \nthe we update this law so that many more of our officers who are \nrisking their lives everyday are able to protect themselves.\n  I hope this mysterious ``hold'' on the other side of the aisle will \ndisappear. The Senate should pass without delay the Bulletproof Vest \nPartnership Grant Act of 2000 and sent to the President for his \nsignature into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/26/senate-section/article/S7651-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

As Bill steps down from a few \nof his many leadership positions, I pay tribute to him for his lifelong \ncommitment to this region.\n  Born in Lexington, he has always focused on the state's higher \neducation. Bill's many leadership positions, including Transylvania \nUniversity Board of Trustees member and chairman of the board of \nShakertown, have guided the growth and success of Kentucky. As he is \nknown for his single-minded determination to help the future success of \nKentuckians, he has left a legacy behind that would prove he is one of \nthe state's greatest assets.\n  No opportunity has been missed by Bill to continue Kentucky's \nprosperity. Beginning with investments in peanut butter that is now \nbetter known as Jif, his business endeavors started successfully. With \nan interest in horses, he continued his success in the business world \nby becoming a prominent leader of thoroughbred racing. Over the years, \nhe became a leading philanthropist by helping construct the YMCA \nlocated on Lexington's High Street, Shakertown, and the University of \nKentucky's new William T. Young Library. He still continues other \nprojects for the community that are significant and meaningful to him.\n  Kentucky would not be what it is today without Bill's leadership and \nguidance over the past years. Though Bill has stepped down for others \nto guide the future, Kentucky will feel the effects of his \naccomplishments for years to come. Thank you, Bill, for putting so much \nof yourself into this state to make it a better place for others.

Known affectionately as just Coach to \nhis many students, he led the Beckley Flying Eagles to three state \nchampionships in football, and six more in basketball. A member of the \nNational High School Sports Hall of Fame, Coach was both a beloved \nteacher and principal and served on the faculty of Beckley College. In \naddition to the numerous honors and awards he has received, Coach Van \nMeter holds the great distinction of being a surviving veteran of both \nWorld Wars.\n  Today, however, the countless lives touched by Coach are his greatest \nlegacy.

Mr. President, on July 1, Mrs. Eusebia Ortiz Vera \npassed away in North Carolina. Born in 1912, she arrived in the United \nStates from Cuba, appropriately, on the Fourth of July, 1954, poor and \nwith young children to support.\n  In America, she promptly seized the opportunity to build a new life, \nas all immigrants to the U.S. hope they can do. Eusebia worked very \nhard to ensure that her children prospered. She made certain, above \nall, that all of them received good educations.\n  And those children who came to the United States did prosper, and \nbecome good citizens of the United States, going on to be a U.S. \nAmbassador to Honduras, a high school teacher, and a professor at the \nUniversity of North Carolina.\n  Among her grandchildren, Mr. President, are two U.S. naval officers, \na medical student studying to be a Navy doctor, two lawyers and an \nelementary school principal--college graduates all. Each of them is a \ntestament to a good life.\n  When I read about her in The Charlotte Observer, I felt a sense of \npride in her story. It is not merely a testimony to her own character, \ndiscipline and strength. No, it is also a reflection of what America is \nall about for so many--a land of opportunity and of hope.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the July 3 article published by The \nCharlotte Observer be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  The article follows:\n\n              [From the Charlotte Observer, July 3, 2000]\n\n For Immigrant, July 4 Was Special--Woman From Cuba Achieved Her Dream\n\n                        (By Christopher Windham)\n\n       Eusebia Ortiz Vera of Charlotte came from Cuba on July 4, \n     1954, in search of the American dream.\n       Like millions of immigrants who arrived before her, she was \n     poor, but optimistic about the future. She had only one wish: \n     for her children to become educated and successful Americans.\n       When Vera, 87, died of natural causes Friday--just days \n     before Independence Day and the anniversary of her arrival in \n     this country--it marked an end of a life that some say \n     epitomized American patriotism.\n       ``She was the original liberated woman,'' said Vera's \n     daughter Miriam Leiva, after Vera's burial Sunday. ``She \n     really wanted a better life for herself and her children.''\n       And Vera did attain that American dream.\n       Born in Ponce, Puerto Rico, in 1912, Vera moved to Cuba \n     with her father and six siblings when she was just 4 months \n     old. Her mother had died moments after she was born. Vera \n     married a Cuban schoolteacher at 22. She was a housewife \n     during her years in Cuba. The marriage that brought Vera \n     three children ended in 1952.\n       After the divorce, Vera was determined to give her children \n     a better life than she had, family members said.\n       Vera decided to move the family to America, where she hoped \n     her children would have greater opportunities. Leiva, 59, was \n     13 when her mother told her--at a moment's notice--to pack a \n     suitcase of her belongings.\n       Leiva said she boarded a plane along with her mother, \n     brother and two aunts en route to Miami. Her sister, Beatriz \n     Manduley, 17 at the time, stayed in Cuba because she was \n     married.\n       ``We came to America for the same reasons as all \n     immigrants, to better our family,'' said Leiva, a consulting \n     professor at UNC Charlotte.\n       The family could not speak English when they arrived, \n     family members said.\n       ``It was hard,'' Leiva said. ``The most difficult part was \n     all things we didn't understand.'' She said her mother did \n     not learn the language until 10 years later when she took \n     English classes at a local high school.\n       The entire family shared a tiny one-room apartment, Leiva \n     said. To make ends meet, Vera took a job as seamstress in the \n     garment district of Miami. She never made more than 75 cents \n     an hour, family members said.\n       Despite the limited income and food, Vera still strived for \n     her children to be successful.\n       ``From the moment we came to the United States, she told us \n     we were going to succeed,'' said Frank Almaguer, Vera's son. \n     Almaguer is now the U.S. ambassador to Honduras.\n       Leiva said her mother prevented her from using a needle and \n     thread because she didn't want her daughter to become a \n     seamstress.\n       ``Women would come to the house and ask, `When is Miriam \n     coming to the factory?' and mother will say `No, Miriam is \n     going to the university,' '' Leiva said.\n       Vera's dream came true in 1957 when Leiva enrolled at \n     Guilford College in Greensboro. With scholarships, loans and \n     help from local Quakers, Leiva was able to graduate in 1961 \n     with a degree in mathematics.\n       Almaguer graduated from the University of Florida in 1967. \n     Manduley came to Miami in 1960. She received her master's \n     degree from UNC Greensboro in 1973. All seven of Vera's \n     grandchildren are college graduates. Vera lived in Miami \n     until 1997, when health conditions caused her to move to a \n     nursing home in Charlotte, close to Leiva.\n       ``This is her legacy,'' said Leiva. ``Failure was simply \n     not an option for us.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/26/senate-section/article/S7652-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7652-S7653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING JUDGE QUILLEN\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor one of \nDelaware's most brilliant legal minds and genuinely altruistic public \nservants--the Honorable William T. Quillen.\n  I have known Judge Quillen for 33 years, since I was an attorney \nfresh out of law school and looking for a job. As a 32-year old \nDelaware Superior Court judge he met with me and on blind faith \nrecommended me for my first legal job. He has been a dear friend and \nconfidant ever since. Over the past three decades, I have watched Judge \nQuillen with pride and admiration attain the greatest judicial heights \nany lawyer could ever strive for in Delaware, which is universally \nrecognized--nationally and internationally--as having one of the most \nreputable, intellectual benches bar none.\n  He is known in my state affectionately and respectfully as ``Judge,'' \n``Chancellor,'' ``Justice,'' and ``Mr. Secretary of State.'' He nearly \nbecame Governor and was my recommendation to President Clinton in June, \n1999 to serve on the United States Third Circuit Court of Appeals. It \nwas during a medical examination required for this position that his \nphysician detected prostate cancer. For health reasons, we withdrew his \nname from consideration. I am happy to report that following treatment \nfor prostate cancer, he is as healthy as ever, running 5K races like a \nman half his age.\n  Now, in classic Bill Quillen altruism--he says it's time to retire \nfrom the bench and make way for younger lawyers to serve as judges.\n  Early in his career, Bill Quillen served in the United States Air \nForce as a judge advocate, then as a top aide for Delaware's Governor. \nHis judicial career began in 1966 on the Superior Court, which is \nDelaware's primary trial court. In 1973, he was elevated and confirmed \nas Chancellor of Delaware's renowned Court of Chancery.\n  Following a two-year experience as a private attorney with the \nWilmington Trust Company, he again heeded the call for public service. \nIn 1978, the General Assembly had expanded Delaware's Supreme Court \nfrom three to five members, and the Governor called on Bill Quillen. He \nwas confirmed unanimously as a Delaware Supreme Court Justice. He \nserved on the State's Highest Court for five years, before stepping \ndown to run for Governor on the Democratic ticket. In one of the rare \ninstances when he did not achieve his goal, Bill Quillen was not bitter \nor discouraged. In 1993, he accepted Governor Tom Carper's call for \ncontinued public service to become Secretary of State. In a state that \nmore than half of the Fortune 500 companies call home, Secretary \nQuillen made his mark on this prestigious office.\n  But his heart remained in the law. In November, 1994, Governor Carper \nnominated and the General Assembly unanimously confirmed him to the \nCourt where his storied career began--the\n\n[[Page S7653]]\n\nDelaware Superior Court. As I said earlier, I believe our federal bench \nwould have been enlightened by his experience and brilliance, but for \nhealth reasons, this was not meant to be.\n  What's even more striking than his distinguished legal career is \nJudge Quillen's love for history. He is a true Delaware historian, with \nlong-time family roots in historic New Castle. His love and respect for \nthe law, democracy and justice for all are unparalleled.\n  Judge Quillen is recognized nationally for his extensive writings on \nDelaware's Court of Chancery, the history of Equity Jurisdiction in \nDelaware and the Federal-State Corporate Law Relationship. His \ncolleagues nationwide also have awarded him numerous prestigious \nawards, including the First Place Award for the 1980 Judge Edward R. \nFinch Law Day U.S.A. Speech, sponsored by the American Bar Association, \non the topic of ``Seven Perceptions of Freedom.'' In June, 1998, he \nalso received the ``American Judicature Society's Herbert Harley \nAward.''\n  Judge Quillen will continue to serve as a professor at the Widener \nUniversity School of Law and plans to spend more time with his wife of \n41 years, two daughters and three grandchildren. I have no doubt his \nlegal legacy, knowledge of Delaware, writing and speaking ability will \ncontinue to serve our State for many years to come.\n  Judge Quillen is a proud graduate of Harvard Law School, and it was \nthe Dean Emeritus of Harvard Law School--Roscoe Pound--who said:\n  ``Law is experience developed by reason and applied continually to \nfurther experience.''\n  Judge Quillen's vast experience and reasoned principles applied as a \nmember of Delaware's top three courts will forever leave its marks on \nour body of law in Delaware. Our State and our citizens are so much \nbetter for his service. So, Your Honor, May It Please The Court, \nrespectfully accept this statement of profound gratitude and \nadmiration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/26/senate-section/article/S7653-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO RON GIST\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nmy friend and Phi Kappa Tau fraternity brother Ron Gist, as founder of \nGist Piano Services, on the occasion of his success with his Louisville \npiano dealership.\n  After attending the University of Louisville, Ron started his piano \ndealership with only $1000 and two used pianos in 1971. Many years \nlater, after persevering through a tornado in 1974, a devastating fire \nthat nearly destroyed his business, and the hardship of an unfortunate \neconomic downturn, Gist Piano Services has grown to become one of \nLouisville's most highly regarded piano dealerships, restorers, and \nconsultants in the region.\n  As a natural salesman, Ron's success has led to profitable \nrelationships with the Louisville Orchestra, Kentucky Center for the \nArts, and Kentucky Fair & Exposition Center. Also, Ron is one of few in \nthe country selected for the honor to represent Steinway pianos. Ron \nhas also provided piano services to other prestigious performance \nvenues and for popular entertainers like James Taylor and Carol King.\n  Ron should not only be congratulated for his success with Gist Piano \nServices, but he should be recognized for his service to the community. \nHe has dedicated himself to making a difference in people's lives \nthrough music. By creating more avenues for young people to express \nthemselves, like through playing the piano, children can learn how to \nimagine, create, and organize the power of music. These skills can \nlater be used as key tools to succeed in the future as they enter \nadulthood. Thank you, Ron, for ensuring a better future for this state \nas the younger generations are better equipped to lead Kentucky.\n  Your hard work continues to display an unswerving commitment to the \npeople of Kentucky and possesses the respect and gratitude of many in \nthe community.

A bill to create a Pension Reform and Simplification \nCommission to evaluate and suggest ways to enhance access to the \nprivate pension plan system; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n\n\n          the pension reform and simplification commission act\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President: I rise today to introduce legislation \ncalling for the establishment of a Pension Reform and Simplification \nCommission. The legislation derives directly from conversations I have \nhad with constituents and experts on three key issues.\n  First, there is the problem related to the current cost and \ncomplexity of private pension plans. In my view current regulations \nplace an unnecessary burden on small and medium business as they \nattempt to adopt pension plans. Indeed, even the most simple plans are \noften so complicated in form and function as to be incomprehensive to \nan everyday businessperson.\n  Second, there is the problem involved in coverage. Although over-all \npension coverage may be consistent over the last decade and the assets \nof private plans have been on the increase, my concern is with those \nindividuals of low to moderate income who are being left out of the \nprivate pension plan equation. As companies move toward cheaper plans--\n401(k)s being a salient example--and feel less obligated to offer \ndefined benefit-type plans, individuals who do not have the extra money \nto contribute to their pension plans are\n\n[[Page S7657]]\n\nunable to benefit from a plan's availability. This is if a plan is \navailable at all, and in many cases it is not.\n  Third, there is the problem of what kind of private pension plans are \nbest suited for the so-called ``New Economy''. Clearly there is \nconsiderable debate as of late in terms of what kind of private pension \nplans should be offered so as to increase saving, decrease mobility, \nprovide opportunity, enhance entrepreneurship, and so on, all of which \nis apparent in the rise of hybrid pension plans. My foremost concern \nhere is that Congress now finds itself reacting to innovative private \npension plans rather than being pro-active in their creation.\n  Mr. President, in 1974, Congress passed the Employee Retirement \nIncome Security Act, known by most people by its acronym of ERISA, our \nintention at the time being twofold. First, we wanted to protect the \nassets held in private sector retirement plans. Second, we wanted to \ncreate uniform rules that govern how these plans will be implemented in \neach and every state.\n  From most accounts we have accomplished these two goals. There is no \nquestion that ERISA has flaws that must be addressed--and I will \ndiscuss these in detail later--but for all these flaws ERISA was \nextremely significant in that it reaffirmed the government's commitment \nto the importance of retirement plans for all Americans. Furthermore, \nit created a comprehensive framework in this country under which the \nexpansion of private retirement plans could occur. Equally important, \nthe mechanisms it established for personal saving has added trillions \nof dollars in available investment capital over the last decade alone, \nfueling in a very tangible way the unprecedented economic growth that \nwe are seeing right now.\n  But for all the praise ERISA receives, it is also criticized widely \nand, in my opinion, correctly on a number of counts. For this reason, \nit is time to seriously re-evaluate whether it is addressing the needs \nand concerns of all Americans. It is time to examine whether it fits \nthe demands of a changing, global, ``new'' economy.\n  As a specific example of these problems, the adoption of piecemeal, \nnarrow, and complicated statutes and regulations in the 26 years since \nERISA's implementation has made substantial portions of our retirement \nsystem inefficient, expensive, and oftentimes incomprehensible to \nanyone wishing to use it. It is well-known that we continue to add \nprovisions and plans with no effort at all to make them internally \ncompatible. We may have a broad vision about what we want to do with \nretirement policy in this country, but we instead of revising \nretirement policy in a comprehensive and strategic manner, we simply \nadd new ideas and language incrementally, hoping they will appeal to \nbusinesses who wish to offer them to their employees.\n  Sadly, the end result is that for many businesses the cost of \ncompliance with ERISA regulations--the administrative and professional \ncosts of qualification--rival and even outweigh the costs of providing \nthe benefits themselves. This, in turn, has led to a decision by many \nbusiness owners that they can no longer afford to offer retirement \nplans to their employees, this in spite of their desire to do so. For \nthese people, the current rules burden the system beyond the benefits \nthey provide. This has to change.\n  But the cost and complexity I have just mentioned has had a corollary \neffect, that being a lack of access to pension plans on the part of \nlow- and middle-income workers, women and minorities in particular. \nRightly or wrongly, one of the foremost criticisms directed toward \nERISA is that it has accelerated the demise of traditional defined \nbenefit pensions and increased conversions to new forms of plans, \nspecifically defined contribution plans like 401(k)s. Employers \noftentimes no longer feel it is their role to provide retirement income \nto their employees as they once did under defined benefit plans. \nInstead they make defined contribution plans available and then educate \nemployees as to how to save for themselves.\n  The problem is that the retirement security of a great many workers \nnow lies in their ability to contribute individually to these plans, \nand this is not always possible. Indeed, data suggests that if these \nindividuals are able to save adequately at all, they do so late in \ntheir careers--this after paying for their homes, their childrens' \neducation, and other important spending priorities. Only then do they \nhave the opportunity to accumulate the money needed to supplement \nSocial Security and carry them through retirement. But these are the \nlucky ones. The fact is a large portion of Americans simply no longer \nhave the capacity to save, this in spite of living in a time of \neconomic prosperity. This too needs to be changed.\n  There is a third reason to re-evaluate ERISA, and that is that the \ndynamics of the New Economy demand a discussion of what retirement \npolicies best serve the economic interests of the United States. For a \ngood part of this century, private pension plans were seen by employers \nas a way to keep their workforce intact, their employees' morale high, \nand devotion to the company constant. Employees stayed with companies \nbecause they identified with the company and were treated by employers \nas family. Continuity and connection were the primary motivations for \nindividuals as they considered a job.\n  Recently, however, this rationale has changed, and has done so \nsignificantly. According to most analysts, the main determinant for \nmost employees as they choose a job is personal development and \nprofessional growth, the feeling being that economic security is best \nattained by mobility--moving from one job to another, increasing \neducation, pay, and retirement savings as you go. Staying at one firm \nis still an ideal for some but it is not essential for many. Perhaps \nmore importantly, given the dynamics of the New Economy, it may no \nlonger be practical to assume that you can find retirement security at \na single firm.\n\n  The bottom line, much as the recent debates over cash balance plans \nsuggest, is that some very basic issues concerning pension policy are \ncoming to the fore at this time, examples being the essence of the \nemployer-employee relationship, the ability of companies to attract and \nmaintain a skilled workforce, the benefits provided to short- and long-\nterm employees, the advisability of worker mobility seen in the context \nof technological innovation and globalization, and so on. Here, we must \nconfront the reality of political economic change, and do so quickly \nand coherently.\n  But Congress is not doing that. As I stated previously, we are \nreacting to changes rather than planning for the future in a coherent \nand strategic manner. In my view, this is an extremely serious problem \nas it limits our ability to create the conditions necessary for \nnational economic growth and individual economic welfare.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the notion of a Pension Commission has \nbeen discussed and debated for a number of years, but we have never \nplaced it high enough on our list of priorities to address it with \npurpose. I would argue that we can no longer afford the luxury of \ncontemplation, and the time to act is now. Failure to adjust our \nexisting policies to meet the challenges we face both now and in the \nfuture will result in several specific outcomes.\n  First, it will mean that many workers will see their retirement \nexpectations fade or disappear. Second, it will likely mean that these \nindividuals will be forced to rely on government sponsored programs \nthat are themselves financially overextended. Finally, it will mean \nthat the capacity of U.S. firms to compete in the global marketplace \nwill be diminished. In my view, none of these outcomes are acceptable. \nWe simply must become more thoughtful and pro-active.\n  The bill I introduce today has a number of purposes, but foremost \namong them is to establish an affordable, accessible, equitable, \nefficient, cost-effective, and easy to understand private pension plan \nsystem in the United States. It is designed to conduct a complete top-\nto-bottom evaluation of the current system and provide concrete \nrecommendations as to how we can reform it to serve the interests of \nemployers, employees, and the entire nation as a whole.\n  This Commission will be composed of fifteen members, all with \nsignificant experience in areas related to retirement income policy. It \nis mandated that the activities of the Commission\n\n[[Page S7658]]\n\nwill be concluded in a little over two years, with specific language to \nbe provided to Congress so that we can act on their recommendations \nimmediately. To ensure that the activities of the Commission are not \nredundant or otherwise wasteful, it will be allowed to secure data from \nany government agency or department dealing with retirement policy, and \nfurthermore, may request detailees from these agencies and departments \non a non-reimburseable basis. The Commission will also be allowed to \nhold hearings, take testimony, and receive evidence as appropriate from \nindividuals who are able to contribute to this reform effort.\n\n  This bill has been created after detailed discussions with a number \nof individuals and organizations interested in retirement policy, from \nthe Employee Benefits Research Institute, to the Center for Budget and \nPolicy Priorities, to the Association of Private Pension and Welfare \nPlans. Although all of the organizations involved have their own \nperspective on how retirement policy issues should be addressed in the \nUnited States, I have made a concerted effort to make their concerns \ncompatible in this legislation. Significantly, all endorse the goals of \nthe bill, as does the American Academy of Actuaries, the Executive \nCommittee of the New York State Bar Association, and the Chairman of \nthe Special Commission on Pension Simplification of the New York State \nBar Association, Mr. Alvin D. Lurie.\n  Mr. President, although there is much to recommend concerning our \ncurrent pension system, it is common knowledge that this system is, in \nmany instances, too complicated for participants to understand, too \ndifficult for businesses to use, and too inaccessible for individuals \nto join. We have added layer upon layer of legislation, to the point \nthat the system is not only unwieldy, but often of questionable \npurpose. We have reached the point that its complexity and \ninaccessibility is having a tangible impact on individuals and \nbusinesses alike.\n  In my view, the status quo is no longer viable or acceptable. It is \ntime to meet the challenge that faces us in a direct and strategic \nfashion. It is time to reform and simplify the system so that we have a \neffective mechanism that serves employers and employees alike and \nprovides the means to guarantee all Americans income security in their \nretirement years.\n  Mr. President, the time to act is now. I ask my colleagues to \nrecognize the importance of this legislation, and lend their support \nfor its passage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nincluded in the Record at the conclusion of my statement. I also ask \nthat the letters of support from the American Academy of Actuaries and \nthe Association of Private Pension and Welfare Plans be included in the \nRecord immediately following my floor statement.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2922\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Pension Reform and \n     Simplification Commission Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The creation and implementation of an affordable, \n     accessible, equitable, efficient, cost-effective, and easy to \n     understand system is essential to the continuity and \n     viability of the current private pension plan system in the \n     United States.\n       (2) There is a near universal recognition in the United \n     States that the laws that regulate our pension system have \n     become unwieldy, complex, and burdensome, a condition that \n     hinders the achievement of increased saving and economic \n     growth and cannot be fixed by ad hoc improvements to ERISA \n     and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n       (3) Significant and effective improvement of laws can only \n     be accomplished through a coordinated, comprehensive, and \n     sustained effort to revise and simplify current laws by a \n     high-level body of pension experts, whose recommendations are \n     then transmitted to Congress.\n       (4) In recent years, the adoption of narrowly focused and \n     increasingly complex statutes through amendment of the \n     Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (in this Act \n     referred to as ``ERISA'') and the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 has impeded the efforts of employers and employees to \n     save for their retirement and imposed significant challenges \n     for businesses which consider establishing pension plans for \n     their workforce.\n       (5) A high national savings rate can contribute \n     significantly to the economic security of the Nation as it \n     adds to available investment capital, fuels economic growth, \n     and enhances productivity, competitiveness, and prosperity.\n       (6) The Federal Government can potentially increase the \n     national savings rate through the implementation of policies \n     that create an effective framework for the spread of \n     voluntary retirement plans and the protection of the private \n     assets held in those plans.\n       (7) Private pension plans have been, and remain, the single \n     largest repository of private capital in the world and \n     potentially act as a significant inducement for personal \n     saving and investment.\n       (8) Pensions represent the only hope that most working \n     Americans have an adequate supplement to social security \n     benefits, and while the private pension system has been \n     greatly improved since the establishment of ERISA, many \n     inequities remain, and many workers are still not covered by \n     the system.\n       (9) It is essential that all Americans, no matter what \n     their income security level, have the opportunity to achieve \n     income security in their retirement years. Currently, many \n     tax and retirement incentives for private pension plans, \n     while benefiting higher income employees who can often save \n     adequately for their retirement, do not serve sufficiently \n     the needs of low and moderate income workers.\n       (10) The current pensions rules have tended to produce \n     disparate coverage rates for low and moderate income workers.\n       (11) The failure of the Government to modify current \n     pension policies will mean that many workers will be deprived \n     of the options needed to save for their retirement and will, \n     consequently, have their retirement expectations minimized or \n     eliminated.\n       (12) The failure of the Government to redress the burdens \n     imposed by over-regulation and complexity on employer-\n     sponsored pension plans will harm employees and their \n     families.\n       (13) The failure of the Government to redress the problems \n     related to private pension plans may erode the ability of \n     United States companies to compete effectively in the \n     international market and result in a decrease in the economic \n     health of the Nation.\n\n     SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF COMMISSION.\n\n       There is established a commission to be known as the \n     Pension Reform and Simplification Commission (in this Act \n     referred to as the ``Commission'').\n\n     SEC. 4. DUTIES.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Commission shall--\n       (1) study the strengths, weaknesses, and challenges \n     involved in the regulation of the current private pension \n     system;\n       (2) review and assess Federal statutes relating to the \n     regulation of the current private pension system; and\n       (3) recommend changes in the law regarding the regulation \n     of the current private pension system to mitigate the \n     problems identified under subsection (b), with the goal of \n     making the system more affordable, accessible, efficient, \n     less costly, less complex, and, in general, to expand pension \n     coverage.\n       (b) Issues To Be Studied.--The Commission shall include in \n     the study under subsection (a) a consideration of--\n       (1) the manner in which the current rules impact private \n     pension coverage, how such coverage has changed over the last \n     25 years (since the enactment of ERISA), and reasons for such \n     change;\n       (2) the primary burdens placed on small and medium business \n     in the United States regarding administration of pension \n     plans, especially how such burdens affect the tenuous \n     position occupied by these organizations in the competitive \n     market;\n       (3) the simplification of existing pension rules in order \n     to eliminate undue costs on employers while providing \n     retirement security protection to employees;\n       (4) the primary obstacles to employees in gaining optimum \n     advantages from the current pension system, with particular \n     attention to the small and medium business sector and low and \n     moderate income employees, including minorities and women;\n       (5) the feasibility of providing innovative design options \n     to enable small and medium businesses to be relieved of \n     complex and costly legislative and regulatory burdens in \n     matters of adoption, operation, administration, and reporting \n     of pension plans, in order to increase affordable and \n     effective coverage in that sector, for low and moderate \n     income employees, with emphasis on minorities and women;\n       (6) the means of leveling distribution of private pension \n     plan coverage between high wage earners and low and moderate \n     income workers;\n       (7) the feasibility of forward-looking reforms that \n     anticipate the needs of small and medium businesses in the \n     United States given the obstacles and opportunities of the \n     new global economy, in particular issues related to the \n     mobility and retention of skilled workers;\n       (8) how pension plan benefits can be made more portable;\n       (9) the means of achieving the expansion and adoption of \n     pension plans by United States businesses, especially those \n     employing low and moderate income workers who currently lack \n     access to such plans;\n\n[[Page S7659]]\n\n       (10) the impact of expanding individual retirement account \n     contribution limits and income limits on private pension plan \n     coverage;\n       (11) the provision of innovative incentives that encourage \n     more employers to use existing private pension plans;\n       (12) the impact of qualified plan contribution and benefit \n     limits on coverage; and\n       (13) any proposals for major simplification of Federal \n     legislation and regulation regarding qualified pension plans, \n     in order to address and mitigate problem areas identified \n     under this subsection, with the goal of--\n       (A) strengthening the private pension system;\n       (B) expanding the availability, adoption, and retention of \n     tax-favored savings plans by all Americans;\n       (C) eliminating rules that burden the pension system beyond \n     the benefits they provide, for low and moderate income \n     workers, including minorities and women, with specific \n     emphasis on--\n       (i) eligibility and coverage;\n       (ii) contributions and benefits;\n       (iii) minimum distributions, withdrawals, and loans;\n       (iv) spousal and beneficiary benefits;\n       (v) portability between plans;\n       (vi) asset recapture;\n       (vii) plan compliance and termination;\n       (viii) income and excise taxation; and\n       (ix) reporting, disclosure, and penalties; and\n       (D) identification of the trade-offs involved in \n     simplification under subparagraph (C).\n       (c) Report.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 24 months after the \n     designation of the chairperson under section 5(d), the \n     Commission shall transmit to the President and Congress a \n     report containing--\n       (A) the issues studied under subsection (b);\n       (B) the results of such study;\n       (C) draft legislation and commentary under paragraph (2); \n     and\n       (D) any other recommendations based on such study.\n       (2) Legislative recommendations.--The Commission shall \n     develop draft legislation and associated explanations and \n     commentary to achieve major simplification of Federal \n     legislation regarding regulation of pension plans (including \n     ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) to implement any \n     findings or recommendations of the study conducted under \n     subsection (b).\n       (3) Recommendations.--Any official findings or \n     recommendations of the Commission shall be adopted by \\2/3\\ \n     of the members of the Commission.\n       (4) Minority views.--All findings and recommendations of \n     the Commission formally proposed by any member of the \n     Commission and not adopted under paragraph (3) shall also be \n     included in the report.\n\n     SEC. 5.

Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: The American Academy of Actuaries \n     would like to express its strong support for your idea of \n     establishing a national commission on pension reform and \n     simplification. The Academy has long advocated a \n     comprehensive and coordinated approach to retirement policy. \n     We believe the establishment of a bipartisan commission of \n     experts to analyze obstacles that weaken our private pension \n     system and recommend solutions is a positive first step. The \n     Academy also believes that slight modifications to your \n     proposal would make the commission more effective.\n       The Academy commends you for recognizing that, because the \n     laws that regulate our private pension system have become too \n     complex, they discourage employers from helping their workers \n     save for an adequate retirement. We strongly support the \n     concept of a bipartisan commission of experts that will \n     recommend specific ways to simplify the rules governing \n     private plans, thereby encouraging employers to expand \n     coverage to more workers.\n       The Academy believes that the commission called for in your \n     proposal could be made more effective if Congress was \n     required to have an up-or-down vote on its recommendations. \n     Furthermore, we believe that, given the expertise available \n     to the commission, it should be possible to formulate a \n     result in 12-18 months, rather than the 24 months specified \n     in your legislation. Finally, we would encourage the \n     commission to examine pension changes in the context of a \n     national retirement income policy, including Social Security, \n     since major changes to the private pension system undoubtedly \n     will affect Social Security.\n       The Academy believes that creation of a national commission \n     will be a positive first step toward our mutual goal of \n     increasing pension coverage for Americans. We appreciate your \n     recognition of the unique role that actuaries should play in \n     such a commission and look forward to providing any \n     assistance that may be of benefit to you and your staff.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  James E. Turpin,\n     Vice President, Pensions.\n                                  ____\n\n                                     APPWP, Association of Private\n\n\n                                    Pension and Welfare Plans,\n\n                                                    July 18, 2000.\n     Pension Reform and Simplification Commission Act\n     Senator Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: On behalf of the Association of \n     Private Pension and Welfare Plans (APPWP--The Benefits \n     Association), I want to express our appreciation for your \n     interest in, and support for, our nation's voluntary, \n     employer-sponsored retirement system as evidenced by the \n     Pension Reform and Simplification Commission Act that you \n     will soon introduce. APPWP is a public policy organization \n     representing principally Fortune 500 companies and other \n     organizations that assist companies of all sizes in providing \n     benefits to employees. Collectively, APPWP's members either \n     sponsor directly or provide services to retirement and health \n     plans that cover more than 100 million Americans. We \n     appreciate your past and continuing efforts to expand the \n     private, voluntary retirement system that currently enables \n     millions of working Americans to achieve financial security \n     in retirement.\n       As you know, the employer-based retirement system provides \n     an important source of income security for many Americans in \n     retirement, and, in many respects, has been successful in \n     meeting the challenges of an aging population. However, we \n     recognize that public policy can build and expand on this \n     success. Many employers, particularly small companies, find \n     it difficult to establish retirement plans because of cost \n     and administrative complexity. As a result, many workers do \n     not have access to private pensions and cannot save \n     adequately for retirement. Moreover, our pension laws have \n     not kept pace with the rapid developments in the business \n     world. New technologies, international competition, and many \n     types of corporate transactions pose unique pension \n     challenges that should be better accommodated by our nation's \n     retirement policy. APPWP has consistently campaigned for \n     expansion and reform of the nation's pension laws with the \n     express goals of expanding coverage, increasing portability, \n     reducing complexity, and reflecting business realities. We \n     are therefore pleased that you have made these goals the \n     central objective of the commission you propose.\n       In particular, APPWP commends you for putting the focus of \n     pension reform on expanding coverage. You correctly note that \n     our retirement system has become overly burdened with \n     unwieldy and complex rules that have impeded expanded \n     coverage and increased retirement security for all Americans. \n     Your advocacy on behalf of the goals of coverage and \n     simplification is an important step towards realizing a more \n     secure retirement for all Americans.\n       We look forward to working with you on these important \n     issues. If we can be of further assistance, please do not \n     hesitate to contact us.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   James A. Klein,\n                                                        President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Daschle, Mr. \n        Moynihan, Mr. L.

Mr. President, I am pleased to announce the introduction \nof the Family Care Act of 2000, which takes the next logical step in \nassuring access by as many citizens as possible to affordable health \ninsurance. I commend Congressman John Dingell and the rest of our \ncolleagues for their fine work in crafting this legislation.\n  The number of uninsured Americans is now more than 44 million, and \nthe figure is rising by an average of one million a year. America is \nthe only industrial country in the world, except South Africa, that \nfails to guarantee health care for all it citizens.\n  It is a national scandal that lack of insurance coverage is the \nseventh leading--and most preventable--cause of death in America today.\n  Three years ago, we worked together to create CHIP, the federal-state \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, which provides coverage to \nchildren in families with incomes too high for Medicaid and too low to \nafford private health insurance.\n  More than two million children have been enrolled in that program, \nand millions more have signed up for Medicaid as a result of outreach \nactivities. Soon, more than three-quarters of all uninsured children in \nthe nation will be eligible for assistance through either CHIP or \nMedicaid.\n  But, despite this progress, the parents of these children, and too \nmany others, have been left behind. The time has come to take the next \nstep.\n  The overwhelming majority of uninsured low-wage parents are \nstruggling to support their families. I will ask unanimous consent to \ninsert a statement in the Record from Patricia Quezada, a parent of \nthree lovely girls, who would benefit from this legislation.\n  Parents who work hard, 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, should be \neligible for assistance to buy the health insurance they need in order \nto protect their families. Our message to them today is that help is on \nthe way.\n  Often, they work for companies which don't offer insurance, or they \naren't eligible for insurance that is offered. Fewer than a quarter of \nthe jobs taken by those who have been forced off the welfare rolls by \nwelfare reform offer insurance as a benefit--and even when it is \noffered too few companies make it available for dependents. The time \nhas come to take the next step.\n  The Family Care Act of 2000 will provide with the resources, \nincentives and authority to extend Medicaid and CHIP to the parents of \nchildren covered under those programs.\n  Coverage for parents also means better coverage for children. Parents \nare much more likely to enroll their children in health insurance, if \nthe parents themselves can have coverage, too.\n  This step alone will give to six and a half million Americans the \ncoverage they need and deserve.\n  The Family Care Act will also improve the outreach and enrollment for \nCHIP and Medicaid, and encourage states to extend coverage to other \nvulnerable population, such as pregnant women, legal immigrants, and \nchildren ages 19 and 20.\n  This program is affordable under current and projected budget \nsurpluses. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the cost will \nbe $11 billion over the next five years.\n  Last Monday, a majority of the Senate voted in favor of this proposal \nas an amendment to the marriage penalty bill. We needed 60 votes, so it \nwas not successful then, but we clearly have a bipartisan majority of \nthe Senate.\n  The bottom line is that we have the resources to take this needed \nstep, and\n\n[[Page S7661]]\n\nend the suffering and uncertainty that accompanies being uninsured.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that statements and letters of \nsupport for this legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n              statement of patricia quezada, july 21, 2000\n\n       Good morning. I am Patricia Quezada. I am a mother of three \n     girls (ages 9, 8 and 5). I work as a part-time parent liaison \n     at Weyanoke Elementary School in Fairfax, Virginia. My \n     husband is a self-employed general contractor. Because my \n     husband is self-employed and I work part-time, our family \n     does not have access to health insurance through our jobs.\n       In the past, we were able to purchase private insurance \n     that covered our family. But, in recent times, our family has \n     been unable to afford the high rates because it came down to \n     either paying for our home, transportation and other \n     necessities--including food--or purchasing this costly \n     insurance. On two occasions, the coverage was cancelled \n     because we were unable to meet the payments, which were \n     required in advance.\n       It was such a relief that my children are now able to \n     receive coverage through Medicaid and CMSIP, Virginia's SCHIP \n     Program. (As a parent-liaison, part of my job has been to \n     help other families sign up their children for health \n     insurance.) I feel extremely fortunate that my children are \n     now covered in case of an illness or accident, however I \n     continue to fear what could happen if my husband or I fall \n     sick or have an injury. While we both do our best to take \n     care of our health, we know how important it is to have \n     health insurance coverage if we should need it.\n       Thank you.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                      Children's Defense Fund,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 21, 2000.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: We are taking this opportunity to \n     thank you for introducing the FamilyCare Act of 2000 and to \n     express the strong support of the Children's Defense Fund for \n     this bipartisan initiative to provide and strengthen health \n     care coverage for uninsured children and their parents. \n     Building on the successes of Medicaid and the Children's \n     Health Insurance Program (CHIP), this legislation will \n     increase coverage for uninsured children, provide funding for \n     health insurance coverage for the uninsured parents of \n     Medicaid and CHIP-eligible children, and simplify the \n     enrollment process for Medicaid and CHIP to make the programs \n     more family friendly.\n       We want to extent our appreciation to Senators Chafee, \n     Collins, Daschle, Lautenberg, Rockefeller, and Snowe for co-\n     sponsoring this legislation in the Senate and to \n     Representatives Dingell, Stark,  and Waxman for taking the \n     lead on this proposal in the House. We look forward to \n     working with you for passage of the FamilyCare Act of 2000.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Gregg Haifley,\n     Deputy Director Health Division.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                         Children's Hospitals,\n\n                                    Alexandria, VA, July 21, 2000.\n     Hon. Edward Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: On behalf of the National Association \n     of Children's Hospital (N.A.C.H.), which represents over 100 \n     children's hospitals nationwide, I want to express our strong \n     support for your introduction of the ``FamilyCare Act of \n     2000.''\n       As providers of care to all children, regardless of their \n     economic status, children's hospitals devote nearly half of \n     their patient care to children who rely on Medicaid or are \n     uninsured, and more than three-fourths of their patient-care \n     to children with chronic and congenital conditions. These \n     hospitals have extensive experience in assisting families to \n     enroll eligible children in Medicaid and SCHIP. They are \n     keenly aware of the importance of addressing the challenges \n     that states face in enrolling this often hard to reach \n     population of eligible children.\n       In particular, N.A.C.H. appreciates and strongly supports \n     your efforts to simplify and coordinate the application \n     process for SCHIP and Medicaid, as well as to provide new \n     tools for states to use in identifying and enrolling \n     families. In addition, N.A.C.H. applauds your provisions that \n     set a higher bar for covering children by: (1) requiring \n     states to first cover children up to 200% of poverty and \n     eliminating waiting lists in the SCHIP program before \n     covering parents; and (2) requiring every child who loses \n     coverage under Medicaid or SCHIP to be automatically screened \n     for other avenues of eligibility and if found eligible, \n     enrolled immediately in that program.\n       N.A.C.H. also supports your legislation's provision to give \n     states additional flexibility under SCHIP and Medicaid to \n     cover legal immigrant children. In states with high \n     proportions of uninsured children, such as California, Texas \n     and Florida, the federal government's bar on coverage of \n     legal immigrant children helps contribute to the fact that \n     Hispanic children represent the highest rate of uninsured \n     children of all major racial and ethnic minority groups. Your \n     provision to ensure coverage of legal immigrant children \n     would be extremely useful in improving this situation.\n       N.A.C.H. greatly appreciates all that you have done \n     throughout your years of service, and continue to do, to \n     provide all children with the best possible chance at \n     starting out and staying healthy. We welcome and look forward \n     to working with you to pass the ``FamilyCare Act of 2000.''\n           Sincerely,\n     Lawrence A. McAndrews.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   March of Dimes,\n\n\n                                     Birth Defects Foundation,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 21, 2000.\n     Hon. Edward Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: On behalf of more than 3 million \n     volunteers and 1600 staff members of the March of Dimes, I \n     want to commend you for introducing the ``FamilyCare Act of \n     2000.'' The March of Dimes is committed to increasing access \n     to appropriate and affordable health care for women, infants \n     and children and supports the targeted approach to expanding \n     the State Children's Health Insurance Program contained in \n     the FamilyCare proposal.\n       The ``FamilyCare Act of 2000'' contains a number of \n     beneficial provisions that would expand and improve SCHIP. \n     The March of Dimes strongly supports giving states the option \n     to cover low-income pregnant women in Medicaid and SCHIP \n     programs with an enhanced matching rate. We understand that \n     FamilyCare would allow states to cover uninsured parents of \n     children enrolled in Medicaid and SCHIP as well as uninsured \n     first-time pregnant women. SCHIP is the only major federally-\n     funded program that denies coverage to pregnant women while \n     providing coverage to their infants and children. We know \n     prenatal care improves birth outcomes. Expanding health \n     insurance coverage for low-income pregnant women has \n     bipartisan support in both the House and Senate.\n       The March of Dimes also supports FamilyCare provisions to \n     require automatic enrollment of children born to SCHIP \n     parents; automatic screening of every child who loses \n     coverage under Medicaid or SCHIP to determine eligibility for \n     other health programs; and distribution of information on the \n     availability of Medicaid and SCHIP through the school lunch \n     program. The March of Dimes also supports giving states the \n     option to provide Medicaid and SCHIP benefits to children and \n     pregnant women who arrived legally to the United States after \n     August 23, 1996, and to people ages 19 and 20.\n       We thank you for your leadership in introducing the \n     ``FamilyCare Act of 2000'' and are eager to work with you to \n     achieve approval of this much needed legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Anna Eleanor Roosevelt,\n       Vice Chair, Board of Trustees; Chair, Public Affairs \n     Committee.\n     Dr. Jennifer L. Howse,\n       Presdient.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       Association of Maternal and\n\n\n                                        Child Health Programs,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 20, 2000.\n     Hon. Edward Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: On behalf of the Association of \n     Maternal and Child Health Programs (AMCHP), I am writing to \n     express our support of the FamilyCare Act of 2000. We are \n     particularly supportive of the provisions that allow states \n     to include pregnant women in their SCHIP and Medicaid \n     programs.\n       We are also pleased with the provisions giving states the \n     flexibility to expand outreach activities as well as moving \n     towards greater equity in program payments.\n       AMCHP represents state officials in 59 states and \n     territories who administer public health programs aimed at \n     improving the health of all women, children, and adolescents. \n     In 1997, over 22 million women, children, adolescents and \n     children with special health care needs received services, \n     which were supported by the Maternal and Child Health Block \n     Grant.\n       We look forward to working with you and your staff on this \n     bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Deborah Dietrich,\n     Director of Legislative Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   American Dental\n\n\n                                        Hygienist Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 24, 2000.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Hon. Jay Rockefeller,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Kennedy and Rockefeller: on behalf of the \n     American Dental Hygienists' Association (ADHA), I write to \n     express ADHA's support for the principles espoused in the \n     Family Care Act of 2000. This legislation is an important \n     step toward the goal of meaningful health insurance coverage, \n     including oral health insurance coverage, for all children \n     and their parents.\n       Regretfully, there is room for much improvement in our \n     children's oral health, a fundamental part of total health. \n     Studies show that oral disease currently afflicts the \n     majority of children in our country. Dental caries (tooth \n     decay), gingivitis, and periodontitis (gum and bone \n     disorders) are the most common oral diseases. The Public \n     Health Service reports that 50% of all children in the United \n     States experience dental caries in their permanent teeth and \n     two-thirds experience gingivitis.\n\n[[Page S7662]]\n\n       The percentages of children with dental disease are likely \n     far higher for the traditionally underserved Medicaid-\n     eligible population and for those eligible for the State \n     Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). For example, one \n     of the most severe forms of gum disease--localized juvenile \n     periodontitis--disproportionately affects teenage African-\n     American males and can result in the loss of all teeth before \n     adulthood. If untreated, gum disease causes pain, bleeding, \n     loss of function, diminished appearance, possible systemic \n     infections, bone deterioration and eventual loss of teeth. \n     Yet, each of the three most common oral health disorders--\n     dental caries, gingivitis, and periodontitis--can be \n     prevented through the type of regular preventive care \n     provided by dental hygienists.\n       Despite the known benefits of preventive oral health \n     services and the inclusion of oral health benefits in \n     Medicaid's Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and \n     Treatment (EPSDT) program, only one in 5 (4.2 million out of \n     21.2 million) Medicaid-eligible children actually received \n     preventive oral health services in 1993 according to a 1996 \n     U.S. Department of Health and Human Services report entitled \n     Children's Dental Services Under Medicaid: Access and \n     Utilization.\n       The nation simply must improve access to oral health \n     services and your legislation is an important building block \n     for all who care about our children's oral health, a \n     fundamental part of general health and well-being.\n       We in the dental hygiene community look forward to working \n     together toward our shared goal of health insurance coverage \n     for all of our nation's families. Please feel free to call \n     upon me or ADHA's Washington Counsel, Karen Sealander of \n     McDermott, Will & Emery (202-756-8024), at any time.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Stanley B. Peck,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                 Premier Inc.,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 21, 2000.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, D.C.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: On behalf of Premier Inc., I am \n     writing to applaud your introduction of the ``FamilyCare Act \n     of 2000'' and express our strong support. Premier is a \n     strategic alliance of leading not-for-profit hospitals and \n     health systems across the nation. Premier provides group \n     purchasing and other services for more than 1,800 hospitals \n     and healthcare facilities.\n       As reported by the Urban Institute in the July/August issue \n     of Health Affairs, the population of non-elderly uninsured \n     grew by 4.2 million between 1994 and 1998. This hike in the \n     rate of uninsured occurred among children and adults. In the \n     same period, Medicaid coverage fell from 10 to 8.4 percent, \n     or about 3.1 million persons (1.9 million children and 1.2 \n     million adults). Your legislation confronts and seeks to \n     address these disturbing trends head on.\n       The FamilyCare Act of 2000 not only expands coverage to \n     children--it also enables states to provide health insurance \n     to parents of children enrolled in CHIP and Medicaid. The \n     bill creates new opportunities for states to cover immigrant \n     children and pregnant women, and provides for the automatic \n     coverage of children born to CHIP-enrolled parents, thereby \n     enhancing presumptive eligibility.\n       This legislation provides for the mutual reinforcement of \n     the Medicaid and CHIP programs by integrating eligibility \n     determination and outreach efforts. A standard application \n     form and simple enrollment process for both programs will \n     raise the participation rate for both programs. Finally, the \n     bill provides grants to support broader outreach activities \n     and employer subsidies to offer health insurance packages, \n     thereby encouraging joint public/private market innovations \n     to reduce the population of uninsured.\n       Stifling the growth in the rate of uninsured and reversing \n     the trend remain a top priority for the hospital community. \n     Securing the appropriate preventative care for these \n     individuals will improve the quality and cost-effectiveness \n     of further care, as the uninsured are more likely to be \n     hospitalized for medical conditions that, initially, could \n     have been managed with physician care and/or medication.\n       Thank you for taking the lead in addressing the problem of \n     America's uninsured. We look forward to working with you \n     toward enactment of this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Kerb Kuhn,\n     Vice President, Advocacy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                 Families USA,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 17, 2000.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: We congratulate you on the \n     introduction of your bill, the Family Care Act of 2000, which \n     gives states the option to provide parents of children \n     enrolled in the Medicaid and CHIP programs with health \n     insurance. We believe that your bill is a crucial next step \n     in addressing the problem of our nation's uninsured, and we \n     offer our unequivocal support.\n       By covering parents through CHIP, the Family Care Act could \n     provide health insurance to over four million previously \n     uninsured Americans. We believe this is a cost-effective and \n     efficient way to provide quality healthcare to low- and \n     moderate-income working families. Children of CHIP-enrolled \n     parents will be automatically enrolled at birth, but, equally \n     importantly, research has shown that children are more likely \n     to have health coverage when their parents are insured. This \n     means that the Family Care Act could, in effect, cover many \n     more Americans than the estimated four million. Additionally, \n     the expansion of coverage to legal immigrant children and \n     pregnant women addresses the needs of two particularly \n     vulnerable groups.\n       Again, we applaud your ongoing leadership in tackling the \n     problem of the uninsured, and we support this important \n     legislation. Please let us know how we can help you to enact \n     this bill into law.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Ronald F. Pollack,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                American Hospital Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 21, 2000.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n         Pensions, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: The American Hospital Association \n     (AHA), which represents, 5,000 hospitals, health care \n     systems, networks, and other providers of care, is pleased to \n     support the FamilyCare Act of 2000. The AHA shares your goal \n     of expanding access to health care coverage for the 44 \n     million uninsured Americans. We believe the federal budget \n     surplus offers a unique opportunity to fund solutions to the \n     health care problems of the uninsured.\n       Recent Medicaid expansions and the creation of the State \n     Children's Health Insurance Program (S-CHIP) have greatly \n     improved access to health care coverage for millions of \n     children living in low-income families. But more needs to be \n     done. AHA strongly supports the objective of your legislation \n     that embraces, as one option to address the problems of the \n     uninsured, building on existing public programs to expand \n     coverage to the parents of the children covered by S-CHIP.\n       Furthermore, your provisions that include coverage for \n     legal immigrants, improve Medicaid coverage for those \n     transitioning from welfare-to-work, and create state grant \n     programs to encourage market innovation in health care \n     insurance are to be applauded. AHA believes these are good \n     first steps toward lowering the numbers of the uninsured.\n       In addition to expanding public programs, AHA supports \n     measures that make health care insurance more affordable for \n     low-income working families. Toward that end, AHA also \n     support H.R. 4113, bipartisan legislation establishing \n     refundable tax credits to assist low-income families in the \n     purchase of health care insurance.\n       Our nation's hospitals see every day that the absence of \n     health coverage is a significant barrier to care, reducing \n     the likelihood that people will get appropriate preventive, \n     diagnostic and chronic care. With the uninsured growing in \n     numbers, AHA supports your effort to build on current public \n     programs as an important option to make it possible for more \n     low-income families to get needed health care coverage. We \n     thank you for your leadership and we look forward to working \n     with you on advancing the FamilyCare Act of 2000.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Rick Pollack,\n     Executive Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                      Network,\n\n                                        Washington, DC, July 2000.\n\n     From NETWORK--A National Catholic Social Justice Lobby.\n     Re: The Family Care Act of 2000.\n\n       Hon. Senator Ted Kennedy: Since 1975, NETWORK: A National \n     Catholic Social Justice Lobby has worked for universal access \n     to affordable, quality health care. NETWORK considers the \n     constant increase in the number of uninsured persons a \n     national disgrace and a serious moral and ethical issue. \n     Sadly, the political will to reform the nation's fragmented \n     non-system of health care is seriously lacking in the current \n     climate of commercialization and profit-making. Therefore, \n     millions of American citizens are denied their human right to \n     medical care.\n       Given that as the context, NETWORK supports the efforts of \n     those legislators who recognize that the anticipated federal \n     surplus should be utilized in part to rectify the serious \n     flaws inherent in the present situation. The Family Care Act \n     of 2000 is one of those efforts. NETWORK urges Congress to \n     pass the proposal.\n       The goal of the bill is to build on existing legislation in \n     order to enroll more uninsured children and their working \n     parents in Medicaid or CHIP. The bill requires that states \n     first cover children up to 200% of poverty before they enroll \n     parents. This will serve to increase coverage of previously \n     eligible but uninsured children by eliminating the CHIP \n     waiting lists. It is estimated that over 4 million previously \n     uninsured children will be enrolled.\n       The proposal targets $50 billion in new money to enable the \n     states to enroll the parents of children already covered by \n     Medicaid and CHIP. This would reduce the number of uninsured \n     parents by an estimated 6.5 million, one out of seven of the \n     nation's uninsured. Most of these uninsured families have at \n     least one member who works.\n       In addition, the bill proposes another $100 million per \n     year for five years to encourage the states to develop \n     innovative approaches to expanding coverage, tailoring their \n     solutions to market needs. Much needed is the\n\n[[Page S7663]]\n\n     proposed extension of The Transitional Medicaid Assistance \n     program. Some of the requirements which jeopardize access to \n     health care by persons moving from welfare to low-wage, non-\n     benefit jobs will be removed. First time pregnant women will \n     receive prenatal care under the CHIP program and grants will \n     enable states to develop innovative coverage mechanisms.\n       All in all, the Family Care Act of 2000 as drafted seeks to \n     rectify to a marked degree the serious problem of lack of \n     health care coverage for the most vulnerable in our society, \n     low-wage working families and their children.\n     Kathy Thornton RSM,\n       National Coordinator.\n     Catherine Pinkerton,\n       CSJ Lobbyist.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, over the last several years health \ncare reform has dropped off our national and Congressional agenda. We \ntalk about it primarily to posture politically, not because we are \ndetermined to actually succeed in extending coverage. Too often, the \ngoal seems to be to simply create a campaign issue and make voters \nbelieve we are working to solve the problem, when in reality no \nprogress is being made.\n  This year, we have seen a lot of talking on health care, but it's \nclear that Congress' priorities lie elsewhere. Just this past week we \npassed a tax break that will affect only 1.7 percent of Americans, yet \nwill cost us $50 billion a year when fully phased in. In the meantime, \n40 million people, mostly of modest incomes, continue to live their \nlives with little hope of getting the health coverage they need.\n  The question that Congress needs to answer: will we continue to sit \nback and simply watch as the problem of the uninsured grows worse?\n  Along with Senator Kennedy, and Congressmen Dingell, Stark and \nWaxman, I obviously have very clear answers to this question. And today \nwe are offering a commonsense, bi-partisan step that Congress can take \nthis year to improve the plight of working, uninsured families.\n  We know that the majority of those without health insurance are \nconcentrated in lower-income, working families. The Medicaid and CHIP \nFamily Care Improvement Act would target our efforts to these families \nby allowing states to extend Medicaid and CHIP to the parents of \neligible children. This is a sensible, affordable expansion that will \nmake a real and immediate difference for many American families.\n  In addition, FamilyCare would provide assistance to increase coverage \nfor workers in small businesses by providing grant money for states to \npursue new and innovative approaches to expand health insurance \ncoverage through small business.\n  Our plan also gives states a number of new tools to help improve \noutreach and enrollment in Medicaid and the State Children's Health \nInsurance Program.\n  FamilyCare would provide health insurance coverage to millions of \nlow-income working families for a fraction of the cost of the recently-\npassed tax breaks that affect only a small number of people.\n  Eight years ago, the fight for universal health care had a surge of \nenergy and there was a common purpose among political leaders and the \nAmerican people. Unfortunately, little progress has been made since \nthen. While the number of uninsured has grown from 36 million in 1993 \nto 44 million in 1999, we have stood by as a nation and simply watched. \nOver the next 3 years, about 30 percent of the population, 81 million \nAmericans, can expect a gap in their health insurance coverage lasting \nat least one month. It is practically inconceivable--and morally \nwrong--that we are allowing this to happen in such a strong economy, \nwith an extremely competitive labor market.\n  It is time to end the failed experiment of trying to let the disease \ncure itself. We need to accomplish the goal of comprehensive reform in \nany way we can--even if it means continuing to work on incremental \nchanges, as long as we always keep our target squarely set on universal \ncoverage.\n  Today, we are giving Congress the opportunity to take a major step \nforward in accomplishing this goal. With FamilyCare, we are simply \ntaking a program that is already working to reduce the number of \nuninsured, and expanding it to cover more people who we know need the \nhelp.\n  This approach makes so much sense that even the conservative Health \nInsurance Association of America--the organization that helped to \ndefeat universal coverage--has offered its support. In addition, our \nbill has four Republicans as original cosponsors. With this bipartisan \nbill we have a real opportunity to stop talking about expanding health \ncoverage, and start acting.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Durbin, and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 2924. A bill to strengthen the enforcement of Federal statutes \nrelating to false identification, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n        the internet false identification prevention act of 2000\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today, along with my colleague from \nIllinois, Senator Durbin, I am introducing legislation to stem the \nproliferation of web sites that distribute counterfeit identification \ndocuments and credentials over the Internet.\n  In May, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I \nchair, held hearings on a disturbing new trend--the use of the Internet \nto manufacture and market counterfeit identification documents and \ncredentials. Our investigation revealed the widespread availability on \nthe Internet of a variety of fake ID documents or computer templates \nthat allow individuals to manufacture authentic looking IDs in the \nseclusion of their own homes.\n  The Internet False Identification Prevention Act of 2000 will \nstrengthen current law to prevent the distribution of false \nidentification documents over the Internet and make it easier for \nFederal officials to prosecute this criminal activity.\n  The high quality of the counterfeit identification documents that can \nbe obtained via the Internet is simply astounding. With very little \ndifficulty, my staff was able to use Internet materials to manufacture \nconvincing IDs that would allow me to pass as a member of our Armed \nForces, as a reporter, as a student at Boston University, or as a \nlicensed driver in Florida, Michigan, and Wyoming--to name just a few \nof the identities that I could assume, using these phony IDs. We found \nit was very easy to manufacture IDs that were indistinguishable from \nthe real documents.\n  For example, using the Internet, my staff created this counterfeit \nConnecticut driver's license, which is virtually identical to an \nauthentic license issued by the Connecticut Department of Motor \nVehicles. Just like the real Connecticut license, this fake with my \npicture on it, includes a signature written over the picture--which is \nsupposed to be a security feature. It includes an adjacent ``shadow \npicture,'' and it includes the bar code and the State seal for the \nState of Connecticut.\n  Each of these sophisticated features was added to the license by the \nState of Connecticut in order to make it more difficult to counterfeit. \nYet the Internet scam artists have been able to keep up with the \ntechnology, and every time a State adds another security feature it has \nbeen easily duplicated.\n  Unfortunately, some web sites sell fake IDs complete with State \nseals, holograms, and bar codes to replicate a license virtually \nindistinguishable from the real thing. Thus, technology now allows web \nsite operators to copy authentic IDs with an extraordinary level of \nsophistication and then distribute and mass produce these fraudulent \ndocuments for their customers.\n  The web sites investigated by my subcommittee offered a vast and \nvaried product line, ranging from the driver's licenses that I already \nshowed to military identification cards to Federal agency credentials, \nincluding those of the FBI and the CIA.\n  Other sites offered to produce Social Security cards, birth \ncertificates, diplomas, and press credentials. In short, one can find \nalmost any kind of identification document that one wants on the \nInternet.\n  The General Accounting Office and the FBI have both confirmed the \nfindings of the subcommittee's investigation of this dangerous new \ntrend. The GAO used counterfeit credentials and badges readily \navailable for purchase via the Internet to breach the security at 19 \nFederal buildings and two commercial airports. GAO's success in doing \nso demonstrates that the Internet and computer technology allow\n\n[[Page S7664]]\n\nnearly anyone to create convincing identification cards and \ncredentials.\n  The FBI has also focused on the potential of misuse of official \nidentification, and just last month executive search warrants at the \nhomes of several individuals who had been selling Federal law \nenforcement badges over the Internet.\n  Obviously, this is very serious. It allows someone to use a law \nenforcement badge to gain access to secure areas and perhaps to commit \nharm. For example, the FBI is investigating a very disturbing incident \nwhere someone allegedly displayed phony FBI credentials to gain access \nto an individual's hotel room and then allegedly later kidnaped and \nmurdered that individual.\n  The Internet is a revolutionary tool of commerce and communications \nthat benefits us all, but many of the Internet's greatest attributes \nalso further its use for criminal purposes. While the manufacture of \nfalse IDs by criminals is certainly nothing new, the Internet allows \nthose specializing in the sale of counterfeit IDs to reach a far \nbroader market of potential buyers than they ever could by standing on \nthe street corner in a shady part of town. They can sell their products \nwith virtual anonymity through the use of e-mail services and free web \nhosting services and by providing false information when registering \ntheir domain names. Similarly, the Internet allows criminals to obtain \nfake IDs in the privacy of their own homes, substantially diminishing \nthe risk of apprehension that attends purchasing counterfeit documents \non the street.\n  Because this is a relatively new phenomenon, there are no good data \non the size of the false ID industry or the growth it has experienced \nas a result of the Internet, but the testimony at our hearing indicates \nthat the Internet is increasingly becoming the source of choice for \ncriminals to obtain false IDs.\n  The subcommittee's investigation found that some web site operators \napparently have made hundreds of thousands of dollars through the sale \nof phony identification documents. One web site operator told a State \nlaw enforcement official that he sold approximately 1,000 fake IDs each \nmonth and generated about $600,000 in annual sales.\n  Identify theft is a growing problem that these Internet sites \nfacilitate. Fake IDs, however, also facilitate a broad array of \ncriminal conduct. We found that some Internet sites were used to obtain \ncounterfeit identification documents for the purpose of committing \nother crimes, ranging from very serious offenses, such as identify \ntheft and bank fraud, ranging to the more common problem of teenagers \nusing phony IDs to buy alcohol.\n  The legislation which Senator Durbin and I are introducing today is \ndesigned to address the problem of counterfeit IDs in several ways. The \ncentral features of our legislation are provisions that modernize \nexisting law to address the widespread availability of false \nidentification documents on the Internet.\n  First, the legislation supplements current Federal law against false \nidentification to modernize it for the Internet age. The primary law \nprohibiting the use and distribution of false identification documents \nwas enacted in 1982. Advances in computer technology and the use of the \nInternet have rendered that law inadequate. This bill will clarify that \nthe current law prohibits the sale or distribution of false \nidentification documents through computer files and templates which our \ninvestigation found are the vehicles of choice for manufacturing false \nIDs in the Internet age.\n  Second, the legislation will make it easier to prosecute those \ncriminals who manufacture, distribute, or sell counterfeit \nidentification documents by ending the practices of easily removable \ndisclaimers as part of an attempt to shield the illegal conduct from \nprosecution through a bogus claim of novelty.\n  What we found is that a lot of these web sites have these \ndisclaimers, in an attempt to get around the law, saying that these can \nonly be used for entertainment or novelty purposes. No longer will it \nbe acceptable to provide computer templates of government-issued \nidentification cards containing an easily removable layer saying it is \nnot a government document.\n  I will give an example. this is a driver's license from Oklahoma. It \nis a fake ID which my staff obtained via the Internet. It is enclosed \nin a plastic pouch that says ``Not a Government Document'' in red print \nacross it, but it was very easily removed. All one had to do, with a \nsnip of the scissors, was cut the pouch, and then the ID is easily \nremoved and the disclaimer is gone. That is the kind of technique that \na lot of times these web site operators use to get around the letter of \nthe law. Under my bill, it will no longer be acceptable to sell a false \nidentification document in this fashion.\n  Finally, my legislation seeks to encourage more aggressive law \nenforcement by dedicating investigative and prosecutorial resources to \nthis emerging problem. The bill establishes a multiagency task force \nthat will concentrate the investigative and prosecutorial resources of \nseveral agencies with responsibility for enforcing laws that \ncriminalize the manufacture, sale, and distribution of counterfeit \nidentification documents.\n  Our investigation established that Federal law enforcement officials \nhave not devoted the necessary resources and attention to this serious \nproblem. by prosecuting the purveyors of false identification \nmaterials, I believe that ultimately we can reduce end-use crime that \noften depends on the availability of counterfeit identification. For \nexample, the convicted felon who testified at our hearings said that he \nwould not have been able to commit bank fraud had he not been able to \neasily and quickly obtain high-quality fraudulent identification \ndocuments via the Internet. I am confident that if Federal law \nenforcement officials prosecute the most blatant violation of the law, \nthe false ID industry on the Internet will wither in short order.\n  By strengthening the law and by focusing our prosecutorial efforts, I \nbelieve we can curb the widespread availability of false IDs that the \nInternet facilitates. The Director of the U.S. Secret Service testified \nat our hearing that the use of such fraudulent documents and \ncredentials almost always accompanies the serious financial crimes they \ninvestigate. Thus, my hope is that the legislation we are introducing \ntoday will produce a stronger law that will help deter and prevent \ncriminal activity, not only in the manufacture of false IDs but in \nother areas as well.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THURMOND:\n  S. 2925. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish \nan Office of Men's Health; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                        MEN'S HEALTH ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to introduce \nthe Men's Health Act of 2000. This legislation will establish an Office \nof Men's Health within the Department of Health and Human Services to \nmonitor, coordinate, and improve men's health in America.\n  Mr. President, there is an ongoing, increasing and predominantly \nsilent crisis in the health and well-being of men. Due to a lack of \nawareness, poor health education, and culturally induced behavior \npatterns in their work and personal lives, men's health and well-being \nare deteriorating steadily. Heart disease, stroke, and various cancers \ncontinue to be major areas of concern as we look to enhance the quality \nand duration of men's lives. Improved education and preventive \nscreening are imperative to meet this objective.\n  Mr. President, as a lifelong advocate of regular medical exams, daily \nexercise and a balanced diet, I feel strongly that an Office of Men's \nHealth should be established to help improve the overall health of \nAmerica's male population.\n  This legislation is identical to a bill introduced earlier this year \nin the House of Representatives. I invite my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this measure. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the \nbill appear in the Congressional Record immediately following my \nremarks.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2925\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S7665]]\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Men's Health Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) There is a silent health crisis affecting the health \n     and well-being of America's men.\n       (2) This health crisis is of particular concern to men, but \n     is also a concern for women, and especially to those who have \n     fathers, husbands, sons, and brothers.\n       (3) Men's health is likewise a concern for employers who \n     lose productive employees as well as pay the costs of medical \n     care, and is a concern to State government and society which \n     absorb the enormous costs of premature death and disability, \n     including the costs of caring for dependents left behind.\n       (4) The life expectancy gap between men and women has \n     steadily increased from 1 year in 1920 to 7 years in 1990.\n       (5) Almost twice as many men than women die from heart \n     disease, and 28.5 percent of all men die as a result of \n     stroke.\n       (6) In 1995, blood pressure of black males was 356 percent \n     higher than that of white males, and the death rate for \n     stroke was 97 percent higher for black males than for white \n     males.\n       (7) The incidence of stroke among men is 19 percent higher \n     than for women.\n       (8) Significantly more men than women are diagnosed with \n     AIDS each year.\n       (9) Fifty percent more men than women die of cancer.\n       (10) Although the incidence of depression is higher in \n     women, the rate of life-threatening depression is higher in \n     men, with men representing 80 percent of all suicide cases, \n     and with men 43 times more likely to be admitted to \n     psychiatric hospitals than women.\n       (11) Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed \n     cancer in the United States among men, accounting for 36 \n     percent of all cancer cases.\n       (12) An estimated 180,000 men will be newly diagnosed with \n     prostate cancer this year alone, of which 37,000 will die.\n       (13) Prostate cancer rates increase sharply with age, and \n     more than 75 percent of such cases are diagnosed in men age \n     65 and older.\n       (14) The incidence of prostate cancer and the resulting \n     mortality rate in African American men is twice that in white \n     men.\n       (15) Studies show that men are at least 25 percent less \n     likely than women to visit a doctor, and are significantly \n     less likely to have regular physician check-ups and obtain \n     preventive screening tests for serious diseases.\n       (16) Appropriate use of tests such as prostate specific \n     antigen (PSA) exams and blood pressure, blood sugar, and \n     cholesterol screens, in conjunction with clinical exams and \n     self-testing, can result in the early detection of many \n     problems and in increased survival rates.\n       (17) Educating men, their families, and health care \n     providers about the importance of early detection of male \n     health problems can result in reducing rates of mortality for \n     male-specific diseases, as well as improve the health of \n     America's men and its overall economic well-being.\n       (18) Recent scientific studies have shown that regular \n     medical exams, preventive screenings, regular exercise, and \n     healthy eating habits can help save lives.\n       (19) Establishing an Office of Men's Health is needed to \n     investigate these findings and take such further actions as \n     may be needed to promote men's health.\n\n     SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF OFFICE MEN'S HEALTH.\n\n       Title XVII of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300u \n     et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following \n     section:\n\n\n                        ``office of men's health\n\n       ``Sec. 1711. The Secretary shall establish within the \n     Department of Health and Human Services an office to be known \n     as the Office of Men's Health, which shall be headed by a \n     director appointed by the Secretary. The Secretary, acting \n     through the Director of the Office, shall coordinate and \n     promote the status of men's health in the United States.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 2926. A bill a amend title II of the Social Security Act to \nprovide that an individual's entitlement to any benefit thereunder \nshall continue through the month of his or her death (without affecting \nany other person's entitlement to benefits for that month) and that \nsuch individuals' benefit shall be payable for such month only to the \nextent proportionate to the number of days in such month preceding the \ndate of such individual's death; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                 The Social Security Family Relief Act\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Social \nSecurity Family Relief Act, which is legislation designed to both \nrevise current Social Security law and assist families living in New \nMexico and across the United States.\n  For those of my colleagues who are not familiar with this issue, at \npresent the Social Security Administration pays benefits in advance, \nand, thus, a check an individual receives from Social Security \nAdministration during the month is calculated and paid in anticipation \nthat the individual will be alive the entire month in which a payment \nwas received.\n  However, if a person dies during that month, the payment must be \nreimbursed in full to the Social Security Administration. If a person \ndies on the 5th of the month, or the 15th of the month, or the 25th of \nthe month, none of this matters. If they die, they are no longer \nentitled to any benefits for that month, period. Furthermore, if a \nsurviving spouse or family member uses a check received from the Social \nSecurity Administration for that month in which a family member had \ndied, they must send it back--in full--to the Social Security \nAdministration.\n  Let me make this clear that this is not just a problem in the \nabstract. Indeed, the introduction of this bill is prompted by a very \nreal experience faced by a family living in New Mexico. In this case, a \nconstituent had a close relative pass away on December 31, 1999. The \nlast day of the month. Not knowing it ran contrary to Social Security \nlaw, the family used the relative's last Social Security check to pay \nher final expenses. Only after these activities had occurred did they \nreceive a letter from the Social Security Administration stating that \nthey would have to return the check. Not just partial payment, but in \nfull. No recognition on the part of the Social Security Administration \nthat this person was alive for the entire month. No recognition on the \npart of the Social Security Administration that this person had \nexpenses that had to be paid for after they had died. No recognition on \nthe part of the Social Security Administration that the surviving \nrelatives had their own bills to pay, and that this additional expense \nimposed a burden on them that was difficult to manage.\n  My constituents found this to absurd. Why, they asked, should they \nhave to return a check for a relative that was alive, was accumulating \nexpenses while she was alive, and deserved the money that was provided \nto her? Why, they asked, should they be required to pay for the \nrelative's expenses when money should be available? Why should their \nemotional suffering be made all the more distressful by the addition of \nfinancial obligations not of their own making?\n  I think these are good questions, and it is logical that Congress \naddress them directly and in a manner that solves the problem at hand. \nFrom what I can see, they are right. Individuals that have worked over \nthe years and have paid into the Social Security Trust Fund all that \ntime, these folks have earned Social Security benefits and should \nreceive them in full for the period that they are alive. As such, \nSocial Security law should be written in such a way that allows the \nsurviving spouse or family member to use the final check to take care \nof the remaining expenses, whether they be utilities, or mortgages, or \ncar payments, or health care, or whatever needs to be taken care of.\n  But although my constituents are sometimes critical of the Social \nSecurity Administration on this issue, in fairness that agency did not \ncreate this problem, Congress did. We wrote the law, and the Social \nSecurity Administration merely implements it. Any responsibility for \nwhat is happening belongs to us. We need to fix the law so the Social \nSecurity Administration can do its job better.\n  It is my understanding that this issue has been discussed in the past \nby a number of Senators, but the revisions have gone nowhere because \nsome felt it would impose an administrative burden on the Social \nSecurity Administration. I find this argument to be unconvincing as we \nclearly find a way to calculate complex equations that ultimately \nbenefit that agency. There are those that now argue that tracking down \nappropriate beneficiaries would be difficult. But I find this to be \nquite unconvincing as well--after all, we do it already when someone \ndies. Surely there is a way to make the changes necessary. Surely the \ntechnology and expertise already exists. Surely it is time to stop \nmaking excuses and do what is right for Americans and their families.\n  The legislation I am introducing today is easy to understand. The \nlegislation says, quite simply, that an individual's entitlement to \nSocial Security benefits shall continue through the month of his or her \ndeath, and after\n\n[[Page S7666]]\n\nthat individual's death, the entitlement shall be calculated in a \nmanner proportionate to the days he or she was still alive. In other \nwords, we are using a method of pro-rating to calculate what portion of \nthe entitlement that individual will receive for the last month. Then, \ninstead of being asked to return that final check, the surviving spouse \nor appropriate surviving family members will receive a check, which can \nthen be used to settle the decedent's remaining expenses. I think this \nis a perfectly fair and reasonable approach to solving the problem at \nhand. And I think it is long overdue.\n  It is my understanding that another bill addressing this problem has \nbeen introduced in the Senate by my colleague Senator Mikulski. \nFurthermore, she has introduced this legislation for several years in a \nrow. I commend her for her awareness of this problem and her ongoing \nefforts to fix it.\n  That said, it is also my understanding that her bill as written \ncalculates these entitlement benefits on a half-month basis. In other \nwords, if you die before the 15th, you get benefits for a half a month. \nIf you die after the 15th, you are entitled to benefits for the entire \nmonth. To be honest, I see no obvious rationale for addressing the \nproblem in this way, and I find a pro-rate strategy to be far more \ncompelling. But this said, I look forward to working with her and her \nco-sponsors to repair the problem. We clearly have the same concerns.\n  Mr. President, let me state in conclusion that this legislation \nrepresents only a partial fix of the current Social Security system. \nThere is no doubt in my mind that much more needs to be done. We have \ntalked about the issues far too long, and it is time to make a serious \neffort to make the Social Security solvent and effective. If had my \nway, this effort would begin tomorrow. But since it is not, this \nlegislation can be considered one small but very important step on the \npath to reform.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation \nbe included in the Record at the conclusion of my statement.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2926\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to ensure that the incarceration of inmates is not \nprovided by private contractors or vendors and that persons charged or \nconvicted of an offense against the United States shall be housed in \nfacilities managed and maintained by Federal, State, or local \ngovernments; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                         THE PUBLIC SAFETY ACT\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, sending inmates to prisons built and run \nby prviate companies has become a popular way to deal with overcrowded \nprisons, but in recent years this practice has been appropriately \ncriticized. As reports of escapes, riots, prisoner violence, and abuse \nby staff in private prisons increase, many have questioned the wisdom \nand propriety of private companies carrying out this essential state \nfunction. After considering safety, cost, and accountability issues, it \nis clear that private companies should not be doing this public work. \nGovernment and only government, whether it's federal, state, or local, \nshould operate prisons. That is why I rise today to introduce a bill \nthat will restore responsibility for housing prisoners to the state and \nfederal government, where it belongs. An identical bill was introduced \nin the House of Representatives by Congressman Ted Strickland, where it \nhas received broad bi-partisan support and currently has 141 \ncosponsors.\n  Private prison companies, and proponents of their use, claim that \nthey save taxpayers money. They claim private companies can do the \ngovernment's business more efficiently, but this has never been \nconfirmed. In fact, two government studies show that it is far from \nclear whether private prisons save taxpayer money. One study, completed \nby the GAO, stated that it could not conclude whether or not \nprivatization saved money. The second study, completed by the Federal \nBureau of Prisons in 1998, concluded that there is no strong evidence \nto show states save money by using private prisons.\n  More importantly, private prison companies are motivated by one goal: \nmaking a profit. Decisions by these companies are driven by the desire \nto make a profit and, in turn, please officers and shareholders. This \nprofit motive in the context of housing criminals is wrong. It is at \ncross-purposes with the government's goal of punishing and \nrehabilitating criminals.\n  So what happens when a private company runs a prison? The prisons \nhave promised to save taxpayers money, so they cut costs. This \ninvariably results in unqualified, low paid employees, poor facilities \nand living conditions, and an inadequate number of educational and \nrehabilitative programs. Recent episodes of escape, violence, and \nprisoner abuse demonstrate what happens when corners are cut.\n  At the Northeast Ohio Correctional facility, a private prison in \nYoungstown, Ohio, 20 inmates were stabbed, two of them fatally, within \na 10-month period. After management claimed they had addressed the \nproblems, six inmates, four convicted of homicide, escaped by cutting \nthrough two razor wire fences in the middle of the afternoon.\n  At a private prison in Whiteville, Tennessee, which houses many \ninmates from my home state of Wisconsin, there has been a hostage \nsituation, an assault of a guard, and a coverup to hide physical abuse \nof inmates by prison guards. A security report at the same Tennessee \nprison found unsecured razors, inmates obstructing views into their \ncells by covering up windows, and an inmate using a computer lab \nstrictly labeled, ``staff only'' without any supervision.\n  At a private prison in Sayre, Oklahoma, a dangerous inmate uprising \njeopardized the security and control of the facility. As a result, the \nstate of Oklahoma removed all its inmates from the facility and \nquestioned its safety. Because the prison gets paid based on the number \nof inmates, however, the prison continued to request, and other states \nsent, hundreds of inmates to be housed there.\n  Earlier this year the Justice Department filed a lawsuit against the \nWackenhut Corrections Corporation, the second largest private prison \ncompany in the United States, charging that in one of its juvenile \nprisons, conditions were ``dangerous and life threatening.'' A group of \nexperts who toured the prison reported that many of the juveniles were \nshort of food, had lost weight, and did not have shoes or blankets. The \nDepartment of Justice lawsuit also alleges that inmates did not receive \nadequate mental health care or educational programming. In addition to \nthe poor conditions and lack of training, the guards physically abused \nthe boys and threw gas grenades into their barracks. Some juvenile \ninmates even tried to commit suicide or deliberately injure themselves \nso they would be sent to the infirmary to avoid abuse by the guards.\n  Mr. President, the profit motive clearly has a dangerous and harmful \neffect on the security of private prisons, but the profit motive also \nshortchanges inmates of the rehabilitation, education, and training \nthat they need. Private prisons get paid based on the number of inmates \nthey house. This means the more inmates they accept and the fewer \nservices they provide, the more money they make. A high crime rate \nmeans more business and eliminates any motivation to provide job \ntraining, education, and other rehabilitative programs. These \nallegations of abuse and the negative effects of the profit motive are \nespecially troubling because they have a disparate impact on the \nminority community, which has been incarcerated disproportionately in \nrecent years particularly with the rise of mandatory minimum sentences \nfor drug offenses.\n  Another issue of concern is accountability for dispensing one of the \nstrongest punishments our society can impose. Incarceration requires a \ngovernment to exercise its coercive police powers over individuals, \nincluding the authority to take away a person's freedom and to use \nforce. This authority to use force should not be delegated to a private \ncompany that is not accountable to the people. This premise was \nreinforced by the Supreme Court in Richardson v. McKnight, which held \nthat private prison personnel are not covered by the qualified immunity \nthat shields state and local correctional officers. This means that a \nstate or local government could be held liable for the actions of a \nprivate corporation.\n  Mr. President, the legislation I introduce today, the Public Safety \nAct, addresses these concerns. It restores control and management of \nprisons to the government. It makes federal grants under Title II of \nthe Crime Control Act of 1994 contingent upon states agreeing not to \ncontract with any private companies to provide core correctional \nservices related to transportation or incarceration of inmates. The \nlegislation was carefully crafted to apply only to core correctional \nservices meaning that private companies can still provide auxiliary \nservices such as food or clothing.\n  Mr. President, let us restore safety and security to the many \nAmericans who work in prisons. Let us protect the communities that \nsupport prisons. And let us ensure rehabilitation and safety for the \nindividuals, including young boys and girls, who are housed there. This \nbill returns to the government the function of being the sole \nadministrator of incarceration as punishment in our society. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me as cosponsors of the Public Safety Act.\n  I ask that the text of the bill be placed in the Record following \nthis statement.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2927\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S7668]]\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Public Safety Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The issues of safety, liability, accountability, and \n     cost are the paramount issues in running corrections \n     facilities.\n       (2) In recent years, the privatization of facilities for \n     persons previously incarcerated by governmental entities has \n     resulted in frequent escapes by violent criminals, riots \n     resulting in extensive damage, prisoner violence, and \n     incidents of prisoner abuse by staff.\n       (3) In some instances, the courts have prohibited the \n     transfer of additional convicts to private prisons because of \n     the danger to prisoners and the community.\n       (4) Frequent escapes and riots at private facilities result \n     in expensive law enforcement costs for State and local \n     governments.\n       (5) The need to make profits creates incentives for private \n     contractors to underfund mechanisms that provide for the \n     security of the facility and the safety of the inmates, \n     corrections staff, and neighboring community.\n       (6) The 1997 Supreme Court ruling in Richardson v. McKnight \n     that the qualified immunity that shields State and local \n     correctional officers does not apply to private prison \n     personnel, and therefore exposes State and local governments \n     to liability for the actions of private corporations.\n       (7) Additional liability issues arise when inmates are \n     transferred outside the jurisdiction of the contracting \n     State.\n       (8) Studies on private correctional facilities have been \n     unable to demonstrate any significant cost savings in the \n     privatization of corrections facilities.\n       (9) The imposition of punishment on errant citizens through \n     incarceration requires State and local governments to \n     exercise their coercive police powers over individuals. These \n     powers, including the authority to use force over a private \n     citizen, should not be delegated to another private party.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to protect the privacy of consumers who use the \nInternet; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n             the consumer internet privacy enhancement act\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues from \nMassachusetts, Michigan, and California to introduce the Consumer \nInternet Privacy Enhancement Act. The purpose of this legislation is \nsimple. We want to ensure that commercial websites inform consumers \nabout how their personal information is treated, and give consumers \nmeaningful choices about the use of that information. While the purpose \nof this legislation is simple, the task my colleagues and I are seeking \nto accomplish is complex and difficult.\n  The Internet is a tremendous medium spurring the world's economy and \nallowing people to communicate in ways that were unimaginable a few \nshort years ago. The Internet revolution is transforming our lives and \nour economy at an incredible pace. Like any other technological \nrevolution it promises great opportunities and, it presents new \nconcerns and fears.\n  Chief among those concerns is the ability of the Internet to further \nerode individual privacy. Since the beginning of commerce, business has \nsought to learn more about consumers. The ability of the internet to \naid business in the collection, storage, transfer, and analysis of \ninformation about a consumer's habits is unprecedented. While this \ntechnology can allow business to better target goods and services, it \nalso has increased consumer fears about the collection and use of \npersonally identifiable information.\n  Since 1998, the Federal Trade Commission has examined this issue in a \nseries of reports to Congress. The FTC and privacy organizations formed \nby industry identified ``four fair information practices'' which should \nbe utilized by websites that collect personally identifiable \ninformation. In simple terms, these practices are notice of what \ninformation is collected and how it is used; choice as to how that \ninformation is used; access by the user to information collected about \nthem; and appropriate measures to ensure the security of the \ninformation.\n  Over the last three years industry has worked diligently to develop \nand implement privacy policies utilizing the four fair information \npractices. While industry has made progress in providing consumers with \nsome form of notice of their information practices, there is much work \nto be done to improve the depth and clarity of privacy policies.\n  The legislation we introduce today should not be viewed as a failure \non the part of industry to address privacy. Instead industry's efforts \nover the past few years have driven the development of standards which \nserve as the model for this legislation. Our objective is to provide \nfor enforceable standards to ensure that all websites provide consumers \nwith clear and conspicuous notice and meaningful choices about how \ntheir information is used.\n\n  Currently, some websites have privacy policies that are confusing and \nmake it difficult for consumers to restrict the use of information. \nDuring a recent hearing before the Senate Commerce Committee, the \nChairman of the Federal Trade Commission--a former dean of Georgetown \nLaw School--expressed his own difficulties in understanding some \nprivacy policies.\n  Privacy is harmed not enhanced when consumers are lost in a fog of \nlegalese. Some current privacy policies confuse and contradict rather \nthan provide clear and conspicuous notice of a consumer's rights.\n  The bill my colleagues and I introduce today attempts to end some of \nthis confusion by providing for enforceable standards that will both \nprotect consumers and allow for the continued growth of e-commerce. \nSpecifically, the bill would require websites to provide clear and \nconspicuous notice of their information practices. It also requires \nwebsites to provide consumers with an easy method to limit the use and \ndisclosure of information.\n  The provisions of the bill are enforceable by the FTC. States \nAttorneys General could also bring suits in federal court under the Act \nusing a mechanism similar to the Telemarketing Sales Rule. We also \npropose a civil penalty of $22,000 per violation with a maximum fine of \n$500,000. Currently, the FTC can only seek civil penalties if an \nindividual or business is under an order for past behavior.\n  The legislation also preempts state law to ensure that the law \ngoverning the collection of personally identifiable information is \nuniform. Finally, the bill would direct the National Academy of \nSciences to conduct a study of privacy to examine the collection of \npersonal information in the offline-world as well as methods to provide \nconsumers with access to information collected by them.\n  Despite our best efforts I recognize this bill does not address all \nof the\n\n[[Page S7669]]\n\nissues affecting online privacy. As I said earlier, this is a complex \nand difficult issue. Other related concerns that should be addressed \nwill continue to arise as we consider this measure. For example, the \nsale of data during bankruptcy, the use of software also known as \nspyware that can transfer personal information while online without the \nuser's consent or knowledge, and the government's use and dissemination \nof personally identifiable information online.\n  Additionally, other new ways to help resolve the issue of online \nprivacy will also arise as we consider this measure. These include the \ndeployment of technology that will enable consumers to protect their \nprivacy is one issue we should expect to address. Another issue is the \nuse of verifiable assessment procedures to ensure that websites are \nfollowing their posted privacy policies.\n  The discovery of new issues and new solutions as we move through this \nprocess will serve to highlight the difficulty and complexity of \ndealing with this issue. It is not my intention to rush to judgment on \nthese matters. Instead, I firmly believe the best way to protect \nconsumers and provide for the continued growth of e-commerce is to give \nprivacy careful and thoughtful deliberation before we act.\n  Mr. President, it is clear that businesses should inform consumers in \na clear and conspicuous manner about how they treat personal \ninformation and give consumers meaningful choices as to how that \ninformation is used. While some of us may disagree on the manner in \nwhich we meet this goal, we all agree that it must be done. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues and addressing their concerns as \nwe move through the legislative process.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print the full text of the \nbill in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2928\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators McCain, Boxer \nand Abraham in announcing that today we will be introducing a bill that \ntakes a positive, balanced approach to the issue of Internet privacy. \nThere can be no doubt that consumers have a legitimate expectation of \nprivacy on the Internet. Our bill protects that interest. At the same \ntime, consumers want an Internet that is free. For that to happen, the \nInternet, like television, must be supported by advertising. Our bill \nwill allow companies to continue to advertise, ensuring that we\n\n[[Page S7671]]\n\ndon't have a subscription-based Internet, which would limit everyone's \nonline activities and contribute to a digital divide.\n  If we recognize that the economy of the Internet calls for \nadvertising, we must also recognize that it won't attract consumers if \nthey believe their privacy is being violated. Finding this fine balance \nof permitting enough free flow of information to allow ads to work and \nprotecting consumers' privacy is going to be critical if the Internet \nis going to reach its full potential. And I believe this bill strikes \nthe right balance.\n  I think all of the bill's cosponsors were hopeful that self-\nregulation of Internet privacy would work. And I think self-regulation \nstill has an important role to play. But it seems that now it is up to \nCongress to establish a floor for Internet privacy. I have no doubt \nthat many innovative high tech companies and advertisers will go beyond \nthe regulations for notice and choice we provide here. A number of \ncompanies in my home state of Massachusetts already do, providing \nconsumers with anonymity when they go online. I applaud and encourage \nthose efforts and am certain that if Congress enacts this bill, they \nwill continue.\n  But technology and innovation won't address all the concerns people \nhave about Internet privacy. Congress has the responsibility to ensure \nthat core privacy principles are the norm throughout the online world. \nWe need to respond to the consumers who don't shop on the Internet \nbecause they are concerned about their privacy. This is necessary not \nonly for the sake of the consumers, but for every online business that \nwants to grow and attract customers.\n  The bill that we are introducing today will encourage those skeptical \nconsumers to go online. This legislation will require Web sites to \nclearly and conspicuously disclose their privacy policies. People \ndeserve to know what information may be collected and how it may be \nused so that they can make an informed decision before they navigate \naround or shop on a particular Web site. They shouldn't have to click \nfive times and need to translate legalese before they know what a site \nwill do with their personal information. Requiring disclosure has the \nadded benefit of providing the FTC with an enforcement mechanism. If a \nWeb site fails to comply with its posted disclosure policy, the FTC can \nbring an action against it for unfair or deceptive acts. This is the \nbare minimum of what I believe consumers deserve and expect, and I \ndon't think this would have any unintended or negative consequences on \ne-commerce.\n  In addition, this bill addresses the core principle of choice by \nrequiring Web sites to offer consumers an easy to use method to prevent \nWeb sites from using personally identifiable information for marketing \npurposes and to prevent them from selling that information to third \nparties. This bill empowers consumers and lets them make informed \ndecisions that are right for them.\n  By ensuring consumers have the right to full disclosure and the right \nto not have their personally identifiable information sold or \ndisclosed, this bill addresses the most fundamental concerns many \npeople have about online privacy. But I believe there are still a \nnumber of important questions that we need to answer. The first is \nwhether there is a difference between privacy in the offline and online \nworlds.\n  Most of us hardly think about it when we go to the supermarket, but \nwhen Safeway or Giant scans my discount card or my credit card, it has \na record of exactly who I am and what I bought. Should my preferences \nat the supermarket be any more or less protected than the choices I \nmake online?\n  Likewise, catalog companies compile and use offline information to \nmake marketing decisions. These companies rent lists compiled by list \nbrokers. The list brokers obtain marketing data and names from the \npublic domain and governments, credit bureaus, financial institutions, \ncredit card companies, retail establishments, and other catalogers and \nmass mailers.\n  On the other hand, when I go to the shopping mall and look at five \ndifferent sweaters but don't buy any of them, no one has a record of \nthat. If I do the same thing online, technology can record how long I \nlinger over an item, even if I don't buy it. Likewise, I can pick up \nany book in a book store and pay in cash and no one will ever know my \nreading preferences. That type of anonymity can be completely lost \nonline.\n  This bill requires the National Research Council to study the issue \nof online versus offline privacy, and make a recommendation if there is \na need for additional legislation in either area.\n  Likewise, this bill requires the Council to study the issue of \naccess. While there is general agreement that consumers should have \naccess to information they provided to a Web site, we still don't know \nwhether it's necessary or proper for consumers to have access to all of \nthe information gathered about an individual. Should consumers have \naccess to click-stream data or so-called derived data by which a \ncompany uses compiled information to make a marketing decision about \nthe consumer? And if we decide consumers need some access to this type \nof information, is it technology feasible? Will there be unforeseen or \nunintended consequences such as an increased risk of security breaches? \nWill there be less, rather than more privacy due to the necessary \ncoupling of names and data? I don't we are ready to regulate until we \nhave some consensus on this issue.\n  Finally, it is important to add that this bill in no way limits what \nCongress has done or hopefully will do with respect to a person's \nhealth or financial information. When sensitive information is \ncollected, it is even more important that stringent privacy protections \nare in place. I have supported a number of legislative efforts that \nwould go far to protect this type of information.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I rise to join with the Senator \nfrom Arizona, the Senator from Massachusetts, and the Senator from \nCalifornia in introducing the Consumer Privacy Enhancement Act. This \nlegislation will provide Americans with some basic--but critically \nimportant--protections for their personal information when they are \nonline.\n  Privacy has always been a very serious issue to American citizens. It \nis a concept enshrined in our Bill of Rights. As persons from all walks \nof life become increasingly reliant on computers and the Internet to \nperform everyday tasks, it is incumbent upon policymakers to ensure \nthat adequate privacy protections exist for consumers. We must ensure \nthat our laws evolve along with technology and continue to provide \neffective privacy protection for consumers surfing the World Wide Web \nand using the Internet for commercial activities.\n  The American people are letting it be known that they have mounting \nconcerns about their vulnerability in this digital age. They are very \nconcerned about the advent of this new high-tech era we've entered and \nthe new threats it potentially poses to our personal privacy. And I \nbelieve there is a consensus building in Congress to begin to tackle \nthe question of ensuring adequate privacy protections for individuals \nusing the Internet.\n  Whether we can find a similar consensus on a particular legislative \nproposal remains to be seen. However, I think it is imperative that we \nbegin to address this topic now and not simply wait until Congress \nreconvenes next year before we take the issue up. So I have joined my \ncolleagues here in introducing legislation that I think accomplishes \nseveral important objectives.\n  The most important provision, I believe, is its most elemental \nconcept: We require that before consumers are asked to provide personal \ninformation about themselves, they must be given an opportunity to \nreview the website's privacy policy in order to learn how their \ninformation will be utilized. While many websites have privacy \npolicies, including the vast majority of those websites receiving the \nmost traffic, there are still many websites out there that do not offer \nprivacy policies or adequate protections for consumers.\n  In addition, many of the privacy policies that do exist are very \nlengthy and often quite confusing to consumers. There are pages and \npages of ambiguous legalese and often seemingly contradictory claims \nabout how protected your information truly is. So our bill also calls \non the Federal Trade Commission to ensure that privacy policies\n\n[[Page S7672]]\n\nare ``clear, conspicuous, and easily understood,'' and that any consent \nmechanisms shall be ``easy to use, easily accessible, and shall be \navailable online.''\n  Finally, this legislation recognizes the importance of allowing the \nInternet industry to continue to promote greater self-regulation and to \ndevelop new technology means for to continue to evolve and to help us \naddress legitimate consumer privacy concerns. There have been several \ninitiatives undertaken by industry leaders to get websites to develop \nand post privacy policies and to give consumers the option of when to \nprovide information and for what uses. This legislation is designed to \nallow such efforts to continue and to provide for technological \nadvances in the area of privacy to benefit consumers. For instance, \nFord and other companies have been participating in the Privacy \nLeadership Initiative whereby companies engaged online are working to \nestablish industry guidelines and protocols for protecting consumers \nprivacy. Nothing we do here today should inhibit such industry efforts.\n  So with those critical features addressed, I believe the legislation \nwe introduce today will be an important stepping stone along the path \nof ensuring that Americans can be confident of having their personal \ninformation will be protected when they go online.\n  I urge my colleagues to review this legislation and to support our \nefforts to protect consumers against unwarranted intrusions into their \npersonal privacy when they are using their computers and surfing the \nInternet.\n  I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Hollings, and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 2929. A bill to establish a demonstration project to increase \nteacher salaries and employee benefits for teachers who enter into \ncontracts with local educational agencies to serve as master teachers; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                       master teacher legislation\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today Senators Hollings, Inouye, and I \nare introducing a bill to create a demonstration grant program to help \nschool districts create master teacher positions.\n  Our bill authorizes $50 million for a five-year demonstration program \nunder which the Secretary of Education would award competitive grants \nto school districts to create master teacher positions. Federal funds \nwould be equally matched by states and local governments so that $100 \nmillion total would be available. Under the bill, 5,000 master teacher \npositions could be created, or 100 per State, if each master teacher \nwere paid $20,000 on top of the current average teacher's salary.\n  As defined in this amendment, a master teacher is one who is \ncredentialed; has a least five years of teaching experience; is judged \nto be an excellent teacher by administrators and teachers who are \nknowledgeable about the individual's performance; and is currently \nteaching; and enters into a contract and agrees to serve at least five \nmore years.\n  The master teacher would help other teachers to improve instruction, \nstrengthen other teachers' skills, mentor lesser experienced teachers, \ndevelop curriculum, and provide other professional development.\n  The intent of this bill is for districts to pay each master teacher \nup to $20,000 on top of his or her regular salary. Nationally, the \naverage teacher salary is $40,582. In California, it is $44,585. \nElementary school principals receive $64,653 on average nationally and \n$72,385 in California. The thrust of the master teacher concept in this \nbill is to pay teachers a salary closer to that of an administrator to \nkeep good teachers in teaching.\n  The bill requires State and/or local districts to match federal funds \ndollar for dollar. It requires the U.S. Department of Education to give \npriority to school districts with a high proportion of economically \ndisadvantaged students and to ensure that grants are awarded to a wide \nrange of districts in terms of the size and location of the school \ndistrict, the ethnic and economic composition of students, and the \nexperience of the districts' teachers.\n  There are several reasons we need this bill.\n\n\n                       new teachers need support\n\n  First, new teachers face overwhelming responsibilities and challenges \nin their first year, but in the real world, they get little guidance. \nWhen first-year teachers enter the classroom, there is typically little \nhelp available to them, in a year that will have a profound impact on \nthe rest of their professional career. They are ``out there alone,'' \nvirtually isolated in their classroom, thrown into an unfamiliar school \nand classroom with a room full of new faces. By the current sink-or-\nswim method, new teachers often find themselves ill equipped to deal \nwith the educational and disciplinary tasks of their first year.\n  In California, 23 percent of teachers in kindergarten through the \nthird grade are novices. Furthermore, we have 30,000 inexperienced \nteachers on emergency credentials in California, over ten percent of \nour teaching workforce.\n  A new teacher can get experienced guidance from a master teacher who \nis paired with the new teacher. The master teacher can help plan \nlessons, improve instructional methods, and deal with discipline \nproblems. ``If you're [a master teacher] teaching a class, then you can \nsay, `last week I handled a discipline problem this way.' It's much \nmore credible.'' said Carl O'Connell, a New York mentor teacher.\n\n\n                   enhancing the teaching profession\n\n  Second, master teacher programs can bring more prestige to teaching \nas a profession, by increasing the teacher's salary, by rewarding \nexperience, and by giving teachers opportunities to supervise others. A \nmaster teacher designation is a way to recognize outstanding ability \nand performance. A master teacher position can give teachers a \nprofessional goal, a higher level to pursue. A 1996 report by the \nNational Commission for Teaching and America's Future said that \ncreating new career paths for teachers is one of the best ways to give \neducators the respect they deserve and to ensure that proven teaching \nmethods spread quickly and broadly.\n  In one survey of teachers which asked which factors make teachers \nstay in teaching, 79 percent of teachers said that respect for the \nteaching profession is needed in order to retain qualified teachers. \nEighty percent said that formal mentoring programs for beginning \nteachers is key (Scholastic/Chief State School Officers' Teacher Voices \nSurvey, 2000). Over 70 percent of teachers said that more planning time \nwith peers is needed to keep teachers in the classroom. This amendment \nshould help.\n\n\n                 improving retention, reducing turnover\n\n  Because of the higher pay and enhanced prestige, a master teacher \nprogram can help to recruit and retain teachers. Mentor systems provide \nnew teachers with a support network, someone to turn to. Studies \nindicate higher retention rates among new teachers who participate in \nmentoring programs. According to Yvonne Gold of California State \nUniversity-Long Beach, 25 percent of beginning teachers do not teach \nmore than two years and nearly 40 percent leave in the first five \nyears. In the Rochester, New York, system, the teacher retention rate \nwas nearly double the national average five years after establishing a \nmentoring program.\n  As Jay Matthews wrote in the May 16 Washington Post, programs like \nthis ``can provide a large boost to the profession's image for a \nrelatively small amount of money.'' These programs can keep good \nteachers in the classroom, instead of losing them to school \nadministration or industry. Larkspur, California, School Superintendent \nBarbara Wilson says she is ``witnessing a steady exodus to dotcom and \nother, more lucrative industries.'' (San Francisco Chronicle, March 26, \n2000).\n  Higher salaries and prestige for master teachers could deter the \ndrain from the classrooms.\n\n\n                      holding teachers accountable\n\n  Another reason for this amendment is that teacher mentoring programs \ncan make teacher performance more accountable. A master teacher can \nhelp novice teachers improve their teaching and get better student \nachievement. ``Teachers cannot be held accountable for knowledge based, \nclient-oriented decisions if they do not have access to knowledge, as \nwell as opportunities for consultation and evaluation of their work,'' \nsaid Adam Urbanski, President of the Rochester, New York, Teachers\n\n[[Page S7673]]\n\nAssociation. He went on: ``Unsatisfactory teacher performance often \nstems from inadequate and incompetent supervision. Administrators often \nlack the training and the resources to supervise teachers and improve \nthe performance of those who are in serious trouble.''\n  Good teachers are key to learning. Lower math test scores have been \ncorrelated with the percentage of math teachers on emergency permits \nand higher math test scores were linked both to the teachers' \nqualifications and to their years of teaching experience, according to \n``Professional Development for Teachers, 2000.''\n\n\n                        california would benefit\n\n  This bill could be very helpful in California where one-fifth of our \nteachers will leave the profession in three years, according to an \narticle in the February 9, 2000, Los Angeles Times.\n  California will need 300,000 new teachers by 2010. ``More students to \nteach, smaller classes, teachers leaving or retiring means that \nCalifornia school districts are now having to hire a record 26,000 new \nteachers each year,'' says the report, ``Teaching and California's \nFuture, 2000.'' California's enrollment is growing at three times the \nnational rate. With these kinds of demands, understaffing often leads \nto under qualified and new teachers entering the classroom. We have to \ndo all we can to attract and retain good teachers.\n\n\n                  examples of master teacher programs\n\n  California has instituted several programs along these lines. \nCalifornia has a program to help beginning teachers. It has grown from \n$5 million (supporting 1,100 new teachers in 1992) to nearly $72 \nmillion (serving 23,000 new teachers in 1999-2000). But even with this \nincrease, the program still does not serve all new teachers,'' \naccording to the report, Teaching and California's Future, 2000.\n  The Rochester City, New York, school system has a Peer Assistance and \nReview Program, begun by the schools and the Rochester Teacher \nAssociation. The Rochester program is working. ``The evaluation is \nabsolutely spectacular. The program has been a terrific success. It has \nbeen deemed a success by mentors, by the panel, by the district, by the \nunion, and, most importantly, by the interns themselves,'' reported the \nnewspaper, New York Teacher.\n  Delaware provides mentors for beginning teachers. ``Not only are \nbeginning teachers receiving the support they need, but the mentoring \nprogram is also developing networks among teachers within districts and \nacross the state, and the mentors have `a new enthusiasm' for \nteaching,'' as reported in ``Promising Practices'' in 1998.\n  Columbus, Ohio, schools instituted a Peer Assessment and Review \nprogram similar to Rochester's. It has two components: the intern \nprogram for all newly hired teachers and the intervention program for \nteachers who are having difficulties in the classroom teaching. \nAccording to the State Education Agency, ``the district has a lower \nrate of attrition than similar districts because of PAR.'' (Promising \nPractices, 1998).\n  The funds provided in this bill can supplement and expand existing \nState programs and help other States start new programs.\n\n\n                        students are the winners\n\n  The true beneficiaries of master teacher programs are the students \nand that is, or course, our fundamental goal. As stated in Rochester's \nteaching manual, the goal is ``to improve student outcomes by \ndeveloping and maintaining the highest quality of teaching, providing \nteachers with career options that do not require them to leave teaching \nto assume additional responsibilities and leadership roles.''\n  I believe this bill can begin to provide teachers the real \nprofessional support they need, can attract and retain teachers and can \nbring to the profession the prestige it deserves.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in support of this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 2931. A bill to make improvements to the Arctic Research and \nPolicy Act of 1984; to the Committee on Government Affairs.\n\n\n       improvements to the arctic research and policy act of 1984\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation \nto improve the operation of the Arctic Research and Policy Act. We have \nabout 15 years of experience with this Act, and the time has come to \nmake some modifications to reflect the experience we have gained over \nthat time.\n  The most important feature of this bill is contained in Section 4. \nThis section authorizes the Arctic Research Commission, a Presidential \nCommission, to make grants for scientific research. Currently, the \nCommission can make recommendations and set priorities, but it cannot \nmake grants. Our experience with the Act and the Commission has shown \nus that research needs that do not fit neatly in a single agency do not \nget funded, even if they are compelling priorities.\n  One example is a proposed Arctic contamination initiative that was \ndeveloped a few years ago after we discovered that pollutants from the \nFormer Soviet Union--including radionuclides, heavy metals and \npersistent organic pollutants--were working their way into the Arctic \nenvironment. It became clear that the job of monitoring and evaluating \nthe threat was too big for any single agency. The Interior Department, \ngiven its vast land management responsibilities in Alaska, was \ninterested. The Commerce Department, given the jurisdiction over \nfisheries issues, was interested. The Department of Health and Human \nServices, given its concern about the health of Alaska's indigenous \npeoples, was interested. The only agency that didn't seem interested in \nthe problem, strangely enough, was the EPA, which at the time was in \nthe process of dismantling its Arctic Contaminants program.\n  Unfortunately, because the job was too big for any single agency, it \nwas difficult to get the level of interagency cooperation necessary for \na coordinated program. Moreover, agencies were unwilling to make a \nsignificant budgetary commitment to a program that wasn't under their \nexclusive control. If the Arctic Research Commission, which recognized \nthe need, had some funding of its own to leverage agency participation \nand help to coordinate the effort, we would know far more about the \nArctic contaminants problem than we do today.\n  Another example is the compelling need to understand the Bering Sea \necosystem. Over the past 20 years we have seen significant shifts in \nsome of the populations comprising this ecosystem. King crab \npopulations have declined sharply. Pollock populations have increased \nsharply. Steller sea lion populations have declined as have many types \nof sea birds. Scientists cannot tell us whether these population shifts \nare due to abiotic factors such as climate change, biotic factors such \nas predator-prey relationships, or some combination of both. Because \nthe nation depends on this area for a significant portion of all its \nseafood, this is not an issue without stakeholders. Despite the chorus \nof interests and federal agencies that have said research is needed, a \ncoordinated effort has not yet occurred. If the Arctic Research \nCommission, which recognized this need early on, had some funding of \nits own to leverage agency participation and help to coordinate the \neffort, we would know far more about the Bering Sea ecosystem than we \ndo today.\n  This bill also makes a number of other minor changes in the Act:\n  Section 2 allows the Chairperson of the Commission to receive \ncompensation for up to 120 days per year rather than the 90 days per \nyear currently allowed by the Act. The Chairperson has a major role to \nplay in interacting with the Legislative and Executive branches of the \ngovernment, representing the Commission to non-governmental \norganizations, in interacting with the State of Alaska, and serving in \ninternational fora. In the past, chairpersons have been unable to fully \ndischarge their responsibilities in the 90 day limit specified in the \nAct.\n  Section 3 authorizes the Commission to award an annual award not to \nexceed $1,000 to recognize either outstanding research or outstanding \nefforts in support of research in the Arctic. The ability to give \nmodest awards will bring recognition to outstanding efforts in Arctic \nResearch which, in turn, will help to stimulate research in the Arctic \nregion. This section also specifies that a current or former Commission \nmember is not eligible to receive the award.\n\n[[Page S7674]]\n\n  Section 5 authorizes official representative and reception \nactivities. Because the Commission is not authorized to use fund for \nthese kinds of activities, the Commission has experienced embarrassment \nwhen they were unable to reciprocate after their foreign counterparts \nhosted a reception or lunch on their behalf. Under this provision, the \nCommission may spend not more than two tenths of one percent of its \nbudget for representation and reception activities in each fiscal year.\n  Mr. President, the Arctic Research and Policy Act and the Arctic \nResearch Commission has worked well over the past 15 years. It can work \neven better with these modest changes. I look forward to working with \nmy colleagues to enact this bill as soon as possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NICKLES:\n  S. 2933. A bill to amend provisions of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 \nrelating to remedial action of uranium and thorium processing sites; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n          to amend provisions of the energy policy act of 1992\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to amend \nprovisions of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 relating to remedial action \nof active uranium and thorium processing sites. On October 24, 1992, \nPresident Bush signed the National Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT) \ninto law. Title X of EPACT authorized the Department of Energy to \nreimburse uranium and thorium processing licensees for the portion of \nthe costs incurred in the remediation of mill tailings, groundwater and \nother by-product material generated as a result of sales to the federal \ngovernment pursuant to the Atomic Energy Commission's procurement \nprogram.\n  The Title X reimbursement program has worked very well. The licensees \nhave completed much of the surface reclamation at the Title X sites. \nHowever, increasingly stringent remediation standards and groundwater \ndecontamination programs have significantly increased the cost and time \nnecessary to complete remediation at many sites. Under current law, in \norder for a licensee to be eligible to recover the federal share of \nremediation costs incurred subsequent to December 31, 2002, the \nlicensee must describe and quantify all costs expected to be incurred \nthroughout the remainder of the site's cleanup in a plan for subsequent \nremedial action. This plan must be submitted to the Department of \nEnergy before December 31, 2001 and approved prior to December 31, \n2002.\n  This bill would amend Title X to extend the date, from 2002 to 2007, \nthrough which licensees can submit claims for reimbursement under the \nprocedures now in place and extend the date until December 31, 2007 \nthat licensees must submit their plans for subsequent remedial action \nto the Department of Energy. This legislation does not seek any \nincrease in the existing authorization. It merely provides the time \nnecessary to prepare the plans on a more informed basis and avoid the \nunintended hardship which would likely result from the 2002 deadline.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2933\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. REMEDIAL ACTION AT ACTIVE URANIUM AND THORIUM \n                   PROCESSING SITES.\n\n       Section 1001(b) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. \n     2296a(b)) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (1)(B)--\n       (A) in clause (i), by striking ``2002'' and inserting \n     ``2007''; and\n       (B) in clause (ii), by striking ``placed in escrow not \n     later than December 31, 2002,'' and inserting ``incurred by a \n     licensee after December 31, 2007,''; and\n       (2) in paragraph (2)(E)(i), by striking ``July 31, 2005'' \n     and inserting ``December 31, 2008''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. TORRICELLI:\n  S. 2934. A bill to provide for the assessment of an increased civil \npenalty in a case in which a person or entity that is the subject of a \ncivil environmental enforcement action has previously violated an \nenvironmental law or in a case in which a violation of an environmental \nlaw results in a catastrophic event; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n\n\n          the zero tolerance for repeat polluters act of 2000\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to draw attention to the \nincreased number of environmental enforcement actions brought against \nrepeat violators in the United States.\n  In 1970, many of America's rivers and lakes were dying, our city \nskylines were disappearing behind a shroud of smog, and toxic waste \nthreatened countless communities. Today, after a generation of \nenvironmental safeguards, our rivers and lakes are becoming safe for \nfishing and swimming again. Millions more Americans enjoy clean air and \nsafe drinking water, and many of our worst toxic dumps have been \ncleaned. Yet more remains to be done before we can truly say our \nenvironment is a healthy environment.\n  Indeed, in 1997 alone, over 11,000 environmental enforcement actions \nhad to be taken at the State and Federal levels. Sadly, it is also \nbecoming much more common for the defendants in these actions to be \nrepeat violators. For instance, in 1994, a chemical company in New \nJersey was fined $6,000 for environmental violations. Just four years \nlater, the same chemical company was again cited for an environmental \ncrime--releasing cresol into the air. Unfortunately, this time 53 \nchildren and 5 adults had to be hospitalized and the EPA had to \nevacuate the local community.\n  Incidents such as this are becoming all too common. Under current \nlaw, the penalties for repeat environmental violators, or parties \nresponsible for environmental catastrophes resulting in serious injury, \nare too low. Indeed, paltry fines are insufficient deterrents for large \ncorporations or parties that repeatedly commit environmental crimes. \nBetween 1994 and 1998, New Jersey had 774 repeat violators--more than \nany other State in the nation. This lack of deterrence has serious \nrepercussions for the environment and public health.\n  To provide a real safeguard against these repeat violators, today I \nwill introduce the ``Zero Tolerance for Repeat Polluters Act of 2000.'' \nThis legislation will create stiffer penalties for repeat violators of \nenvironmental safeguards and provides penalties that will more \naccurately reflect the costs to public health and the environment of \ncatastrophic events. The bill also gives the EPA emergency order and \ncivil action authority to address imminent and substantial \nendangerments of health and environment and creates a new EPA trust \nfund into which recovered funds can be used to address other \nsignificant threats.\n  Repeat environmental polluters that negligently endanger the public \nwith their actions or inaction will not be tolerated. No individual or \nbusiness should be able to endanger the public's health and safety with \nonly the threat of a slap on the wrist hanging over them. The ``Zero \nTolerance for Repeat Polluters Act of 2000'' goes a long way towards \nensuring that public health and the environment are truly protected for \nfuture generations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Bayh, \n        Mr. Breaux, Ms. Collins, and Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 2935. A bill to amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act \nof 1974, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and the Public Health \nService Act to increase Americans' access to long term health care, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                 the omnibus long-term care act of 2000\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise \ntoday to introduce the Omnibus Long-term Care Act of 2000 with my \ncolleagues Senators Grassley, Mikulski, Bayh, Breaux, Collins, and \nAkaka.\n  Americans in need of long-term care now face a fragmented and \ninadequate system of state and federal programs. This is no longer \nacceptable. Millions are struggling today to meet their long-term care \nneeds, and these numbers will grow dramatically as the country ages. \nWhile Medicare reform is important, we will have accomplished little if \nwe address seniors' acute care needs, but then leave them to suffer in \npoverty when they require long-term care.\n  I am pleased to introduce bipartisan legislation that demonstrates \nthe Senate's commitment to addressing this issue in a comprehensive \nway. The Omnibus Long-term Care Act of 2000 will\n\n[[Page S7675]]\n\nhelp millions of seniors and their caregivers who are struggling in our \ncommunities, while also encouraging all Americans to better plan for \ntheir own retirements.\n  Many seniors move to Florida with plans of a comfortable retirement, \nbut all too often, these hopes are never realized. A stroke or \nAlzheimer's Disease strikes and a family is quickly overwhelmed by \ntheir long-term care costs and responsibilities. To complicate matters, \nmany spouses of disabled seniors are frail themselves, and so find it \nincreasingly difficult to meet the needs of their loved ones.\n  Caregiving is also a huge concern for the millions of Americans in \nthe sandwich generation, those who are caring both for their children \nand their parents, while also balancing work obligations. Almost one-\nthird of all caregivers is juggling employment and caregiver \nresponsibilities, and of this group, two-thirds have conflicts that \nrequire them to quit work, cut hours, or turn down promotions.\n  It is clear that too many Americans are now being forced to sacrifice \ntheir health and their careers to care for their loved ones. To help, \nthis bill: provides the disabled or their caregivers with a $3,000 \nlong-term care tax credit; implements the National Family Caregiver \nSupport Program, which will provide caregivers with information and \nservices to help them meet their responsibilities; increases Social \nServices Block Grant funding for community-based long-term care \nservices; and ensures that seniors can return to their nursing home \nafter hospitalization.\n  This bill can also avert the long-term care crisis that will result \nif we do nothing to prepare for the aging of the Baby Boomers. Millions \nwho are struggling to care for their parents today will soon need long-\nterm care themselves. Baby Boomers had a higher divorce rate and fewer \nchildren than today's seniors, so they will not have the same support \nnetwork that today's retirees enjoy.\n  With more seniors needing more paid help in the future, costs will \nskyrocket. According to the Congressional Budget Office, individual \nout-of-pocket costs for long-term care could nearly double from $43 \nbillion today to $82 billion in 2020, and government's costs could \nincrease from $73 billion to $125 billion in the same period. It is \nclear that future retirees and the government cannot afford business as \nusual.\n  We must ask all Americans to take more responsibility for their own \nlong-term care needs. To help bring this about, this bill: offers a tax \ndeduction for the premiums of long-term care insurance policies; \nprovides long-term care insurance to federal employees; authorizes a \nnational public information campaign to educate employers and employees \nabout the benefits of long-term care coverage; mandates a federal \nsurvey to determine whether cities and counties are ``elder-ready;'' \ncalls for studies to determine how best to meet Americans' future long-\nterm care needs; and includes a Sense of the Senate affirming the \nbody's commitment to ensuring seniors' physical, emotional, and \nfinancial well-being in the new century.\n  The long-term care crisis we face demonstrates that we have neglected \nthis issue for far too long. But we must act now. The large number of \nseniors and their caregivers who are suffering in our communities today \nand the future needs of the Baby Boomers require it. A big problem \nrequires a big solution, and this bill helps protect seniors today and \nin the future.\n  All of the cosponsors of this legislation have championed the need to \nmeet seniors' long-term care needs. The fact that we have all come \ntogether in a bipartisan manner demonstrates that the Senate is \ncommitted to addressing this issue in a meaningful way. I look forward \nto working with my colleagues and the many organizations that support \nthis bill to make comprehensive long-term care reform a reality.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President I rise as a proud original cosponsor of \nthe Omnibus Long-Term Care Act of 2000. I am very pleased to join \nSenators Graham, Grassley, Bayh, Collins, Breaux, and Akaka to \nintroduce this bipartisan legislation that provides a comprehensive \napproach to the long-term care of our nation's citizens. I am committed \nto finding long-term solutions to the long-term care problem in our \ncountry.\n  I like this bill because it meets the day-to-day needs of Marylanders \nand the long-range needs of our country. At least 5.8 million Americans \naged 65 and older currently need long-term care. While this legislation \nhas many important provisions, I would like to highlight three of its \nfeatures: the National Family Caregiver Support Program, long-term car \ninsurance for federal employees, and the ``return to home'' provision.\n  First, this bill would establish the National Family Caregiver \nSupport Program. I am proud to have sponsored and cosponsored this \nlegislation previously in this Congress. This program will provide \nrespite care, training, counseling, support services, information and \nassistance to some of the millions of Americans who care for older \nindividuals and adult children with disabilities. In fact, eighty \npercent of all long-term care services are provided by family and \nfriends. This program has strong bipartisan support, will get behind \nour nation's families, and give help to those who practice self-help.\n  As Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Aging, I am pleased to \nreport that last week the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee unanimously approved a bipartisan bill to reauthorize the \nOlder Americans Act (OAA). This bill included the caregiver support \nprogram which is strongly supported by the entire aging community. As I \nwork with Senators Jeffords, Kennedy, and DeWine and our colleagues in \nthe House to pass the OAA reauthorization in September, I want to \nstrongly urge fellow appropriators in the House and Senate to fund \nthese vital caregiver support services as close as possible to the full \nfunding level of $125 million. Millions of Americans are waiting for \nCongress to act.\n  Second, I think it is important that this bill includes the Long-Term \nCare Security Act. This bill would enable federal and military workers, \nretirees, and their families to purchase long-term care insurance at \ngroup rates (projected to be 15-20 percent below the private market). \nIt would create a model that private employers can use to establish \ntheir own long-term care insurance programs. As our nation's largest \nemployer, the federal government can be a model for employers around \nthe country whose workforce will be facing the same long-term care \nneeds. Starting with the nation's largest employer also raises \nawareness and education about long-term care options.\n  Yesterday, the Senate passed the Long-Term Care Security Act (H.R. \n4040). I am proud to be the lead Democratic sponsor of the Senate \ncompanion to this bill, S. 2420, because it gives people choices, \nflexibility, and security. Families will have an additional option \navailable to them as they look at their long-term care choices. This \nprovision would also help reduce reliance on federal programs, like \nMedicaid, so the American taxpayer benefits.\n  This legislation also provides people with flexibility because it \nallows them to receive care in different types of settings. They may \nchoose to be cared for in the home by a family caregiver--or they may \nneed a higher level of care that nursing homes and home health care \nservices provide. Different plan reimbursement options will ensure \nmaximum flexibility that meet the unique health care needs of the \nbeneficiary.\n  Long-term care insurance also provides families with some security. \nFamily members will not be burdened by trying to figure out how to \nfinance health care needs--and beneficiaries will be able to make \ninformed decisions about their future.\n  Finally, I am pleased that the bill we have introduced includes \nbipartisan legislation that I have previously sponsored, the Seniors' \nAccess to Continuing Care Act (S. 1142). This legislation protects \nseniors' access to treatment in the setting of their choice and ensures \nthat seniors who reside in continuing care communities, and nursing and \nother facilities have the right to return to that facility after a \nhospitalization, even if the insurer does not have a contract with the \nresident's facility.\n  Across the country seniors in managed care plans have discovered too \nlate that after a hospital stay, they may be forced to return to a \nfacility in the plan's provider network and not to the continuing care \nretirement community or skilled nursing facility\n\n[[Page S7676]]\n\nwhere they live. No senior should have to face this problem. In \nMaryland alone, there are over 12,000 residents in 40 continuing care \nretirement communities and 24,000 residents in over 200 licensed \nnursing facilities. I have visited many of these facilities and heard \nfrom residents and operators about this serious and unexpected problem.\n  Residents choose and pay for facilities like continuing care \nretirement communities (CCRC's) for the continuum of care, safety, \nsecurity, and peace of mind. Hospitalization is traumatic. Friends, \nfamily, and familiar staff and faces are crucial to a speedy recovery. \nWhere you return after a hospital stay should be based on humanity and \nchoice, not the managed care company's bottom line.\n  Specifically, the Seniors' Access to Continuing Care Act protects \nresidents of CCRC's and nursing facilities by: enabling them to return \nto their facility after a hospitalization; and requiring the resident's \ninsurer or managed care organization (MCO) to cover the cost of the \ncare, even if the insurer does not have a contract with the resident's \nfacility. Certain conditions must be met.\n  This legislation also requires an insurer or MCO to pay for a service \nto one of its beneficiaries, without a prior hospital stay, if the \nservice is necessary to prevent a hospitalization of the beneficiary \nand the service is provided as an additional benefit. Lastly, the bill \nrequires an insurer or MCO to provide coverage to a beneficiary for \nservices provided at a facility in which the beneficiary's spouse \nalready resides, even if the facility is not under contract with the \nMCO. Certain requirements must be met. These provisions are an \nimportant part of our safety net for seniors.\n  I want to salute the strong leadership of the other cosponsors of \nthis legislation who have authored various provisions of this \ncomprehensive bill that we have joined together to introduce today. I \nknow that all the cosponsors are sincerely committed, as I am, to \naddressing the challenges facing our aging population. I look forward \nto working with all of them to enact this important legislation.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I cosponsor \nthe Omnibus Long-term Care Act of 2000, introduced by Senator Graham. \nThe cosponsors of this legislation are well-known for their commitment \nto encouraging all Americans to prepare for their own long-term needs.\n  Many Americans mistakenly believe that Medicare and their regular \nhealth insurance programs will pay for long-term care. They do not. \nAlthough Medicare provides some long-term care support, an individual \ngenerally must ``spend-down'' his or her income and assets to qualify \nfor coverage.\n  More and more Americans are requiring long-term care. About 6.4 \nmillion Americans, aged 65 or older, require some long-term care due to \nillness or disability. Over five million children and adults under the \nage of 65 also require long-term care because of health conditions from \nbirth or a chronic illness developed later in life. Only 12 percent \nreceive care in nursing homes or other institutional settings.\n  The need for long-term care is great. In 20 years, one in six \nAmericans will be age 65 or older. By the year 2040, the number of \nAmericans age 85 years or older will more than triple to over 12 \nmillion. The cost of nursing home care now exceeds $40,000 per a year \nin most parts of the country, and home care visits for nursing or \nphysical therapy runs about $100 per visit. In 1996, over $107 billion \nwas spent on nursing homes and home health care. However, this figure \ndoes not take into account that over 80 percent of all long-term care \nservices are provided by family and friends.\n  In my own state of Hawaii, 13.2 percent of the population is 65 years \nand older. Although Hawaii enjoys one of the highest life \nexpectancies--79 years, compared to a national average of 75 years--the \nstate's rapidly aging population will greatly impact available \nresources for long-term care, both institutional and from non-\ninstitutional sources. Hawaii's long-term care facilities are operating \nat full capacity. According to the Hawaii State Department of Health, \nthe average occupancy rate peaked at 97.8 percent in 1994. But \noccupancy remains high. By 1997, the average occupancy dropped to 90 \npercent.\n  These statistics point to the overriding need to help American \nfamilies provide dignified and appropriate care to their parents and \nrelatives. We know that the demand for long-term care will increase \nwith each passing year, and that federal, state, and local resources \ncannot cover the expected costs. Nursing home costs are expected to \nreach $97,000 by the year 2030.\n  What Congress can do, however, it make long-term care insurance \navailable to a broad segment of the population. As the ranking minority \nmember of the Subcommittee on Federal Services, I co-chaired a hearing \non long-term care insurance on May 16, 2000. We heard testimony on S. \n2420, legislation to authorize the Office of Personnel Management to \ncontract with one or more insurance carriers for long-term care \ninsurance for federal and military personnel and their families. As a \ncosponsor of that bill, I am pleased that just last night, the Senate \npassed our measure after substituting the text of S. 2420 under H.R. \n4040, the House long-term care bill for the federal family. The bill, \nas amended, also includes provisions of S. 1232, the Federal Erroneous \nRetirement Coverage Corrections Act, which I cosponsored with Senator \nCochran last year. These provisions will provide relief to the \nestimated 20,000 federal employees who, through no fault of their own, \nfound themselves in the wrong retirement system. H.R. 4040, as amended, \noffer a model for the private sector. I am delighted that similar \nlegislation providing long-term care insurance for federal employees \nand military personnel is included in Senator Graham's bill, and I \nwelcome the opportunity to join with him in helping Americans meet \ntheir long-term care needs in a dignified manner.\n  The bill introduced today provides a comprehensive effort to address \nour citizens' long-term care needs. Among its provisions are the \nauthorization of a phased-in tax deduction for the premiums of \nqualified long-term care insurance, implementation of the National \nFamily Caregiver Support Program, restoration of $2.38 billion \nauthorization for the Social Services Block Grant, and creation of a \nnational public information campaign.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original sponsor of this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROBB (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Breaux, \n        Mr. Dodd, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. \n        Kerry, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Reid, Mr. \n        Rockefeller, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Harkin, and Mr. \n        Bayh):\n  S. 2936. A bill to provide incentives for new markets and community \ndevelopment, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n        creating new markets and empowering america act of 2000\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Creating New \nMarkets and Empowering America Act of 2000, which is designed to \nstrengthen and revitalize low and moderate income communities across \nAmerica.\n  Because we made some tough choices to balance our budget, we have the \nfirst federal surplus since Lyndon Johnson was President. And now is \nthe time to give some back, particularly to those who have missed out \non so much of our economic prosperity. This legislation would pump new \ncapital into our nation's inner cities and isolated rural communities--\nareas that have had a difficult time building up from within.\n  The legislation contains three ``New Markets'' initiatives designed \nto attract and expand new capital into low to moderate income areas. \nFirst, a New Markets Tax Credit would infuse $15 billion in investments \nover the next 7 years through a 30 percent tax credit for businesses \nwho provide capital to lower income communities. Secondly, the bill \nauthorizes the designation of America's Private Investment Companies \n(APIC's) which would receive federal matching funds for private \ninvestments made in lower income areas. This provision would allow $1 \nbillion in federal low-cost loans to match $500 million in private \ninvestment. Thirdly, the bill would create a new class of venture \ncapital funds to assist with the operation and administration of \nongoing businesses in lower income areas, who have growth potential, so \nthey can continue to expand.\n\n[[Page S7677]]\n\n  The bill also requires mandatory funding for Round II Empowerment \nZones (EZ's) and Enterprise Communities (EC's) and creates a new set of \nRound III EZ's.\n  Mr. President, the mandatory funding of Round II Empowerment Zones is \ncritically important to the citizens of Norfolk and Portsmouth, \nVirginia. The Federal Government made a commitment to these two \ncommunities--they need and deserve the funding--and I am determined to \nget the check in the mail to them. With this legislation, the Norfolk-\nPortsmouth Empowerment Zone would be guaranteed the remaining $94 \nmillion it was promised when it competed for the Empowerment Zone \ndesignation.\n  The legislation I'm introducing today also creates 40 Renewal \nCommunities--which reflect the agreement between President Clinton and \nSpeaker Hastert--along with a host of tax provisions to expand and \nrevitalize housing.\n  Very important to my home state of Virginia, this bill contains \nlegislation I introduced earlier this year (S. 2445) to assist \ncommunities affected by job loss due to trade. The Assistance in \nDevelopment for Communities Act (AID for Communities Act) both assists \ncommunities in developing a plan to retool their economies and offers \nfinancial assistance and tax incentives to help communities implement \nthose plans.\n  Mr. President, the AID for Communities Act is immensely important to \nthe people of Martinsville, Virginia--who have suffered economic \ndevastation from the recent closing of a Tultex plant. This bill would \ngive the citizens of Martinsville the urgent assistance they need to \nstrengthen their economy and create a more vibrant future for all who \nlive there.\n  Finally, Mr. President, this legislation includes two new initiatives \nto help religious and other community organizations better participate \nin federal grant programs. Specifically, it requires the Substance \nAbuse and Mental Health Services Administration to provide assistance \nin a manner similar to HUD's Office of Community and Faith-Based \nOrganizations to assist faith-based and community organizations in \napplying for federal grant funds to provide substance abuse treatment. \nIt would also require the IRS to provide guidance and make information \navailable to assist religious and community organizations in \nestablishing tax-exempt entities that can be used to operate social \nservices.\n  Many of these organizations are unfamiliar with the process necessary \nto set up a tax-exempt organization and are, therefore, unable to \nparticipate in federal grant programs. This provision would provide \nthem with the necessary information and assistance.\n  Mr. President, the ``Creating New Markets and Empowering America Act \nof 2000'' will spur economic growth in low to moderate income \ncommunities across our nation. As such, it will improve the lives of \ncountless Americans. I urge my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to cosponsor the Creating New \nMarkets and Empowering America Act of 2000. We are living in a time of \nunprecedented prosperity. However this prosperity has not reached every \nAmerican equally. The boom on Wall Street has not reached Main Street \nin many regions of our nation. The problem is quite simple. Many of our \nlower income communities are unable to attract the investment capital \nthat is allowing more affluent areas to flourish. As the United States \neconomy continues to grow it has become more and more apparent that \nattracting capital to these communities is one of the largest \nchallenges facing the private sector and all levels of government.\n  It is important to keep in mind that this is not just an urban \nproblem. Many rural communities, especially those that rely on \nagriculture, are watching their jobs disappear with nothing on the \nhorizon in the form of new business or industry to offer much hope. My \nhome state of Montana is facing this economic turmoil right now. A \nstate that was built on agriculture, mining, and timber has watched \nthese industries diminish to the point that Montana is now 50th in per-\ncapita income relative to other states--dead last.\n  We often hear the phrase ``digital divide.'' Well, Montana is \nstanding on the edge of an economic divide, but we are not quitters. \nMontana has much to offer. We have an unparalleled quality of life, a \nhighly-educated work force, a burgeoning high-tech sector, and top-\nnotch schools. In many respects, we are right on the cusp of an \neconomic upswing. However, we are having an extremely difficult time \nattracting the investment capital that we need to become a partner in \nthe Internet mainstream, create good paying jobs, and truly turn the \neconomic corner.\n  This past June over the course of two days, I convened a Montana \nEconomic Development Summit that brought together not only our state's \nleaders and decision makers, but also outside experts in various \ndisciplines in an effort to build a road map for improving Montana's \neconomy. We covered many issues, but primarily focused on high-tech, \nbusiness development, and marketing and trade. We tackled tough \nquestions such as how we retain and support our current businesses and \nalso attract new businesses that truly fit with Montanans and their \nvalues. Three points came up time and again. First, the need for and \ninability to get the necessary investment capital. We simply do not \nhave the population or resources available that larger states enjoy. \nSecond, our window of opportunity is closing. Time moves faster than it \nused to and if we don't act quickly the world will move right past us. \nThird, and most importantly, any action or strategy that we take must \ncome from begin locally. Economic development initiatives must be \nbottom-up and not top-down or they just will not work.\n  It is for these three reasons that I am cosponsoring this \nlegislation. The New Markets proposals are a quick and efficient way to \nleverage the necessary investment in lower-income communities through \nprivate/public partnerships. And it will give these communities the \ntools they need to map their own economic destiny and create the better \npaying jobs that are so desperately needed.\n  Two portions illustrate the private/public partnership. On the public \nside, the Trade Adjustment Assistance provision will enhance the \nability of each community to be proactive in crafting a long-term \nstrategy for economic development. This is crucial for communities and \nregions in rural areas that are natural resource dependent and have \nsuffered severe employment losses in the past decade. For the private \nsector, the New Markets tax credit will create opportunity by providing \na tangible incentive for companies to take a serious look at areas of \nthe country that are currently being ignored.\n  In closing, this legislation will provide the necessary ingredients \nfor revitalizing America's less fortunate rural areas. It will help \ntarget investment to these communities and it will allow them the \nflexibility to build their economies on their terms and their ability. \nI commend my colleague from Virginia, Senator Robb, for introducing \nsuch proactive legislation that addresses several of the most urgent \nissues facing economically troubled areas. Finally, I urge my \ncolleagues to work together and pass this legislation so that states \nlike Montana can begin their long climb back up to economic stability \nand prosperity.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I join Senator Robb and 16 other \ncolleagues to introduce comprehensive legislation aimed at spurring \neconomic development and person empowerment in our inner cities and \nisolated rural areas. Our economy is booming, and has been for most of \nthe 90s, yet there are still individuals and families who are \nstruggling.\n  What we've tried to do is develop economic incentives that will \nencourage business development and remove barriers that make it hard \nfor entrepreneurs, community organizations and individuals to build \nhealthy communities.\n  Among the many important initiatives in this bill is my new markets \nlegislation that I introduced last September, S. 1594, the Community \nDevelopment and Venture Capital Act, which passed the Senate Committee \non Small Business today, and as part of the Clinton/Hastert package in \nthe House yesterday. It also includes full funding for Round II of \nEmpowerment Zones.\n  The Community Development and Venture Capital Act has three parts: a\n\n[[Page S7678]]\n\nventure capital program to funnel investment money into distressed \ncommunities; Senator Wellstone's program to expand the number of \nventure capital firms and professionals who are devoted to investing in \nsuch communities; and a mentoring program to link established, \nsuccessful businesses with small businesses owners in stagnant or \ndeteriorating communities in order to facilitate the learning curve.\n  The venture capital program is modeled after the Small Business \nAdministration's successful Small Business Investment Company program. \nAs SBA Administrator Alvarez pointed out just last week in a Small \nBusiness Committee hearing, the SBIC program has been so successful \nthat it has generated more than $19 billion in investments in more than \n13,000 businesses since 1992. And, in the past five years, the SBIC \nparticipating securities program has returned $224 million in profits, \nvirtually paying for itself for the past nine years.\n  As successful as that program is, it does not sufficiently reach \nareas of our country that need economic development the most. One, out \nof the total $4.2 billion that SBICs invested last year, only 1.6 \npercent were deals of less than $1 million dollars in LMI areas. Two, \nonly $1.1 million of that $4.2 billion went to LMI investments in rural \nareas. Three, in 1999, 85 percent of SBIC deals were $10 million and \nmore.\n  In broader terms, the economy is booming. Since 1993, almost 21 \nmillion jobs have been created. Since 1992, unemployment has shrunk \nfrom 7.5 percent to 4 percent. In the past two years, we've paid down \nthe debt $140 billion, and CBO currently projects a surplus of $176 \nbillion. Some estimates even say more than $2 trillion. In spite of \nthese impressive numbers, one out of five children grows up in poverty \nand there are pockets of America where unemployment is as high as 14 \npercent.\n  We can make a difference by investing in a new industry of community \ndevelopment venture capital funds that target investment capital and \nbusiness expertise into low- and moderate-income areas to develop and \nexpand local businesses that create jobs and alleviate economic \ndistress. The existing 25 or 30 community development venture capital \nfunds have set out to demonstrate that the same model of business \ndevelopment that has driven economic expansion in Silicon Valley and \nRoute 128 Massachusetts can also make a powerful difference in areas \nlike the inner-city areas of Boston's Roxbury or New York's East \nHarlem, or the rural desolation of Kentucky's Appalachia or \nMississippi's Delta region.\n  Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan says ``Credit alone is \nnot the answer. Businesses must have equity capital before they are \nconsidered viable candidates for debt financing.'' He emphasizes that \nthis is particularly important in lower-income communities.\n  What I'm trying to do as Ranking Member of the Small Business \nCommittee, and have been working with the SBA to achieve, is expand \ninvestment in our neediest communities by building on the economic \nactivity created by loans. I think one of the most effective ways to do \nthat is to spur venture capital investment in our neediest communities. \nI am very glad that Senator Robb and my other colleagues agreed to \ninclude this powerful economic development plan in this legislation.\n  Switching to another provision in this bill, this legislation builds \non the President's and Speaker's agreement by securing full, mandatory \nfunding for Massachusett's Empowerment Zone. As I said earlier, this \npassed the full House yesterday by a vote of 394 to 27. Full, mandatory \nfunding is important because, so far, the money has dribbled in--only \n$6.6 million of the $100 million authorized over ten years--and made it \nimpossible for the city to implement a plan for economic self-\nsufficiency. Some 80 public and private entities, from universities to \ntechnology companies to banks to local government, showed incredible \ncommunity spirit and committed to matching the EZ money, eight to one. \nLet me say it another way--these groups agreed to match the $100 \nmillion in Federal Empowerment Zone money with $800 million. Yet, \nregrettably, in spite of this incredible alliance, the city of Boston \nhas not been able to tap into that leveraged money and implement the \nstrategic plan because Congress hasn't held up its part of the bargain. \nI am extremely pleased that we were able to work together and find a \nway to provide full, steady funding to these zones. That money means \neducation, daycare, transportation and basic health care in areas--in \nMassachusetts that includes 57,000 residents who live in Roxbury, \nDorchester and Mattipan--where almost 50 percent of the children are \nliving in poverty and nearly half the residents over 25 don't even have \na high school diploma\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their work on this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to give my support to the \nCreating New Markets and Empowering America Act of 2000. In a time of \nunprecedented economic prosperity, there are too many communities in \nthis nation that are beleaguered by crumbling infrastructures and \nstagnant economies. This legislation will help attract capital, produce \nmuch-needed housing, and encourage private investment to communities \nmost in need.\n  I am proud to join in cosponsoring this legislation and would like to \nthank Senator Robb for all his hard work in crafting this bill. Of \nparticular importance to my home state of Vermont are increases in the \nLow Income Housing Tax Credit and Private Activity Bond cap.\n  Vermont is currently in the middle of an affordable housing crisis. \nProduction has stalled and demand has risen. In Chittenden County, one \nof Vermont's most populated areas, residents face a rental vacancy rate \nof less than one percent. Housing costs are so expensive, middle income \nfamilies are being forced into hotels, college dorms, homeless \nshelters, or left out on the street. Sadly, this is a situation that is \nbeing repeated nationwide.\n  As funding for other federal housing assistance programs has \ndiminished, states depend more and more on the LIHTC and private \nactivity bonds to finance affordable housing projects. The LIHTC has \nbeen extremely successful since its enactment as part of the Tax Reform \nAct of 1986. Today, the LIHTC is one of the primary tools that states \nhave to attract private investment in affordable rental housing. In \nVermont, the LIHTC has made possible the production, rehabilitation, \nand preservation of over 2,600 affordable apartments since 1987. \nUnfortunately this credit has not been increased since its creation \nnearly fourteen years ago. Today, the demand for tax credits far \nexceeds their availability. This year in Vermont, over $2.5 million in \ncredits were requested but only $718,000 were available.\n  I am pleased that this bill raises the annual per capita allocation \nof tax credits from $1.25 to $1.75 and indexes the credit to inflation. \nIn addition to the increased per capita allocation, I hope to work a \nsmall state minimum. Such a floor would help to ensure that small \nstates like Vermont have access to the resources they need to provide \naffordable housing for every resident in need.\n  Private activity bonds also play an important role in providing \naffordable housing for Vermonters. In 1986 the Federal Tax Reform Act \nlimited the amount of tax-exempt bonds that each state could issue to \nno more than $50 per capita. There has not been an inflation adjustment \nto the cap since its inception. The Vermont Housing Finance Agency \n(VHFA) has issued over $1.25 billion in private activity bonds since \n1974, bonds which have helped make the dream of home ownership a \nreality for over 20,425 Vermont households. I am pleased that this bill \nincludes a cap increase from $50 to $75 per capita which will help \nVermont's finance agencies continue this success.\n  Again, I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill which will offer \nmany households, businesses and communities new opportunities as we \nenter the 21st century. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of \nthis legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Grassley, and Mr. \n        Kerrey):\n  S. 2937. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nimprove access to Medicare+Choice plans through an increase in the \nannual Medicare+Choice capitation rates and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n[[Page S7679]]\n\n            the medicare geographic fair payment act of 2000\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today with some very \ndistinguished colleagues from both sides of the aisle--Senator Wyden, \nwho is here, and Senator Grassley, who is not here--who are cosponsors \nof this measure, along with Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska.\n  Mr. President, let me suggest for Senators' staff who are looking at \nthis to look alphabetically. You will find how much is being reimbursed \nin your cities for the Medicare+Choice reimbursement. Look at it, and \nyou will see how the HMOs are reimbursed to provide this rather good, \nfair, and competitive coverage to the senior citizens. You will be \nastounded. Many people think New York is covered. They are getting a \nvery high rate of reimbursement because they started high. But look at \nsome of the cities in New York. You will find that New York has a \nnumber of cities that are under $450. We reimburse them on the high \nlevel--as high as $800.\n  The bill we are introducing today we are going to call the Medicare \nGeographic Fair Payment Act. Week after week, the Federal Government \ndeducts a portion of everyone's paycheck to support the Medicare \nprogram. After our seniors have retired and begin to take advantage of \nthe program they have supported for so many years, I think it is fair \nthat they continue to have a choice.\n  Right now they have a choice. But the choice is really not for all \nseniors because we made a decision when we put in the Medicare+Choice \nProgram, which was really an alternative that seniors could choose. We \nmade a decision as to how we would reimburse the provider. That \ndecision was made based upon, as I understand from my good friend, \nSenator Wyden--allegedly based on what they needed to get the job done \nto get the program going.\n  I don't intend to be critical, but in many instances those who had \nnot been frugal, had not been careful about costs, got high \nreimbursements. But if you lived in Senator Wyden's State or New \nMexico, where they were being extremely frugal in what they charged for \nthe services, they got a very low rate.\n  It is unfortunate, but for Staten Island the rates of reimbursement \nare $814; $794 for Dade County--I am not complaining; I am stating a \ndollar amount--$702 for New Orleans; and $661 for Los Angeles.\n  Senator Wyden, perhaps, could intervene and tell me what it is in \nPortland.\n  Mr. WYDEN. $445.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. $445; Albuquerque is $430, $15 under Oregon. That is \nall the government will give as reimbursement if you decide to get into \nthe HMO business with hospitals and everybody else joining together, if \nyou are going to furnish this service. Remember, there are some places \ngetting $800-plus.\n  I am not here to take away anything from anyone. That is how our \namendment is different. We are not trying to take the pie, leave it the \nsame size, and say those who are getting more money have to cut back. \nRural areas are even lower and are expected to provide the same level \nof benefits or nearly half the reimbursement.\n  There were seniors who had a marvelous Medicare+Choice Program. Why \nwas it good? It was good because for a reasonable cost they were \ngetting prescription drugs, which you don't get under Medicare, and the \nwhole package was new benefits. Some of them got dental insurance, \nwhich they don't get. Some of them got a number of different things \nthey don't get under Medicare, for a premium they could afford.\n  These programs are being closed down every day we delay. Thousands of \nseniors are getting notices. They had a good program, but they won't \nhave it in January. I want everybody to know if there are going to be \nany entitlement bills getting out of here on anything that is even \nclose to Medicare, this is an amendment that will be on there--or \nsomething better. This amendment says by January 1st of this year, the \nrates are raised. They are these low rates we are talking about. Very \nsimply, under this bill, we will change the rates.\n  It is pretty easy for everybody to understand. This is not a \ncomplicated bill. What we are doing is saying for those metropolitan \nareas which are 250,000 or more, the minimum reimbursement will be \n$525. If we can't get that through here to preserve some of these plans \nwhere seniors are just falling off the log, desperately getting their \nnotices, and raising it to $525, then I don't know what is fair around \nhere anymore. For all the rural counties, we have raised the minimum to \n$475.\n  My friend, Senator Wyden, can talk about his State and about his \nobservations. Clearly, he has been asking everybody around here, \nincluding the Budget Committee, to have hearings on this great \ndisparity which he calls penalizing efficiency.\n  The truth of the matter is in my home city and in my State of New \nMexico, what is happening, the HMO companies can no longer stay in \nbusiness. Seniors are getting notified. In fact, we don't have a lot of \npeople under this program--15,000 are going to get knocked off the \nprogram right now, very soon. If you think they are not going to \nmeetings, they met with Heather Wilson, one of our representatives, and \n400 people showed up because they read in the newspaper she was holding \na meeting and they already got their notices: Come January, find a new \nplan. They are asking: Why? The plan is good. It is very good for me. I \nhave been paying all my life. Why are you taking this away?\n\n  I ask Senators to take a look. In my case, we will get $34 million in \nadditional reimbursements during the first year and $170 out of this \nbill. Incidentally, this bill will cost $700 million the first year. I \nsay to the thousands of seniors who may be able to keep their insurance \nand be under this kind of program, that is a pretty good bargain. Over \n5 years, it will cost $3.7 billion.\n  It also includes a third provision which I ask Senators to look at. \nIt is the product of some very wise thinking by Senator Grassley. It \nshould have been separately called the Grassley bill, but it is \npackaged in this as our third title. It says essentially hospitals will \nhereinafter be reimbursed on labor costs--on what the actual cost is, \nnot on what the stated cost is. That makes the payment to hospitals go \nup substantially. My small State will go up about $6.5 million over the \nyear. I don't know what it would be in a State such as Ohio, but it \nwould be rather substantial.\n  I have extensive research, with cities alphabetically listed. Just \nlook for your city and see what the reimbursement rate is. If it is \nunder $525, we will take it to $525. If there are rural counties that \nare not in these lists, call home and ask what some of the counties are \ngetting reimbursed. Raising it to $475 will help an awful lot of \npeople. Is it enough? I don't know. I want to get something done. My \nfriend wants to get something done, as do my two cosponsors. I assume \nin a couple of days or a week we will have a lot more Senators, \nbipartisan, asking to be on this.\n  I remind everyone, the total cost of doing a bit of fairness to \nseniors and ending discrimination by region is going to be $700 million \nin the first year and $3.7 over 5. We have been talking about \nastronomical numbers for Medicare reform, prescription drugs. I don't \nknow where we will end up. I hope in the heat of this political 6 weeks \nwe don't do anything major, because it will be wrong, but clearly we \nhave to do something.\n  Come January 1, if we don't put money into this reimbursement \nprogram, I think my friend, who has followed this carefully, will say \nhundreds of thousands of seniors will be denied the option to buy \ncoverage which they think is rather good in many cases, including \nprescription drugs, for which they only have to pay $50 extra. They \ncan't get that anywhere else. They got extensive coverage of items in \ntheir health care needs that are not covered anywhere.\n  I very much thank the Senators who are cosponsoring, Senators Wyden, \nGrassley, and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska. We will have more.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill and additional \nmaterial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2937\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, before he leaves the floor, I thank the \nchairman of the Budget Committee for the opportunity to be involved in \nthis issue. I think the chairman has said it very well. In effect, what \nhe has done is make the case for why the bill we are proposing is \nabsolutely essential to modernize the Medicare program.\n  If there is one principle that Medicare is going to have to stand for \nin the 21st century, it is that we must change this system which now \nliterally rewards waste and penalizes frugality.\n  Medicare has an HMO reimbursement system today which is, even by \nbeltway standards, perverse. It sends the message if you are really \ninefficient, if you have not taken the steps that Colorado and Oregon \nand other States have taken, don't worry about it, don't go out and \nmake the tough choices about introducing competition to your community. \nThe Federal Government will just keep sending you big checks.\n  I think it is absolutely key, especially given the fact that close to \na million seniors are going to lose their HMO coverage this year--close \nto a million seniors will lose their coverage this year--that we pass \nthis bipartisan legislation. I think the chairman is right. I think by \nthe end of the next couple of days, we will have many other colleagues \nfrom both political parties here. I see my friend, Senator Smith of \nOregon, has come into the Chamber. He and I have worked on this issue \nsince he has come to the Senate as part of our bipartisan agenda for \nOregon. I am going to talk for a few minutes to try to elaborate on \nsome of the themes Chairman Domenici has so eloquently addressed.\n  As we have seen in Oregon and New Mexico and so many other States, \nthe present HMO reimbursement system is literally driving HMO plans out \nof the program and leaving seniors across this country petrified about \ntheir future health care in their communities. What senior after senior \nasks at this point is how can it be that since they pay the same amount \nfor hospitalization and outpatient services, if they live in Pendleton \nor they live in Portland, they pay the same amount for outpatient and \nhospitalization services as seniors in other parts of the country yet \nthe Federal Government does not send an equal payment to folks in \nPendleton and Portland? As Chairman Domenici has very specifically and \neloquently described, they send dramatically different payments to \ncommunities across this country. So you can have communities, for \nexample, on the east coast, that literally get twice the reimbursement \nof communities in Oregon and New Mexico.\n  We hear about it very bluntly from our constituents. You can have a \nsenior in Pendleton or Coos Bay call up their cousin in one of the \ncities back East and ask their cousin about Medicare, how it is going.\n  The senior back East says: You know, it goes great. I get \nprescription drugs for only a few dollars a month. I also get dental \ncoverage. I get free hearing aids. How is it going for you there in \nCoos Bay or Pendleton or Albuquerque, NM? How is Medicare going for \nyou?\n  That senior in Albuquerque or Pendleton or Portland wants to throw \nthe telephone through the living room window because they don't get \nthat prescription drug coverage, hearing aids, or dental coverage \nbecause the reimbursement is as low as Chairman Domenici has described.\n  The Congress was supposed to have begun, several years ago, a \nbipartisan effort to change this. The system was called a blended rate. \nIn effect, over the next few years, we would move to a national system, \nso instead of driving some of these high-cost areas down precipitously, \nwe would move low-cost areas up over the next few years. Unfortunately, \nthat system has been delayed. It has been delayed, in my view, in a \nfashion that has made for many plans saying they can no longer afford \nto stay in business; certainly no longer afford to offer some of those \nbenefits such as prescription drugs, which are so important to seniors.\n\n  That is why Chairman Domenici and I and Senator Grassley and Senator \nKerrey and I know many of our colleagues are going to join in a \nbipartisan effort, first, to establish a minimum payment floor for \nurban counties; second, to boost the rural counties where, again, these \nprograms have barely been able to survive as a result of low \nreimbursement rates; and, third, to address the concerns with respect \nto wages that Senator Grassley has so eloquently described. But I am of \nthe view that if this Congress is to modernize the Medicare program, \nthe essence of such a modernization effort is to create more options \nand more choices. That will not be possible if you perpetuate an HMO \nreimbursement system that day after day after day penalizes frugality \nand rewards waste.\n  For those who really want to get into the details of this subject, \nthe system is known as the AAPCC, the average adjusted per capita cost. \nThe way it has worked, the HMOs are reimbursed by the Federal \nGovernment through a system that historically has looked at average \nlocal costs of various procedures, such as a heart bypass in Pendleton \nor cataract operation in Portland--and then you calculate a formula for \nreimbursing these HMOs, using a percentage of the fee-for-service costs \nfor health care in the area.\n  But at the end of the day, the message is, if you are wasteful, don't \nworry about it. If you are inefficient, the Federal Government is going \nto say maybe that is not ideal, but we will just send you a check to \nreflect the fact that you are not taking steps to hold down your costs \nand we are not going to give you any consequences as a result.\n  That makes no sense to Senator Domenici and me and our cosponsors. I \nknow it makes no sense to the Presiding Officer because he and I have \ntalked about this innumerable times. We tried to boost reimbursement \nrates for the people of Oregon. We have to change the Medicare program \nto eliminate the discrimination against communities that control costs \nwhile offering good quality care.\n  Our bipartisan legislation is not just a one-time infusion of money. \nWe structured it so that money becomes part of a base for future \nincreases, which in my view helps to jump-start what Congress intended \nseveral years ago by passing legislation to promote a nationwide \nblended rate.\n  We all understand that at present, as we look to the last days of the \nsession, with the budget surplus, it is going to be possible to use a \nportion of that surplus, after we have helped pay down the debt, after \nhopefully there is a targeted tax cut; at that point, we will have some \ndollars to take the steps to better meet the health care needs of older \npeople and also jump start the modernization of the Medicare program.\n  Our legislation, I hope, will be part of that effort. I think \nChairman Domenici and Senator Grassley, among our cosponsors, are very \nlikely to be in the room at the end of the day when that legislation is \nbeing offered. I and others are going to do our best to support those \nefforts in the Budget Committee. I know the Presiding Officer and I \nhave used every opportunity to raise these issues, and we are going to \ncontinue to do so.\n  Our State has been a pioneer in the health care reform area. We are \nproud of the fact that we are the first State in the country to have \nmade tough choices about health care priorities through the Oregon \nhealth plan. We are proud of the fact that we have been able to \nintroduce more choices and more competition to the health care system \nand, as a result, seniors in our State are able to get more for their \nhealth care dollar.\n\n[[Page S7687]]\n\n  It is not right for older people in Oregon, New Mexico, Iowa, and in \nother States where they have done the heavy lifting and they have taken \nsteps to hold down their costs, to be discriminated against by the \nFederal Government.\n  This bipartisan legislation, in my view, is going to help keep HMOs \nthat are currently in the program in the program, and it will begin the \nprocess of bringing back to Medicare some of those we have lost because \nthey have been discriminated against in the past with respect to \nreimbursement and they could not keep their doors open.\n  We will be talking about this legislation frequently in the last few \ndays of this Congress and in the fall, and I believe passing this \nlegislation, as we look at that final budget bill that is sure to be \npart of our fall debates, that this is one of the best ways we can \ntarget dollars that need to be spent carefully so as to maximize the \nvalues of what we are getting in health care for older people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I could not help but hear the words of \nSenator Wyden and Senator Domenici about the terrible situation we have \nacross this country today in regard to HMOs dropping senior citizens \noff the Medicare Plus Choice Program.\n  While I was Governor of the State of Ohio, we had several instances \nwhere people were thrown off the rolls of their HMO and forced to be \nwithout any kind of supplemental insurance or prescription drug \nbenefits. It is a growing epidemic today in the United States of \nAmerica. I want to go on record in support of the legislation of \nSenator Wyden and Senator Domenici. In fact, earlier today I asked \nSenator Domenici if I could be a cosponsor of this legislation.\n  It is important to point out that some of the on-budget surplus that \nwe now have in the year 2000 and the projected $102 billion in 2001 is \ngenerated by the fact that projected Medicare costs are coming in far \nbelow what they anticipated because of the formula that was adopted in \n1997. It seems to me we ought to look at the situation as it really is, \nincrease the reimbursement to those HMOs so individuals can stay in \nthose programs, and so they don't have to buy Medigap insurance to \ncover out-of-pocket expenses and prescription drugs.\n  It seems to me it should be our responsibility to make sure those who \nare now covered remain covered and not be thrown out on the street. I \nhave read so often: Don't worry about those people, somebody else will \npick them up, or they can go to fee for service. When they go to fee \nfor service, they don't get their 20 percent out-of-pocket paid for, \nnor does Medicare pick up prescription drugs.\n  It is time for this Congress to step in and change the system, \nincrease the reimbursement, keep those individuals who are on Medicare \nPlus Choice Programs so they can maintain coverage for out-of-pocket \nexpenses and maintain the prescription drug coverage they have.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to note the introduction of the \nMedicare Geographic Fair Payment Act of 2000. I'm very pleased to join \nSenators Domenici, Wyden, and Kerrey in this effort. While we share the \nproblem of low payment rates, Iowa and Nebraska are in a different \nsituation than New Mexico and Oregon. Those two states are concerned \nabout Medicare + Choice plans leaving, but for the most part we in Iowa \nare still waiting for plans to arrive. There are a number of things \nthat have to fall into place for Medicare + Choice to become a reality \nin Iowa, but one of them is increasing payment rates. I want to make \nsure that if Congress provides any relief in Medicare + Choice this \nyear, that low-cost areas are not forgotten. We need to make Medicare + \nChoice a truly national program.\n  There are two simple Medicare + Choice payment provisions in the \nbill. It would raise the minimum payment floor for all counties from \nthe current $415 to $475 in 2001. This would primarily benefit rural \nand small urban areas, including the vast majority of Iowa. Secondly, \nit would establish a new minimum payment floor of $525 for all counties \nin Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) with populations exceeding \n250,000. In Iowa, this would mean a substantial incentive for plans to \nenter the Des Moines and Quad Cities areas.\n  As I've said so often throughout the five-plus years that I've been \nworking on this issue, people in low-cost states like Iowa pay the same \npayroll taxes as those in high-cost areas. So it's a matter of simple \nfairness and equity that all seniors have access to the choices in \nMedicare, wherever they live. The problem with Medicare + Choice has \nbeen that payment rates are based on fee-for-service payment rates in \nthe same county; thus, cost-effective regions like ours are punished. \nThis makes no sense. We took our first step toward breaking that \nunfortunate link in 1997, and I have high hopes that we will take \nanother big step with this bill in 2000.\n  We in low-cost regions have to keep the fight for equity going on two \nfronts: Medicare + Choice payment, and traditional Medicare payment. \nThe latter is harder for Congress to change, because we have to \nidentify inequities in the various Medicare payment policies and fix \nthem one by one. I thank my colleagues for including in this bill my \nearlier bill on the hospital wage index, which is one of those flaws in \nfee-for-service Medicare that cries out to be fixed.\n  I look forward to the Finance Committee's Medicare discussions this \nfall; this is the kind of legislation that merits serious consideration \nthere.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Jeffords, and \n        Mrs. Lincoln):\n  S. 2939. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na credit against tax for energy efficient appliances; to the Committee \non Finance.\n\n\n             the resource efficient appliance incentive act\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President I rise today to introduce an extremely \ntimely piece of legislation in light of the current energy crisis \nfacing our nation. This legislation, entitled ``The Resource Efficient \nAppliance Incentive Act,'' will provide a valuable incentive to \naccelerate and expand the production and market penetration of ultra \nenergy-efficient appliances. Senator Rockefeller is joining me in this \nbipartisan effort, along with Senators Jeffords and Lincoln.\n  Earlier this year, the appliance industry, the Department of Energy, \nand the nation's leading energy-efficiency and environmental \norganizations came together and agreed upon significantly higher energy \nefficiency standards for clothes washers to accompany the new energy \nefficiency standards for refrigerators that go into effect in July \n2001, as well as the new criteria for achieving the voluntary ``Energy \nStar'' designation. This agreement is significant considering the fact \nthat clothes washers and dryers, together with refrigerators, account \nfor approximately 15 percent of all household energy consumed in the \nUnited States.\n  This legislation will provide a tax credit to assist in the \ndevelopment of super energy-efficient washing machines and \nrefrigerators, and creates the incentives necessary to increase the \nproduction and sale of these appliances in the short term. \nManufacturers would be eligible to claim a credit of either $50 or \n$100, depending on efficiency level, for each super energy-efficient \nwashing machine produced between 2001 and 2006. Likewise, manufacturers \nwould be eligible to claim a credit of $50 or $100, depending on \nefficiency level, for each super energy-efficient refrigerator produced \nbetween 2001 and 2006. It is estimated that this tax credit will \nincrease the production and purchase of super energy-efficient washers \nby almost 200 percent, and the purchase of super energy-efficient \nrefrigerators by over 285 percent.\n  Equally important is the long-term environmental benefits of the \nexpanded use of these appliances. Over the life of the appliances, over \n200 trillion Btus of energy will be saved. This is the equivalent of \ntaking 2.3 million cars off the road or closing 6 coal-fired power \nplants for a year. In addition, the clothes washers will reduce the \namount of water necessary to wash clothes by 870 billion gallons, an \namount equal to the needs of every household in the city the size of \nPhoenix, Arizona for two years. Most importantly, the benefits to \nconsumers over the life of the washers and refrigerators from \noperational savings is estimated at nearly $1 billion.\n  In my home state of Iowa, this legislation would result in the \nproduction of\n\n[[Page S7688]]\n\n1.5 million supper energy-efficient washers and refrigerators over the \nnext six years, requiring over 100 new production jobs. I also expect \nIowans to save $11 million in operational costs over the life span of \nthe appliances, and 9 billion gallons of water--enough to supply \ndrinking water for the entire state for 30 years.\n  Lastly, I believe the total revenue loss of this credit compares \nextremely favorably to the estimated benefits of almost $1 billion to \nconsumers over the life of the super energy-efficient clothes washers \nand refrigerators from operational savings.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues, \nSenators Grassley, Jeffords, and Lincoln, in the introduction of \nlegislation to establish a tax credit incentive program for the \nproduction of super energy-efficient appliances. This creative proposal \nwill result in substantial environmental benefits for the nation at a \nvery small cost to the government.\n  Our bill would provide for either a $50 or $100 tax credit for the \nproduction and sale of energy efficient washing machines and \nrefrigerators. Today, these two appliances account for approximately 15 \npercent of the energy consumed in a typical home, which amounts to \nabout $21 billion in energy expenditures annually. Although most \nAmericans may not realize it, home appliances offer the potential for \nmajor energy savings across the nation.\n  Recently, several energy efficiency and environmental organizations \njoined with the appliance industry in endorsing considerably tougher \nenergy-efficiency standards for washing machines. These proposed \nstandards are now under active consideration by the Department of \nEnergy for incorporation in new regulations. The new standards will \nresult in tremendous energy-efficiency improvements that will have very \npositive environmental consequences over time. But there is a cost to \nthese new minimum standards and, as we often find, reluctance on the \npart of industry and the public to incur the additional costs necessary \nto achieve higher energy efficiencies. Home appliances can be made more \nefficient but it would mean greater costs to consumers. I believe there \nis a necessary balance between the objective of obtaining higher energy \nefficiencies that reduce air emissions and the higher product costs \nthat result. This is as true with respect to the purchase of appliances \nas it is with respect to the automobile, electric power, and other \nmarkets. I also recognize that there are understandable limits to the \ncosts that society is willing to bear through regulation to obtain \nhigher energy savings that result in environmental benefits.\n  However, that is not necessarily the limit at which point energy \nsavings can be achieved. While many consumers may not be willing to pay \nextra for more energy-efficient appliances, I believe they can be \nencouraged to do so through incentive programs. The legislation we are \nproposing today would do just that by giving manufacturers either a $50 \nor $100 tax credit for every super energy-efficient appliance produced \nprior to 2007. The idea is to give manufacturers the means by which to \ncreate the most appropriate incentives to get consumers to purchase \nwashing machines and refrigerators that are the most energy-efficient. \nThrough these tax credits we will accelerate the production and market \npenetration of leading-edge appliance technologies that create \nsignificant environmental benefits.\n  The expanded use of super energy-efficient appliances will have \nsignificant long-term environmental benefits. It is estimated that as a \nresult of this legislation over 200 trillion Btus of energy will be \nsaved over the life of the appliances manufactured with these credits. \nThis is the equivalent of taking 2.3 million cars off the road or \nclosing down six coal-fired power plants for a year. Energy savings of \nthis magnitude pay significant environmental dividends. For example, it \nis projected that with these energy savings carbon emissions, the \ncritical element in greenhouse gas emissions, will be reduced by over \n3.1 million metric tons. In addition, the super energy-efficient \nwashing machines will reduce the amount of water necessary to wash \nclothes by 870 billion gallons, or approximately the amount of water \nnecessary to meet the needs of every household in a state the size of \nWest Virginia for nearly 2 years.\n\n  Vice President Gore recently recommended a similar program of tax \nincentives for the purchase of home appliances as part of his energy \nsavings initiatives--and I congratulate him for his leadership in this \nregard. I am very glad the Vice President is considering ways to \nbalance how we produce energy savings and believe it is important that \nwe discuss this balance of interests as part of our national dialogue \nto improve our energy efficiency. I am also extremely pleased this \nlegislation is strongly supported by leading environmental \norganizations including the Natural Resources Defense Council, the \nAlliance to Save Energy, and the American Council for an Energy \nEfficient Economy.\n  The use of energy-efficient appliances is an important milestone on \nthe road to a cleaner, lower-cost energy future. This common-sense \ninitiative follows on the heels of other important bipartisan \nlegislation that I am proud to have sponsored or cosponsored during \nthis Congress to improve our nation's energy independence and the \nenvironment. During the first session of the 106th Congress, I was \njoined by Senators Hatch, Crapo, and Bryan in introducing the \nAlternative Fuel Promotion Act in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions and lower our consumption of imported oil. Earlier this year \nI joined Senators Jeffords and Hatch on the Alternative Fuels Tax \nIncentives Act, which would accomplish many of the same goals.\n  I am especially proud to have joined with Senator Bingaman and six of \nmy Democratic colleagues on the Energy Security Tax and Policy Act, a \ncomprehensive energy policy bill that looks to improve our nation's \nenergy independence while protecting the environment. Finally, it was \nmy pleasure last week to join with Environment and Public Works \nChairman Bob Smith and the Ranking Democratic Member Senator Baucus on \nthe Energy Efficient Building Incentives Act, which promotes the \nconstruction of buildings 30-50 percent more efficient than today's \nstandard. As building energy use accounts for 35 percent of the air \npollution emissions nationwide and $250 billion per year in energy \nbills, this legislation could produce a dramatic benefit for our \nenvironment, and this country's long-term energy needs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 2940. A bill to authorize additional assistance for international \nmalaria control, and to provide for coordination and consultation in \nproviding assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 with \nrespect to malaria, HIV, and tuberculosis; read the first time.\n\n\n            global aids and tuberculosis relief act of 2000\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, earlier today, we approved the Helms \nsubstitute to H.R. 3519, ``Global AIDS and Tuberculosis Relief Act of \n2000.'' I was pleased to support this legislation, recognizing the need \nfor our country to support an enhanced effort to prevent and treat AIDS \nand tuberculosis abroad.\n  I was pleased to work with Chairman Helms, Senator Biden, Senator \nFrist, Senator Smith of Oregon, and other members of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee as this legislation was finalized, and, indeed, I \nwant to work closely with them on our continuing efforts to address the \nproblems of infectious diseases in the developing world.\n  For the reasons I will lay out today, I believe the aid we make \npossible in H.R. 3519 should be expanded to embrace not only HIV/AIDS \nand TB, but also malaria as well. In fact, I think it essential to make \nsure our foreign assistance program in Africa and the developing world \ncoordinates its activities closely among these three diseases.\n  With the support of Chairman Helms, Senator Biden, and Senator Frist \nin the Senate, and Chairman Leach in the House of Representatives, I \nhave drafted companion legislation to H.R. 3519 which make certain that \nU.S. efforts for all three diseases are well-coordinated.\n  Accordingly, I rise today to introduce S. 2940 the ``International \nMalaria Control Act of 2000''.\n  The World Health Organization estimates that there are 300 million to \n500 million cases of malaria each year. According to the World Health \nOrganization, more than 1 million persons are estimated to die due to \nmalaria each year.\n\n[[Page S7689]]\n\n  The problems related to malaria are often linked to the devastation \nof two other terrible diseases--Acquired Immunodeficiency Disease, that \nis AIDS, and tuberculosis. One of the unfortunate commonalities of \nthese diseases is that they all ravage sub-Saharan Africa and other \nparts of the underdeveloped world.\n  In addition to the one million malaria related deaths per year, about \n2.5 million persons die from AIDS and another 1.5 million people per \nyear die from tuberculosis.\n  The measure I introduce today centers on malaria control and calls \nfor close cooperation among federal agencies that are charged with \nfighting malaria, AIDS, and TB worldwide.\n  According to the National Institutes of Health, about 40 percent of \nthe world's population is at risk of becoming infected. About half of \nthose who die each year from malaria are children under nine years of \nage. Malaria kills one child each 30 seconds.\n  Although malaria is a public health problem in more than 90 \ncountries, more than 90 percent of all malaria cases are in sub-Saharan \nAfrica. In addition to Africa, large areas of Central and South \nAmerica, Haiti and the Dominican Republic, the Indian subcontinent, \nSoutheast Asia, and the Middle East are high risk malaria areas.\n  These high risk areas represent many of the world's poorest nations \nwhich complicates the battle against malaria as well as AIDS and TB.\n  Malaria is particularly dangerous during pregnancy. The disease \ncauses severe anemia and is a major factor contributing to maternal \ndeaths in malaria endemic regions. Research has found that pregnant \nmothers who are HIV-positive and have malaria are more likely to pass \non HIV to their children.\n  ``Airport malaria,'' the importing of malaria by international \naircraft and other conveyances is becoming more common as is the \nimportation of the disease by international travelers themselves; the \nUnited Kingdom reported 2,364 cases of malaria in 1997, all of them \nimported by travelers.\n  In the United States, of the 1,400 cases of malaria reported to the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention in 1998, the vast majority \nwere imported. Between 1970 and 1997, the malaria infection rate in the \nUnited States increased by about 40 percent.\n  In Africa, the projected economic impact of malaria in 2000 exceeds \n$3.6 billion. Malaria accounts for 20 to 40 percent of outpatient \nphysician visits and 10 to 15 percent of hospital visits in Africa.\n  Malaria is caused by a single-cell parasite that is spread to humans \nby mosquitoes. No vaccine is available and treatment is hampered by \ndevelopment of drug-resistant parasites and insecticide-resistant \nmosquitoes.\n\n  Our nation must play a leadership role in the development of a \nvaccine for malaria as well as vaccines for TB and for the causal agent \nof AIDS, the human immunodeficiency virus--HIV. In this regard I must \ncommend the President for his leadership in directing, back on March \n2nd, that a renewed effort be made to form new partnerships to develop \nand deliver vaccines to developing countries. I must also commend the \nBill and Melinda Gates foundation for pledging a substantial $750 \nmillion in financial support for this new vaccine initiative.\n  The private sector appears to be prepared to help meet this challenge \nas the four largest vaccine manufacturers, Merck, American Home \nProducts, Glaxo SmithKline Beecham, and Aventis Pharma, have all \nstepped to the plate in the quest for vaccines for HIV/AIDS, TB and \nmalaria. We must all recognize that the private sector pharmaceutical \nindustry, in close partnership with academic and government scientists, \nwill play a key role in the development of any vaccines for these \ndiseases.\n  Among the promising developments in recent months has been Secretary \nShalala directing the National Institutes of Health to convene a \nmeeting of experts from government, academia, and the private sector to \naddress impediments to vaccine development in the private sector. \nAnother goal of this first in a series of conferences on Vaccines for \nHIV/AIDS, Malaria, and Tuberculosis, held on May 22nd and 23rd, was to \nfoster public-private partnerships.\n  These ongoing NIH Conferences on Vaccines for HIV/AIDS, Malaria, and \nTuberculosis will address three basic questions: what are the \nscientific barriers to developing vaccines for malaria, TB and HIV/\nAIDS? What administrative, logistical and legal barriers stand in the \nway of malaria, TB and HIV/AIDS vaccines? And, finally, if vaccines are \ndeveloped how can they best be produced and distributed around the \nworld?\n  Each of these questions will be difficult to answer. Developing \nvaccines for malaria, TB, and HIV/AIDS will be a difficult task. While \neach vaccine will be different, there are commonalities such as the \nfact that the legal impediments and distributional issues may be very \nsimilar. Also, there is an unfortunate geographical overlap with \nrespects to the epidemics of malaria, TB, and HIV/AIDS. Ground zero is \nsub-Saharan Africa.\n  So while the ultimate goal is to end up with three vaccines, we must \nbe mindful that there is a close societal and scientific linkage \nbetween the tasks of developing and delivering vaccines and therapeutic \ntreatments for those at risk of malaria, TB and HIV/AIDS worldwide.\n  While the greatest immediate need is clearly in Africa and in other \nparts of the developing world, citizens of the United States and my \nconstituents in Utah stand to benefit from progress in the area of \nvaccine development.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/26/senate-section/article/S7689-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7689-S7691]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 309\n\n  At the request of Mr. McCain, the name of the Senator from Rhode \nIsland (Mr. L.

Res. 343\n\n       Whereas Israel's Magen David Adom Society has since 1930 \n     provided emergency relief to people in many countries in \n     times of need, pain, and suffering, regardless of nationality \n     or religious affiliation;\n       Whereas in the past year alone, the Magen David Adom \n     Society has provided invaluable humanitarian services in \n     Kosovo, Indonesia, Ethiopia, and Eritrea, as well as Greece \n     and Turkey in the wake of the earthquakes that devastated \n     these countries;\n       Whereas the American Red Cross has recognized the superb \n     and invaluable work done by the Magen David Adom Society and \n     considers the exclusion of the Magen David Adom Society from \n     the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement ``an \n     injustice of the highest order'';\n       Whereas the American Red Cross has repeatedly urged that \n     the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement \n     recognize the Magen David Adom Society as a full member, with \n     its emblem;\n       Whereas the Magen David Adom Society utilizes the Red \n     Shield of David as its emblem, in similar fashion to the \n     utilization of the Red Cross and Red Crescent by other \n     national societies;\n       Whereas the Red Cross and the Red Crescent have been \n     recognized as protective emblems under the Statutes of the \n     International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement;\n       Whereas the International Committee of the Red Cross has \n     ignored previous requests from the United States Congress to \n     recognize the Magen David Adom Society;\n       Whereas the Statutes of the International Red Cross and Red \n     Crescent Movement state that it ``makes no discrimination as \n     to nationality, race, religious beliefs, class or political \n     opinions,'' and it ``may not take sides in hostilities or \n     engage at any time in controversies of a political, racial, \n     religious or ideological nature'';\n       Whereas although similar national organizations of Iraq, \n     North Korea, and Afghanistan are recognized as full members \n     of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, the \n     Magen David Adom Society has been denied membership since \n     1949;\n       Whereas in the six fiscal years 1994 through 1999, the \n     United States Government provided a total of $631,000,000 to \n     the International Committee of the Red Cross and $82,000,000 \n     to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent \n     Societies; and\n       Whereas in fiscal year 1999 alone, the United States \n     Government provided $119,500,000 to the International \n     Committee of the Red Cross and $7,300,000 to the \n     International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent \n     Societies: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the International Committee on the Red Cross should \n     immediately recognize the Magen David Adom Society and the \n     Magen David Adom Society should be granted full membership in \n     the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement;\n       (2) the International Federation of Red Cross and Red \n     Crescent Societies should grant full membership to the Magen \n     David Adom Society immediately following recognition by the \n     International Committee of the Red Cross of the Magen David \n     Adom Society;\n       (3) the Magen David Adom Society should not be required to \n     give up or diminish its use of its emblem as a condition for \n     immediate and full membership in the International Red Cross \n     and Red Crescent Movement; and\n       (4) the Red Shield of David should be accorded the same \n     recognition under international law as the Red Cross and the \n     Red Crescent.\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, today I am introducing a resolution \nexpressing the sense of the Senate that the International Red Cross and \nRed Crescent Movement should recognize and admit to full membership \nIsrael's Magen David Adom Society with its emblem, the Red Shield of \nDavid. I thank Senators Lieberman, Hagel, Helms, and Lugar for joining \nme as original cosponsors of this important resolution.\n  The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement is the largest \nhumanitarian network in the world. The Movement has many components, \nincluding the International Committee of the Red Cross (the ICRC--the \nSwiss-based founding institution of the Movement that serves as a \nneutral intermediary in armed conflict areas) and the International \nFederation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (the Federation, \nwhich groups together the Movement's 176 recognized national societies \nand coordinates international disaster relief and refugee assistance in \nnon-conflict areas).\n  The Red Shield of David has been in use and recognized de facto since \n1930 as the distinctive emblem of the medical and first aid services of \nthe Jewish population in Palestine and, after 1948, the state of \nIsrael. Israel signed the Geneva Conventions in 1949. The new state of \nIsrael therefore attempted to have the Red Shield of David recognized \nin the Geneva Conventions as an alternative to the red cross, the red \ncrescent, and the red lion and sun. In a secret ballot, however, \nIsrael's request was rejected, 22 to 21. The end result was that \nIsrael's equivalent of the Red Cross, Magen David Adom (MDA), was \nrelegated to non-voting observer status and thereby effectively \nexcluded from the Movement.\n  In rejecting the Red Shield of David, and excluding Israel's national \nsociety from the Movement, the 1949 diplomatic convention established \nthe principle that only those already using an exceptional sign--that \nis, a non-Red Cross emblem--had the right to continue using it. All new \nnational societies would have to adopt the Red Cross. However, the \nadmission of 25 new Red Crescent societies since 1949 demonstrates the \ninconsistency with which this principle has been applied.\n  Despite MDA's exclusion from the Movement, it has continuously played \nan active role in disaster assistance worldwide, recently helping to \nrescue trapped civilians following the 1999 earthquakes in Turkey and \nGreece. Israeli medical teams were also among the first to assist \nvictims of severe flooding in Mozambique this year. ICRC officials have \npraised MDA for its ``life-saving work'' and report they have \nmaintained ``excellent working relations'' with the MDA for decades.\n  The existing Protocols of the Geneva Conventions provide for two \ndifferent uses of the Movement emblem: ``protective,'' whcih is used \nfor protective purposes in armed conflicts and requires the use of a \nsingle unique emblem, and ``indicative,'' which is used for \nidentification purposes in non-conflict circumstances, and therefore \nallows for the existence of several emblems. Currently, negotiations \nare underway to add a possible third Protocol to the Geneva Conventions \nto create a new neutral emblem and allow for MDA recognition with its \nemblem. However, before these negotiations can translate into formal \nrecognition, significant procedural hudles must be overcome, including \nsuper-majority votes of three bodies and ratification by member nations \nthat could take years. Meanwhile, the American Red Cross has been \npursuing other approaches that would allow for the recognition of MDA \nand its emblem without the introduction of a third Protocol.\n  The resolution I am introducing today would help facilitate the \nnegotiating process by putting the Senate on record in support of MDA \nrecognition at a critical time in these negotiations. The House of \nRepresentatives passed a similar resolution on May 3, 2000. The Senate, \nhowever, last announced its support of recognition of MDA and its \nemblem over 12 years ago.\n  Over the last six years, the United States Government has provided \nthe ICRC and the Federation with $713 million. Once again, the United \nStates Senate should urge the International Red Cross and Red Crescent \nMovement to recognize the Red Shield of David emblem and admit MDA for \nfull membership in the Movement.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution to encourage the \nInternational Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement to recognize Israel's \nMagen David Adom society and its emblem, the Red Shield of David.\n\n[[Page S7692]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/26/senate-section/article/S7691-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7691-S7692]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 343--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \nINTERNATIONAL RED CROSS AND RED CRESCENT MOVEMENT SHOULD RECOGNIZE AND \n  ADMIT TO FULL MEMBERSHIP ISRAEL'S MAGEN DAVID ADOM SOCIETY WITH ITS \n EMBLEM, THE RED SHIELD OF DAVID; TO THE COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN RELATIONS\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Helms, and \nMr. Lugar) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

Res. 344\n\n       Whereas, in 1999 the 6 largest hub-and-spoke airlines in \n     the United States accounted for nearly 80 percent of the \n     revenue passenger miles flown by domestic airlines,\n       Whereas, according to Department of Transportation \n     statistics, a combined United Airlines and US Airways would \n     result in at least 20 airline hub airports in the United \n     States where a single airline and its affiliate air carriers \n     would carry more than 50 percent of the passenger traffic;\n       Whereas, the Department of Transportation and the General \n     Accounting Office have documented that air fares are \n     relatively higher at those airline hub airports where a \n     single airline carries more than 50 percent of the passenger \n     traffic;\n       Whereas, a combined United Airlines and US Airways would \n     hold approximately 40 percent of the air carrier takeoff and \n     landing slots at the 4 high density airports, even taking \n     into account the parties' planned divestiture of slots at \n     Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport;\n       Whereas, most analysts agree that a United Airlines-US \n     Airways merger would lead to other merger in the airline \n     industry, likely resulting in combinations that would reduce \n     the 6 largest domestic hub-and-spoke airlines to 3 airlines;\n       Whereas, media reports indicate that American Airlines has \n     made a tangible offer to purchase Northwest Airlines and that \n     Delta Air Lines and Continental Airlines have engaged in \n     merger negotiations;\n       Whereas, it would be difficult for the Department of \n     Transportation and other responsible Federal agencies of \n     jurisdiction to disapprove subsequent airline merger \n     proposals if the government allows the largest domestic \n     airline, in terms of total operating revenue and revenue \n     passenger miles flown in 1999, United Airlines, to merge with \n     the sixth largest airline, US Airways, making United Airlines \n     substantially bigger than its next largest competitor;\n       Whereas, 3 larger domestic airlines will have substantially \n     increased market power, and would have the ability to use \n     that market power to drive low fare competitors out of direct \n     competition and to thwart new airline entry into the \n     marketplace;\n       Whereas, the Department of Transportation credits nearly \n     all of the benefits of deregulation (a reported $6.3 billion \n     in annual savings to airline passengers) to the entry and \n     existence of low fare airline competitors in the marketplace;\n       Whereas, a combined United Airlines and US Airways, \n     including their commuter airline partners, would be the only \n     carrier offering nonstop flights between at least 26 domestic \n     airports in 12 States;\n       Whereas, in 1999 United Airlines and US Airways enplaned 22 \n     percent of all revenue passengers flown by domestic airlines;\n       Whereas, the transition from 6 major airlines to 3 would \n     likely result in less competition and higher fares, giving \n     consumers fewer choices and decreased customers service;\n       Whereas, it is the role of the Senate Committee on \n     Commerce, Science, and Transportation and, more specifically \n     the Subcommittee on Aviation, to conduct oversight of the \n     aviation industry and to promote consumers' receiving a basic \n     level of airline customer service;\n       Whereas, the Air Transport Association member air carriers \n     agreed to an Airline Customer Service Commitment to improve \n     the current level of customer service in the airline \n     industry;\n       Whereas, in an interim oversight report, the Department of \n     Transportation Inspector General recently concluded that the \n     results are mixed with respect to the effectiveness of the \n     efforts of the major airlines to implement their Airline \n     Customer Service Commitment;\n       Whereas, the combination of 2 entities as large as United \n     Airlines and US Airways could cause at least short-term \n     disruptions in service;\n       Whereas, according to the Department of Transportation \n     statistics for the month of May 2000, for the 10 major \n     airlines, a combined United Airlines and US Airways would \n     have had the lowest percentage of ontime flight arrivals, the \n     highest percentage of flight operations canceled, the second \n     highest rate of consumer complaints, and the second highest \n     rate of mishandled baggage: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate expresses concern about the proposed United \n     Airlines-US Airways merger because of its potential to leave \n     consumers with fewer travel options, higher fares, and \n     lowered levels of service; and\n       (2) it is the sense of the Senate that the potential \n     consumer detriments from the proposed United Airlines-US \n     Airways merger outweigh the potential consumer benefits.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by the Commerce \nCommittee Aviation Subcommittee Chairman, Senator Gorton, to introduce \na Senate resolution expressing our strong reservations about the \nproposed merger of United Airlines and US Airways.\n  Through Commerce Committee deliberations, Senator Gorton and I have \ncarefully analyzed the proposed merger, as well as its long-term \nconsumer effects. We conclude that whatever air travelers stand to gain \nfrom the merger is outweighed by what they stand to lose.\n  The public interest would likely be harmed by a United Airlines-US \nAirways merger. First, almost all analysts agree that the merger would \ntrigger additional consolidation in the airline industry. The six \nlargest hub-and- spoke carriers in the country would likely become the \n``big three.'' Everything else being equal, basic economic principles \nsuggest that consumers are better served by having six competitors in a \nmarket rather than three.\n  Even at this preliminary date, our experience bears out the \nprediction of additional industry consolidation. American Airlines has \nalready made an offer for Northwest Airlines. Delta Air Lines and \nContinental have reportedly engaged in merger negotiations.\n  Consolidation among these network carriers poses additional problems \nfor the flying public. The likely result of fewer carriers is more \nsingle-carrier concentration at hub airports across the country. \nStudies by the Department of Transportation, the General Accounting \nOffice, and others consistently conclude that air fares are relatively \nhigher at hub airports ``dominated'' by a single carrier.\n  Important new entry in the airline industry would be hurt by \nconsolidation among the major airlines. The mega-carriers would have \nadditional resources to engage in fierce and prolonged behavior \ndesigned to drive new competitors out of the market, and to single \npotential entrants that they dare not compete with the incumbent.\n  Today, many new entrants simply choose not to enter the major \nairlines' hub markets because they fear they cannot survive a sustained \nhead-to-head battle. A United-US Airways merger, and the consolidation \nthat would ensue, would further entrench the incumbent air carriers' \npositions.\n  I admit that there are benefits associated with the proposed United-\nUS Airways merger. The carriers, for instance, tout ``seamless'' \nconnections to international destinations, an expanded frequent flyer \nprogram, and similar benefits that should appeal to travelers on the \nUnited-US Airways system.\n  United and US Airways also applaud new service to a multitude of \ndestinations as a consequence of the merger. It is important to note, \nhowever, that what is new to United is not exactly new to the flying \npublic, since United's ``new'' service is made up of flights that are \nnow offered by US Airways.\n  Again, the point is that the anti-competitive harm posed by the \nproposed United-US Airways merger outweighs its benefits. And that \nconclusion does not even take into account the customer service \nproblems associated with integrating the work forces of two or more \nmajor airlines.\n  I want to underscore that this resolution is designed to express our \nconcerns about the proposed United-US Airways merger. It does not seek \nto force any federal agency or department to take any specific action \nwith respect to the proposed merger. However, our concerns for the \nconsumer are of such a significant nature that we are compelled to \nintroduce this resolution.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nthe father of airline deregulation, Prof. Alfred Kahn. His letter \noutlines his preliminary concerns with the proposed United-U.S. Airways \nmerger.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                               Alfred E. Kahn,\n\n                                   Ithaca, New York, June 9, 2000.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, \n         U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: I'm very sorry that I can't accept \n     your invitation to testify before your Committee on June \n     20th, and hope that you will regard the arrival that day of\n\n[[Page S7693]]\n\n     my son and his family from Australia, for a brief visit, as a \n     sufficient reason. I particularly regret my inability to take \n     advantage of that opportunity to renew our acquaintance.\n       Your Ann Choiniere has asked me to offer, as a substitute, \n     a statement of my--as yet only provisional--opinions about \n     the proposed merger of United Airlines and US Airways. I am \n     happy to do so, even though, to repeat, I have by no means a \n     settled final opinion about whether or not it should be \n     approved.\n       I do urge you to give careful consideration to its possible \n     anticompetitive effects, however. The central premise of \n     deregulation was that competition would best serve and \n     protect consumers; that meant vigorous enforcement of the \n     antitrust laws rather than direct regulation would become \n     critical in the new regime.\n       Primary responsibility for making this investigation rests, \n     of course, with the antitrust agencies. It is my \n     understanding, however, that the Antitrust Division's \n     resources are severely strained by their other obligations, \n     including other proceedings specifically involving the \n     airlines; if they lack the resources to look at this latest \n     proposed merger with great care, it seems to me that would be \n     a case of the government being penny-wise and pound-foolish. \n     Partly because of the possible direct effects of this merger \n     and, perhaps even more, because of its threatening to set off \n     a series of imitative mergers that would substantially \n     increase the concentration of the domestic industry, there is \n     a possible jeopardy here to the many billions of dollars that \n     consumers have been saving each year because off the \n     competition set off by deregulation.\n       It seems to me there are several levels at which to assess \n     these possible anticompetitive effects.\n       1. The first goes to the question of whether there are any \n     substantial number of particular routes on which United and \n     US Airways are already direct competitors. In the case of the \n     proposed merger of Continental/Northwest, the Antitrust \n     Division identified several very important routes between \n     their respective hubs (for example, Houston/Minneapolis-St. \n     Paul, Houston/Detroit, Cleveland/Minneapolis-St. Paul, \n     Cleveland/Memphis, Newark/Twin Cities) on which it appeared \n     those airlines were the two main if not only competitors, and \n     their merger would simply eliminate that competition. I do \n     not know to what extent there are similar overlaps between US \n     Airways and United.\n       2. In deregulating the airlines we relied very heavily on \n     the threat of potential as well as actual competition to \n     prevent exploitation of consumers: an important part of the \n     rationale of deregulation was the contestability of airline \n     markets. It seems to me highly likely that there are many \n     routes in which United or US Airways is a potential \n     competitor of the other. And it is my recollection that while \n     studies of the behavior of airline fares after deregulation \n     (notably one by Winston and Morrison and another by Gloria \n     Hurdle, Andrew Joskow and others) demonstrated that one \n     actual competitor in a market is worth two or three potential \n     contesters in the bush, they nevertheless also found that the \n     presence of a potential contester--identified as a carrier \n     already present at one or the other end of a route--did \n     constrain the fares incumbents could charge.\n       3. The likelihood that a United/US Airways merger would \n     indeed result in suppression of this potential competition \n     would seem to be enhanced by what I take it would be United's \n     explanation and justification--namely, its need for a strong \n     hub in the Northeast (commented on widely in the literature, \n     along with attributions of a similar need to American \n     Airlines). But if United really does feel the need for a big \n     hub in the Northeast, this suggests that it is indeed an \n     important potential competitor of US Airways, and that, \n     denied the ability to acquire the hub in the easiest, \n     noncompetitive fashion, by acquisition, it might instead feel \n     impelled to construct a hub of its own in direct competition \n     with US Airways; if some place within a couple of hundred \n     miles of Pittsburgh is the needed location--observe the hubs \n     of Continental at Cleveland and Delta at Cincinnati--then why \n     not, say, Buffalo for United? And while I have the impression \n     that the suppression of potential competition has not played \n     a major role in most merger litigation, it might properly be \n     definitive in this case, if only because, either explicitly \n     or implicitly, United is in effect conceding the potentiality \n     of that competition in its rationalizations of the merger \n     itself. The stronger its argument that it does indeed require \n     a big hub in the Northeast, the more that signifies that the \n     alternative, if it were denied the opportunity to acquire US \n     Airways, would be to construct a major competitive hub of its \n     own.\n       4. In addition, if indeed United's acquisition of a \n     competitive advantage by this acquisition--giving it the \n     first claim on traffic feed from US Airways' extensive \n     network--does increase the pressure on other carriers, \n     particularly American to merge similarly, then it seems to me \n     that is a possible competitive consequence of this particular \n     merger that should additionally be taken into account in \n     deciding whether it should be permitted.\n       I do hope you will undertake this important inquiry: we may \n     be confronting a very radical consolidation of the industry, \n     which cannot be a matter of indifference to people like you \n     and me, who have regarded deregulation as a striking success \n     thus far.\n       With warm personal regards,\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Alfred E. Kahn,\n             Robert Julius Thorne Professor of Political Economy, \n        Emeritus, Cornell University; Chairman, Civil Aeronautics \n                                                    Board 1977-78.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to highlight one point Professor \nKahn makes. He asserts that United's main justification for the merger \nis the need for a hub in the northeast. He goes on to question, \nhowever, why United doesn't create a hub in the northeast, rather than \nfollow the path of ``least competitive resistance'' by trying to \nacquire on its competitors' hubs. Mr. President, I ask the same \nquestion, and urge my colleagues to join Senator Gorton and me in \nsupporting this Senate resolution expressing our strong concerns about \na United-US Airways merger.\n  Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague, the distinguished \nchairman of the Aviation Subcommittee of the Commerce Committee who \njoined me in this resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, it is my purpose to join with the Senator \nfrom Arizona today in introducing this sense-of-the-Senate resolution. \nEach of us has thought long and hard about this proposed measure, as it \ngoes to the heart of our air transport system in the United States. I \nbelieve I speak for the Senator from Arizona as well as for myself in \nsaying this merger seems quite obviously to be beneficial both to \nUnited Airlines and to U.S. Airways. Public policy, however, does not \nconcern itself primarily with the benefits to the companies involved in \nthe competitive field. Public policy should concern itself with \nconsumer interests and with the interests of the millions of Americans \nwho use these airlines to fly from one place to another across the \nUnited States and for that matter overseas.\n  A merger of these two airlines would create by far the largest single \nairline in the United States. Inevitably, it seems to me that would \nlead to two more mergers, at the very least involving the other four of \nthe largest six airlines in the United States. In fact, it would be \nalmost impossible to mount a logical and rational defense against such \nmergers as those airlines would complain with real justification that \nthey were no longer competitive with the giant created by a United-U.S. \nAirways merger.\n  From our perspective, we need to consider what the ultimate outcome \nof this merger would be and the impact it would have on airline \npassengers all across the United States. There would be a significant \nincrease in the number of hubs overwhelmingly dominated by a single \nairline. There would be, in my view, a sharp decrease in the \ncompetition for airline travel in many cities across the United States. \nThere would certainly be the legitimate desire on the part of the \nremaining airlines to maximize their profits. That exists at the \npresent time. But these three mergers would vastly increase the ability \nof the airlines to do so in what would be distinctly a less competitive \nmarket.\n  I have attended hearings on this subject. I have had meetings with \nthe CEOs of both airlines seeking to merge and with some of those who \nhave apprehensions about that merger. I may say there are a number of \nways in which my mind was changed by those meetings. My first reaction \nto the proposal was that the creation of one new entrant--D.C. \nAirlines--was little more than a sham. The hearings and my meetings \nindicated to me that I was almost certainly wrong in that respect, and \nthat the proposed new owner and manager of D.C. Airlines did intend to \nbe a real airline to provide real service. But even if we grant the \npotential success of that airline, the net effect on competition \noverall would be highly negative on the part of this merger.\n  I join with the chairman of the Commerce Committee in this \nresolution. I do not think in the ultimate analysis that this merger is \nin the public interest. I believe it would lessen competition among \ndomestic airlines. I think it would not improve the way in which the \nairline passengers are treated, and probably, at least in the short \nterm and perhaps in the long term, would exacerbate an already \ntroublesome situation.\n\n[[Page S7694]]\n\n  I believe we would end up with three major airlines flying roughly 80 \npercent of all the passengers on domestic flights in the United States, \nand that the net result, by a significant margin from such a merger, \nwould not be in the public interest.\n  I hope this resolution becomes more formalized than it is just by the \nintroduction by these two Members. I suspect the chairman of the \nCommerce Committee will bring it up in the Commerce Committee. I hope \nit is here for consideration by the entire Senate promptly, and it will \nbe considered by the regulatory authorities that are dealing with the \nproposed merger at the present time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/26/senate-section/article/S7694-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7694-S7703]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n        TREASURY AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2001\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        LEAHY AMENDMENT NO. 4016\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. LEAHY submitted the following amendment intended to be proposed \nby him to the bill (H.R. 4871) making appropriations for the Treasury \nDepartment, the United States Postal Service, the Executive Office of \nthe President, and certain Independent Agencies, for the fiscal year \nending September 30, 2001, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec.   .

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) According to the Surgeon General of the United States, \n     the epidemic of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune \n     deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) will soon become the worst \n     epidemic of infectious disease in recorded history, eclipsing \n     both the bubonic plague of the 1300's and the influenza \n     epidemic of 1918-1919 which killed more than 20,000,000 \n     people worldwide.\n       (2) According to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/\n     AIDS (UNAIDS), more than 34,300,000 people in the world today \n     are living with HIV/AIDS, of which approximately 95 percent \n     live in the developing world.\n       (3) UNAIDS data shows that among children age 14 and under \n     worldwide, more than 3,800,000 have died from AIDS, more than \n     1,300,000 are living with the disease; and in one year \n     alone--1999--an estimated 620,000 became infected, of which \n     over 90 percent were babies born to HIV-positive women.\n       (4) Although sub-Saharan Africa has only 10 percent of the \n     world's population, it is home to more than 24,500,000--\n     roughly 70 percent--of the world's HIV/AIDS cases.\n       (5) Worldwide, there have already been an estimated \n     18,800,000 deaths because of HIV/AIDS, of which more than 80 \n     percent occurred in sub-Saharan Africa.\n       (6) The gap between rich and poor countries in terms of \n     transmission of HIV from mother to child has been increasing. \n     Moreover, AIDS threatens to reverse years of steady progress \n     of child survival in developing countries. UNAIDS believes \n     that by the year 2010, AIDS may have increased mortality of \n     children under 5 years of age by more than 100 percent in \n     regions most affected by the virus.\n       (7) According to UNAIDS, by the end of 1999, 13,200,000 \n     children have lost at least one parent to AIDS, including \n     12,100,000 children in sub-Saharan Africa, and are thus \n     considered AIDS orphans.\n       (8) At current infection and growth rates for HIV/AIDS, the \n     National Intelligence Council estimates that the number of \n     AIDS orphans worldwide will increase dramatically, \n     potentially increasing threefold or more in the next 10 \n     years, contributing to economic decay, social fragmentation, \n     and political destabilization in already volatile and \n     strained societies. Children without care or hope are often \n     drawn into prostitution, crime, substance abuse, or child \n     soldiery.\n\n[[Page S7695]]\n\n       (9) Donors must focus on adequate preparations for the \n     explosion in the number of orphans and the burden they will \n     place on families, communities, economies, and governments. \n     Support structures and incentives for families, communities, \n     and institutions which will provide care for children \n     orphaned by HIV/AIDS, or for the children who are themselves \n     afflicted by HIV/AIDS, will be essential.\n       (10) The 1999 annual report by the United Nations \n     Children's Fund (UNICEF) states ``[t]he number of orphans, \n     particularly in Africa, constitutes nothing less than an \n     emergency, requiring an emergency response'' and that \n     ``finding the resources needed to help stabilize the crisis \n     and protect children is a priority that requires urgent \n     action from the international community.''.\n       (11) The discovery of a relatively simple and inexpensive \n     means of interrupting the transmission of HIV from an \n     infected mother to the unborn child--namely with nevirapine \n     (NVP), which costs US$4 a tablet--has created a great \n     opportunity for an unprecedented partnership between the \n     United States Government and the governments of Asian, \n     African and Latin American countries to reduce mother-to-\n     child transmission (also known as ``vertical transmission'') \n     of HIV.\n       (12) According to UNAIDS, if implemented this strategy will \n     decrease the proportion of orphans that are HIV-infected and \n     decrease infant and child mortality rates in these developing \n     regions.\n       (13) A mother-to-child antiretroviral drug strategy can be \n     a force for social change, providing the opportunity and \n     impetus needed to address often long-standing problems of \n     inadequate services and the profound stigma associated with \n     HIV-infection and the AIDS disease. Strengthening the health \n     infrastructure to improve mother-and-child health, antenatal, \n     delivery and postnatal services, and couples counseling \n     generates enormous spillover effects toward combating the \n     AIDS epidemic in developing regions.\n       (14) United States Census Bureau statistics show life \n     expectancy in sub-Saharan Africa falling to around 30 years \n     of age within a decade, the lowest in a century, and project \n     life expectancy in 2010 to be 29 years of age in Botswana, 30 \n     years of age in Swaziland, 33 years of age in Namibia and \n     Zimbabwe, and 36 years of age in South Africa, Malawi, and \n     Rwanda, in contrast to a life expectancy of 70 years of age \n     in many of the countries without a high prevalence of AIDS.\n       (15) A January 2000 United States National Intelligence \n     Estimate (NIE) report on the global infectious disease threat \n     concluded that the economic costs of infectious diseases--\n     especially HIV/AIDS--are already significant and could reduce \n     GDP by as much as 20 percent or more by 2010 in some sub-\n     Saharan African nations.\n       (16) According to the same NIE report, HIV prevalence among \n     militias in Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo \n     are estimated at 40 to 60 percent, and at 15 to 30 percent in \n     Tanzania.\n       (17) The HIV/AIDS epidemic is of increasing concern in \n     other regions of the world, with UNAIDS estimating that there \n     are more than 5,600,000 cases in South and South-east Asia, \n     that the rate of HIV infection in the Caribbean is second \n     only to sub-Saharan Africa, and that HIV infections have \n     doubled in just two years in the former Soviet Union.\n       (18) Despite the discouraging statistics on the spread of \n     HIV/AIDS, some developing nations--such as Uganda, Senegal, \n     and Thailand--have implemented prevention programs that have \n     substantially curbed the rate of HIV infection.\n       (19) AIDS, like all diseases, knows no national boundaries, \n     and there is no certitude that the scale of the problem in \n     one continent can be contained within that region.\n       (20) Accordingly, United States financial support for \n     medical research, education, and disease containment as a \n     global strategy has beneficial ramifications for millions of \n     Americans and their families who are affected by this \n     disease, and the entire population which is potentially \n     susceptible.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are to--\n       (1) help prevent human suffering through the prevention, \n     diagnosis, and treatment of HIV/AIDS; and\n       (2) help ensure the viability of economic development, \n     stability, and national security in the developing world by \n     advancing research to--\n       (A) understand the causes associated with HIV/AIDS in \n     developing countries; and\n       (B) assist in the development of an AIDS vaccine.\n\n                  Subtitle A--United States Assistance\n\n     SEC. 111.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``International Tuberculosis \n     Control Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 202. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Since the development of antibiotics in the 1950s, \n     tuberculosis has been largely controlled in the United States \n     and the Western World.\n       (2) Due to societal factors, including growing urban decay, \n     inadequate health care systems, persistent poverty, \n     overcrowding, and malnutrition, as well as medical factors, \n     including the HIV/AIDS epidemic and the emergence of multi-\n     drug resistant strains of tuberculosis, tuberculosis has \n     again become a leading and growing cause of adult deaths in \n     the developing world.\n       (3) According to the World Health Organization--\n       (A) in 1998, about 1,860,000 people worldwide died of \n     tuberculosis-related illnesses;\n       (B) one-third of the world's total population is infected \n     with tuberculosis; and\n       (C) tuberculosis is the world's leading killer of women \n     between 15 and 44 years old and is a leading cause of \n     children becoming orphans.\n       (4) Because of the ease of transmission of tuberculosis, \n     its international persistence and growth pose a direct public \n     health threat to those nations that had previously largely \n     controlled the disease. This is complicated in the United \n     States by the growth of the homeless population, the rate of \n     incarceration, international travel, immigration, and HIV/\n     AIDS.\n       (5) With nearly 40 percent of the tuberculosis cases in the \n     United States attributable to foreign-born persons, \n     tuberculosis will never be controlled in the United States \n     until it is controlled abroad.\n       (6) The means exist to control tuberculosis through \n     screening, diagnosis, treatment, patient compliance, \n     monitoring, and ongoing review of outcomes.\n       (7) Efforts to control tuberculosis are complicated by \n     several barriers, including--\n       (A) the labor intensive and lengthy process involved in \n     screening, detecting, and treating the disease;\n       (B) a lack of funding, trained personnel, and medicine in \n     virtually every nation with a high rate of the disease;\n       (C) the unique circumstances in each country, which \n     requires the development and implementation of country-\n     specific programs; and\n       (D) the risk of having a bad tuberculosis program, which is \n     worse than having no tuberculosis program because it would \n     significantly increase the risk of the development of more \n     widespread drug-resistant strains of the disease.\n       (8) Eliminating the barriers to the international control \n     of tuberculosis through a well-structured, comprehensive, and \n     coordinated worldwide effort would be a significant step in \n     dealing with the increasing public health problem posed by \n     the disease.\n\n     SEC. 203. ASSISTANCE FOR TUBERCULOSIS PREVENTION, TREATMENT, \n                   CONTROL, AND ELIMINATION.\n\n       Section 104(c) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 \n     U.S.C. 2151b(c)), as amended by section 111(a) of this Act, \n     is further amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(7)(A) Congress recognizes the growing international \n     problem of tuberculosis and the impact its continued \n     existence has on those nations that had previously largely \n     controlled the disease. Congress further recognizes that the \n     means exist to control and treat tuberculosis, and that it is \n     therefore a major objective of the foreign assistance program \n     to control the disease. To this end, Congress expects the \n     agency primarily responsible for administering this part--\n       ``(i) to coordinate with the World Health Organization, the \n     Centers for Disease Control, the National Institutes of \n     Health, and other organizations toward the development and \n     implementation of a comprehensive tuberculosis control \n     program; and\n       ``(ii) to set as a goal the detection of at least 70 \n     percent of the cases of infectious tuberculosis, and the cure \n     of at least 85 percent of the cases detected, in those \n     countries in which the agency has established development \n     programs, by December 31, 2010.\n       ``(B) There is authorized to be appropriated to the \n     President, $60,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 2001 and \n     2002 to be used to carry out this paragraph. Funds \n     appropriated under this subparagraph are authorized to remain \n     available until expended.''.\n\n                 TITLE III--ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITIES\n\n     SEC. 301. EFFECTIVE PROGRAM OVERSIGHT.\n\n       Section 635 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 \n     U.S.C. 2395) is amended by adding at the end thereof the \n     following new subsection:\n       ``(l) The Administrator of the agency primarily responsible \n     for administering part I may use funds made available under \n     that part to provide program and management oversight for \n     activities that are funded under that part and that are \n     conducted in countries in which the agency does not have a \n     field mission or office.''.\n\n     SEC. 302. TERMINATION EXPENSES.\n\n       Section 617 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 \n     U.S.C. 2367) is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``SEC. 617.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Indian Land Consolidation \n     Act Amendments of 2000''.\n\n                   TITLE I--INDIAN LAND CONSOLIDATION\n\n     SEC. 101. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) in the 1800's and early 1900's, the United States \n     sought to assimilate Indian people into the surrounding non-\n     Indian culture by allotting tribal lands to individual \n     members of Indian tribes;\n       (2) as a result of the allotment Acts and related Federal \n     policies, over 90,000,000 acres of land have passed from \n     tribal ownership;\n       (3) many trust allotments were taken out of trust status, \n     often without their owners consent;\n       (4) without restrictions on alienation, allotment owners \n     were subject to exploitation and their allotments were often \n     sold or disposed of without any tangible or enduring benefit \n     to their owners;\n       (5) the trust periods for trust allotments have been \n     extended indefinitely;\n       (6) because of the inheritance provisions in the original \n     treaties or allotment Acts, the ownership of many of the \n     trust allotments that have remained in trust status has \n     become fractionated into hundreds or thousands of undivided \n     interests, many of which represent 2 percent or less of the \n     total interests;\n       (7) Congress has authorized the acquisition of lands in \n     trust for individual Indians, and many of those lands have \n     also become fractionated by subsequent inheritance;\n       (8) the acquisitions referred to in paragraph (7) continue \n     to be made;\n       (9) the fractional interests described in this section \n     often provide little or no return to the beneficial owners of \n     those interests and the administrative costs borne by the \n     United States for those interests are inordinately high;\n       (10) in Babbitt v. Youpee (117 S Ct. 727 (1997)), the \n     United States Supreme Court found the application of section \n     207 of the Indian Land Consolidation Act (25 U.S.C. 2206) to \n     the facts presented in that case to be unconstitutional, \n     forcing the Department of the Interior to address the status \n     of thousands of undivided interests in trust and restricted \n     lands;\n       (11)(A) on February 19, 1999, the Secretary of Interior \n     issued a Secretarial Order which officially reopened the \n     probate of all estates where an interest in land was ordered \n     to escheat to an Indian tribe pursuant to section 207 of the \n     Indian Land Consolidation Act (25 U.S.C. 2206); and\n       (B) the Secretarial Order also directed appropriate \n     officials of the Bureau of Indian Affairs to distribute such \n     interests ``to the rightful heirs and beneficiaries without \n     regard to 25 U.S.C. 2206'';\n       (12) in the absence of comprehensive remedial legislation, \n     the number of the fractional interests will continue to grow \n     exponentially;\n       (13) the problem of the fractionation of Indian lands \n     described in this section is the result of a policy of the \n     Federal Government, cannot be solved by Indian tribes, and \n     requires a solution under Federal law.\n       (14) any devise or inheritance of an interest in trust or \n     restricted Indian lands is a matter of Federal law; and\n       (15) consistent with the Federal policy of tribal self-\n     determination, the Federal Government should encourage the \n     recognized tribal government that exercises jurisdiction over \n     a reservation to establish a tribal probate code for that \n     reservation.\n\n     SEC. 102. DECLARATION OF POLICY.\n\n       It is the policy of the United States--\n       (1) to prevent the further fractionation of trust \n     allotments made to Indians;\n       (2) to consolidate fractional interests and ownership of \n     those interests into usable parcels;\n       (3) to consolidate fractional interests in a manner that \n     enhances tribal sovereignty;\n       (4) to promote tribal self-sufficiency and self-\n     determination; and\n       (5) to reverse the effects of the allotment policy on \n     Indian tribes.\n\n     SEC. 103. AMENDMENTS TO THE INDIAN LAND CONSOLIDATION ACT.\n\n       The Indian Land Consolidation Act (25 U.S.C. 2201 et seq.) \n     is amended--\n       (1) in section 202--\n       (A) in paragraph (1), by striking ``(1) `tribe' '' and \n     inserting ``(1) `Indian tribe' or `tribe' '';\n       (B) by striking paragraph (2) and inserting the following:\n       ``(2) `Indian' means any person who is a member of any \n     Indian tribe or is eligible to become a member of any Indian \n     tribe, or any person who has been found to meet the \n     definition of `Indian' under a provision of Federal law if \n     the Secretary determines that using such law's definition of \n     Indian is consistent with the purposes of this Act;'';\n       (C) by striking ``and'' at the end of paragraph (3);\n       (D) by striking the period at the end of paragraph (4) and \n     inserting ``; and''; and\n       (E) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(5) `heirs of the first or second degree' means parents, \n     children, grandchildren, grandparents, brothers and sisters \n     of a decedent.'';\n       (2) in section 205--\n       (A) in the matter preceding paragraph (1)--\n       (i) by striking ``Any Indian'' and inserting ``(a) In \n     General.--Subject to subsection (b), any Indian'';\n       (ii) by striking the colon and inserting the following: ``. \n     Interests owned by an Indian tribe in a tract may be included \n     in the computation of the percentage of ownership of the \n     undivided interests in that tract for purposes of determining \n     whether the consent requirement under the preceding sentence \n     has been met.'';\n       (iii) by striking ``: Provided, That--''; and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(b) Conditions Applicable to Purchase.--Subsection (a) \n     applies on the condition that--'';\n       (B) in paragraph (2)--\n       (i) by striking ``If,'' and inserting ``if''; and\n       (ii) by adding ``and'' at the end; and\n       (C) by striking paragraph (3) and inserting the following:\n       ``(3) the approval of the Secretary shall be required for a \n     land sale initiated under this section, except that such \n     approval shall not be required with respect to a land sale \n     transaction initiated by an Indian tribe that has in effect a \n     land consolidation plan that has been approved by the \n     Secretary under section 204.'';\n       (3) by striking section 206 and inserting the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 206.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Indian Land Consolidation \n     Act Amendments of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) in the 1800's and early 1900's, the United States \n     sought to assimilate Indian people into the surrounding non-\n     Indian culture by allotting tribal lands to individual \n     members of Indian tribes;\n       (2) as a result of the allotment Acts and related Federal \n     policies, over 90,000,000 acres of land have passed from \n     tribal ownership;\n       (3) many trust allotments were taken out of trust status, \n     often without their owners consent;\n       (4) without restrictions on alienation, allotment owners \n     were subject to exploitation and their allotments were often \n     sold or disposed of without any tangible or enduring benefit \n     to their owners;\n       (5) the trust periods for trust allotments have been \n     extended indefinitely;\n       (6) because of the inheritance provisions in the original \n     treaties or allotment Acts, the ownership of many of the \n     trust allotments that have remained in trust status has \n     become fractionated into hundreds or thousands of interests, \n     many of which represent 2 percent or less of the total \n     interests;\n       (7) Congress has authorized the acquisition of lands in \n     trust for individual Indians, and many of those lands have \n     also become fractionated by subsequent inheritance;\n       (8) the acquisitions referred to in paragraph (7) continue \n     to be made;\n       (9) the fractional interests described in this section \n     provide little or no return to the beneficial owners of those \n     interests and the administrative costs borne by the United \n     States for those interests are inordinately high;\n       (10) in Babbitt v. Youpee (117 S Ct. 727 (1997)), the \n     United States Supreme Court found that the application of \n     section 207 of the Indian Land Consolidation Act (25 U.S.C. \n     2206) to the facts presented in that case to be \n     unconstitutional, forcing the Department of the Interior to \n     address the status of thousands of undivided interests in \n     trust and restricted lands;\n       (11)(A) on February 19, 1999, the Secretary of Interior \n     issued a Secretarial Order which officially reopened the \n     probate of all estates where an interest in land was ordered \n     to escheat to an Indian tribe pursuant to section 207 of the \n     Indian Land Consolidation Act (25 U.S.C. 2206); and\n       (B) the Secretarial Order also directed appropriate \n     officials of the Bureau of Indian Affairs to distribute such \n     interests ``to the rightful heirs and beneficiaries without \n     regard to 25 U.S.C. 2206'';\n       (12) in the absence of comprehensive remedial legislation, \n     the number of the fractional interests will continue to grow \n     exponentially;\n       (13) the problem of the fractionation of Indian lands \n     described in this section is the result of a policy of the \n     Federal Government, cannot be solved by Indian tribes, and \n     requires a solution under Federal law.\n\n[[Page S7705]]\n\n       (14) any devise or inheritance of an interest in trust or \n     restricted Indian lands is based on Federal law; and\n       (15) consistent with the Federal policy of tribal self-\n     determination, the Federal Government should encourage the \n     recognized tribal government that exercises jurisdiction over \n     a reservation to establish a tribal probate code for that \n     reservation.\n\n     SEC. 3. DECLARATION OF POLICY.\n\n       It is the policy of the United States--\n       (1) to prevent the further fractionation of trust \n     allotments made to Indians;\n       (2) to consolidate fractional interests and ownership of \n     those interests into usable parcels;\n       (3) to consolidate fractional interests in a manner that \n     enhances tribal sovereignty;\n       (4) to promote tribal self-sufficiency and self-\n     determination; and\n       (5) to reverse the effects of the allotment policy on \n     Indian tribes.\n\n     SEC. 4. AMENDMENTS TO THE INDIAN LAND CONSOLIDATION ACT.\n\n       The Indian Land Consolidation Act (25 U.S.C. 2201 et seq.) \n     is amended--\n       (1) in section 202--\n       (A) in paragraph (1), by striking ``(1) `tribe' '' and \n     inserting ``(1) `Indian tribe' or `tribe' '';\n       (B) by striking paragraph (2) and inserting the following:\n       ``(2) `Indian' means any person who is a member of any \n     Indian tribe or is eligible to become a member of any Indian \n     tribe at the time of the distribution of the assets of a \n     decedent's estate;'';\n       (C) by striking ``and'' at the end of paragraph (3);\n       (D) by striking the period at the end of paragraph (4) and \n     inserting ``; and''; and\n       (E) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(5) `heirs of the first or second degree' means parents, \n     children, grandchildren, grandparents, brothers and sisters \n     of a decedent.'';\n       (2) in section 205--\n       (A) in the matter preceding paragraph (1)--\n       (i) by striking ``Any Indian'' and inserting ``(a) In \n     General.--Subject to subsection (b), any Indian'';\n       (ii) by striking the colon and inserting the following: ``. \n     Interests owned by an Indian tribe in a tract may be included \n     in the computation of the percentage of ownership of the \n     undivided interests in that tract for purposes of determining \n     whether the consent requirement under the preceding sentence \n     has been met.'';\n       (iii) by striking ``: Provided, That--''; and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(b) Conditions Applicable to Purchase.--Subsection (a) \n     applies on the condition that--'';\n       (B) in paragraph (2)--\n       (i) by striking ``If,'' and inserting ``if''; and\n       (ii) by adding ``and'' at the end; and\n       (C) by striking paragraph (3) and inserting the following:\n       ``(3) the approval of the Secretary shall be required for a \n     land sale initiated under this section, except that such \n     approval shall not be required with respect to a land sale \n     transaction initiated by an Indian tribe that has in effect a \n     land consolidation plan that has been approved by the \n     Secretary under section 204.'';\n       (3) by striking section 206 and inserting the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 206.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. DeWine], for Mr. Campbell, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4019.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record Under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, on September 15, 1999, I introduced S. \n1586, the Indian Land Consolidation Act Amendments of 2000. At that \ntime I pledged to work with all interested parties to address the \nvexing problems associated with fractionated ownership of Indian lands. \nThese lands were carved out of Indian reservations in the late 19th and \nearly 20th centuries. Within only a few generations, the ownership of \nthe allotments was divided among dozens of the heirs of the original \nowners of these parcels. This situation has only grown worse as each \ndecade passes.\n  In 1983, Congress tried to solve fractionation when it enacted the \nIndian Land Consolidation Act (ILCA), P.L. 94-459. The ILCA prevented \nsmall undivided interests from passing by either devise or descent. \nOnly those interests that produced more than $100 in revenue in the \npreceding year were exempted. In 1987 the Supreme Court ruled in Hodel \nv. Irving, 481 U.S. 704, that those provisions of the ILCA violated the \n5th Amendment by taking property without just compensation.\n  Then in 1992, the General Accounting Office surveyed 12 Indian \nreservations with fractionated ownership and reported to Congress:\n\n\n[[Page S7709]]\n\n\n       BIA's workload for ownership records is substantial. The \n     agency maintains about 1.1 million records for the 12 \n     reservations. Over 60 percent of the records represent small \n     ownership interests of Indian individuals--some as small as \n     one four thousandth of 1 percent. (GAO/RCED-92-96BR)\n\n  In 1994, the Department of Interior began a national consultation \nwith tribal leaders and landowners concerning the need to address \nfractionation through a comprehensive legislative proposal. Based on \nthese consultations, in June 1997, the Administration submitted a \nlegislative proposal on land fractionation to Congress.\n  Also in 1997, the Supreme Court ruled in Babbitt v. Youpee, 519 U.S. \n234 that the 1984 amendments to the ILCA did not go far enough to alter \nthe Court's previous finding that the ILCA violated the 5th Amendment.\n  On November 4, 2000, the Senate Indian Affairs Committee (SCIA) held \na joint hearing on S. 1586 with the House Committee on Resources.\n  On March 23, 2000, the SCIA reported S. 1586. Relying on a suggestion \nin the Supreme Court's 1987 opinion, the reported bill allowed an owner \nto devise fractional interests of less than 2%, but eliminated the \nintestate descent of such interests. These interests were allowed to \n``escheat'' to the tribe exercising jurisdiction over the parcel. \nBecause of the controversy associated with the escheat provision, \nCommittee staff continued to work with interested parties to develop a \nproposal for addressing fractionation without the use of escheat.\n  On June 14, 2000, the SCIA reported S. 1586 with an amendment in the \nnature of a substitute. In response to concerns that probate reform \nshould be comprehensive, the reported version of the bill was not \nlimited to smaller fractional interests. Instead the bill addressed \nboth the problem of fractionated ownership and the loss of trust land \nthrough devise and descent. The bill provided that non-Indian heirs and \ndevisees would receive ``non-Indian interests in Indian land,'' rather \nthan fee title to trust and restricted land. In most instances, these \ninterests would operate as if they were a life estate in the interest.\n  S. 1586 was endorsed on June 28, 2000 by the National Congress of \nAmerican Indians (NCAI), the largest and most representative tribal \norganization in the Nation, through Resolution Jun-00-044. The \nResolution requested that the bill's sponsor continue to work with NCAI \nto address technical issues.\n  Throughout June and July, a concerted effort has been made to consult \nwith Indian tribes, landowners, and inter-tribal organizations, BIA \npersonnel, and interested academics to clarify and simplify the bill. \nFor example, in many instances a ``non-Indian estate in Indian land'' \nmight prove a more complicated interest than was necessary to achieve \nthe bill's objective. It was recommended that the bill's non-Indian \nestate should simply be replaced by an ordinary life estate.\n  A proposed amendment in the nature of a substitute has been produced. \nThe amendment differs from the version reported by the SCIA on June 14, \n2000 in the following ways:\n  The definition of ``Indian'' is amended. As reported on June 14, \n2000, the definition included members of Indian tribes and those \neligible for membership in an Indian tribe. The proposed amendment adds \na provision for: ``any person who has been found to meet the definition \nof `Indian' under a provision of Federal law if the Secretary \ndetermines that using such law's definition of Indian is consistent \nwith the purposes of this Act.'' This amendment will ensure that \nindividuals who are treated as Indians for other purposes of Federal \nlaw will also be treated as Indian for purposes of this Act.\n  Section 207 dealing with the devise and descent of interests in trust \nand restricted lands has been rewritten to provide that non-Indians \ninheriting interest in trust and restricted land will now receive life \nestates in place of ``non-Indian interests in Indian land.'' The owner \nof allotted land who does not have any Indian heirs may devise his \ninterest to non-Indian heirs. Such a devise may then reserve a life \nestate if the remainder interest is acquired by the tribe under section \n206(c).\n  Section 206(c), which allows Indian tribes to acquire interests \ndevised to non-Indians has been rewritten for clarity.\n  As reported on June 14, 2000, S. 1586 provided that interests of 5% \nor less that pass by intestate succession would be inherited with the \nright of survivorship to prevent further fractionation. Since the BIA \nis in the process of reforming its trust and probate management system, \nthe proposed amendment provides that this provision will not take \neffect until the Secretary certifies that the BIA has a process in \nplace to track interests held with the right of survivorship.\n  A separate subsection concerning gift deeds is now incorporated into \nanother section that allows the Secretary to approve conveyance of \ntrust land to Indians. Also, trust land may now be conveyed to Indians \nby a person of Indian ancestry who owns trust land, but does not meet \nthe ILCA''s definition of Indian.\n  A second title to S. 1586 includes the text from S. 1315 and its \nHouse counterpart H.R. 3181, which allow the Secretary of Interior to \napprove oil and gas leases on lands allotted to individual Navajo \nIndians, as long as the specified majority of owners of undivided \ninterests approve the transaction. S. 1315 and H.R. 3181 were \nintroduced at the request of the Navajo Allottee Association, Shii Shi \nKeyah.\n  I have described S. 1586 as the ``cornerstone'' of the Committee's \nefforts to reform the BIA's management of land fractionation. Without \nthis bill, interests will continue to fractionate. That is why the \nDepartment of the Interior continues to support this bill, even though \nit differs greatly from the Department's original proposal.\n  As far back as 1934, a member of the House of Representatives \nreferred to fractionated interests as: ``a meaningless system of minute \npartitioning in which all thought of the possible use of the land to \nsatisfy human needs is lost in a mathematical haze of bookkeeping.'' S. \n1586 provides a framework that will allow the Federal government, \ntribal governments, and those who own interests in allotments to begin \naddressing these issues.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe agreed to, the committee amendment be agreed to, as amended, the \nbill be read the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and any statements relating to the bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4019) was agreed to.\n  The committee amendment, in the nature of a substitute, as amended, \nwas agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 1586), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n\n                                S. 1586\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) in the 1800's and early 1900's, the United States \n     sought to assimilate Indian people into the surrounding non-\n     Indian culture by allotting tribal lands to individual \n     members of Indian tribes;\n       (2) as a result of the allotment Acts and related Federal \n     policies, over 90,000,000 acres of land have passed from \n     tribal ownership;\n       (3) many trust allotments were taken out of trust status, \n     often without their owners consent;\n       (4) without restrictions on alienation, allotment owners \n     were subject to exploitation and their allotments were often \n     sold or disposed of without any tangible or enduring benefit \n     to their owners;\n       (5) the trust periods for trust allotments have been \n     extended indefinitely;\n       (6) because of the inheritance provisions in the original \n     treaties or allotment Acts, the ownership of many of the \n     trust allotments that have remained in trust status has \n     become fractionated into hundreds or thousands of undivided \n     interests, many of which represent 2 percent or less of the \n     total interests;\n       (7) Congress has authorized the acquisition of lands in \n     trust for individual Indians, and many of those lands have \n     also become fractionated by subsequent inheritance;\n       (8) the acquisitions referred to in paragraph (7) continue \n     to be made;\n       (9) the fractional interests described in this section \n     often provide little or no return to the beneficial owners of \n     those interests and the administrative costs borne by the \n     United States for those interests are inordinately high;\n       (10) in Babbitt v. Youpee (117 S Ct. 727 (1997)), the \n     United States Supreme Court\n\n[[Page S7710]]\n\n     found the application of section 207 of the Indian Land \n     Consolidation Act (25 U.S.C. 2206) to the facts presented in \n     that case to be unconstitutional, forcing the Department of \n     the Interior to address the status of thousands of undivided \n     interests in trust and restricted lands;\n       (11)(A) on February 19, 1999, the Secretary of Interior \n     issued a Secretarial Order which officially reopened the \n     probate of all estates where an interest in land was ordered \n     to escheat to an Indian tribe pursuant to section 207 of the \n     Indian Land Consolidation Act (25 U.S.C. 2206); and\n       (B) the Secretarial Order also directed appropriate \n     officials of the Bureau of Indian Affairs to distribute such \n     interests ``to the rightful heirs and beneficiaries without \n     regard to 25 U.S.C. 2206'';\n       (12) in the absence of comprehensive remedial legislation, \n     the number of the fractional interests will continue to grow \n     exponentially;\n       (13) the problem of the fractionation of Indian lands \n     described in this section is the result of a policy of the \n     Federal Government, cannot be solved by Indian tribes, and \n     requires a solution under Federal law.\n       (14) any devise or inheritance of an interest in trust or \n     restricted Indian lands is a matter of Federal law; and\n       (15) consistent with the Federal policy of tribal self-\n     determination, the Federal Government should encourage the \n     recognized tribal government that exercises jurisdiction over \n     a reservation to establish a tribal probate code for that \n     reservation.\n\n     SEC. 102. DECLARATION OF POLICY.\n\n       It is the policy of the United States--\n       (1) to prevent the further fractionation of trust \n     allotments made to Indians;\n       (2) to consolidate fractional interests and ownership of \n     those interests into usable parcels;\n       (3) to consolidate fractional interests in a manner that \n     enhances tribal sovereignty;\n       (4) to promote tribal self-sufficiency and self-\n     determination; and\n       (5) to reverse the effects of the allotment policy on \n     Indian tribes.\n\n     SEC. 103. AMENDMENTS TO THE INDIAN LAND CONSOLIDATION ACT.\n\n       The Indian Land Consolidation Act (25 U.S.C. 2201 et seq.) \n     is amended--\n       (1) in section 202--\n       (A) in paragraph (1), by striking ``(1) `tribe' '' and \n     inserting ``(1) `Indian tribe' or `tribe' '';\n       (B) by striking paragraph (2) and inserting the following:\n       ``(2) `Indian' means any person who is a member of any \n     Indian tribe or is eligible to become a member of any Indian \n     tribe, or any person who has been found to meet the \n     definition of `Indian' under a provision of Federal law if \n     the Secretary determines that using such law's definition of \n     Indian is consistent with the purposes of this Act;'';\n       (C) by striking ``and'' at the end of paragraph (3);\n       (D) by striking the period at the end of paragraph (4) and \n     inserting ``; and''; and\n       (E) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(5) `heirs of the first or second degree' means parents, \n     children, grandchildren, grandparents, brothers and sisters \n     of a decedent.'';\n       (2) in section 205--\n       (A) in the matter preceding paragraph (1)--\n       (i) by striking ``Any Indian'' and inserting ``(a) In \n     General.--Subject to subsection (b), any Indian'';\n       (ii) by striking the colon and inserting the following: ``. \n     Interests owned by an Indian tribe in a tract may be included \n     in the computation of the percentage of ownership of the \n     undivided interests in that tract for purposes of determining \n     whether the consent requirement under the preceding sentence \n     has been met.'';\n       (iii) by striking ``: Provided, That--''; and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(b) Conditions Applicable to Purchase.--Subsection (a) \n     applies on the condition that--'';\n       (B) in paragraph (2)--\n       (i) by striking ``If,'' and inserting ``if''; and\n       (ii) by adding ``and'' at the end; and\n       (C) by striking paragraph (3) and inserting the following:\n       ``(3) the approval of the Secretary shall be required for a \n     land sale initiated under this section, except that such \n     approval shall not be required with respect to a land sale \n     transaction initiated by an Indian tribe that has in effect a \n     land consolidation plan that has been approved by the \n     Secretary under section 204.'';\n       (3) by striking section 206 and inserting the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 206.

Mr. President, it would be helpful to get a clarification \nfor the Record from the manager of H.R. 1167, the distinguished \nChairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs. I understand that \nH.R. 1167, the bill to amend the Indian Self-Determination and \nEducation Assistance Act to provide for further self-governance by \nIndian tribes, contains a provision that would allow Indian tribes to \npurchase prescription drugs from the Federal Supply Schedule for the \npurpose of providing health services to Indians under contract with the \nIndian Health Service.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I would be glad to clarify this matter for the \ndistinguished Senator from North Carolina. Your understanding is \ncorrect.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the able Senator. Moreover, I understand that the \ncommittee intends that the prescription drugs purchased off the Federal \nSupply Schedule can only be used for Indians whose health care is \nprovided by the tribe, and cannot be purchased or used for resale, nor \nmay they be dispensed to non-Indian employees of a tribe. Is that \ncorrect, Mr. Chairman?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. It is the Committee's intent that prescription drugs \npurchased off the Federal Supply Schedule, as authorized under H.R. \n1167, are for the exclusive use of tribal members, not for non-Indian \nemployees of a tribe. Furthermore, it is the intent of the committee \nthat prescription drugs purchased through access to the Federal Supply \nSchedule by tribes are not to be resold.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nagree to the amendments of the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof Senators Thurmond, Biden, and Leahy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio (Mr. DeWine) for Mr. Thurmond, Mr. \n     Biden, and Mr. Leahy, proposes an amendment numbered 4020.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To impose nondisclosure requirements, and for other purposes)\n\n       On page 14, beginning with line 21, strike through page 15, \n     line 20 and insert the following:\n       ``(3) Nondisclosure requirements.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Except as provided in paragraphs (1) and \n     (2), the Attorney General may apply to a court for an order \n     requiring the party to whom an administrative subpoena is \n     directed to refrain from notifying any other party of the \n     existence of the subpoena or court order for such period as \n     the court deems appropriate.\n       ``(B) Order.--The court shall enter such order if it \n     determines that there is reason to believe that notification \n     of the existence of the administrative subpoena will result \n     in--\n       ``(i) endangering the life or physical safety of an \n     individual;\n       ``(ii) flight from prosecution;\n       ``(iii) destruction of or tampering with evidence;\n       ``(iv) intimidation of potential witnesses; or\n       ``(v) otherwise seriously jeopardizing an investigation or \n     undue delay of a trial.\n       On page 16, line 9 insert ``, in consultation with the \n     Secretary of the Treasury,'' after ``eral''.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am very pleased that tonight the \nSenate is considering S. 2516, the Fugitive Apprehension Act. Senator \nBiden and I introduced this important legislation to help address the \nserious threat of federal and state fugitives. The need for it was \nclearly demonstrated in a hearing I held on this matter last month in \nmy subcommittee.\n  The number of wanted persons is truly alarming. There are over 38,000 \nfelony warrants outstanding in federal cases. There are over one-half \nmillion felony or other serious fugitives listed in the National Crime \nInformation Center database. Yet, this is far less than the actual \nnumber of dangerous fugitives roaming the streets because many states \ndo not put all dangerous wanted persons into the database. As recently \nreported in the Washington Post, California has 2.5 million unserved \nfelony and misdemeanor warrants, and Baltimore has 61,000.\n  While violent crime in the United States has been decreasing in \nrecent years, the number of serious fugitives has been climbing. The \nnumber of N.C.I.C. fugitives has doubled since 1987, and continues to \nrise steadily each year.\n  Fugitives represent not only an outrage to the rule of law, they are \nalso a serious threat to public safety. Many of\n\n[[Page S7717]]\n\nthem continue to commit additional crimes while they roam undetected.\n  The bill would provide $40 million dollars over three years for the \nMarshals Service to form fugitive task forces with state and local \nauthorities. The Marshals Service is the lead federal agency regarding \nthis matter. Task forces combine the expertise of the Marshals Service \nin these specialized investigations with the knowledge that local law \nenforcement has about their communities. This teamwork helps \nauthorities prioritize and apprehend large numbers of dangerous \ncriminals.\n  The legislation would also provide administrative subpoena authority, \nwhich would allow investigators to track down leads about wanted \npersons faster and more efficiently. Currently, the time it takes to \nget vital information, such as telephone or apartment rental records, \nthrough a formal court order can make the difference between whether a \nfugitive is apprehended or remains on the run.\n  This bill has been endorsed by various law enforcement organizations, \nincluding the National Sheriffs Association, the Fraternal Order of \nPolice, and the National Association of Police Organizations, and the \nsubpoena authority is supported by the Administration. This is an \nimportant step that we can take to help federal and state law \nenforcement address the serious fugitive threat that exists in our \ncountry.\n  I ask consent to have printed in the Record a section-by-section \nanalysis of the bill.\n  There being no objection, the analysis was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n     Section 1. Short title\n       The title is the ``Fugitive Apprehension Act of 2000.''\n     Section 2. Fugitive apprehension task forces\n       The purpose of this provision is to assist Federal, state \n     and local law enforcement authorities by forming multi-agency \n     task forces around the country to locate and apprehend \n     fugitives wanted by their jurisdictions.\n       The bill would authorize to be appropriated to the U.S. \n     Marshals Service $40 million dollars over three years to \n     establish new, permanent Fugitive Apprehension Task Forces \n     and supplement the efforts of task forces already operating \n     in areas throughout the United States. The Fugitive \n     Apprehension Task Forces would be totally dedicated to \n     locating and apprehending fugitives under the direction of a \n     National Director and not under a specific District to insure \n     that they are not utilized for other Marshals Service \n     missions.\n     Section 3. Administrative subpoena authority\n       This section of the bill creates a new section 1075 in \n     Title 18, United States Code, providing for administrative \n     subpoena authority to ascertain the whereabouts of fugitives.\n       Section 1075(a) contains various definitions for \n     ``fugitive,'' ``investigation,'' and ``state,'' that delimit \n     the scope of the section's operative provisions.\n       Section 1075(b) provides for the issuance of administrative \n     subpoenas in investigations as defined in section 1075(a). \n     The Attorney General may subpoena witnesses for the \n     production of records the Attorney General finds, based on \n     articulable facts, are relevant to discerning the whereabouts \n     of a fugitive. A subpoena must describe the records or items \n     required to be produced and prescribe a return date within a \n     reasonable period of time within which the records or items \n     can be assembled and made available. Witnesses may not be \n     required to travel more than 500 miles from the place of \n     service of the subpoena, and must be paid the same fees and \n     mileage paid witnesses in United States courts.\n       Section 1075(c) provides for methods of service of a \n     subpoena under this section.\n       Section 1075(d) empowers courts to enforce subpoenas issued \n     under this section. Subpoena recipients may move to modify or \n     quash an administrative subpoena within 20 days of service of \n     the subpoena, or prior to the return date, whichever period \n     is shorter, on specified grounds.\n       Section 1075(e) provides that the Attorney General must \n     issue a report to the Congress about the use of this section, \n     for the first three years following enactment of the statute.\n       Section 1075(f) provides that the Attorney General shall \n     issue guidelines governing the issuance of administrative \n     subpoenas aimed at the apprehension of fugitives as \n     authorized by this section. The guidelines shall mandate that \n     no such subpoenas issue absent review and approval of senior \n     supervisory personnel within the respective investigative \n     agency or component of the Department of Justice.\n       Section 1075(g) provides that administrative subpoenas \n     issued to a provider of electronic communication service (as \n     defined in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2510) or remote computing service \n     (as defined in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2711) may include delayed \n     notification and nondisclosure provisions consistent with 18 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 2705. Paragraph (g) further provides that \n     subpoenas issued under this section for financial records are \n     subject to the Attorney General's power to request a delayed \n     customer notice pursuant to 12 U.S.C. Sec. 3409. \n     Administrative subpoenas issued pursuant to this section \n     should be governed, where appropriate, by 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2705 \n     and 12 U.S.C. Sec. 3409. Otherwise, the Attorney General may \n     apply for a court order imposing a non-disclosure period for \n     specified reasons.\n       Section 1075(h) provides that good faith compliance with a \n     subpoena issued under this section, and good faith compliance \n     with a nondisclosure order under this provision (whether \n     incorporated in a subpoena by the Attorney General or \n     separately ordered by a court), will be immunized from civil \n     liability in state and federal courts.\n     Section 4. Study and report of the use of administrative \n         subpoenas\n       This section requires the Attorney General, in consultation \n     with the Secretary of the Treasury, to complete a study of \n     the use of administrative subpoena power, and report to the \n     Congress by December 31, 2001.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is passing S. \n2516, ``The Fugitive Apprehension Act of 2000.''\n  During Senate Judiciary Committee consideration of this legislation, \nwe were able to reconcile in the Thurmond-Biden-Leahy substitute \namendment to S. 2516, the significant differences between that bill, as \nintroduced, and S. 2761, ``The Capturing Criminals Act,'' which I \nintroduced with Senator Kohl on June 21, 2000. I commend Senators \nThurmond and Biden for their leadership on this issue and am glad we \nwere able to make a number of changes to the bill to ensure that the \nauthority granted is consistent with privacy and other appropriate \nsafeguards.\n  As a former prosecutor, I am well aware that fugitives from justice \nare an important problem and that their capture is an essential \nfunction of law enforcement. According to the FBI, nearly 550,000 \npeople are currently fugitives from justice on federal, state, and \nlocal felony charges combined. This means that there are almost as many \nfugitive felons as there are citizens residing in my home state of \nVermont.\n  The fact that we have more than one half million fugitives from \njustice, a significant portion of whom are convicted felons in \nviolation of probation or parole, who have been able to flaunt courts \norder and avoid arrest, breeds disrespect for our laws and poses \nundeniable risks to the safety of our citizens.\n  Our federal law enforcement agencies should be commended for the job \nthey have been doing to date on capturing federal fugitives and helping \nthe states and local communities bring their fugitives to justice. The \nU.S. Marshals Service, our oldest law enforcement agency, has arrested \nover 120,000 federal, state and local fugitives in the past four years, \nincluding more federal fugitives than all the other federal agencies \ncombined. In prior years, the Marshals Service spearheaded special \nfugitive apprehension task forces, called FIST Operations, that \ntargeted fugitives in particular areas and was singularly successful in \narresting over 34,000 fugitive felons.\n  Similarly, the FBI has established twenty-four Safe Streets Task \nForces exclusively focused on apprehending fugitives in cities around \nthe country. Over the period of 1995 to 1999, the FBI's efforts have \nresulted in the arrest of a total of 65,359 state fugitives.\n  Nevertheless, the number of outstanding fugitives is too large. The \nsubstitute amendment we consider today will help make a difference by \nproviding new but limited administrative subpoena authority to the \nDepartment of Justice to obtain documentary evidence helpful in \ntracking down fugitives and by authorizing the Attorney General to \nestablish fugitive task forces.\n  ``Administrative subpoena'' is the term generally used to refer to a \ndemand for documents or testimony by an investigative entity or \nregulatory agency that is empowered to issue the subpoena independently \nand without the approval of any grand jury, court or other judicial \nentity. I am generally skeptical of administrative subpoena power. \nAdministrative subpoenas avoid the strict grand jury secrecy rules and \nthe documents provided in response to such subpoenas are, therefore, \nsubject to broader dissemination. Moreover, since investigative agents \nissue such subpoenas directly, without review by\n\n[[Page S7718]]\n\na judicial officer or even a prosecutor, fewer ``checks'' are in place \nto ensure the subpoena is issued with good cause and not merely as a \nfishing expedition.\n  Nonetheless, unlike initial criminal inquiries, fugitive \ninvestigations present unique difficulties. Law enforcement may not use \ngrand jury subpoenas since, by the time a person is a fugitive, the \ngrand jury phase of an investigation is usually over. Use of grand jury \nsubpoenas to obtain phone or bank records to track down a fugitive \nwould be an abuse of the grand jury. Trial subpoenas may also not be \nused, either because the fugitive is already convicted or no trial may \ntake place without the fugitive.\n  This inability to use trial and grand jury subpoenas for fugitive \ninvestigations creates a gap in law enforcement procedures. Law \nenforcement partially fills this gap by using the All Writs Act, 28 \nU.S.C. Sec.  1651(a), which authorizes federal courts to ``issue all \nwrits necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions \nand agreeable to the usages and principles of law.'' The procedures, \nhowever, for obtaining orders under this Act, and the scope and non-\ndisclosure terms of such orders, vary between jurisdictions.\n  Thus, authorizing administrative subpoena power will help bridge the \ngap in fugitive investigations to allow federal law enforcement \nagencies to obtain records useful for tracking a fugitive's \nwhereabouts.\n  The Thurmond-Biden-Leahy substitute amendment incorporates a number \nof provisions from the Leahy-Kohl ``Capturing Criminals Act'' and makes \nsignificant and positive modifications to the original version of S. \n2516. First, as introduced, S. 2516 would have limited use of an \nadministrative subpoena to those fugitives who have been ``indicted,'' \nand failed to address the fact that fugitives flee after arrest on the \nbasis of a ``complaint'' and may flee after the prosecutor has filed an \n``information'' in lieu of an indictment. The substitute amendment, by \ncontrast, would allow use of such subpoenas to track fugitives who have \nbeen accused in a ``complaint, information or indictment.''\n  Second, S. 2516, as introduced, would have required the U.S. Marshal \nService to report quarterly to the Attorney General (who must transmit \nthe report to Congress) on use of the administrative subpoenas. While a \nreporting requirement is useful, the requirement as described in the \noriginal S. 2516 was overly burdensome and insufficiently specific. The \nsubstitute amendment, as in the Capturing Criminals Act, would require \nthe Attorney General to report for the next three years to the \nJudiciary Committees of both the House and Senate with the following \ninformation about the use of administrative subpoenas in fugitive \ninvestigations: the number issued, by which agency, identification of \nthe charges on which the fugitive was wanted and whether the fugitive \nwas wanted on federal or state charges.\n\n  Third, although the original S. 2516 outlined the procedures for \nenforcement of an administrative subpoena, it was silent on the \nmechanisms for contesting the subpoena by the recipient. The substitute \namendment expressly addresses this issue. As set forth in the Capturing \nCriminals Act, this substitute amendment would allow a person who is \nserved with an administrative subpoena to petition a court to modify or \nset aside the subpoena on grounds that compliance would be \n``unreasonable or oppressive'' (a standard used in Fed. R. Crim. P. 17 \nfor trial subpoenas) or would violate constitutional or other legal \nrights of the person.\n  Fourth, the original S. 2516 did not provide, or set forth a \nprocedure, for the government to command a custodian of records not to \ndisclose or to delay notice to a customer about the existence of the \nsubpoena. This is particularly critical in fugitive investigations when \nlaw enforcement does not want to alert the fugitive that the police are \non his/her trail. The substitute amendment incorporates from the \nCapturing Criminals Act the express authority for law enforcement to \napply for a court order directing the custodian of records to delay \nnotice to subscribers of the existence of the subpoena on the same \nterms applicable in current law to other subpoenas issued to phone \ncompanies and other electronic service providers and to banks.\n  Fifth, the original S. 2516 did not provide any immunity from civil \nliability for persons complying with administrative subpoenas in \nfugitive investigations. As in the Capturing Criminals Act, the \nsubstitute amendment would provide immunity from civil liability for \ngood faith compliance with an administrative subpoena, including non-\ndisclosure in compliance with the terms of a court order.\n  Sixth, S. 2516, as introduced, would have authorized use of an \nadministrative subpoena upon a finding by the Attorney General that the \ndocuments are ``relevant and material,'' which is further defined to \nmean that ``there are articulable facts that show the fugitive's \nwhereabouts may be discerned from the records sought.'' Changing the \nstandard for issuance of a subpoena from ``relevancy'' to a hybrid of \n``relevant and material'' sets a confusing and bad precedent. \nAccordingly, the substitute amendment would authorize issuance of an \nadministrative subpoena for documents if the Attorney General finds \nbased upon articulable facts that they are relevant to discerning the \nfugitive's whereabouts.\n  Seventh, the original S. 2516 authorized the Attorney General to \nissue guidelines delegating authority for issuance of administrative \nsubpoenas only to the Director of the U.S. Marshals Service, despite \nthe fact that the FBI, and the Drug Enforcement Administration also \nwant this authority to find fugitives on charges over which they have \ninvestigative authority. The substitute amendment would authorize the \nAttorney General to issue guidelines delegating authority for issuance \nof administrative subpoenas to supervisory personnel within components \nof the Department.\n  Eighth, the original S. 2516 did not address the issue that a variety \nof administrative subpoena authorities exist in multiple forms in every \nagency. The substitute amendment incorporates from the Capturing \nCriminals Act a requirement that the Attorney General provide a report \non this issue.\n  Finally, as introduced, S. 2516 authorized the U.S. Marshal Service \nto establish permanent Fugitive Apprehension Task Forces. By contrast, \nthe substitute amendment would authorize $40,000,000 over three years \nfor the Attorney General to establish multi-agencytask forces (which \nwill be coordinated by the Director of the Marshals Service) in \nconsultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and the States, so that \nthe Secret Service, BATF, the FBI and the States are able to \nparticipate in the Task Forces to find their fugitives.\n  This Thurmond-Biden-Leahy substitute amendment makes necessary \nchanges to this bill that will help law enforcement--with increased \nresources for regional fugitive apprehension task forces and \nadministrative subpoena authority--bring to justice both federal and \nstate fugitives who, by their conduct, have demonstrated a lack of \nrespect for our nation's criminal justice system.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the amendment be \nagreed to, the committee substitute amendment, as amended, agreed to, \nthe bill be read the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4020) was agreed to.\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended, \nwas agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 2516), as amended, was passed.\n\n                                S. 2516\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fugitive Apprehension Act of \n     2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FUGITIVE APPREHENSION TASK FORCES.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Attorney General shall, upon \n     consultation with appropriate Department of Justice and \n     Department of the Treasury law enforcement components, \n     establish permanent Fugitive Apprehension Task Forces \n     consisting of Federal, State, and local law enforcement \n     authorities in designated regions of the United States, to be \n     directed and coordinated by the United States Marshals \n     Service, for the purpose of locating and apprehending \n     fugitives.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to\n\n[[Page S7719]]\n\n     the United States Marshal Service to carry out the provisions \n     of this section $30,000,000 for the fiscal year 2001, \n     $5,000,000 for fiscal year 2002, and $5,000,000 for fiscal \n     year 2003.\n       (c) Other Existing Applicable Law.--Nothing in this section \n     shall be construed to limit any existing authority under any \n     other provision of Federal or State law for law enforcement \n     agencies to locate or apprehend fugitives through task forces \n     or any other means.\n\n     SEC. 3.
