Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration of the veto message accompanying S. 1287, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Veto message on S. 1287, a bill to provide for the storage \n     of spent nuclear fuel pending completion of the nuclear waste \n     repository, and for other purposes.\n\n  (The text of the President's veto message is printed on page S3017 of \nthe Congressional Record of April 27, 2000.)\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the veto message.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there shall be 90 \nminutes under the control of the Senator from Alaska, Mr. Murkowski, \nand 90 minutes under the control of the Senators from Nevada, Mr. Reid \nand Mr. Bryan.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it is my understanding Senator Bingaman \nhas indicated a desire to speak. I believe he is off the floor at this \ntime and will be coming momentarily. I suggest the absence of a quorum \nand ask unanimous consent that the time be equally taken off both \nsides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it is my intent to accommodate Senator \nBingaman's schedule.\n  I yield to the ranking member of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, Senator Bingaman, with the understanding that the time be \ncharged to the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I will take a few minutes to give my \nperspective on this upcoming vote to override the President's veto.\n  The question before the Senate is not whether the Senate supports the \nconstruction of a nuclear waste repository. Clearly, I support \nconstruction of a nuclear waste repository. The President has indicated \nhe does. The Department of Energy has made significant progress on a \nrepository in the time this administration has been in office. In fact, \nthe Department of Energy has made much more progress in the past 7 \nyears under President Clinton than during the preceding 10 years under \nPresidents Reagan and Bush.\n  The President, according to the statement he issued, is ``committed \nto resolving the . . . issue in a timely and sensible manner consistent \nwith sound science and protection of public health, safety, and the \nenvironment.''\n  This bill was not vetoed by the President because he does not want to \nsolve\n\n[[Page S3202]]\n\nthe nuclear waste problem. He vetoed it because, as he stated in his \nveto message, this bill ``will do nothing to advance'' the program. \nThat is a quote out of the statement that was issued. And secondly, \ninstead of doing something to advance the program, the bill will be ``a \nstep backward.''\n  What are the problems that face the nuclear waste program today? Let \nme go through those problems with a little bit of detail so we all \nunderstand what those problems are and we can assess whether or not \nthere is anything in this bill that helps us address that.\n  First, burying tens of thousands of tons of highly radioactive waste \nin Yucca Mountain and making sure it does not escape for tens of \nthousands of years--that is the goal we set for ourselves--raises very \ndifficult scientific and technical questions.\n\n  Only last month, the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, which \nCongress created to advise us on these matters, warned that ``a \ncredible technical basis does not exist for the repository design.'' \nThis is the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board. This is a group that \nCongress established. This is not some left-wing environmental \norganization that made this statement.\n  That report also went on to say, ``large uncertainties'' still exist \nin how the Yucca Mountain site will behave, and ``much work remains to \nbe completed.'' That is an exact quote from that review board.\n  The bill before us does nothing to advance the scientific program \nthat is trying to resolve these issues. Instead, the bill will make it \nharder for the Department of Energy to resolve these issues by imposing \nsubstantial new requirements which will divert the limited resources \nthey have away from the essential scientific work that needs to be \ndone.\n  A second problem facing the program is public confidence. People need \nto know that the repository will be safe and will not leak radiation \ninto their water supply now or long into the future. Again, the bill \nwill do nothing to advance public confidence in the repository's \nsafety. Instead, it will undermine that public confidence. Under \ncurrent law, the repository must meet radiation standards set by the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency to protect public health and the \nenvironment.\n  The bill on which we are now voting to override a Presidential veto \nforbids the Environmental Protection Agency from issuing those \nstandards until this administration leaves office. The proponents of \nthe provision are plainly hoping Governor Bush will be elected \nPresident and that his administration will adopt more lax standards \nthan the Clinton administration would adopt. Such a blatant attempt to \nmanipulate the scientific review process is sure to undermine public \nconfidence in the ultimate site suitability determination.\n  A third problem facing the program is that it is behind schedule. \nAgain, the bill does nothing to accelerate the program. On the \ncontrary, the bill will delay the program further by forbidding the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency from issuing its radiation protection \nstandards before June of 2001.\n  Under current law, EPA will issue the standards this summer, in \nplenty of time for the Secretary of Energy to take the standards into \naccount in determining whether Yucca Mountain is suitable in 2001. But \nby delaying the issuance of the standards by nearly one year, the bill \nis likely to delay the Secretary's suitability determination and his \nrecommendation that the repository be built.\n  A fourth problem facing the program is that the Department of Energy \nhas not been able to begin moving waste from the States where it is now \nstored to Yucca Mountain. Again, the bill does nothing to begin moving \nwaste to Yucca Mountain or to accelerate the date at which shipments \ncan begin. On the contrary, the bill will probably obstruct shipments \nof waste by imposing a host of new obstacles to such shipments.\n  The bill says no shipment can be made until the Secretary of Energy \nhas determined that emergency responders in every State, every local \ncommunity, and every tribal jurisdiction, along every primary and every \nalternative shipping route, have met certain training standards and \nuntil the Secretary has given all of those entities financial \nassistance for 3 years before the first shipment. That is what the bill \nprovides.\n\n  The transportation provisions of the bill are far more restrictive \nthan those for shipments to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in my \nState. They are an open invitation to opponents of the nuclear waste \nprogram to obstruct shipments to the repository. I think we are all \nfamiliar with the availability of the courts to assist in that \nobstruction, where we put unreasonable restrictions on the Department \nof Energy, as we have done in the case of transportation to the site.\n  A fifth problem facing the program--this is the nuclear waste \nrepository program--is the claims against the Government for failing to \naccept the utilities' waste by the original deadline. The bill permits \nthe Department of Energy to settle these claims by paying the utilities \ncompensation out of the nuclear waste fund--which the utilities said \nthey did not want.\n  This bill does not permit the Department of Energy to take title to \nthe utilities' waste at the utilities' sites, which is the one near-\nterm solution that was sought by the administration when we went into \nthis debate. In fact, that provision was in the bill when we reported \nit out of the committee, which I think was a step forward.\n  Moreover, the bill creates new unfunded liabilities for the \nGovernment. It does so by imposing new deadlines that the Department of \nEnergy cannot meet and imposing substantial new requirements without \nproviding funding mechanisms to meet those obligations.\n  A sixth major problem facing the program is inadequate funding. Our \ncurrent budget rules make it impossible to give the program the money \nit requires, even though the fees the utilities pay the Government far \nexceed what Congress appropriates to the program each year, and the \nnuclear waste fund has a $9 billion surplus in it. Yet, at the same \ntime, the bill imposes substantial new unfunded spending requirements. \nSo we are setting up and maintaining a prohibition against spending the \nmoney at the same time we are imposing new unfunded spending \nrequirements on the program.\n  These unfunded spending requirements are to provide relief to the \nutilities under the settlement agreements, to provide financial \nassistance for transportation planning and training, and to conduct \nresearch on alternative waste management technologies.\n  Finally, the bill does nothing to help the one utility that is \nactually threatened with having to shut down one of its plants because \nof insufficient onsite storage capacity. Here I am talking about \nNorthern States Power's Prairie Island plant in Minnesota. Nothing in \nthis bill forestalls the shutdown of that plant in January of 2007.\n  The bottom line is that this bill will not fix what is wrong with the \nnuclear waste program. On the contrary, it will make matters worse and \nmove us further from a final solution.\n  The question before the Senate is whether the bill should pass, ``the \nobjections of the President notwithstanding.'' That is the question for \nus to vote on this afternoon.\n  The President said he remains committed to solving the nuclear waste \nissue. The administration has made considerable progress toward that \nend and is close to completing the work needed for the site suitability \ndecision next year.\n  The President says the bill does not help; it does not advance the \nprogram's goals.\n  On the contrary, in his view, it is a major step backward because it \nis likely to delay the site suitability determination, it undermines \npublic confidence, and it is likely to create new unfunded liabilities \nfor the Government--in fact, not likely, but it does create them.\n  The President's objections to the bill are well taken, and, in my \nview, the Senate should not pass the bill over the objections that have \nbeen raised by the President.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we are again faced with the decision of \nwhether to put off an obligation that we have to store nuclear waste \nthat is threatening our industry or just talk some more.\n  If we reflect on reality, we will find that the last time this issue \ncame before the Senate we had 64 votes in favor. There was one Senator \nwho was\n\n[[Page S3203]]\n\nabsent. We anticipate that Senator to be here today, so we anticipate \napproximately 65 votes. In the House, it passed 253-167. So, clearly, a \nmajority in the House and Senate have spoken on this issue.\n  We have before us the question of the President's veto on the Nuclear \nWaste Policy Act. I say that the President is wrong. He is wrong for \nthe environment, wrong for the U.S. energy policy, wrong for the \neconomy, and he is wrong for international security.\n  This has become pretty much a political issue on the floor--whether \nto override the President's veto and do what is right. What is right is \nto address the responsibility that we have to the taxpayers of this \ncountry. I urge every Member of this body to reflect on the obligation \nthat he or she has at this time. We have a situation where, as a \nconsequence of the inability of the Federal Government to take the \nwaste, which was to occur in 1998, we have a breach of contract with \nseveral of our utility companies. That breach of contract has resulted \nin liability and damages--damages that are assessed now at somewhere \nbetween $40 billion and $80 billion. So every Member of this body who \ndoes not support an override better be prepared to respond to the \nAmerican taxpayer and address the reasons and have an excuse for not \nmoving this and terminating that extended liability to the taxpayers.\n  While the President's veto wasn't based on good science, it was based \non crass politics. The President's veto is particularly troublesome \nbecause Congress has bent over backward to meet every legitimate \nconcern expressed by this administration. So it is simply clear that \nthis administration doesn't want to take up this matter and resolve it \nunder any circumstances under their watch.\n  Instead, they apparently want to use it as an election year issue. \nWell, I think it will come back and bite them as an election year \nissue. The bill the President vetoed would have disposed of our nuclear \nwaste in a rational and effective way. It would do so by providing \nearly receipt at Yucca Mountain of our civilian and our defense nuclear \nwaste 5 years earlier than under existing law but not until after the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission approved a construction permit for the \nfacility, and it would have protected the $16 billion nuclear waste \nfund from being raided to pay for the Government's default on its \ncontract with the utilities--money that consumers have paid through \nhigher electric rates. It would have protected consumers from the \nSecretary of Energy unilaterally and unreasonably raising the nuclear \nwaste tax on electricity without the consent of Congress, and it would \nhave preserved the right of the Environmental Protection Agency to set \nthe radiation standards in a manner that fully protects public health \nand safety.\n  If you go back and read the bill, it clearly gives the Environmental \nProtection Agency the obligation of setting the standard. Failure to \naddress this problem does not solve the problem by any means; it simply \nleaves the waste where it is.\n  I would like to refer to this chart in back of me because this is the \nreality. We have the waste at 80 sites in 40 States. It is located in \nour backyards. Each year that goes by, our ability to continue to store \nnuclear waste in each of these sites in a safe and reasonable way \ndiminishes. Why? These sites were designed for temporary storage and, \nin many cases, they have about reached their maximum. Isn't it better \nto put this at one site, at Yucca Mountain in Nevada, which was \ndesigned for the waste?\n  It is irresponsible to let this situation continue. Rather than \nexhibiting courage and signing legislation that would address the \nproblem, the President has abdicated his responsibility. Rather than \nprotect the American people, he has chosen to sacrifice them to satisfy \nthe anti-nuclear interests.\n  The veto is absolutely wrong for the environment. Again, I refer to \nthis chart. Is it better to have this material scattered at 80 sites in \n40 States or one, single, easily-monitored location which, I add, is \nwhere we have had over 50 years of nuclear testing out in the Nevada \ndesert? This veto means that the administration wants to continue to \nkeep this material near our major population centers, near schools, \nhospitals, parks, homes, areas where we have earthquakes, such as in \nCalifornia, and in other areas, such as Illinois, where we have severe \nwindstorms at times. The administration's own draft environmental \nimpact statement released in August of last year makes it clear that \nleaving the material spread around the country could represent a \nconsiderable human health risk.\n  His veto is wrong for the U.S. energy policy. The real agenda of this \nadministration is to kill nuclear power as a means to provide \nelectricity, but they never answered the tough questions--the reality \nthat nuclear power generation consists of 20 percent of the Nation's \nelectricity. It does so without emanating any air pollution or \ngreenhouse gases. How do we address the risk of global warming without \nnuclear power? It is pretty hard to do. How do we meet our clean air \nrequirements and goals without nuclear power?\n  There is no alternative suggested by the administration. How do we \nprovide consumers and our economy with the electricity they need if we \nrule out our nuclear power? The answer is very simple: We can't.\n  The choice we face is either replace nuclear power with coal-fired \npower or consumers will go without; that means brownouts, perhaps \nblackouts. But this should come as no surprise to an administration \nthat has allowed this Nation to become dependent on insecure sources of \nforeign oil to meet our energy needs. Our energy policy consists of the \nSecretary of Energy going hat-in-hand to beg for help from countries \nthat once sought our protection to maintain their existence. We have \nrecently seen our increased dependence on oil from Saddam Hussein and \nIraq. It was 300,000 barrels a day last year, and this year it is \n700,000 barrels a day.\n  Isn't it rather ironic, as we look at the foreign policy of this \ncountry, to recognize that we buy Saddam Hussein's oil and give him our \ndollars, and we take that oil, put it in our airplanes, and we go out \nand bomb him.\n  That is really what we are doing. How ironic.\n  Furthermore, it has cost the American taxpayer about $10 billion \nsince the end of the Persian Gulf war in 1991 to keep Saddam Hussein \nfenced in.\n  The veto is wrong for the economy. Failure to resolve the nuclear \nwaste problem may well turn into a budgetary disaster that will rival \nthe savings and loan crisis.\n  I say that as a consequence of the increasing liability that goes to \nthe Federal Government for its inability to take that waste when it was \ndue under the contract terms in 1998. That is over $40 billion. It may \nbe closer to $80 billion. That is a liability that is being assumed by \nthe American taxpayer as we delay addressing this obligation.\n  By failing to resolve the nuclear waste problem, the Federal courts \nhave said this administration has violated its contractual obligations. \nAs I said, this means the Department of Energy may have to pay as much \nas $40 billion to $80 billion in liability, and possibly more. Where do \nyou think this money is going to come from? You guessed it. The \ntaxpayer. And every Member who doesn't support this veto override had \nbetter be able to explain that to his or her constituents. Instead of \nusing this money to keep Social Security solvent, we have to use it to \npay for this administration's willful failure to comply with the law.\n  But keep in mind that even after the taxpayers foot this bill, the \nnuclear waste problem still won't be dealt with because the President \nsimply won't stand up and recognize that we have an obligation under a \ncontract made 20 years ago to accept the waste.\n  Further, it is wrong for the international security of this Nation. \nHow do we convince our allies and those who are not to abide by our \ngoal of nuclear nonproliferation when we demonstrate that we have \nneither the will nor the intelligence to deal with our own domestic \nproblem? How do we convince our European allies to look to us and not \nRussia for solutions when we demonstrate that we do not have the \ncourage to follow science and our own law? What type of leadership do \nwe show to the world when we are unwilling to honor our commitments to \nour own citizens? It is not only our security that is jeopardized but \nalso that of our allies who depend on our willingness and capability to \ndefend them to enforce a peace.\n\n[[Page S3204]]\n\n  This is referred to as a ``mobile Chernobyl'' by some. Opponents of \nthe legislation argue that shipping nuclear waste across the Nation \nwill create a ``mobile Chernobyl.'' The administration seems to agree \nwith these opponents. Yet this very same administration agreed in 1996 \nto accept 20 tons of foreign nuclear high-level waste shipped to the \nUnited States. The administration's Foreign Research Reactor Program \nbrought that in. This foreign nuclear waste is being moved safely in \nthe very same way and in the very same casks that the opponents say \nU.S. nuclear waste cannot be moved safely.\n  Let me also observe as we are talking about ``mobile Chernobyls'' \nthat there are 83 nuclear-powered U.S. submarines and naval warships \nwhich operate under nuclear power. They are around the world. They \noperate around the clock in both U.S. and foreign ports to ensure our \nsecurity. They carry the reactors, and they have done it in a safe and \nadmirable manner for a long period of time. There does not seem to be \nany concern about these ships. And the shipments we are talking about \nare dry, stable waste, and not reactors. But they criticize it in the \ncapacity of suggesting this is a Chernobyl-style act. This is fear \nmongering. It is unnecessary. It is fear in the worst case.\n  Finally, we recognize the obligation of our Chief Executive. The \nPresident of the United States had a choice. The President could have \nshown courage and chosen for the environment. Instead, he declined. The \nPresident could have shown leadership and chosen a sound energy policy. \nInstead, he refused. The President could have demonstrated concern for \nthe future and chosen for a healthy economy. Instead, he ducked. The \nPresident could have shown resolve on our national and international \nobligations and chosen for our national security. Instead, he \nabdicated. The President's veto was wrong for the environment, for \nenergy policy, for the economy, and for our national security.\n\n  Today, our choice is a simple one.\n  Again, I note on this chart behind me, all of those areas in green \nare the States where nuclear waste is stored, 40 States. Do we want to \nhave that, or do we want to have one central disposal facility at Yucca \nMountain where we have already expended $6 billion or $7 billion in the \ndesign of a permanent repository? Do we want to move it to one central \nfacility in an area where over 800 nuclear devices were tested?\n  I show you a chart and a picture of the proposed location for the \npermanent repository at the Nevada site. It was used for previous \ntesting of more than 800 nuclear weapons.\n  I urge my colleagues not to be misguided and to support the veto \noverride.\n  Before I yield some time to the other side, I want to make a couple \nof points relative to the radiation issue which has come up from time \nto time.\n  One of the principles originally in S. 1287 was that the Yucca \nMountain radiation standards should be set by the NRC and not the EPA. \nAlthough I still strongly believe that the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission should set this standard, the managers' amendment contains \nnew language--I hope my colleagues will read it--that will permit the \nEPA to go ahead with its rule as long as both the EPA and the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission, in consultation with the National Academy of \nSciences, agrees that the standard will protect public health, safety, \nand the environment, and is reasonable and obtainable. If that isn't \nthe best science available, I don't know what is.\n  This is a very reasonable approach that provides the very best \nscience and the very best peer review, yet allows the EPA to have the \nobligation to ultimately complete the rule after all the best minds on \nthe subject have been consulted.\n  I think it is apparent as we address this issue--and I recognize that \nmy State of Alaska does not have nuclear waste stored in it--that if we \ndon't resolve it today, we are going to have to address it at a later \ndate because the fact is nobody wants this waste.\n  I am particularly sensitive to and appreciate the position of my \ncolleagues from Nevada. The bottom line is they don't want the waste. \nIf the waste were going to be stored in Colorado, we would have the \nSenators from Colorado speaking here on the floor and objecting to it. \nIt is going to be stored in California, or New Hampshire, or somewhere. \nThat is just the harsh reality of recognizing that no one wants this \nwaste.\n  But my colleagues from Nevada claim that the Congress chose Nevada to \nbe studied for nuclear waste disposal purely for political reasons. \nThey would have you believe that there are no rational, technical, or \nscientific reasons for placing spent nuclear fuel in Nevada. That is \nwhat they would have you believe. But it is wrong.\n  The DOE spent over $1 billion studying other potential sites before \nnarrowing the list to three sites, one of which was Yucca Mountain. \nCongress settled on Yucca Mountain back in 1987. It is geologically \nunique. The Nevada Test Site has been used to explode nuclear weapons \nfor over 50 years.\n  This is a picture of the Nevada site. The last weapon exploded there \nunderground was in 1991. The underground tests are still being \nperformed, with nuclear materials being exploded with conventional \nexplosives, with the wholehearted support of the Nevada delegation. In \nfact, not too long ago one of the Senators from Nevada supported \nstoring spent fuel at the test site. There was a resolution that I \nbelieve took place back in 1975 or 1976.\n\n  The resolution reads as follows. This is a resolution from the Nevada \nAssembly, Joint Resolution 15:\n\n       Whereas, the people of Southern Nevada have confidence in \n     the safety record of the Nevada test site and the ability of \n     the staff of the site to maintain safety in the handling of \n     nuclear materials;\n       Whereas, nuclear disposal can be carried out at the Nevada \n     test site with minimal capital investment relative to other \n     locations;\n       Now, therefore, be it resolved that the Assembly of the \n     State of Nevada jointly with the Legislature of the State of \n     Nevada strongly urges the Energy Research and Development \n     Administration to choose the Nevada test site for the \n     disposal of nuclear waste.\n\n  This resolution passed the Nevada Senate by a 12-6 vote, aided by a \nvote at that time of then State Senator Bryan and signed by the \nGovernor of Nevada.\n  What has changed? The Nevada Test Site has not changed. It has the \nworkers, a workforce, an infrastructure for dealing with nuclear \nmaterials. The geology has not changed.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a Los Angeles \nTimes article called ``Marketing a Nuclear Wasteland.''\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Los Angeles Times, Feb. 4, 1998]\n\n                     Marketing a Nuclear Wasteland\n\n    (U.S. tries to drum up business for Nevada Test Site by urging \n companies to use it for research too risky to try anywhere else. ``No \n             job is too big,'' promotional brochure boasts)\n\n                          (By Stephanie Simon)\n\n       Mercury, Nev.--This sun-scraped scab of desert has been \n     pounded by the worst mankind could hurl at it: four decades \n     of nuclear explosions.\n       Those trials are over now. But this echoing expanse remains \n     the proving ground for audacious inventions. Only now it's \n     not the government experimenting, it's private industry.\n       Need to blow up a building to test a new anti-terrorism \n     design? Do it at the Nevada Test Site. Need to set a chemical \n     fire to try out a new foam flame retardant? Feel free, at the \n     Nevada Test Site.\n       Dump toxins on the ground to train emergency crews. Bury \n     land mines to test detection technology. Send a brand new, \n     one-of-a-kind reusable rocket hurtling into orbit.\n       Even the most violent and volatile of experiments can do \n     little to land that has been assaulted by 928 nuclear \n     explosions over the years.\n       That is why the U.S. Department of Energy is marketing the \n     site--a wasteland bigger than Rhode Island--as the perfect \n     place to conduct research that would not be welcome in the \n     average American neighborhood. As the promotional brochure \n     boasts: ``No job too big.''\n       The push to woo private industry to the Nevada Test Site \n     mirrors transitions underway at nuclear facilities across the \n     country. With the Cold War over, the government has been \n     trying to shrug off surplus weapons plants by cleaning them \n     up and turning them over to communities for commercial \n     development.\n       The test site, however, presents some unusual challenges:\n       It's huge. It's impossible to scrub clean. And it might one \n     day be needed for more nuclear tests. Thus, unlike some other \n     nuclear facilities, it can't be transformed into, say, an \n     industrial park. Instead, the Energy Department seeks to \n     bring in private projects compatible with the site's legacy.\n\n[[Page S3205]]\n\n       ``We're selling the concept of a place where you can do \n     things you can't do anywhere else,'' said Tim Carlson, who \n     runs NTS Development Corp., a nonprofit group commissioned by \n     the government to market the site.\n       Of course, not every company wants to be associated with a \n     nuclear testing ground, even one that no longer sends \n     mushroom clouds roaring through the dawn. Hundreds of craters \n     from underground blasts still pock the earth like giant \n     thumbprints in a just-baked pie. Yellow signs still warn of \n     radiation here and there in the desert scruff.\n       ``Gerber baby food will never move out here, because of the \n     image,'' NTS consultant Terry Vaeth acknowledged.\n       But plenty of other companies will. Exempt from many \n     environmental restrictions, the site allows researchers to \n     step outside their labs and conduct real-life, full-scale \n     tests too dangerous to carry out elsewhere.\n       Consider the Hazardous Materials Spill Center, a tangle of \n     criss-crossing pipes and mock smokestacks gleaming in the \n     dull brown emptiness. It's centered around a giant wind \n     tunnel built to spew toxins into the air--on purpose.\n       Private firms and government agencies pay up to $1.2 \n     million for the privilege of dumping dangerous brews by the \n     tens of thousands of gallons through the wind tunnel or \n     elsewhere at the facility. From a bank of nearby TV cameras, \n     they can then monitor how the fumes spread in different \n     weather conditions, or whether experimental cleanup methods \n     work.\n       ``It's the only place we've found where we can spill this \n     stuff,'' said Mark Salzbrenner, a senior engineer at DuPont \n     Chemical Co.\n       Every other year, DuPont holds two weeklong workshops for \n     industrial customers who buy fuming sulfuric acid for \n     products such as shampoo, laundry detergent and \n     pharmaceuticals. Engineers spill the stuff into huge steel \n     pans, then demonstrate how to battle the resulting blazes.\n       Each workshop costs DuPont $40,000 a fee Salzbrenner \n     considers well worthwhile. After all, he says, ``we're not \n     going to do this in the middle of Los Angeles.''\n       The spill center has been operating for more than a decade, \n     but promoters are just starting to market it intensively to \n     private industry as part of the drive to commercialize the \n     site. It's a startling shift of focus for this lonely \n     chunk of desert 65 miles northwest of Las Vegas.\n       For decades, the test site was top secret, off limits a \n     proud if mysterious symbol of America's determination to \n     preserve peace through overwhelming military strength.\n       Before the test site was established in 1951, the United \n     States had exploded five nuclear bombs on the Bikini Atoll in \n     the Pacific Ocean. With tensions rising in Korea, President \n     Harry Truman decided to shift the nuclear program to the \n     mainland, Nevada, with its dry weather and low population, \n     was selected.\n       The government conducted a handful of tests on peaceful \n     uses for nuclear explosions in Alaska, Mississippi, New \n     Mexico and Colorado, as well as 104 blasts on Pacific \n     islands. But more than 90% of the nation's nuclear tests took \n     place at the Nevada site.\n       Then the Cold War crumbled.\n       In 1992, President George Bush declared a moratorium on \n     nuclear testing that has held to this day. The Energy \n     Department, which runs U.S. nuclear programs, responded with \n     painful cutbacks at weapons assembly and testing facilities \n     from Tennessee to New Mexico.\n       In the past six years, the department has slashed its \n     nuclear work force by a third. The Nevada site, suddenly \n     stranded with no clear mission, fared even worse: Employment \n     has collapsed from a Cold War peak of 11,000 jobs to fewer \n     than 2,500.\n       Scientists lost their jobs, of course,but so did lab \n     technicians and welders and mechanics. Half of the site's \n     3,300 buildings, ranging from trailers to offices to \n     elaborate labs, were vacated and declared surplus. ``It \n     created a kind of vacuum,'' said Susan Haase, a vice \n     president of NTS Development.\n       To cushion the blow, the Energy Department set aside more \n     than $190 million over five years to help communities \n     affected by the downsizing. Cities could use the grants to \n     retrain laid-off workers, convert weapons plants to \n     commercial use or put together incentive plans to lure new \n     employers.\n       The Nevada Test Site received nearly $9 million of these \n     funds, but with a caveat: Privatization would have to proceed \n     with caution, because the government still has first dibs on \n     the rugged, mountain-fringed site.\n       Though the United States has not set off a nuclear \n     explosion in nearly six years, the Nevada site is still used \n     for underground experiments designed to assess the stability \n     of aging weapons.\n       Also, by law the Energy Department must be prepared to \n     resume full-scale tests within two years if the president \n     ever gives the word. So the government could not simply hand \n     the site to Las Vegas developers and let them have at it.\n       Clearly, a Ground Zero Casino was out. Instead, NTS \n     Development has tried to market the site to industries that \n     can take advantage of the equipment and brainpower assembled \n     over the years to support nuclear tests.\n       ``You've got a tremendous amount of energy . . . sitting \n     there waiting to be of service again,'' Carlson said.\n       Local leaders hope that wooing scientific projects to the \n     site will diversify the state's economy, which now leans on \n     gambling and tourism for nearly half its revenue. At the same \n     time, the government is eager to busy laid-off nuclear \n     workers with peacetime challenges so they'll keep their \n     skills sharp in case testing ever resumes.\n       Whatever the motivation, electrical foreman Clifford Houpt \n     is glad to see so much interest in revving up business for \n     the repair shops and assembly facilities of Mercury, a town \n     that serves as the last site's faded barracks-style base \n     camp. ``We need all the work we can get out here,'' he said.\n       Some of the projects drawn to the test site represent \n     efforts to atone for the Cold War years of environmental \n     destruction.\n       Most of the site's new ventures so far have come from \n     private, for-profit companies such as Kistler. Eventually, \n     though, local leaders hope that the federal government will \n     step in with its own projects.\n       The nonprofit Nevada Testing Institute is pressing Congress \n     to fund a $1-million anti-terrorism center. Engineers could \n     subject buildings to terrorist-style assaults to determine \n     how best to safeguard lives and property, said institute \n     President Pete Mote.\n       ``They may say, `We need a 20,000-pound bomb, and we want \n     to simulate a building in New York City that a Ryder truck \n     can get within 20 feet of,' '' he said. ``We'll say, `OK, \n     we're the place to do it.' ''\n       The prospect of such projects cheers Nevada civic leaders \n     who would love to see the site once again serve national \n     security--without sending mushroom clouds billowing toward \n     Las Vegas as the early atmospheric tests in the 1950s did.\n       ``We want to take the technology and the personnel we had \n     [for the nuclear industry] and apply it to new areas so we're \n     doing things for society instead of just blowing up bombs,'' \n     said Stephen Rice, associate provost of the University of \n     Nevada, Las Vegas. Or, as NTS Development's Haase put it: \n     ``Taxpayers paid for this place, after all.\n\n\n                        Nevada's Nuclear Legacy\n\n       The United States conducted 928 nuclear tests at the Nevada \n     Test Site between 1951 and 1992. Though most were \n     conventional bombs, the government also tested a nuclear \n     artillery shell, experimented with a nuclear-powered rocket \n     and sought peaceful uses of atomic explosives for earth-\n     moving projects.\n\n\n                     Some facts about the test site\n\n       Las Vegas residents used to stand on their doorsteps to \n     toast the passing mushroom clouds.\n       In the early 1950s, troops from all four military services \n     were deployed within a few thousand yards of atmospheric \n     tests to train them in atomic combat.\n       For a 1953 test dubbed ``Doom Town'' scientists built a \n     mock American community near ground zero, complete with cars, \n     bunkers and mannequin families. The explosion destroyed all \n     but two houses.\n       The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for years managed \n     a 36-acre farm on the site to test the effect of radiation on \n     cattle, crops and wells.\n       For a 1957 test, ``Priscilla,,'' engineers built concrete \n     domes, underground garages, bridges and other shelters near \n     ground zero to see how they would fare in a blast. Most did \n     poorly, although a bank vault survived intact.\n       Scientists built a Japanese-style town and bombarded it \n     with radiation in 1962 to determine whether houses shielded \n     residents from exposure during the Hiroshima and Nagasaki \n     bombings.\n       Apollo 16 astronauts practiced driving their moon rover \n     through test-site craters thrown up by nuclear explosions.\n       The test site's base camp, in Mercury, includes dormitory \n     housing for 1,200 as well as warehouses, laboratories, repair \n     shops and a hospital. Recreation facilities include a bowling \n     alley, movie theater, pool, track and cafeteria.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The subheading reads:\n\n       U.S. tries to drum up business for Nevada's Test Site by \n     urging companies to use it for research too risky to try \n     anywhere else. No job is too big, promotional brochures \n     boast. It is huge. It is impossible to scrub clean. We are \n     selling the concept of a place where you can do things you \n     can't do anywhere else, said Tim Carlson, who runs the NTS \n     Development Corporation, a nonprofit commission by the \n     Governor to market the site.\n\n  A few more observations from Nevadans quoted by the story:\n\n       We take these companies out of someone's backyard and put \n     them here. They are never going to be able to reclaim it for \n     10,000 or 15,000 years, says Randy Harness of the Sierra \n     Club's Las Vegas chapter. They might as well do research \n     there.\n\n  He concludes:\n\n       Given the constant monitoring, the site is probably the \n     safest place in the whole United States.\n       We want to take the technology and the personnel we have in \n     the nuclear industry and apply it to new areas so we are \n     doing things for society instead of just blowing up bombs, \n     said Steven Rice, assistant provost for the University of \n     Nevada, Los Vegas.\n\n  Or, as the Nuclear Testing Site Development's Haase put it:\n\n       Taxpayers paid for this place, after all. They should get \n     some use out of it.\n\n  We are seeing a situation develop where it is fair to say we have the \nfinal obligation in the Congress of the United States to address this \nwith resolve once and for all.\n\n[[Page S3206]]\n\n  I will comment briefly on the specifics of the veto the President saw \nfit to initiate. In looking at the President's veto message, the \nPresident presented the argument that S. 1287 is a step backward \nbecause delaying the issue regarding radiation standards delays any \ndecision with regard to the site recommendation. The reality is the \nradiation standard is only necessary for the license application \nthrough March 2000.\n  The other argument the President reports is that the bill adds \nunnecessary bureaucracy to issuing standards and delays. The bill says \nspecifically that the EPA issues the radiation standards by June 2001. \nEPA must also compare provisions with the National Academy's \nrecommendation and justify this scientific basis for the rule. If good \nscience unduly burdens the EPA, then perhaps we have a problem with the \nproposed rule. We are talking about the EPA having the final \ndetermination.\n  The President further states that the bill does not help with claims \nagainst the Federal Government for damages related to failure to accept \nfuel. The opposite is true. The bill provides early receipt as soon as \nconstruction is authorized. That is as early as 2006, January. It \npermits the Secretary of Energy to enter into settlement agreements \nwith utilities, thus limiting continued liability. I think this is \nanother example of the administration putting responsibility for its \nown problems on Congress. They seek to minimize damages from their own \nfailure to take the waste and minimize the $40 to $80 billion liability \nby cooperating with Congress. Is that too much to ask? I ask my \ncolleagues to explain to their constituencies why they are exposing \nthem to continued litigation at the expense of the taxpayer, as the $40 \nto $80 billion claims against the Federal Government continues to \nmount.\n  Another argument is S. 1287 doesn't promote settlement because it \ndoesn't have ``take title'' language. Mr. President, one time it had \ntake title language but the Secretary of Energy, Secretary Richardson, \ndidn't do his part to gain support from the States that opposed it. Why \ndid the States oppose it? They feared the Federal Government would \nsimply leave the waste in their States, take title to it and leave it. \nMore importantly, the DOE has argued in the past; the Ninth Circuit, in \n1991, said that the Department of Energy already had the authority to \ntake title. That was granted by the 1954 Atomic Energy Act. This is \nanother smokescreen.\n  What is lacking is not legal authority but a political exercise of \nwill. This administration, unfortunately, does not have that political \nwill.\n  It is interesting to note some of the support. I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record a letter from the Governor of the \nState of New York, George Pataki.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                             State of New York\n\n                                                   April 21, 2000.\n       Dear Mr. President: Now before you is the Nuclear Waste \n     Policy Amendments Act of 2000 (S. 1287). On behalf of the \n     citizens of New York State who have been forced to \n     temporarily store more than 2,000 tons of radioactive nuclear \n     waste, I urge you to sign this bill into law.\n       Because the Federal government has failed in its statutory \n     obligation to build a permanent and safe nuclear disposal \n     site by 1998, our State and others are faced with continued \n     on-site management of high-level radioactive waste. With S. \n     1287 Congress has developed a sensible plan that will, if \n     signed by you, begin a process leading to this facility \n     finally being built.\n       This bill has passed both the U.S. Senate and House of \n     Representatives by large majorities and would allow New York \n     State to transport the radioactive waste we have been storing \n     on an interim basis. Disposal of this waste is one of the \n     most important environmental concerns facing New York and \n     other states with nuclear facilities and failure to seize the \n     opportunity we now have with passage of S. 1287 could pose \n     serious risks for us all.\n       Enactment of the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of \n     2000 will also allow us to avoid continued litigation over \n     the Federal government's failure to live up to its commitment \n     to accept this waste. The plan laid out after years of debate \n     and discussion in Congress moves us closer to protecting the \n     health and safety of all Americans and should be signed.\n       As time passes, the problem of finding a means for the safe \n     disposal of nuclear waste grows more complicated. Your \n     support is needed on this critical issue of national \n     importance, and I respectfully request that you sign S. 1287 \n     so the process of shipping radioactive waste out of New York \n     and other states into a safe, permanent Federal facility can \n     finally begin.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                 George E. Pataki.\n\n     The Honorable William J. Clinton,\n     President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I will read briefly from the letter.\n\n                                                   April 21, 2000.\n       Dear Mr. President: Now before you is the Nuclear Waste \n     Policy Amendments Act of 2000 (S. 1287). On behalf of the \n     citizens of New York State who have been forced to \n     temporarily store more than 2,000 tons of radioactive nuclear \n     waste, I urge you to sign this bill into law.\n       Because the Federal government has failed in its statutory \n     obligation to build a permanent and safe nuclear disposal \n     site by 1998, our State and others are faced with continued \n     on-site management of high-level radioactive waste. With S. \n     1287 Congress has developed a sensible plan that will, if \n     signed by you, begin a process leading to this facility \n     finally being built.\n       This bill has passed both the U.S. Senate and House of \n     Representatives by large majorities and would allow New York \n     State to transport the radioactive waste we have been storing \n     on an interim basis. Disposal of this waste is one of the \n     most important environmental concerns facing New York and \n     other states with nuclear facilities.\n  This is an appeal by the Governor of New York, to this body, to \noverride the President's veto.\n  Another point. Some of the affected States that would have high-level \nwaste have been storing this waste at interim sites, sites that were \nnot designed for a permanent storage.\n  Ratepayers from the State of New York paid in over $1 billion in \ntheir electric bill for the Federal Government to take that waste. \nThere are seven sites in New York, about 2,167 metric tons of waste. As \na consequence, the State dependence on nuclear energy is about 26 \npercent. They had one shutdown of one plant, Indian Point, in 1974. The \npoint is to show in New York the significance of what it means and why \nwe have this letter from the Governor of New York addressing this body \nasking to move this bill and override the President's veto.\n  Another State with a significant amount of waste is Colorado. Federal \npayments of about $6.3 million have been paid by the ratepayers in \nColorado. There is one unit that is closed, Fort St. Vrain, and about \n15 metric tons of waste. There is a significant amount of Department of \nEnergy defense waste. The alternative is to leave the waste in Colorado \nor move it out.\n  Illinois is another State where there is a significant amount of \nwaste as a consequence of the fact that 39 percent of Illinois' power \ngeneration comes from nuclear energy. In Illinois, the ratepayers have \npaid $2 billion to the Federal Government to take the waste. They have \n11 units and approximately 5,215 metric tons of waste. Is that waste \ngoing to stay in those numerous sites where the 11 units are, or are we \ngoing to move it out to one central location in Nevada?\n  In North Carolina, in 1998, the ratepayers have paid over $706 \nmillion to the Federal Government to take the waste. As I have \nindicated, the Federal Government is in violation of the contract. \nThirty-one percent of the State of North Carolina is dependent on \nnuclear energy. As a consequence, they are looking at 1,400 metric \ntons.\n  Do we want to leave that waste in temporary storage, or do we want to \nmove it now when we have an opportunity?\n  The State of Oregon has a significant amount of waste stored at \nHanford. Hanford is in Washington, but the site certainly affects \nOregon as well. The ratepayers have paid $108 million. The Trojan plant \nin Oregon has been closed for decommissioning. Do we want to leave it \nclosed, or do we want to move the high-level waste out of there to one \ncentral site? There are 424 metric tons in Oregon.\n  Whether one is talking about Massachusetts, Connecticut, Arkansas, \nWisconsin, Georgia, Louisiana, Washington State, Maine, Pennsylvania, \nor Vermont, these are all States which have a significant amount of \nwaste that has been generated by the utilities under the assumption \nthat the Federal Government would take that waste in 1998. The Federal \nGovernment has failed to take that waste and, as a consequence, the \nlitigation goes on.\n  I am amused because we have a statement by the Vice President on this\n\n[[Page S3207]]\n\nquestion of the veto override. Looking at his statement, I see a rather \ncurious phraseology. I ask unanimous consent that statement be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Statement by the Vice President on Yucca Mountain Veto\n\n       Today's veto of the nuclear waste bill is an important step \n     to protect health, safety and the environment. This \n     legislation was rejected because it does nothing to assist in \n     conducting the best scientific research into the propriety of \n     the Yucca Mountain site, as a long-term geologic repository \n     for high level nuclear waste. Rather, the legislation limits \n     the ability of the Environmental Protection Agency to set \n     appropriate radiation emissions standards for the site. I \n     believe that we need to find a permanent solution for the \n     disposal of high-level nuclear waste, but one that is based \n     on the best available science, in order to protect public \n     health and the environment. I wish to commend Senator Reid, \n     Senator Bryan and Representative Berkley for their tireless \n     work to help us defeat the ill-advised approach in this bill.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. He states:\n\n       Today's veto of the nuclear waste bill is an important step \n     to protect the health, safety, and the environment.\n\n  He is saying the President's veto is in the interest of protecting \nhealth, safety, and the environment. He is saying leave it at those \nsites in the 40 States. That must be what he is saying.\n  He says:\n\n       This legislation was rejected because it does nothing to \n     assist in conducting the best scientific research into the . \n     . . Yucca Mountain site. . . .\n\n  What are the EPA, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the National \nAcademy of Sciences? That is the best science we have, and yet he says \nthere is no science involved in this process.\n  He says:\n\n       . . . the legislation limits the ability of the \n     Environmental Protection Agency to set appropriate radiation \n     . . . standards.\n\n  That is contrary to reality. It does not. We do give that authority \nto the EPA.\n  He further says:\n\n       I believe we need to find a permanent solution for the \n     disposal--\n\n  We all agree we need a permanent solution, but the Vice President \ndoes not suggest any permanent solution. He says we ought to have one.\n  We have spent almost $7 billion digging a hole out of Yucca Mountain \nand, in 1998, the ratepayers have paid $16 billion to the Federal \nGovernment to take the waste. Now the taxpayers, as a consequence of \nthe inability of the Federal Government to live under the terms of that \ncontract, are looking at a liability exposure of $40 billion to $80 \nbillion.\n  When the Vice President makes that kind of a statement, I wonder what \nhe is talking about--we need to find a permanent solution. This is a \npermanent solution for disposal of the high-level nuclear waste and is \none based on the best science available to protect public health and \nthe environment.\n  This is just another issue of politics. Obviously, there is a certain \nsensitivity about overriding any President's veto, but there is a \nrecognition of and an obligation to do what is in the interest of the \ntaxpayers and of protecting those 80 sites in 40 States where this \nwaste is stored and getting on with the obligation.\n  What concerns me more than anything is the reality that at some point \nin time we may find ourselves in a position where we simply are unable \nto come to grips with this matter. I am going to quote one of my \nfriends from Nevada who, in a February 9 press release, indicated a key \nvictory on the nuclear waste bill. It is entitled, ``Senators Secure \nVotes Needed to Sustain Presidential Veto.''\n  The interesting paragraph reads, under a criticism of S. 1287:\n\n       The Environmental Protection Agency will have full \n     authority to set radiation standards for Yucca Mountain which \n     many experts say will ultimately prevent--\n\n  Ultimately prevent--\n\n     the site from ever being licensed as a nuclear waste dump.\n\n  Make no mistake about this, there is a conscientious effort by many \npeople who are antinuclear to simply stop the nuclear industry in its \ntracks by making sure there is no permanent repository for that waste. \nThe sequence of what will happen is these reactor sites are licensed \nfor a certain capacity. When that capacity fills up, those plants have \nto shut down, and we can bid goodbye to the nuclear industry. The \nproblem is the administration and those who oppose it have not \nsuggested an alternative as to where we are going to pick up the power.\n\n  It is fair to say the ultimate objective of some people is to ensure \nthat Yucca Mountain is never used, others never want to see a permanent \nrepository built, regardless of where it is. In deference to my good \nfriends from Nevada, clearly they do not want it in their State under \nany terms and circumstances.\n  That is the posture of where we are, but we do have an opportunity \ntoday to bring this matter to a head by overriding the President's veto \nand getting on with the business at hand.\n  I have used a good deal of time this morning. I yield the floor to \nthe other side. First, how much time have I used?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator has used 35\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. That is all that has been used on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, I ask \nunanimous consent that when the Senate resumes the pending ESEA \nlegislation this afternoon, debate only be in order for the remainder \nof the session today.\n  Mr. REID. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, how much time was used by Senator Bingaman \nthis morning on behalf of the people wishing to sustain the \nPresidential veto?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twelve minutes.\n  Mr. REID. And the remaining time, after the morning formalities took \nplace, is evenly divided between the two respective parties?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend from Alaska talked about a little \nhistory this morning, or words to that effect. ``Heard a little \nhistory'' is not very accurate. For example, the chart they just took \ndown shows the Nevada Test Site. Yucca Mountain is not the Nevada Test \nSite. It is a mountain in Nye County. It is separate and apart from the \nNevada Test Site.\n  What my friends from Alaska should do is pull out new notes, not the \nold ones. That is what they were trying to do previously with interim \nstorage: take it to the Nevada Test Site. This is a new bill. They are \nback at Yucca Mountain, which is not the Nevada Test Site. Of course, \nthe Nevada Test Site had a lot of aboveground tests and some \nunderground tests. That whole area is contaminated, and it is going to \ncost billions and billions of dollars to clean up that area.\n  Nevada has sacrificed a great deal. We have done it for national \nsecurity.\n  I, as a young boy, watched the tests go off above ground. We did not \nknow this would kill people. The dust clouds did not blow toward where \nI was watching, thank goodness, at least to my perspective. It blew the \nother way, causing the highest rate of cancer in America. People in \nsouthern Utah and parts of Nevada suffered and still today suffer from \nthe effects of those aboveground tests.\n  As to the underground tests, the Department of Energy and this \nadministration recently included Nevada Test Site workers for the \nability to be compensated for exposure to radiation-type injuries and \nillnesses as a result of working on the underground tests. So Nevada \nhas given a great deal. But, I repeat, the Nevada Test Site is not \nYucca Mountain. History--but the wrong history.\n  I also say, there is some intimation here, by my friend, for whom I \nhave the greatest respect, the chairman of the Energy Committee, who is \nattempting to override the President's veto, talking about radiation \nstandards. He talks about the manager's amendment. No one should be \nfooled. This bill the President vetoed is the same one--the identical \none--that Members of the Senate voted on just a few months ago. Nothing \nhas changed. For my friend to intimate that the managers suddenly \nchanged things from the national Nuclear Regulatory Commission back at \nthe EPA--that was in the bill to begin with.\n  My friend, interestingly, pointed out and showed pictures of States \nwhere\n\n[[Page S3208]]\n\nSenators had the courage to vote for the right principle. Every State \nhe talked about--Colorado, New York, Oregon, North Carolina, \nMassachusetts--is a State where Senators had the courage to vote, and \nthey will vote to sustain the Presidential veto. And why? Because \nevery--I am not talking about 90 percent or 98 percent; I am talking \nabout every--environmental group in America supports the sustainment of \nthe Presidential veto--every environmental group.\n  My friend says, I do not understand what Vice President Gore is \nsaying when he says this veto is protecting the environment. Of course \nit is protecting the environment.\n  My colleague also brings up something that took place--a resolution--\n25 years ago in the Nevada State Legislature. That was 25 years ago. \nWe, in Nevada, in 1982, suddenly began to learn very quickly that there \nwere 70,000 tons of nuclear waste stored around the country. Nevadans--\neveryone in this country--have a different perspective than they did \nbefore.\n  I show my colleagues a chart. This is a chart that is comparable to \nthe one my friend from Alaska showed. What this chart shows is that \nthere are nuclear-generating facilities all over America. In fact, \nthere are 100-some-odd sites where nuclear power is generated in \nAmerica today.\n  He showed his chart. He said: Wouldn't it be wonderful? And the \nnuclear power industry runs ads around the country costing hundreds of \nthousands of dollars--full-page ads, newspaper ads. What they do in \nthese adds is say: Instead of having all these sites, wouldn't it be \nwonderful to wind up having just one? That is a sleight of hand, if \nthere ever was one.\n  I will show you another chart.\n  What will happen is, we will not wind up with simply one site, we \nwill wind up with one more site. These other places will still be \ngenerating nuclear waste. There will be nuclear waste stored in those \nsites. Even those sites that are closed down will still have nuclear \nwaste. They will be nuclear waste sites for many years to come.\n  Why do we want to establish a new repository at Yucca Mountain?\n  Let me show you what this chart shows. This chart illustrates a \nnuclear nightmare. It does not show the highways. We could show \nhighways here, too. But we just wanted to make this relatively simple \nfor illustrative purposes. This chart shows the railroads in America \nwhere nuclear waste will be carried to this one site. If this does not \nsend a chill down your spine, nothing will. Why? Because accidents \nhappen on the railways all the time.\n\n  The chart shows an accident that happened very recently. It happened \non March 21, 2000. This is a picture of an accident that happened in \nOregon. The part of Oregon where this accident took place has dense \nfarmland, lots of water. In this instance, there was a track slightly \nout of line. There was no notice for the accident. Train cars went \ntumbling over each other.\n  Let's see what the newspaper reported about this accident.\n  On this chart, you can see an article from this newspaper, the \nLaGrande Observer, of March 21, 2000. We thought we would get a fairly \nrecently one. But you can pick any time of the year. These accidents \nhappen all the time.\n  But this article shown on the chart is about the same accident that \nis depicted in the previous picture. In the picture, you can see one \nlocomotive, and down here you can see another locomotive in yellow. \nThey are tumbled--turned all over. You can see that it crumpled \neverything in its path. You can see railcars with stuff pouring out of \nthem. This is what they are going to haul nuclear waste in.\n  One problem: They have not figured out any way to safely store \nnuclear waste for transportation purposes. They have come up with some \ndry cask storage containers. These dry cask storage containers, they \nsay, are fine--unless you have an accident and are going more than 30 \nmiles per hour. If you go more than 30 miles per hour, it will breach \nthe container.\n  They also say these containers they have developed are really safe in \na fire--unless it is fueled by diesel and burns for more than 30 \nminutes. We have one train in recent months that burned for 4 days.\n  Also, the point is always raised, what are we going to do with \nnuclear waste? In 1982, that was probably a pretty good question. But \nas the years roll on, that is not a very good question because there is \nan easy answer. You do just as they do out at Calvert Cliffs in \nSouthern Maryland--a nuclear-power-generating facility--you store it \nonsite.\n  Dry cask storage--it is pretty safe if you leave it onsite because \nyou are not going to be traveling 30 miles per hour; it is going to be \nstationary. And, likely, there will not be a diesel fire. Diesel burns \nvery hot. So the odds are very good that if you store it onsite, it \nwill be safe. That is what they are doing at Calvert Cliffs and other \nplaces around the country. We do not need to transport all this stuff \nacross America.\n  I show my colleagues again the chart with the train tracks. We do not \nneed to have this nuclear nightmare. Remember, this chart I am showing \nyou now does not have the highways on it. This is only the railroads. \nWe do not need to establish this very dangerous precedent of hauling \nnuclear waste all over America.\n  The situation is beyond my ability to comprehend except, when I think \nabout it, it is easier to understand because the very powerful, greedy \nnuclear power industry knows it will be safer to leave it where it is. \nThey helped defeat a provision that said the United States of America \nwill take title to this waste. They would not allow that to take place \nin one of the previous bills.\n  They want an issue because they do not want any responsibility for \nthe poison they have created. They want to be able to wash their hands \nof it and send it someplace else. But they cannot do that, even though \nthey might try, because there are always going to be the nuclear waste \nsites where the nuclear-generating facilities exist.\n  We know there are all kinds of problems--problems that relate to \ntransportation. Transportation problems are replete with danger. We \nknow terrorist threats are significant. We know that no matter how hard \nyou try, you cannot keep the trainloads or the truckloads of nuclear \nwaste secret. For example--this is in the Congressional Record from \nprevious debates--one organization wanted to see if they could follow \nthings nuclear on the highways and railways in this country. Yes, they \ncould.\n  Ground water protection. Not only in Nevada, but all along the routes \nwhere 50-plus million people are within a slingshot of these trains and \nhighways, they are all going to be exposed.\n  The risk to children is significant. Radiation standards are not only \nserious in Nevada but wherever these trains and trucks travel.\n  The other question the American public should ask is, Why are we \nhaving this debate? We have voted on nuclear waste time after time. \nEvery vote we have taken has shown we have enough votes to sustain a \nPresidential veto. In fact, it shows there is ground being lost by the \nnuclear power industry. For the first time since 1982, in the House of \nRepresentatives there was a vote taken that had 51 votes more than \nnecessary to sustain a Presidential veto. That was the first time they \nhave had enough votes to sustain a Presidential veto, and they did it \nby more than 50 votes in the House.\n  One reason we are on this path is to take up time. The Senate should \nbe doing other things, but we are here debating whether or not the \nPresidential veto will be sustained.\n  We should be talking about the juvenile justice bill. Why should we \nbe talking about juvenile justice? Let's see the chart. One of my staff \nwent on a short vacation to New Orleans. In the paper they had a number \nof cartoons, and one he brought home to me was from the Dayton Daily \nNews. This is one reason we should be debating things other than \nnuclear waste on the Senate floor today. The number of Americans who \ndied from all our wars since 1775: 650,858. That is the number of \nAmericans who died in all our wars since 1775. The number of Americans \nwho died from guns in the last 20 years tops that: 700,000. All the \nwars since 1775 compared to 700,000. I say maybe we should be doing \nsome work here on the Senate floor dealing with guns.\n  I am from a Western State. I have been a police officer. I have been \na prosecutor. I have been involved in things relating to guns all my \nlife. As I have said on the floor before, when I\n\n[[Page S3209]]\n\nwas 12 years old I was given a 12-gauge shotgun for my birthday. I \nstill have that gun. I am very proud of it. I have a rifle my brothers \nhad when they were younger, and I now have that, and I have all kinds \nof pistols. I have guns. I believe in the second amendment. But I also \nbelieve we have to stop certain things.\n  For example, I think we have to stop crazy people, people with \nemotional problems, and people who are felons, from purchasing guns. \nThat is something we need to debate because there are gun loopholes \nthat allow people to buy guns who should not be able to buy guns. You \ncan go to a gun show in Las Vegas or Denver or Hartford and there are \nno restrictions; anybody can sell to anybody. We should close that \nloophole. Pawn shops--there are loopholes there.\n  We need to constructively determine why in America, in the last 20 \nyears, 700,000 people have been killed by guns--700,000. But no, after \nthe Columbine killings, we passed a juvenile justice bill and nothing \nhas happened. The House passed something. We passed something. We have \nwaited more than a year for a conference to be appointed to deal with \nthat issue. No, we are here debating nuclear waste.\n  There are a lot of other issues we should talk about, such as \nMedicare. For 35 years Medicare has been in existence. When Medicare \ncame into being, there was no need for a prescription drug benefit \nbecause doctors didn't use them to keep people well --they didn't \nexist. In the 35 years since Medicare came into being, there are many \nprescription drugs that save lives and make for people having very good \nyears in those so-called golden years. We should do something to change \nMedicare. The average senior citizen now has 18 prescriptions filled \nevery year.\n  We need to debate this issue. We need to spend some time on this \nfloor determining why senior citizens on Medicare do not have a \nprescription drug benefit. But no, this is an issue we are not going to \nget to right away. Perhaps we won't get to it this year. We are going \nto spend our time talking about nuclear waste and other issues that are \nsimply fillers of time.\n  Paying down the debt? I think it would be good if we had a little \ndiscussion on paying down the debt. There is always a constant \nharangue. George W. Bush, his answer to every problem in the world is \nlower taxes. International problems? Lower the taxes. What to do about \nthe surplus? Lower the taxes. That is his one-liner: Lower the taxes. I \nguess he learned it from his dad who said ``Read my lips.'' But the \nfact of the matter is, paying down the debt is something we should talk \nabout here because before lowering taxes we should talk about the $5.7 \ntrillion debt we have and figure out a way to reduce that \nsignificantly.\n\n  Patients' Bill of Rights? We had a hearing, and Senator Dorgan and I \nare going to come to the floor this week, or the first chance we get, \nto talk about that hearing we had in Las Vegas. At the hearing we had \nin Las Vegas, I guarantee everyone in this room, had they heard these \nstories, tears would come to their eyes and some would break down and \ncry, as they did in that room.\n  One man had two broken legs. He was covered by the managed care \nindustry. They won't get him a wheelchair. He crawled to the orthopedic \nsurgeon, and the surgeon said: I can't help you, go to the HMO. \nSomebody drove him there. He crawled in on his hands and knees and then \nfinally got a wheelchair. He said he has been so denigrated, his spirit \nhas been so broken at how he has been treated by his managed care \nprovider, he felt what he wanted to do was buy a quart of gasoline, \ndouse himself with gasoline, and set himself afire.\n  Another woman who had cancer--she was a nurse--she told of the \nhurdles she had to jump to receive minimal treatment.\n  We had a doctor come in and talk about the impossibility patients \nhave in trying to get care. He is one of the physicians who \nacknowledged that he has lied to insurance companies in an effort to \nget treatment that patients badly need.\n  That is what the Patients' Bill of Rights is all about, and that is \nwhat we should be talking about on the Senate floor today, doing \nsomething to protect people who are sick and need help. They may need \nto go to an emergency room. A woman may need to go to a gynecologist. \nThey are prevented from doing so because of managed care entities that \nhave a lock on this country.\n  What about saving Social Security? Why are we not talking about \nSocial Security? Social Security is not in the danger that people say \nit is in, but it is something we need to take a look at and debate \nhere. How we are going to prolong Social Security past the year 2040 so \npeople can draw 100 percent of their benefits, not 75 to 80 percent?\n  Public schools? It seems everything the majority does regarding \nschools is something to tear down public schools. We need to talk about \nour need for more teachers. We need to give school districts help in \nschool construction. This great Nation is the only superpower left in \nthe world. Doesn't it seem this Nation could spend more than one-half \nof 1 percent of its budget on education? We spend one-half of 1 percent \nof the Federal budget on education. We can do better than that. This \nhas nothing to do with taking away from the power of local schools, \nfrom school districts, to control their schools. There are national \nproblems in which the Federal Government must be involved.\n  There are lots of things we should be working on, but wasting a day \nof time in sustaining a Presidential veto is not one of them. As I said \nbefore, the people who have the courage to vote to sustain the \nPresidential veto are doing the right thing. They are doing the right \nthing for their States. They are doing the right thing for the country. \nThey are doing the right thing in the process for the environment. So \nwhen Vice President Gore said, following the veto by the President, \nthat this is a proenvironmental stand the President took--he said it. I \ndo not think there is anyone in this body who can question the Vice \nPresident's credentials on the environment.\n  We have a lot more to say. The fact of the matter is this is an \nimportant issue. It is important to the country.\n  I look forward to the President's veto being sustained. I acknowledge \nand congratulate and applaud the President for doing this. It would \nhave been easy for him to go with the States with all the power and the \nmoney, but he decided to do what he thought was right for the \nenvironment. I think he has done a very courageous thing. I will always \nremember the President's stand on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I yield the 20 minutes remaining to our \ngood friend from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, before I proceed, let me yield 2 minutes to \nmy good friend from Washington for a comment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, for nearly 60 years, the citizens of the \nTri-Cities in Washington state, Richland, Kennewick and Pasco, have \nworked to guarantee our nation's nuclear defense. Now it's time for the \nfederal government to guarantee these citizens--and the rest of the \nNorthwest--that the nuclear waste produced at Hanford will be moved to \nan adequate storage facility for permanent disposal.\n  The Hanford site contains 177 underground tanks full of radioactive \nand chemical byproduct waste. These aren't small tanks--some are as \nlarge as a four story apartment building, and, in toto, they hold 54 \nmillion gallons of waste: two-thirds of the nation's defense-related \nnuclear waste. This waste resulted from nearly 45 years of plutonium \nproduction at Hanford. Unfortunately, at least 66 of these tanks have \nexceeded their design life by thirty years and have leaked radioactive \nwaste into the soil near the Columbia River. This problem is not going \naway.\n  We need a safe, permanent repository for this waste. We need the \nfederal government to be focused on opening the repository. We need \nthis nuclear waste legislation to become law.\n  Many of the opponents of this legislation are acting as if they do \nnot want a solution to this problem at all. They would rather have \ncommercial waste stored at reactors all around the country and defense \nwaste stored in temporary structures, including the leaking underground \ntanks at Hanford. Delaying work on the repository is not the answer.\n\n[[Page S3210]]\n\n  Continuing with the present situation is irresponsible. I urge an \noverride of the President's veto of this nuclear waste legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thought it was important for my \ncolleague, the senior Senator from the State of Washington, to make \nthose statements because, as we are here today on the floor talking \nabout nuclear waste, I must tell my colleague from the State of Nevada \nit is an important issue. I am sorry he and his colleagues haven't \ngained traction on the issue of guns, but America is wise to that. Try \nas you may, second amendment rights prevail in our country.\n  What we are here to talk about today is the absence of this \nadministration's energy policy. Now, brownouts and blackouts and \nescalating fuel prices seem to take second or third place on the list \nof priorities about which the Senator from Nevada would like to talk. I \nthink the American consumer and that elderly person whose air-\nconditioning may go out this summer at the peak of a heat spell would \nsay this issue is a mighty important issue for this Senate to be \nconsidering.\n  So as it relates to priorities, while I am going to say that some of \nwhat the Senator from Nevada suggested is important for the Senate to \naddress, but this issue is among them in priority. But, of course, my \ncolleagues on the other side have been running for cover for months \nbecause they know that Bill Clinton has no energy strategy, never has \nhad one, and doesn't propose one. He simply runs around Nevada sticking \nhis head in the sand and talking about the politics of the issue \ninstead of the substance of the issue.\n  Well, the veto we are here to attempt to override today is the \nfundamental difference between politics and substance. You heard the \nSenator from Alaska, Mr. Murkowski, in great detail talking about the \npracticality of needing a national nuclear waste policy implemented in \nthis country to be able to sustain our nuclear energy as we now have \nit, but, most importantly, to move forward into the future.\n  For a few moments today, let me talk about where we get our \nelectricity. Somehow, it just comes when you throw on a switch. The \nbulbs light up, the heater turns on, the air-conditioner turns on, and \nwe don't stop to think about the long-term strategy and policy that \nthis country has been engaged in for decades to assure that the light \ndoes come on, that the air-conditioner does turn on, and that we have \nabundant energy.\n  Sixty percent of our electricity comes from coal. Given the concern \nof the other side about climate change, we aren't building new coal \nplants, we are not pushing forward on the technology of clean coal--the \nkind of technology that we ought to be pushing and giving priority to. \nThe Clinton-Gore administration wants to make this situation \ndramatically worse by tying our hands and tying U.S. power companies to \na Kyoto treaty, while allowing our economic competitors in developing \nnations to pollute at will.\n  Shame on you, Bill Clinton and Al Gore, for that kind of silly \nenvironmental policy. Climate change is a serious issue, but it isn't \naddressed in a helpful manner when you walk away from the negotiating \ntable with an agreement that lets China and India and other major \ndeveloping nations pollute at will, penalizing our economy, and doing \nso by trying to develop an anti-fossil-fuel bias in this country, along \nwith the anti-nuclear-energy bias on which the President based his \nveto.\n  We get 20 percent of our electricity from nuclear power. That is why \nwe are having this debate today. We have to sustain at least 20 percent \nof our energy base coming from nuclear if we are ever going to have \nclean air and gain the standards in the nonattainment areas that we \nwant to set. Any right-thinking scientist and right-thinking politician \ntoday knows that fact. They can't argue otherwise. We won't get to the \nclean air levels this country wants without at least a 20-percent blend \nin our energy base coming from nuclear.\n  We have about 10 percent of our electricity coming from hydropower, \nand the Presiding Officer and I know how silly this has become in the \nPacific Northwest. We have a President, a Vice President, and a \nSecretary of the Interior who want to take dams down--all in the name \nof what? Environmental radicals who want to roll back to a history of a \ncentury ago and try to reestablish ourselves without the kind of very \nclean power that our hydro base provides for us. It is not a large \nbase; it is 10 percent of our base, though. Again, it is part of that \n10 percent, 60 percent, 20 percent that has built the stability of an \nintegrated power system for our country over the years that has brought \nus the best electrical service of any nation in the history of the \nworld.\n\n  What we are talking about today is sustaining that capability. We are \nnot talking about tearing dams down. We are talking about finding a \nsafe repository for nuclear waste so we can complete the cycle of \nnuclear energy and allow it to go forward.\n  We get a small percentage of our electricity from solar and wind and \nbiomass. Let me be perfectly clear about my support for these \ntechnologies because I do support them and I am willing to continue to \nallow taxpayer dollars to go into the investment of the technology as \nit relates to solar and wind and biomass. I am also willing to invest \nin fuel cells and fusion energy and other kinds of new technology that \nmay someday supplant the kind of technology about which we are talking.\n  But let's have a reality check because if the Senator from Nevada is \ngoing to talk about the importance, or the lack thereof, of what we \ndebate today, let's talk about this President and this administration's \nenergy budget and where they want to spend money. They want to spend a \nlot of money on wind. They have even said that it is their goal to have \n5 percent of our electricity generated by wind by the year 2020. It \njust so happens that the States of Nevada and Idaho have a little wind. \nIt doesn't all come from politicians. It is kind of natural, and it \nflows through the Rocky Mountains out of Canada. It is the way Mother \nNature created the natural environment which creates a wind opportunity \nout there.\n  But let me talk to you for a moment about a recent report in \nanalyzing the 5 percent wind blend by the year 2020 that this President \nwants.\n  If you calculate what is needed to meet the goal of 5 percent of our \nelectricity coming from wind energy that would require 133,000 \nwindmills. The current wind turbines generate about 750 kilowatts of \nelectricity each. Some of these 750 kilowatt wind turbines have been \ninstalled in Iowa. They are impressive and huge in size. They are on \ntowers 213 feet tall. In addition to that, they have blades with a \nsweep of 164 feet in diameter. What is something comparable in height? \nWell, that is about the height of the Capitol dome in the building in \nwhich we are standing today.\n  Can't you just see all of those spread across the State of Nevada and \nIdaho? What are the environmentalists going to say again about vistas, \nvisions, and horizons? You know and I know what they are going to say--\n``no windmills.'' But that is what this administration wants to talk \nabout because they have this illusion that somehow that is \nenvironmentally sensitive.\n  Have you ever caught an eagle in a 164-foot blade? It is referred to \nas ``avian mortality''--eagles, condors, flying into the turbines and \nbeing killed. Yes. Those machines aren't very environmentally \nsensitive, and they make a great sound across the countryside. They are \nprobably the loudest producer of electricity of any technology we have \ntoday.\n  One-hundred and thirty-plus thousand windmills is the answer to no \nnuclear waste policy? I don't think so. I don't think America thinks \nso. When they are faced with those realities, I think they will turn on \nthis administration and say, Why aren't you being responsible? Why \ncreate a problem when you can solve a problem with a single location in \na permanent, deep, geologic repository that is environmentally safe and \nsound for all under the most stringent of laws and the best technology \navailable?\n  That is what we are talking about. That is a right and responsible \nchoice for the American people to contemplate and for this Senate to \ndebate.\n  There is going to be debate on guns. There is going to be debate on \nhealth care. There is going to be debate on prescription drugs. But, in \nmy opinion, a well founded, well orchestrated energy policy for this \ncountry is every bit\n\n[[Page S3211]]\n\nas valuable and important for us to be involved in as any one of those \nissues.\n  A veto override that this President offered and gave, in my opinion, \nis not an environmental vote. Voting for a sound and sane policy for \nnuclear waste is the No. 1 environmental vote all of us will be making. \nLet's not try to hide it and walk away from it. Let's deal with it up \nfront and in a way that is right and responsible to recognize.\n  As I thought about what I would say here today that might convince my \ncolleagues to vote for a Presidential override, because for some it is \na tough vote and it is a partisan vote, tragically enough, good \nnational energy policy has in this instance become an issue of \npolitics.\n  There is a letter from J.V. Parrish of Energy Northwest based in \nRichland, WA. He writes about the importance of this legislation. I \nfound his words compelling. I want to read them to you. He says:\n\n       Because the Federal Government has not had an effective \n     program to receive spent fuel from this country's commercial \n     power reactors, most of these reactors will have to spend \n     several millions of dollars of ratepayer dollars to provide \n     temporary storage. My own company will spend in excess of $25 \n     million. This is money that could be better spent by the \n     households and businesses in the region on things that would \n     improve their futures.\n\n  What is he talking about? He is talking about utility companies \nhaving to charge their ratepayers more because this administration \nfailed to be responsible in their energy policy.\n  I think as time goes on we will find a lot of other things in which \nour President failed to be responsible, and history will record him \ndifferently. I hope the absence of a nuclear waste policy is one of \nthem because that is the way it deserves to be remembered.\n\n  All I would say to President Clinton is: In vetoing this bill, you \nhave failed, once again, to do the right thing for the country but my \ncolleagues and I don't have to be a party to your failure.\n  I encourage my colleagues to vote to override the President's mistake \nand override this veto.\n  Mr. President, I yield my time.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, how much time is remaining from the 20 \nminutes that was allotted?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Three and one-half minutes are \nstill remaining.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I want to point out a couple of things. I saw my \nfriend from California on the floor a few moments ago. I guess she \nintends to speak.\n  Let me point out something that I think is paramount as we address \nthis matter. That is the reality of where this waste is and where this \nwaste is coming in.\n  I think it is important to note that San Francisco is obviously key \nbecause just up from the area of Sacramento and the Sacramento River is \nConcord, CA. Concord, CA, is unique inasmuch as it has been designated \nby the Clinton administration as one of the major west coast ports for \nreceiving high-level nuclear waste under the Foreign Research Reactor \nProgram.\n  It is kind of interesting because over a 13-year period some portion \nof 20 tons of spent nuclear fuel from 41 countries will be shipped to \nthe United States for storage, and a good portion of that will come \ninto Concord, CA. Once it gets into Concord, CA, it will be shipped \nfrom the Concord Naval Weapons Station in California, and it will \nfollow a route up to Idaho. That shipment will either go by rail or \ntruck.\n  I think it is significant to recognize the reality that we move \nwaste. The waste moves in areas that are prone to earthquakes. \nCalifornia certainly is. California has four nuclear reactors \ncurrently: San Onofre, Rancho Seco--and one which is shut down. Here is \nanother opportunity for the waste to simply stay at the shutdown \nreactor, or move almost 20 percent of California's electricity which \ncomes from nuclear energy.\n  I might add that the residents of California have paid $762 million \ninto a nuclear waste fund. That is three-quarters of a billion dollars.\n  In 1998, nuclear reactors avoided about 5.35 million metric tons of \nCO2 emissions. Have they helped with the greenhouse gases? Since 1983, \nthe total avoided greenhouse emissions are 83 million metric tons. \nThese are to be avoided as a consequence of the contribution of nuclear \npower in California. During 1998, nuclear power avoided 878 tons of \nsulfur dioxide in California.\n  If indeed my friend from California intends to speak on this issue, I \nwould certainly encourage her to address the concerns of California \nbeing chosen as the West Coast recipient for the transfer of waste from \nthe 41 countries and some 20 tons of spent fuel.\n  On the east coast, the Charleston Naval Weapons Station in South \nCarolina will be the recipient of waste moving by rail and truck.\n  This is pertinent to the discussion at hand. We have heard in detail \nthe question of the important agenda before the Senate, whether we are \ntalking about juvenile justice, protecting Medicare or Patients' Bill \nof Rights. These are all important issues, but so is this. It is \nimportant we get this issue behind us. It is costing the taxpayers a \ngood deal every day it goes unresolved--$40 to $80 billion in \nliability. That continues to increase as a consequence of the Nation's \ninability to honor the sanctity of the contracts.\n  I urge my colleagues to reflect on the importance of this bill, the \nimportance of this legislation, and not be misled. It is meaningful to \nthe taxpayers of this country that we vote today to override the \nPresident's veto.\n  How much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time remaining is 27\\1/2\\ minutes out of \nthe original 90.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. And we have more this afternoon, is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One hour equally divided.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I yield myself 20 minutes.\n  The proponents of this legislation, who would have us override the \nPresidential veto, proclaim this is an environmental savior. In point \nof fact, this legislation is an unenvironmental travesty. It represents \nthe most cynical assault to date on the environment.\n  I will respond to a general criticism frequently made. That is, that \nthe deadline for the opening of a permanent repository in 1998 as \ncontemplated in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, enacted in 1982, has been \nbreached. There is no permanent repository that will be opened for any \ntime within the foreseeable future, in my judgment. The reason is that \npolitics, not science, has been involved in this process, including \nproponents of nuclear power and, more specifically, the nuclear \nindustry itself, and its advocates who appear on the floor.\n  Let me briefly, as I have on many occasions over the past 12 years of \nmy Senate tenure, give a little bit of history. In 1982, the Nuclear \nWaste Policy Act was enacted by the Congress. It sought to search the \nentire country for three sites to be studied. Those would be sent to \nthe President of the United States, and the President himself would \nselect one of those sites as the repository location. It was \ncontemplated there would be regional equity in balance, and indeed, \nsome of the promising geologic formations in upper New England, the \nformations of granite, would be examined. We would look at the salt \ndome locations in the southeastern part of our States, and, yes, the \ngeology of Nevada would be considered, as well, what was referred to as \nwelded tuff.\n  That was a fair and balanced approach. Let science look throughout \nthe country for the best sites. Those sites would be recommended. That \ndid not occur. It did not occur because politics, not science, dictated \nthe conclusion. No sooner had the act been signed into law in January \nof 1983 by then-President Reagan than the Department of Energy made a \nunilateral decision it would not look at the granite formations because \nthe people in that part of the country would strongly resist the \nlocation of a permanent repository in their State. Is that science? Of \ncourse not. It was politics.\n  Then in the 1984 Presidential campaign, President Reagan assured \nthose in the Southeast that the salt dome formations would not be \nconsidered. Was that science? Of course not. It was politics.\n  Then finally in 1987, legislation, which is infamously known in my \nState as the ``Screw Nevada'' bill, the\n\n[[Page S3212]]\n\nwhole concept of the original Nuclear Waste Policy Act to search the \ncountry and truly try to come up with the right science and the right \nlocation, all of that was cast into the ash bin because politics, not \nscience, dictated only one site would be studied.\n\n  When I hear the lamentations about the delays and all the money that \nhas been spent, it is politics that has caused that, and politics that \ninterfered with the science of the process.\n  Today we have the most recent cynical political attempt to manipulate \nthe process. In that 1982 legislation, the Environmental Protection \nAgency was selected as the agency to establish health and safety \nstandards. Who better than the Environmental Protection Agency? For \nmore than a decade, that was not questioned.\n  Then in 1992, there was, in the Energy Act of that year, an attempt \nto inject another aspect of the equation. The National Academy of \nSciences was asked to review the process and come up with a range of \nrecommendations. Make no mistake, the distinguished predecessor \nchairman to the distinguished Senator from Alaska has been debating as \na great advocate of nuclear power and was advocating a position sought \nfor the nuclear power industry. It was his hope and expectation that \nthe National Academy of Sciences would somehow cast an aspersion and \nquestion the credibility of the Environmental Protection Agency's \nproposed regulations when they were issued.\n  We have the regulations now. Let me describe them briefly. This chart \nexpresses the recommendations or the regulations proposed by the EPA in \nterms of the millirems of radioactive exposure per year per person. \nThat is one of the standards involved. The EPA has proposed a standard \nof millirems. That is 15 millirems and is the only reason we are on \nfloor today debating the veto override of the President. That is the \nEPA's proposed standard.\n  Now what does National Academy of Sciences say the appropriate \nstandard should be? Remember, they expressed that in a range. NAS \nrefers to the National Academy of Science. They are saying the range \nshould be between 2 and 20 millirems; 15, by any standard, is in that \nmid-range. S. 1287 in its original iteration--not the bill before the \nSenate, but in the original iteration--proposed a standard that was \nnearly twice the rate of exposure per person per year, a 30 millirem \nstandard. That is what the nuclear industry desires, the 30 millirem \nstandard. The NRC has come up with a standard of 25 millirems. WIPP, a \nwaste isolation facility in the State of New Mexico which currently \nhouses transuranic nuclear waste, the standard set by EPA not objected \nto, 15 millirem.\n  Why the difference? Why are we debating this? Because the nuclear \npower industry does not want a 15 millirem standard; they prefer a 30 \nmillirem standard. The legislation ultimately submitted by the \nPresident interferes with the Environmental Protection Agency in moving \nforward with that and seeks to delay the final rule of 15 millirems.\n  My friend from Alaska has pointed out his responsibilities as the \nchairman of this committee. I understand that. I respect that and I \nrespect him. But let's talk about what we are trying to do. We are \ntrying to jury-rig, to skew this standard so that under every \ncircumstance Yucca Mountain will meet the scientific criteria. The only \nway they can do that is to move the goalposts, and that is what the \nSenator from Alaska has indicated is his primary purpose. What he wants \nis to ``make sure that the measuring,'' referring to radioactivity, \n``is under a regulation that allows waste to go to Yucca Mountain.''\n\n  That says nothing about safety--safety for millions of Americans, \nsafety for several hundreds of thousands of people who would live \nwithin the affected vicinity, the 2 million people who live in Nevada. \nThat is what we are talking about, health and safety. We are not \ntalking about whether nuclear power is good or bad. That debate can be \nhad another day. We are talking about health and safety. That is why \nmany of us have become energized.\n  It is fair to say there are different ways in which these accidents \nhave occurred, but I wish to illustrate the magnitude of the problem. \nWith radioactivity, we are talking about something that is lethal, \ndeadly, not for generations, but thousands of years--not only a few \ngenerations, but thousands of generations. We are not talking about a \nmistake we could make today and correct in the next Congress or the \nnext decade or even in the next century; and we are talking about \nsomething that is lethal.\n  Our friends advocating on behalf of this legislation do not like us \nto point this out, but let's talk a little bit about the history, since \nhistory has been mentioned. In the dawn of the nuclear age, between \n1945 and 1968, some 23 years, there were a series of accidents \ninvolving nuclear reactors and nuclear power. Some six people were \nkilled as a consequence. I am not suggesting the circumstances are \nidentical to what would be involved with the storage of high-level \nradioactivity, but I point out this is not just an academic discussion. \nWe are talking about things that cause people to die--not get sick and \nthen get well, but die. That is a very final medical judgment: Death.\n  In the Soviet Union, in 1957, a container of nuclear waste exploded \nand nearly 11,000 people were evacuated. We don't know how many people \nmay have died as a consequence of that. Theirs is a society, unlike our \nown, that is closed. We don't get as much information as we would like.\n  In 1961, at Idaho Falls, ID, an explosion occurred within a reactor \nvessel that resulted in the individuals who were at the reactor site \nbeing impaled with a spent fuel rod. Two men were killed. To give you \nsome indication of how lethal, how deadly this is, the remains of those \ntwo men who were tragically killed in that accident, by virtue of their \ncontact with the spent fuel rod--and that is what we are talking about \nwith the civilian reactor waste--by virtue of their contact, their \nbodies themselves had become high-level nuclear waste. It is a rather \nunpleasant thought but it is true. So in making the arrangements the \nrelatives had to make, they were not only talking about selecting \nsomething that might be at the local undertaker's home; they had to \ndesign a facility that protected against high-level nuclear waste \nbecause the victims themselves had become high-level nuclear waste. \nThat is why health and safety is such a critical concern for us.\n  We could go on and on. We had the Three Mile Island tragedy. \nFortunately, that situation did not result in any loss of life.\n  Let me comment on Chernobyl for a moment, because, yes, I have \nreferred to this legislation as the ``mobile Chernobyl.'' I do so \nbecause it involves some very serious issues. Last week, in the \nWashington Post--and I will yield in a moment to my colleague from \nCalifornia who has rejoined us on the floor, but let me finish this \nthought, if I may--the United Nations released an assessment of the \nChernobyl nuclear meltdown that occurred 14 years ago, saying the worst \nhealth consequences for 7.1 million people may be yet to come. Then, in \nmaking the contrast my colleague from Nevada and I tried to make on so \nmany occasions, in explaining in Chernobyl, at least 100 times as much \nradiation was released by this accident as by the two atomic bombs we \ndropped in World War II on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Then this article \ngoes on to say:\n\n       The number of those likely to develop serious medical \n     conditions because of delayed reactions to radiation exposure \n     will not be known until 2016 at the earliest.\n\n  Yes, this is about health and safety; and do I get mad? You bet I do, \nbecause we are talking about the health and safety, not only of \nmillions of Americans, but 2 million people who live in my own State. \nDo we want science and not politics to be the way in which these \nstandards are set? The answer is you bet we do. I am greatly offended \nand outraged the suggestion would be made on the floor of the Senate \nthat we should let politics dictate this health and safety issue \nbecause we want to make sure that, whatever the cost, we have to make \nsure Yucca Mountain qualifies. That was not the concept and spirit of \nthe 1982 legislation, and it should not be the spirit that activates us \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my colleague from \nCalifornia be recognized and, upon the completion of her remarks, I \nmight again be recognized to take the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S3213]]\n\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Nevada, Mr. \nBryan, and Senator Reid, the assistant Democratic leader, for their \nincredible leadership, and I might say sometimes lonely leadership, on \nthis issue of nuclear waste safety.\n  I strongly oppose S. 1287. I believe the bill is bad policy. \nPresident Clinton has rejected it, and I urge my colleagues in the \nSenate to join him. I think it is a dangerous bill. I think it is \nimportant to note that this Senate has stopped this bill in its tracks \nfive times at least. I believe today we will stop it again. So the \nquestion is, Why do we keep turning to this bill over and over and over \nagain when so many people, including the President of the United States \nand the Vice President, have so many concerns that, in fact, it would \nbe quite dangerous for our people? Why do we turn to it?\n  I think Senator Reid was quite eloquent when he made the point, it is \nnot as if we do not have other things to do. It is not as if there are \nnot issues that are crying out to be debated and discussed on this \nSenate floor. He mentioned a few of those. I thought it would be good \nto simply summarize what I think about what he said.\n  Clearly, we need to take up education. We are going to an education \nbill. However, we are now taking time away from that education debate \nwhen people want us to make it the No. 1 issue: smaller class sizes, \nafterschool--we know the things people want--school renovation, teacher \ntraining. We are now taking precious time of the Senate away from that \nwhen we could be starting that debate.\n  A good Patients' Bill of Rights bill passed out of the House of \nRepresentatives. I thought the bill that passed out of the Senate was \nnot as good. It was really a sham. I thought it was an HMO Bill of \nRights for the HMOs. But that is in the conference committee. We ought \nto work on that.\n  Sensible gun control--we passed five sensible gun control measures in \nthe juvenile justice bill.\n  Every day 12 children die of gun violence. In my State of California, \nit is the No. 1 cause of death among children. Senator Reid had an \nincredible cartoon that ran showing the amazing number of deaths. \nDuring the Vietnam war, there were 58,000 deaths over an 11-year \nperiod. In the last 11 years, we have lost 300,000 Americans to gun \nviolence. Why are we taking up a bill that is dangerous--and I will get \ninto why it is dangerous--when we could be making our lives less \ndangerous? It does not make sense.\n  Then Senator Craig from Idaho says this administration has no energy \npolicy. Maybe that is because the Republican side keeps reducing the \namount the President wants to spend on energy efficiency, which is so \nimportant. It is the cheapest way to get more energy.\n  Campaign finance reform is an issue Senator McCain and Senator \nFeingold bring continually before us. It passed in the House, but it is \ngetting the death knell in the Senate. This is just a handful of \nissues. If protecting the health of our citizens is our highest \npriority--and indeed it should be--then we should not be taking up a \nbill that will expose our people to illness and danger. This is not a \nbill that makes life better for our people. It is a bill that is going \nto make life worse for our people.\n  It has been described as a compromise bill, but, in my view, it is \nstill an attempt to bypass and preempt science and legislate the \nscientific suitability of Yucca Mountain, NV, as a high-level nuclear \nwaste dump. It is not based on reality or on fact. Instead of finding a \nrepository that meets the health and safety standards we have \nestablished in law, this legislation attempts to weaken our health and \nsafety standards to make Yucca Mountain fit because some people \ncommitted themselves to Yucca Mountain, and it does not seem to matter \nwhat the facts are; they just keep on going down that path. I cannot, \nand I will not, support such action.\n  For many years, we have debated the suitability of a high-level \nradioactive waste dump at Yucca Mountain, and for years I have been on \nthe Senate floor with my colleagues from Nevada fighting to protect the \nhealth and safety of the citizens of Nevada.\n  I want my colleagues to know that today I am fighting not only for \ntheir citizens but for the citizens of the State of California. In \nfact, because of recent studies, we know that if we go forward with \nYucca Mountain, it will seriously impact the people I represent.\n  Yucca Mountain is only 17 miles from the California border and from \nDeath Valley National Park. I have a map to show how close we are. We \ncan see where the Yucca Mountain repository site is and how close Death \nValley National Park is to Yucca Mountain. There is Yucca Mountain, \nDeath Valley National Park in Inyo County, and then San Bernardino \nCounty.\n  I want to show my colleagues the beauty of Death Valley National \nPark. This is one magnificent view of Death Valley National Park. It \namazes me when we make these incredibly important investments in our \nenvironment and in the beauty of our Nation to protect and preserve it, \nwith the next vote, we vote for a nuclear waste dump that can adversely \nimpact on this national treasure. I will explain that.\n  The development of Yucca Mountain has the potential to contaminate \nCalifornia's ground water. It poses a threat to the health and safety \nof Californians from possible transportation accidents related to the \nshipping of high-level nuclear waste through Inyo, San Bernardino, and \nneighboring California counties.\n\n  Since its inception as a national monument in 1933, the Federal \nGovernment has invested more than $600 million in Death Valley National \nPark. The park receives over 1.4 million visitors each and every year.\n  The communities surrounding the park are economically dependent on \ntourism. The income generated by the presence of the park exceeds $125 \nmillion per year. The park has been the most significant element in the \nsustainable growth of the tourist industry in the Mojave Desert. This \nchart is a blown-up photo of how close the national park is to Yucca \nMountain and why these two counties have concerns.\n  Scientific studies show that a significant part of the regional \nground water aquifer surrounding Yucca Mountain discharges in Death \nValley because the valley is downgradient of areas to the east. If the \nground water at Death Valley is contaminated from nuclear waste stored \nat Yucca Mountain, it will be the demise of the park and the \nsurrounding communities.\n  The long-term viability of fish, wildlife, and human population in \nthese areas are largely dependent on water from this aquifer. The vast \nmajority of the park's visitors rely on services and facilities at the \npark headquarters near Furnace Creek. These facilities are all \ndependent upon the ground water aquifer that flows under or near Yucca \nMountain. Unfortunately, there is no alternative water source that can \nsupport these visitor facilities and wildlife resources. So I cannot \nunderstand why, on the one hand, we create a magnificent park--we spent \n$600 million on it; we get tourist dollars from it--and on the other \nhand in another vote we endanger this magnificent monument and the \npeople who live in the surrounding areas.\n  Water is life in the desert. Water quality must be preserved for the \nviability of Death Valley National Park, the dependent tourism \nindustry, and the surrounding communities.\n  We do not have the science that tells us that Yucca Mountain is safe, \nand the potential loss is far too great. It has been hard to get the \nEnergy Department to accept California's connection to the site. Every \ntime they talk about the site, they talk about Nevada. Finally, they \nrecognize that Inyo County, CA, as an effective unit of local \ngovernment under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, actually qualifies. \nThere had to be, unfortunately, a lawsuit by the county that resulted \nin DOE granting affected unit status in 1991.\n  It is very important my colleagues understand that my concern comes \nfrom the local people.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a letter from the \nboard of supervisors of the county of Inyo.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                               Independence, CA, February 1, 2000.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, D.C.\n       Dear Senator Boxer, I am writing to express concern with S. \n     1287, the Nuclear Waste\n\n[[Page S3214]]\n\n     Policy Amendments Act of 1999. S. 1287 proposes to abandon \n     current specific DOE guidelines for determining the \n     suitability of Yucca Mountain, Nevada (for siting of a \n     nuclear waste repository) in lieu of less-demanding, \n     generalized criteria. S. 1287 also removes the role of the \n     Environmental Protection Agency from determining the human \n     health standard to which repository design and operations \n     should be held.\n       S. 1287, as it currently stands, would replace DOE's \n     current and specific site suitability criteria (10 CFR 960--\n     adopted in 1986 after considerable public input) with a \n     generalized ``total system performance assessment'' approach \n     (proposed in 10 CFR 963) which does not require the site to \n     meet specific criteria with regard to site geology and \n     hydrology or waste package performance. Replacement of the \n     current site suitability criteria by 10 CFR 963 would reduce \n     the likelihood that the repository would be designed and \n     constructed using the best available technology. Individual \n     components of the repository system could be less than \n     optimal in design and performance if computer modeling of the \n     design showed it capable of meeting NRC's less-demanding \n     standard. Given the significant long-term risk that \n     development of the repository places on California \n     populations and resources, any compromises on repository \n     design, operations or materials cannot be tolerated.\n       S. 1287 allows the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to set a \n     standard for protection of the public from radiological \n     exposure associated with development of the repository. The \n     power to set a standard for the Yucca Mountain project \n     rightfully belongs with the EPA in its traditional role of \n     setting health standards for Federal projects. In our recent \n     response to EPA's proposed radiological health standard for \n     the repository, Inyo County stated its strong support for EPA \n     authority over the project and for use of a standard which \n     focuses on maintaining the safety of groundwater in the Yucca \n     Mountain-Amargosa Valley-Death Valley region.\n       Based on these considerations, S. 1287 will not provide \n     adequate protection for Inyo County resources or citizens. We \n     hope that the provisions in the bill for setting repository \n     standards and for changing the site suitability guidelines \n     will be deleted.\n       We appreciate your continued support of Inyo County's \n     efforts to safeguard the health and safety of its citizens.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Michael Dorame,\n                        Supervisor, Fifth District County of Inyo.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I shall not read the entire letter. The Board of \nSupervisors, County of Inyo--and these are the local government \nofficials to whom my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are \nconstantly saying we have to pay attention--let us pay attention to \nthem. They are saying:\n\n       [We] are writing to express concern with S. 1287, the \n     Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1999.\n\n  They go on to say why it is flawed. They say there is a ``significant \nlong-term risk that development of the repository places on \nCalifornia''--that it places California in an untenable position. In \nvery strong language they ask that we not approve this. They say it \ndoes not ``provide adequate protection for Inyo County resources or \ncitizens'' and that they are very concerned about it.\n  I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter \nfrom the Board of Supervisors of San Bernardino County.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                             Board of Supervisors,\n\n\n                                     County of San Bernardino,\n\n                             San Bernardino, CA, January 12, 2000.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: The Board of Supervisors unanimously \n     approved the attached resolution at our meeting yesterday. It \n     expresses our substantial concern over the lack of \n     notification from the Department of Energy with regard to \n     their plans to transport thousands of shipments of high-level \n     radioactive waste through the major cities of our County.\n       The only hearing held in this State took place in a remote \n     area hundreds of miles from our major population centers. In \n     addition we were not provided with any official notification \n     of the Issuance of the Environmental Impact Statement nor \n     were we provided a copy of same.\n       While we understand that transportation and storage/\n     disposal of this material is essential for operation of \n     various facilities, it is only appropriate that the \n     jurisdictions which will be recipient of the majority of \n     these shipments be given notice and response opportunities.\n       We ask for your strong support for our request to the \n     Department of Energy for full disclosure, additional time for \n     response and review, and for a public hearing to be held in \n     our area. The hearing should be held somewhere near the \n     population centers which will be subject to these shipments \n     and the potential dangers imposed thereby.\n       We appreciate your serious consideration of this request.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Jerry Eaves,\n                                       Supervisor, Fifth District.\n\n                         Resolution No. 2000-10\n\n       Whereas, the United States Department of Energy, has \n     prepared an Environmental Impact Statement for the Yucca \n     Mountain High Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Site, and\n       Whereas, the COUNTY of SAN BERNARDINO has learned through \n     non-official sources that the United States Government plans \n     to construct and operate a disposal site for high level \n     radioactive waste which will include spent nuclear fuel rods, \n     and\n       Whereas, no less than a year ago, the COUNTY of SAN \n     BERNARDINO was provided inadequate notification on another \n     Department of Energy Radioactive Waste project and formally \n     expressed its objections to the lack of proper notification, \n     and\n       Whereas, almost all of the shipment will pass through major \n     population centers in San Bernardino County on Interstate \n     Highways 10, 15 and 40, State Route 247 and rail lines in San \n     Bernardino County, and\n       Whereas, the project presents obvious potential hazards \n     from transportation accidents, which place an unnecessary \n     additional burden on emergency response resources; and\n       Whereas, had it not been for the news media; the public \n     would not have known that the project was underway because no \n     public hearing has been scheduled or held in San Bernardino \n     County or anywhere else in Southern California, and\n       Whereas, there has been no opportunity for our citizens to \n     review or comment on this project in a formal setting, and\n       Whereas, the citizens of the COUNTY of SAN BERNARDINO have \n     a right to be informed of and have an opportunity to comment \n     on a project of this magnitude that poses a potential \n     significant threat to their health, property, air and water \n     quality and other natural resources, and\n       Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Board of \n     Supervisors of the COUNTY of SAN BERNARDINO, petition the \n     United States Department of Energy to extend the comment \n     period on the Yucca Mountain Project, and\n       Further be it Resolved that public hearings be held by the \n     Department of Energy in San Bernardino County so as to \n     provide our citizens a reasonable opportunity to comment on \n     this project, and\n       Further be it Resolved that this resolution be forwarded \n     without delay to United States Senators Boxer and Feinstein \n     and Congressmen Lewis, Baca and Miller.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. This letter expresses substantial concern over this \nproject. They are asking us to be very careful with shipments and with \nthe entire project.\n  Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a letter from the County of Ventura.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                            County of Ventura,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 1, 2000.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: I am writing to reiterate the Ventura \n     County Board of Supervisors' opposition to S. 1287, the \n     Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments of 1999, which, as currently \n     written, would allow spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste \n     to be transported through Ventura County.\n       The Board of Supervisors endorses the development of a \n     national policy for the transportation of spent nuclear fuel. \n     However, the Board opposes transporting these materials \n     through Ventura County. County officials and residents are \n     concerned about the proximity of the Diablo Canyon Nuclear \n     Power Plant in San Luis Obispo County and the vulnerability \n     to potential disasters related to the transportation of \n     hazardous materials through the community, which poses \n     serious health and safety risks to County residents.\n       Please vote against S. 1287 unless it is amended to \n     prohibit the transportation of spent nuclear fuel and \n     radioactive waste through Ventura County and other heavily \n     populated areas.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                Thomas P. Walters,\n                                        Washington Representative.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. In this letter they reiterate their opposition to this \nbill. They say it would be very dangerous for their residents because \nthe waste could be transported through Ventura County.\n  On this map I show my colleagues, even the counties next to Inyo and \nSan Bernardino are very upset that waste will come all through \nCalifornia. Ventura County is taking a stand. They say:\n\n       Please vote against S. 1287. . . .\n\n  I have a letter from the California Energy Commission. I ask \nunanimous consent it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S3215]]\n\n\n\n\n                                 California Energy Commission,\n\n                                 Sacramento, CA, February 7, 2000.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: We have reviewed S. 1287 (Nuclear Waste \n     Policy Amendments Act of 2000) (NWPA) and offer the following \n     comments.\n       The State of California, including thirteen California \n     agencies, has reviewed the Department of Energy's (DOE) Draft \n     Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) for the proposed Yucca \n     Mountain High-Level Nuclear Waste Repository. This review, \n     coordinated by the California Energy Commission, identified \n     major areas of deficiencies and scientific uncertainties in \n     the DEIS regarding potential transportation and groundwater \n     impacts in California from the repository. In light of these \n     deficiencies and uncertainties, there are serious questions \n     whether a decision should/can be made on the Yucca Mt. site's \n     suitability in time for shipments to begin in 2007, as \n     required by S. 1287.\n       These deficiencies and uncertainties include the need for \n     better data and more realistic models to evaluate groundwater \n     flow and potential radionuclide migration toward regional \n     groundwater supplies in eastern California. In addition, \n     there are major scientific uncertainties regarding key \n     variables affecting how well geologic and engineered barriers \n     at the repository can isolate the wastes from the \n     environment. For example, there is considerable uncertainty \n     regarding waste package corrosion rates, potential water \n     seepage through the walls of the repository, groundwater \n     levels and flow beneath the repository, and the potential \n     impact on California aquifers from the potential impact on \n     California aquifers from the potential migration of \n     radionuclides from the repository. California is concerned \n     about these uncertainties and deficiencies in studies of the \n     Yucca Mt. project and the serious lack of progress in DOE's \n     developing transportation plans for shipments to the \n     repository.\n       Potential major impacts in California from the proposed \n     repository include: (1) transportation impacts, (2) potential \n     radionuclide contamination of groundwater in the Death Valley \n     region, and (3) impacts on wildlife, natural habitat and \n     public parks along shipment corridors and from groundwater \n     contamination. Transportation is the single area of the \n     proposed Yucca Mt. project that will affect the most people \n     across the United States, since the shipments will be \n     traveling cross-country on the nation's highways and \n     railways. California is a major generator of spent nuclear \n     fuel and currently stores this waste at four operating \n     commercial nuclear power reactors, three commercial reactors \n     being decommissioned, and at five research reactor locations \n     throughout the State. Under current plans, spent nuclear fuel \n     shipments from California reactors will begin the first year \n     of shipments to a repository or storage facility.\n       In addition to the spent fuel generated in California, a \n     major portion of the shipments from other states to the Yucca \n     Mountain site could be routed through California. This \n     concern was elevated recently when DOE decided, over the \n     objections of California and Inyo and San Bernardino \n     Counties, to reroute through southeastern California, along \n     California Route 127, thousands of low-level waste shipments \n     from eastern states to the Nevada Test Site, in order to \n     avoid nuclear waste shipments through Las Vegas and over \n     Hoover Dam. We objected to DOE's rerouting these shipments \n     over California Route 127 because this roadway was not \n     engineered for such large volumes of heavy truck traffic, \n     lacks timely emergency response capability, is heavily \n     traveled by tourists, and is subject to periodic flash \n     flooding. We are concerned that S. 1287, by requiring that \n     shipments minimize transport through heavily populated areas, \n     could force NWPA shipments onto roadways in California, such \n     as State Route 127, that are not suitable for such shipments.\n       The massive scale of these shipments to the repository or \n     interim storage site will be unprecedented. Nevada's \n     preliminary estimates of potential legal-weight truck \n     shipments to Yucca Mountain show that an estimated 74,000 \n     truck shipments, about three-fourths of the total, could \n     traverse southern California under DOE's ``mostly truck'' \n     scenario. Shipments could average five truck shipments daily \n     through California during the 39-year time period of waste \n     emplacement. Under a mixed truck and rail scenario, \n     California could receive an average of two truck shipments \n     per day and 4-5 rail shipments per week for 39 years. Under a \n     ``best case'' scenario that assumes the use of large rail \n     shipping containers, Nevada estimates there could be more \n     than 26,000 truck shipments and 9,800 shipments through \n     California to the repository.\n       We are concerned that S. 1287 would require NWPA shipments \n     begin prematurely before the necessary studies determining \n     the site's suitability have been completed and before the \n     transportation impacts of this decision have been fully \n     evaluated. S. 1287 accelerates the schedule for the \n     repository by requiring shipments to begin at the earliest \n     practicable date and no later than January 31, 2007. In \n     contrast, DOE has been planning for shipments to begin in \n     2010, a date considered by many to be overly optimistic. \n     Shipping waste to a site before the necessary scientific \n     evaluations of the site have been completed and before route-\n     specific transportation impacts have been fully evaluated \n     could have costly results. The DOE nuclear weapons complex \n     has many examples of inappropriate sites where expediency has \n     created a legacy of very costly waste clean-up, e.g., \n     Hanford, Washington. The use of methods that were not fully \n     tested for the storage and disposal of nuclear wastes has \n     resulted in contaminants from these wastes leaking into the \n     environment. Transporting waste to a site, as mandated by S. \n     1287, before the appropriate analyses are completed could \n     create a ``de facto'' high-level waste repository in \n     perpetuity with unknown and potentially serious long-term \n     public and environmental consequences.\n       Attached is information that might be useful in formulating \n     your position on S. 1287. It includes (1) our specific \n     comments on S. 1287, (2) an overview of our comments on the \n     Yucca Mountain Draft EIS, and (3) Resolution 99-014 passed by \n     the Western Governor's Association on Spent Nuclear Fuel \n     Shipments. If you have any questions regarding these \n     materials, please phone me at (916) 654-4001 or Barbara Byron \n     at (916) 654-4976.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Robert A. Laurie,\n\n                            Commissioner and State Liaison Officer\n                             to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. This letter is quite long and goes into all the \nobjections, with detailed comments, and the concerns they have about \nYucca Mountain.\n  I think the important point here is, this is not just a Nevada issue. \nEven when in my mind it was, I would never subject the people of Nevada \nto this kind of a dangerous policy. It now includes the people of \nCalifornia. We are very concerned about transportation routes, very \nconcerned about the ability of this material to migrate into an aquifer \nthat serves the counties surrounding it, and we could go on and on.\n  Even the Western Governors' Association has repeatedly asked the \nEnergy Department to complete an analysis of the transportation routes \nto Yucca Mountain, to no avail.\n  So we have a lot of problems with this bill in my home State of \nCalifornia.\n  The radiation to be allowed at Yucca Mountain would be much higher \nthan is allowed under current regulations. The DOE study finds that \nmaximum doses at the site would be 50 millirems per year. I am sure my \ncolleagues have gone into it, but sometimes you repeat facts because \nthey are very important. I would like to put the numbers into \nperspective.\n  That amount of radiation would equal approximately 5,000 chest x rays \nannually. It is 2,000 times higher than what the public is currently \npermitted to receive from an operating powerplant under EPA \nregulations.\n  I will say, under NRC and DOE risk estimates, it is my \nunderstanding--I am going to just double-check here--studies have shown \nthat if these people were exposed to the maximum, virtually all of them \nwould get cancer. That is how much and how high these levels are.\n  In conclusion, my colleagues from Nevada have done us a great \nservice. Even before I knew the extent to which they were actually \nfighting was not only for Nevada but for California, I knew they were \ndoing the right thing, because if we do not stand up and protect the \nhealth and safety of the people we represent, what use are we? What \ngood are we?\n  When a physician takes his or her test to get licensed, they say: Do \nno harm. At a minimum, do no harm. This does harm. If we were, in fact, \nto allow this matter to move forward, I think the people would become \neven more cynical than they are about Government. They will ask: What \nspecial interests are behind this one? How on Earth can we throw out \nthe health and safety regulations to push through this site? Is that \nthe best we can do for this site?\n  I will tell you, it makes me sick at heart. The only thing that keeps \nme going on this one is my colleagues from Nevada, who have stood up in \nthe face of powerful committee chairmen. And you will hear them today. \nOh, you will hear them today. The Senators from Nevada have stood up \nfor the people of this country. I stand with them. I stand with the \npeople of California, who want to protect Death Valley National Park, \nwho want to protect the water supply there, who want to protect our \nFederal investment there, who want to protect the health and safety of \nthe people who have to drink the water and live there.\n  So let us do what we have done five times before. Let us beat back \nthis ill-advised attempt to put a nuclear waste dump where it does not \nbelong. Let us feel good that we have protected the people of this \ncountry. Let us turn to\n\n[[Page S3216]]\n\nthe matters to make life better for our people: Sensible gun laws, an \nHMO Patients' Bill of Rights, education, afterschool programs, smaller \nclass sizes, and campaign finance reform.\n\n  For goodness' sake, let's do something in this Chamber that helps \npeople, not exposes them to risk.\n  Yesterday I was at the Albert Einstein Medical School in New York. \nThey are doing extraordinary things to find cures for cancer, to invest \nin ways to make our people healthier, to work with the Federal \nGovernment to make sure we have enough money going into research. Why \nwould we do things around here that would elevate people's risk of \ngetting cancer? I do not understand it. It does not add up. I listened \nto the arguments on the other side. They simply do not add up.\n  So, again, I associate myself with my friends from Nevada. They are \ncourageous. They are brave. They are right. They are protecting the \npeople of Nevada and the people of California. I hope they will be \nsuccessful. I will be working with them.\n  As I understand it, the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Bryan, will now have \nsome time for further remarks.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada, under a previous \nagreement, is to be allowed to continue now after the Senator from \nCalifornia. He has 5 minutes remaining on his time.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I assure the Senator, I will only speak for 5 minutes \nbecause I understand he has a commitment at noon.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, it was my understanding that after \nthe Senator from Nevada spoke and after the Senator from New Mexico \nspoke, I would be able to speak.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could ask my friend from Nevada to \nyield for a minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator Nevada has the floor.\n  Mr. REID. So everyone understands what we would like to have happen, \nSenator Bryan will speak for 5 or 6 minutes, and then Senator Domenici \nwill take time under the control of Senator Murkowski for whatever time \nhe may consume, and then Senator Bryan and I would be happy to yield to \nSenator Rockefeller 10 minutes to speak on another issue. He has been \nvery supportive of us on this underlying issue of nuclear waste. He \nwants to speak on something regarding his ranking membership dealing \nwith veterans, introducing some legislation. We are happy to allow him \nto do that.\n  I ask that in the form of a unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, for the remaining 5 or 6 minutes, let me \njust complete my thoughts on the issue of health and safety because I \nthink this is the overriding issue.\n  EPA has proposed a standard of 15 millirems, consistent with what was \ndone in New Mexico. S. 1287, in its original form, doubled this. We are \ndebating this issue today because the nuclear utilities do not want the \n15-millirem standard. That is what we are talking about.\n  One can have a difference of opinion as to whether or not nuclear \npower is good or bad or whether Yucca Mountain is or is not the proper \nscientific site. I might say, parenthetically, no one has ever made a \ndetermination that Yucca Mountain will meet the suitability standards. \nThat remains to be seen. But how in God's world can we say we ought to \nchange a health and public safety standard, one that is set by \nindependent agents?\n\n  Let me point out that the history of matters nuclear has indicated \nthat we have underestimated the risk and danger to public health. In \nthe immediate aftermath of World War II, we exposed military veterans \nat Bikini and Eniwetok to levels of radiation exposure that today would \nbe absolutely a crime. In my own youth, while growing up in Nevada, \nwatching the detonations at Frenchman's Flat, where they dropped \nnuclear bombs out of B-29s, we were told it is ``absolutely safe, don't \nworry about a thing.'' Today, we know that nobody in his or her right \nmind would suggest that anyplace in the world. Indeed, the tragedy is \nthat people downwind from that died of cancer and have suffered from \nother mutations.\n  There are literally hundreds of thousands of people in this country \nwho helped us in America prevail in the cold war, working in our \nnuclear weapons production facilities, in the nuclear testing program \nin Nevada, who were told the diseases that they suffered from and the \nsuffering and the death that families had endured had nothing to do \nwith radiation. Today, to the great credit of this administration and \nthe Secretary of Energy, Mr. Richardson, we now acknowledge that it was \nwrong, that people did become ill, and people did die because of \nradiation.\n  Every person in this Chamber will recall in his or her own personal \nlife how, and today, when you get an x ray at your dentist, or a chest \nx ray, the amount of radioactive exposure you have is much less than it \nwas earlier because we are fearful of what the consequences of this \nexposure over a period of time can mean. Many will recall going to the \nlocal shoe store and getting on a fluoroscope; you could see the bones \nin your feet and your mom or your dad would look at that just to see \nwhether or not you had the correct fitting. That was exposure to \nradioactivity. There is no place in the country where that would be \ntolerated today. What did we learn? We learned the risk of \nradioactivity is much greater than we had originally thought.\n  To conclude this aspect of my discussion today, the whole history of \nradioactivity exposure, in terms of its impact upon us as human beings, \nhas been that the standards ought to be increased in terms of safety. \nWe have done that in the private sector; we have done that publicly. \nNow this legislation would suggest that we abandon that, and that in \nthe name of helping out nuclear power industries--utilities \nparticularly--we should reject the health and safety standard. It was \ngood enough for our friends in New Mexico, and I support that, but \nnever objected to. We simply say, look, what is sauce for the goose is \nsauce for the gander. Fifteen millirems is within the range of the \nNational Academy of Sciences. To do anything less is a cynical and \ncavalier disregard for the public health of citizens in America \ngenerally, and Nevadans particularly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to support override of the \nPresident's veto of the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act. This bill, \nS. 1287, under Senator Murkowski's leadership, provided the first \nopportunity for real progress on nuclear waste issues during the term \nof the Clinton Administration.\n  With nuclear energy providing 22 percent of our Nation's electrical \npower, it is simply irresponsible for the Administration to continue to \navoid all attempts at improving our handling of spent nuclear fuel. We \nmust maintain nuclear energy as a viable energy option for our nation, \nand without concrete progress on nuclear waste, we will lose this part \nof our national energy supply.\n  American consumers are still facing dramatically higher prices for \ngas and oil, driven in no small part by the failure of this \nAdministration to develop a coherent energy policy. We can't afford to \nplace 22 percent of our electrical supply in jeopardy, and then pretend \nto be surprised when energy prices skyrocket.\n  These recent oil shocks have proven again the folly of over \ndependence on a single source of energy. They should have reinforced to \nthe Administration that we need, more than ever before, a coherent \nenergy policy that maintains a diverse energy supply portfolio. Nuclear \nenergy is an important component of that portfolio.\n  As I've noted in the last few months, our response to this latest oil \nprice episode was to approach the OPEC countries, tin barrel in hand, \nasking them to increase the flow of oil and lower our prices. That only \nserves to make us more dependent on their oil and increase the impact \nof the next episode of restricted oil availability.\n  Senator Murkowski incorporated a very large range of concessions into \nthe current bill, concessions that met every one of the \nAdministration's advertised concerns. Unfortunately, as\n\n[[Page S3217]]\n\nwe've seen before, this Administration is so determined to undercut the \nrole of nuclear energy, that new objections were invented faster than \nconcessions were granted.\n  I find it interesting that the Administration is treating the two \nmajor electrical producers in the nation, coal and nuclear, in somewhat \nsimilar ways. These two sources together account for over 70 percent of \nour electricity. Yet in both cases, the Administration is not focusing \nresources on actions that would address remaining concerns with these \ntwo sources. Our dependence on foreign oil would be far more serious \nwith loss of either of these energy sources.\n  For coal, they should be increasing resources on clean coal \ntechnologies. For nuclear, they should be advancing timetables for \naddressing spent nuclear fuel. Neither is happening.\n  I believe that consumer concerns relating to nuclear energy are \nchanging, as more information about the successes of this energy source \nbecomes better known. Just yesterday, I checked on an MSNBC Internet \npoll on the 20 year anniversary of the Three Mile Island nuclear \naccident.\n  In that poll, 80 percent of over 18,000 people responding said that \nthey believe nuclear energy is safe, with 85 percent favoring licensing \nof new plants.\n  I find it amazing how fear of anything in this country with \n``nuclear'' in its title, like ``nuclear waste,'' seems to paralyze our \nability to act decisively. Nuclear issues are immediately faced with \nimmense political challenges.\n  There are many great examples of how nuclear technologies impact \nour daily lives. Yet few of our citizens know enough about the benefits \nwe've gained from harnessing the nucleus to support actions focused on \nreducing the remaining risks.\n\n  Just one example that should be better understood and appreciated \ninvolves our nuclear navy. Their experience has important lessons for \nbetter understanding of these technologies.\n  The Nautilus, our first nuclear powered submarine, was launched in \n1954. Since then, the Navy has launched over 200 nuclear powered ships, \nand about 85 are currently in operation. Recently, the Navy was \noperating slightly over 100 reactors, about the same number as those \noperating in civilian power stations across the country.\n  The Navy's safety record is exemplary. Our nuclear ships are welcomed \ninto over 150 ports in over 50 countries. A 1999 review of their safety \nrecord was conducted by the General Accounting Office. That report \nstated:\n\n       No significant accident--one resulting in fuel \n     degradation--has ever occurred.\n\n  For an Office like GAO, that identifies and publicizes problems with \ngovernment programs, that's a pretty impressive statement.\n  Our nuclear powered ships have traveled over 117 million miles \nwithout serious incidents. Further, the Navy commissioned 33 new \nreactors in the 1990s, that puts them ahead of civilian power by a \nscore of 33 to zero. And Navy reactors have more than twice the \noperational hours of our civilian systems.\n  The nuclear Navy story is a great American success story, one that is \ncompletely enabled by appropriate and careful use of nuclear power. Its \ncontributed to the freedoms we so cherish.\n  Nuclear energy is another great American success story, it is not a \nsupply that we can afford to lose. It's a clean source of power, \nwithout release of greenhouse gases, with a superlative safety record \nover the last decade. The efficiency of nuclear plants has risen \nconsistently and their operating costs are among the lowest of all \nenergy sources.\n  I've repeatedly emphasized that the United States must maintain \nnuclear energy as a viable option for future energy requirements. And \nwithout some near-term waste solution, like interim storage or an early \nreceipt facility, we are killing this option. We may be depriving \nfuture generations of a reliable power source that they may desperately \nneed.\n  There is no excuse for the years that the issue of nuclear waste has \nbeen with us. Near-term credible solutions are not technically \ndifficult. We absolutely must progress towards early receipt of spent \nfuel at a central location, at least faster than the 2010 estimates for \nopening Yucca Mountain that we now face or risk losing nuclear power in \nthis country.\n  Senator Murkowski's bill is a significant step toward breaking the \ndeadlock which continues to threaten the future of nuclear energy in \nthe U.S. I appreciate that he made some very tough decisions in \ncrafting this bill that blends ideas from many sources to seek \ncompromise in this difficult area.\n  One concession involves tying the issuance of a license for the \n``early receipt facility'' to construction authorization for the \npermanent repository. I'd much prefer that we simply moved ahead with \ninterim storage. An interim storage facility can proceed on its own \nmerits, quite independent of decisions surrounding a permanent \nrepository. Such an interim storage facility could be operational well \nbefore the ``early receipt facility'' authorized in this act.\n  There are absolutely no technical issues associated with interim \nstorage in dry casks, other countries certainly use it. Nevertheless, \nin the interests of seeking a compromise on this issue, I supported \nthis act's approach with the early receipt facility.\n  I appreciate that Senator Murkowski included Title III in the new \nbill with my proposal to create a new DOE Office of Spent Nuclear Fuel \nResearch. This new Office would organize a research program to explore \nnew, improved national strategies for spent nuclear fuel.\n  Spent fuel has immense energy potential--that we are simply tossing \naway with our focus only on a permanent repository. We could be \nrecycling that spent fuel back into civilian fuel and extracting \nadditional energy. We could follow the examples of France, the U.K., \nand Japan in reprocessing the fuel to not only extract more energy, but \nalso to reduce the volume and toxicity of the final waste forms.\n  Now I'm well aware that reprocessing is not viewed as economically \ndesirable now, because of today's very low uranium prices. Furthermore, \nit must only be done with careful attention to proliferation issues. \nBut I submit that the U.S. should be prepared for a future evaluation \nthat may determine that we are too hasty today to treat this spent fuel \nas waste, and that instead we should have been viewing it as an energy \nresource for future generations.\n  We do not have the knowledge today to make that decision. Title III \nestablishes a research program to evaluate options to provide real data \nfor such a future decision.\n  This research program would have other benefits. We may want to \nreduce the toxicity of materials in any repository to address public \nconcerns. Or we may find we need another repository in the future, and \nwant to incorporate advanced technologies into the final waste products \nat that time. We could, for example, decide that we want to maximize \nthe storage potential of a future repository, and that would require \nsome treatment of the spent fuel before final disposition.\n  Title III requires that a range of advanced approaches for spent fuel \nbe studied with the new Office of Spent Nuclear Fuel Research. As we do \nthis, I'll encourage the Department to seek international cooperation. \nI know, based on personal contacts, that France, Russia, and Japan are \neager to join with us in an international study of spent fuel options.\n  Title III requires that we focus on research programs that minimize \nproliferation and health risks from the spent fuel. And it requires \nthat we study the economic implications of each technology.\n  With Title III, the United States will be prepared, some years in the \nfuture, to make the most intelligent decision regarding the future of \nnuclear energy as one of our major power sources. Maybe at that time, \nwe'll have other better energy alternatives and decide that we can move \naway from nuclear power. Or we may find that we need nuclear energy to \ncontinue and even expand its current contribution to our nation's power \ngrid. In any case, this research will provide the framework to guide \nCongress in these future decisions.\n  Mr. President, I want to specifically discuss one of the compromises \nthat Senator Murkowski developed. In my view, his largest compromise \ninvolves the choice between the Environmental Protection Agency or the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission to set the radiation-protection standards \nfor Yucca\n\n[[Page S3218]]\n\nMountain and for the ``early release facility.''\n  The NRC has the technical expertise to set these standards. \nFurthermore, the NRC is a non-political organization, in sharp contrast \nto the political nature of the EPA. We need unbiased technical \nknowledge in setting these standards, there should be no place for \npolitics at all. The EPA has proposed a draft standard already, that \nhas been widely criticized for its inconsistency and lack of scientific \nrigor--events that do not enhance their credibility for this role.\n  I appreciate, however, the care that Senator Murkowski has \ndemonstrated in providing the ultimate authority to the EPA. His new \nlanguage requires both the NRC and the National Academy of Sciences to \ncomment on the EPA's draft standard. And he provides a period of time, \nuntil mid-2001, for the EPA to assess concerns with their standard and \nissue a valid standard.\n  These additions have the effect of providing a strong role for both \nthe NRC and NAS to share their scientific knowledge with the EPA and \nhelp guide the EPA toward a credible standard.\n  Mr. President, I want to again thank Senator Murkowski for his \nleadership in preparing this bill and in leading this over ride \ndiscussion. We need to overturn the President's veto, to ensure that we \nfinally attain some movement in the nation's ability to deal with high \nlevel nuclear waste.\n  Mr. President, I won't respond to the millirem argument with \nreference to New Mexico and WIPP. Frankly, I believe it is irrelevant. \nNonetheless, I wish to talk about nuclear energy power and what is \nhappening to the United States of America. I say to the Senators from \nNevada, I compliment them. They have been able, for a number of years, \nto delay the United States of America from having an underground \npermanent repository, and today, once again, they are successful. I \nunderstand they are acting in what they think is the best interest of \ntheir State. They are, once again, going to preclude the United States \nfrom coming up with an interim storage facility for nuclear waste.\n  Whatever the arguments have been, there is no science or engineering \nissue with reference to whether or not the United States of America can \nbuild, plan, and safely maintain an interim storage facility for high-\nlevel nuclear waste. Let me repeat. Nobody can, with any credibility, \ncome to the floor of the Senate and say we cannot do that. In fact, we \nare doing so many things with reference to nuclear energy, with \nreference to radiation, that are more difficult than building an \ninterim storage facility, a temporary storage facility for high-level \nwaste for 25 or 50 years. In fact, the idea that we must find a \npermanent repository, one that will last for 20,000 or 30,000 years, \nfor the fuel rods that come out of nuclear power reactors before we can \nproceed to take care of it for 50 or 100 years, borders on lunacy. It \nborders on standing reality on its head. The only possible reason could \nbe that we don't believe we will build a permanent one if we build \ninterim ones. But the truth is that it is not difficult; it is very \nsafe once you have established it, and the only possible argument could \nbe transportation.\n  We should have a debate on the floor of the Senate on whether it is \ndangerous for the American people to transport nuclear waste from fuel \nsites across the United States--and every Senator knows where they are \nin their States--to interim facilities that we don't have today. We \ntold the American people that the waste would move from their states. \nNobody should conclude that it is unsafe to move it across the United \nStates. We are moving more, and risking more dangerous things on a \nregular basis, across the highways of the United States, with utter and \ntotal safety, than would be involved in this.\n  What is the issue? It seems to me that any time you are involved with \nradiation and anything nuclear, those who oppose it rely upon scaring \nthe American people or their constituents, when the truth is that the \nUnited States of America gets 22 percent of its electricity from \nnuclear powerplants. Let me suggest that anybody who wants to test out \nwhat I am going to say have at it. That 22 percent of electricity \nproduced in nuclear powerplants is the safest electricity produced in \nAmerica. If you want to talk about risk of lives, injuries, health \nconditions, anything you would like, those are the safest sites \nproducing electricity for the engine of American industry and for \nAmericans living every day with computers built upon energy sources and \nelectricity, and the like.\n  I laud Senator Murkowski for his compromise legislation. Actually, I \nthought he might have even given away too much at one point, but \nlooking at how things are going, he can't even get this passed. He has \nconceded a number of issues since this was originally proposed.\n  What do we do? We continue our dependence upon oil, and now natural \ngas, for our electricity in the future. This administration, by vetoing \nthis bill and other actions, does the following things: One, they don't \nspend money on coal technology that will clean that technology up. Two, \nthey don't spend money on finding an interim facility for nuclear \nwaste. And then, three, we go begging those in Saudi Arabia and in \nCentral and South America to continue to provide us with reasonably \npriced oil because we have become hostage to their oil.\n  Here we are, as a nation, worrying about oil supplies while the \nDemocrats on that side get up and say this is not an issue; that the \nissues are Medicaid, Medicare, or Social Security. Well, the issue \nabout 7 weeks ago was skyrocketing oil prices, which caused \nskyrocketing gasoline prices. What if we cannot produce electricity as \nwe need it in America? Think what would happen to America.\n  Think what would happen in the United States if, in fact, we decided, \nas a nation, that we were not going to do anything with nuclear power, \nit is too dangerous, too scary, and we decided to shut it down. The \nUnited States would become a basket case soon.\n\n  When the Democrats get up in rhythm with each of them, saying this is \nnot an important issue, my friends, this is a big issue. This is one of \nthe most important issues to America's future because it has been made \nthe linchpin about which we discuss the future of improved nuclear \npower in the United States of America.\n  I've become a strong advocate for nuclear power. I speak to it \nwherever I can. People listen. I think people believe we ought to \ncontinue with it. But we can't continue with it unless we decide what \nto do with the waste.\n  Recently, my spirits were lifted a bit by a poll on MSNBC Internet. I \nknow it is not scientific poll, but it is pretty interesting. It's \nbeing conducted on the 20th anniversary of Three Mile Island. People \nstill hearken back to that event and say, ``Look at what happened with \nnuclear power.'' Well, actually nothing happened. There was a leak. \nNobody got hurt, and nothing happened.\n  Over 18,000 people responded on that MSNBC Internet poll, and 80 \npercent believe nuclear energy is safe. Eighty-five percent favor \nlicensing power plants in the future for nuclear power.\n  Right now, today, the U.S. Navy has slightly over 100 nuclear \nreactors with partially spent fuel rods in the power plant. Those 100 \nnuclear power plants are sailing the oceans and the seas of the world \nin the hulls of submarines, battleships, and aircraft carriers. Some \nhave two power plants in them--two complete nuclear reactors with the \nfuel rods that we are down here talking about and we don't know what to \ndo with. They are on ships. Those ships are welcomed in almost every \nseaport in the world, except New Zealand because it had some argument \nabout it years ago.\n  Imagine, all the big ports in America welcoming U.S. Navy ships into \ntheir waters and their harbors. What do they have in them? Nuclear \npower plants with their fuel rods. Why do they let them in? Why don't \nthey say that is terrible, as we are saying here on the floor, and \npeople are going to get hurt? Because they have been audited, and \nreaudited.\n  The General Accounting Office has looked at it and concluded, like no \nother study, that U.S. Navy ships are totally safe, never having had an \naccident since the Nautilus was launched in 1954.\n  We are here today arguing about whether we can safely take spent fuel \nrods--not in a pond of water where, if something happens, it goes \neverywhere. But we are talking about whether we\n\n[[Page S3219]]\n\ncan haul it down the road or highway and take it somewhere. It is on \nall the oceans of the world, and nobody is even talking about it.\n  Then we are arguing about, once you get it there, it is just too \nscary to think of storing it there.\n  France has about 80 percent of its energy in nuclear. They get the \nbenefits of what I am bringing to the surface now--there is no air \npollution to speak of in France because nuclear power does not create \nthe air pollution we are worried about with reference to global \nwarming.\n  The United States of America runs around the world negotiating how to \nclean our air so we will not have global warming. And here we're \ntalking about the principal source of electricity that would be totally \nclean. We scare our people to death about moving fuel rods down a \nhighway when the oceans and seas of the world have nuclear power plants \nfloating under water and on top of the water by virtue of 100 U.S. Navy \nships at sea.\n  Actually, France, which I just described, does not today have a \npermanent repository.\n  You heard the argument, fellow Senators, and those listening, that we \ndon't want to have interim storage until we have a permanent repository \nfor certain.\n  I think France is pretty concerned about the health and safety of \ntheir constituents, the French people. They aren't building underground \nrepositories yet because they are very satisfied with having interim, \ntemporary storage. Sooner perhaps than later, they will find a way to \nuse that spent fuel, which is highly radiated, either to produce more \nenergy, or they will break it into its components and make sure they \ncan safely put it somewhere.\n\n  There is no question in this Senator's mind, that this is a big \nissue. This is America trying to turn science, engineering, and safety \non its head to try to make fear where there is no reality of fear, to \ntry to conclude that this great Nation cannot take care of the nuclear \nwaste coming out of our powerplants with the end product being no more \nnuclear power.\n  What a shame, if that happened in the Nation that started it, that \nled it, that built the safest reactors in the world--safer than 20 or \n30 coal-burning, electricity-generating plants, or any kind of plant.\n  What if we as a matter of fact kill nuclear power while the rest of \nthe world proceeds to use it in China, Japan, Europe? We're doing that \nby not finding a way to do the easiest part of the fuel cycle, which is \nto temporarily put spent fuel somewhere in a repository of interim \nmeasure?\n  It would appear to me that, innocently or intentionally, those who \noppose it are failing to recognize the significance of the future of \nnuclear energy and nuclear power for America and for a world that wants \nto be clean and wants to have growth and prosperity without global \nwarming.\n  From my standpoint, not only do I refute the argument that this is \nnot important, that there are other issues more important.\n  I want to say that the President is making a very big mistake for \nAmerica's future by vetoing this compromise bill. The Congress passed \nit in both bodies overwhelmingly. Now, because of his veto ban, we need \n66 votes in the Senate. That is probably too hard to do for an issue \nsuch as this. But sooner or later, a President will sign a bill. I am \nhoping it is sooner.\n  Obviously, we shouldn't try it again with the current President \nbecause it won't fly. But I personally believe the day will come soon \nwhen we will have the repository, wherever it is, and we will not come \nto the floor of the Senate and hearken back to the numerous times we \nhave denied the validity and credibility of the fact that it can be \neasily and safely transported and easily and safely put in 30- to 50-\nyear interim repositories.\n  I yield the floor. I thank the Senate for listening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous agreement, the Senator from \nWest Virginia is recognized for up to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER.

Mr. President, this past Sunday, April 30, was the \n25th anniversary of the end of the Vietnam war. And that reaches deep \ninto the soul of every Member of this body, all across America, and all \nacross the world.\n  Our involvement with Vietnam was filled with discord, it was filled \nwith anxiety, and it tore sections and generations of our country \napart. It began slowly. It gradually escalated and became ``a \nbottomless quagmire'' for America, ``our longest, costliest, and . . . \nleast popular war,'' until it finally came to an end.\n  Many in our country were very ambivalent about this war. Some thought \nwe didn't fight hard enough, some thought we turned our backs on the \nSouth Vietnamese, and some thought we should have fought a lot \nharder. Many became disillusioned with our Government. I think that \nexperience changed the nature of American politics and public life for \nat least some time to come.\n\n  However, there should be no ambivalence whatsoever about those who \nfought that war. Today I want to pay homage to those who fought that \nwar. It doesn't matter whether you were for or against the war. All who \nserved there deserve our appreciation, our respect, our caring, our \ncompassion. It would have been easier to fight in a popular war. There \nare such wars, oddly enough. It is obtuse to say that, but it is true.\n  But it took guts, courage, and endurance to fight in that war and \nsurvive it; to resist the erosion of the bad morale which overtook at \nleast part of our ground forces in Vietnam. And then, of course, there \nwas the lack of united support from the home front which had to have \njust overwhelming consequences, not only while the soldiers were there, \nbut even more so when they returned.\n  Those who served did their duty, and they did it under very \ndifficult, trying circumstances. Their motto might very well have been \nwhat Alexander Pope said:\n\n       Act well your part, therein all honor lies.\n\n  Looking back at this war, like the war before it and others, what \nstrikes me with enormous poignancy and tenderness, is how young our \nsoldiers were. Many were teenagers--18- and 19-year-old men and women--\nfrom familiar and comfortable surroundings, leading lives we all might \nidentify with, sent to a completely foreign country, a foreign culture, \nhalfway around the world, not knowing what to expect. They encountered \nbaking heat, torrential rain, fire ants, leeches, and the enemy. They \ncould not imagine the world of horror that awaited them when they got \nthere. Presumably they were trained and told about it, but I think it \nwas unimaginable to them when they got there. There was no clear enemy \nline. They could be ambushed at any minute. They couldn't tell enemies \nfrom allies.\n  Some never came back. The more than 58,000 names on the Vietnam \nMemorial Wall attest to that. But painful as it is to view those names, \nit does not begin to encompass the scope of pain caused by that war. \nLike a pebble thrown in a pool, each single name on the wall is ringed \nby concentric circles of others touched by that person's death--widows, \nmothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, aunts, uncles, friends. For all in \nthat pool, certain hopes and dreams died as well. We grieve for all of \nthem.\n  Some came back wounded. In an instant, life could change. Soldiers \ncould step on a landmine; they could be killed by friendly fire; they \ncould come under random attack. They never knew from moment to moment. \nDue to the wonders of modern medicine, many of those who, in earlier \nwars, would have died, did not and were saved; they survived. But \nmerely surviving posed tremendous burdens on those who did. The process \nof adapting, accepting, and moving on is easy to say, very hard to do.\n  So I salute the stubborn resilience and perseverance of those who did \nmove on with life after recovering from injury.\n  Some came back suffering from emotional trauma--people call it PTSD--\nand many other things. For them, it has been a very hard road to make \npeace with the past. They are still haunted by it, fighting it in their \nnightmares, in startle reflexes to sudden noises which bring back \nmemories of perceived danger. They may turn to\n\n[[Page S3220]]\n\nalcohol to numb the constant pain, to drown the memories.\n  Veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder deserve our \nmost profound compassion, love and caring. As we have discovered, PTSD \nin fact goes back even to World War I. We are discovering a lot of \nthings about the consequences of war. We have no way of knowing what \npeople have been through, those of us who were not there. But we cannot \njudge their continuing pain. We cannot judge them. But we can honor \nthem, and we need to do that, to respect them for what they have done, \nand to hope they will recover as others did.\n  As a Senator from West Virginia, I have more than a personal interest \nin this war. Statistics show that West Virginia's soldiers suffered \nmore casualties per capita during that war than any other State in the \nUnion. On this day, I salute our West Virginia veterans in particular. \nI am enormously proud of the sons and daughters of West Virginia, who, \nas they have done throughout history, volunteered or were drafted, and \nwent to fight and to protect their country and their freedom, mountain \nmen doing what needed to be done.\n  That fighting spirit and strength of character runs incredibly deep \nin this Senator's State, and this Senator is very proud of it.\n  Lyndon Johnson called the war ``dirty, brutal and difficult.'' It \ntore apart our country, devastated lives, caused tremendous personal \nhardship and unbearable pain. Twenty years later, the scars are still \nhealing.\n  I am reminded of the words of Maya Lin, the young architect student \nwho designed the Vietnam Memorial. In conceptualizing the form of her \ndesign, she wrote:\n\n       I thought about what death is, what a loss is. A sharp pain \n     that lessens with time, but never quite heals over. The idea \n     occurred to me there on the site. Take a knife and cut open \n     the earth, and with time, the grass would heal it.\n\n  With time, the wounds of Vietnam will heal. But we should never \nforget the courage and bravery of those who served there. Let us always \nhonor our men and women who fought and died in Vietnam.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Rockefeller pertaining to the introduction of S. \n2494 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to take just a few minutes today to \nspeak about the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act and the President's \nrecent veto of this legislation.\n  Throughout the past 5 years, I have repeatedly come to the Senate \nfloor to discuss this important issue and its impact on my home State \nof Minnesota. I have, on countless occasions, laid out for Members of \nthe Senate the history of the nuclear energy program and the promises \nmade by the Federal Government. Every time I sit down to discuss this \nmatter with stakeholders, I am reminded that the Federal Government not \nonly allowed, but strongly encouraged, the construction of nuclear \npower plants across the country.\n  This point needs to be clearly understood by the Members of this \nbody. Our Nation's nuclear utilities did not go out and invest in \nnuclear power in spite of Federal Government warnings of future \ndifficulties. Instead, they were encouraged by the Federal Government \nto turn to nuclear power to meet increasing energy demands. Utilities \nand states were told to move forward with investments in nuclear \ntechnologies because it is a sound source of energy production.\n  It is important to note that the Federal Government's support for \nnuclear power was based on some very sound considerations. First, and I \nbelieve most important, nuclear power is environmentally friendly. \nNothing is burned in a nuclear reactor so there are no emissions \nreleased into the atmosphere. In fact, nuclear energy is responsible \nfor over 90% of the reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that have \ncome out of the energy industry since 1973. Between 1973 and 1996, \nnuclear power accounted for emissions reductions of 34.6 million tons \nof nitrogen oxide and 80.2 million tons of sulfur dioxide.\n  Second, nuclear power is a reliable base-load source of power. \nFamilies, farmers, businesses, and individuals who are served by \nnuclear power are served by one of the most reliable sources of \nelectricity. In Minnesota, nuclear power accounts for roughly 30% of \nour base-load generation.\n  Third, nuclear energy is a home-grown technology and the United \nStates led the way in its development. We have long been the world \nleader in nuclear technology and continue to be the world's largest \nnuclear producing country. Using nuclear power increases our energy \nsecurity.\n  Finally, much of the world recognizes those same values and promotes \nthe use of nuclear power because of its reliability, its environmental \nbenefits, and its value to energy independence.\n  Because of those reasons, the Federal Government threw one more bone \nto our Nation's utilities. It said if you build nuclear power, we will \ntake care of your nuclear waste. We will build a repository and take it \nout of your States. In response to those promises, over 30 States took \nthe Federal Government at its word and allowed civilian nuclear energy \nproduction to move forward.\n\n  Ratepayers agreed to share some of the responsibilities, but were \npromised some things in return. They agreed to pay a fee attached to \ntheir energy bill to pay for the proper handling of the spent nuclear \nfuel in exchange for an assurance that the Federal Government meet its \nresponsibility to manage any waste storage challenges. Because of these \npromises and measures taken by the Federal Government, ratepayers have \nnow paid over $15 billion, including interest, into the Nuclear Waste \nFund. Today, these payments continue, exceeding $600 million annually, \nor $70,000 for every hour of every day of the year. In Minnesota alone, \nratepayers have paid over $300 million into the Nuclear Waste Fund.\n  In summary, the Federal Government promoted nuclear power, utilities \nagreed to invest in nuclear power, states agreed to host nuclear power \nplants, and ratepayers assumed the responsibility of investing in the \nlong-term storage of nuclear waste. And still, nuclear waste is \nstranded on the banks of the Mississippi River in Minnesota and on \ncountless other sites across the country because the Department of \nEnergy has a very short-term memory and this administration has \nvirtually no sense of responsibility.\n  We can argue all day long in this Chamber on the merits of nuclear \npower. But we cannot deny that the Federal Government promoted nuclear \npower and promised to take care of nuclear waste.\n  The Clinton administration, however, would have you believe that they \ndo not have a responsibility to deal with nuclear power. I have been \nworking with Senator Murkowski and many other Members over the roughly \n5 years that I have been in the Senate to establish an interim \nrepository for nuclear waste and move forward with the development of a \npermanent repository. We have brought a bill to the floor that \naccomplishes those objectives in each of the past two Congresses. Each \ntime, we passed the bill in both the House and the Senate with \noverwhelming, bipartisan support. Just over 2 years ago, we passed a \nbill that would have removed nuclear waste from States by a vote of 65-\n34 and the House passed the bill with 307 supporters--a veto-proof \nmajority. We have had extensive debate with the opportunity for anyone \nto offer amendments. We have thoroughly addressed most issues related \nto nuclear waste storage, including the transportation of waste across \nthe United States. Yet every time we have passed a bill that fulfills \nthe Federal Government's commitments, President Clinton has issued his \nveto threat and stopped our efforts in their tracks.\n  Here we are again. The President has vetoed the legislation before us \ntoday and apparently taken great pride in doing so. Time and again, \nwhen confronted with making the tough decisions about the future of our \nNation's energy supply, this President has ``punted,'' and refused to \ntake any responsibility for the energy needs of our growing economy.\n\n[[Page S3221]]\n\n  If it were not such a serious matter, I would have to say that the \nPresident's approach to energy policy is comical. When was the last \ntime anyone here heard the President speak in any great detail about \nenergy issues? He does not. I do not think he cares or at least his \npolicies reflect a great degree of indifference to the energy needs of \nour Nation's consumers.\n  He has turned over the reins of the Energy Department not just to \nSecretary Richardson, but to Al Gore, and Bruce Babbitt, and Carol \nBrowner, and anyone else who has an agenda with an aspect of the energy \nindustry.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I have been a strong critic of the \nDepartment of Energy since coming to Congress in 1992. I have long \nargued that the Department has failed miserably on its most basic \nmission of increasing our Nation's energy independence. The Department \nwas created in the late 1970's in response to that decade's energy \ncrisis. Since that time, our reliance on foreign oil has increased from \n35% to almost 60% today. In the 1970s, we were looking to increase our \nuse of nuclear energy, today we are looking at closing down plants \nbefore their licenses have expired. In the 1970s, much like today, \nhydro power was a very popular form of electricity generation among the \nAmerican public. Even still, this Administration wants to rip apart \nhydro dams in the Northwest and, I guess, replace them with fossil \nfuels.\n  Therein lies the great irony of the Clinton administration's approach \nto energy and the environment. This administration had the vision to \nagree to legally binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions while \nat the same time failing to take even the most basic steps to protect \nemissions free nuclear power plants from shutting down. I asked the \nadministration's chief Kyoto negotiator, Stuart Eizenstat, about \nnuclear energy during a Foreign Relations Committee hearing and he said \nthat we absolutely needed nuclear energy to meet the demands of the \nTreaty. In fact, he said that he believed his own administration ought \nto have done more and ought to be doing more to promote nuclear power. \nMr. Eizenstat, the President's signature on this bill would have been a \ngreat first step. Instead, this President has taken an action which I \nargue is harmful to the environment and contradicts his statements and \nactions that he wants to improve air quality in our country.\n  Nuclear energy, however, is not the only example of this \nadministration's hypocrisy on energy and the environment. Hydro power, \nas well, is an emissions free form of electricity generation. Yet this \nadministration is engaged in at least two separate activities that \nundermine the future of hydro power and its environmental benefits. As \nI mentioned earlier, this administration wants to rip open hydro dams \nin the northwest and, I guess, replace that electricity with fossil \nfuels. Second, this administration, in its electricity restructuring \nproposals, wants to require a certain usage of renewable energy but \nrefuses to include hydro power as a renewable energy source. These are \nall perfect examples of how this administration isn't truly interested \nin results oriented clean air goals. Instead, they want to deeply \ninvolve themselves in the process of achieving environmental goals, \nregulate like crazy, and predetermine winners and losers. \nUnfortunately, the only real losers in the Clinton energy circus are \nthe American consumers.\n  I want to touch on one last Clinton administration energy and \nenvironment contradiction. As my colleagues know, this administration \nhas been opposed to new oil and gas development on public land. In \nfact, Vice President Gore recently stated that he would do everything \nin his power to stop offshore oil and gas leasing. Both President \nClinton and Vice President Gore tout these stances against oil and gas \ndevelopment as part of their legacy of environmental protection. I ask \nmy colleagues, do you think other nations on whom we rely for our oil \nsupplies are employing the environmental protections and reviews that \nwe require? Do you think Iran, Libya, or Iraq are going the extra mile \nto protect the environment? Do you think the OPEC nations are holding \nthemselves to the stringent environmental standards to which we hold \ncompanies on U.S. soil? We all know the answer is an emphatic no. Yet \nthis administration is opposing virtually any exploration of oil and \ngas reserves on public land for environmental reasons, while at the \nsame time, it employs its ``tin cup diplomacy'' that relies upon \ncountries like Iran, Iraq, Libya and others to increase their \nproduction for us. I ask my colleagues, if you look at the global \nimpacts of the Clinton administration's actions, who are the real \nenvironmentalists? Certainly not the Clinton administration. It is \nclear to me that this administration's policy against exploration and \ndevelopment, when compared against its policy of begging for increased \noil production abroad, is a net loss for American jobs, family \ncheckbooks, domestic energy security, and the environment.\n\n  I am getting a little off track, but I believe this point needs to be \nclearly understood when we are talking about a long- term plan to \nremove, transport, and store nuclear waste. This administration is not \nconcerned about results, nor is it really concerned about the \nenvironment. Instead, this administration is concerned solely with its \npolitical agenda and keeping the nuclear industry on the ropes.\n  We can, as a nation, move forward now and deal with our nuclear \nwaste. There is simply no scientific nor technological reasons why we \ncannot move waste from civilian reactors to a central repository. In \nfact, we ship waste across our Nation right now--including the waste we \nhave accepted from 41 other nations under the Atoms for Peace program. \nOur Nation's fleet of nuclear powered vessels go from international \nport to port. They protect the world and our Nation's interests in a \nway that is only allowed them through the use of nuclear power. There \nis overwhelming proof that we can transport nuclear waste on ships, \nroads, and rail without a threat to either the environment or human \nbeings.\n  I am going to support the legislation before us, and I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same. If the President is not going to have an \nenergy policy, then we in Congress had better step forward and forge \none of our own. When the brownouts begin increasing in frequency and \nenergy rates rise, President Clinton will be long gone and we will be \nleft to explain to our constituents why their family lost its power, \ntheir business lost a days work, or their farm was unable to milk its \ncows.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank Senator Grams for his \nstatement, particularly for highlighting the risk we face in not \nacting, inasmuch as some of our plants that anticipated having Yucca \nMountain available for permanent storage, indeed, are in danger.\n  Maryland, for example, has two reactors at Calvert Cliffs producing \nover 13,000 kilowatts a year. They provide 26 percent of the clean \nelectricity for the State of Maryland. The consumers in Maryland have \npaid $337 million into the nuclear waste fund since 1982. There are 741 \nmetric tons stored there, and it is short term. It is temporary \nbecause, when they built that plant, they were looking at Yucca \nMountain as a permanent storage. Indeed, there is genuine concern about \nthe ability to maintain this very clean source of energy if, indeed, we \ndo not act in this body and override the President's veto.\n  Before we break, I wish to take my colleagues through a brief summary \nof the inconsistencies of this administration with regard to \ntransportation.\n  In 1996, the Clinton administration agreed to participate in the \nForeign Research Reactor Program where, over a 13-year period, some 20 \ntons of spent nuclear fuel from 41 countries will be shipped to the \nUnited States for storage. It goes into Concord, CA, and up to Idaho on \nrailroads and highways. It goes into Savannah River and is moved there \nthrough the rail system, as well as highways.\n  At the Savannah River site in South Carolina, as well as the Idaho \nNational Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, this waste is moved, \ndepending on whether it comes from the west coast or east coast--\nshipment comes in on freighters through the Charleston Naval Weapons \nStation in South Carolina and the Concord Naval Weapons Station in \nCalifornia--the spent fuel is transported from the ship to a final \ndesignation by either rail or truck.\n\n[[Page S3222]]\n\n Shall we leave it in California? Shall we leave it in South Carolina?\n  The President mentions the importance of nonproliferation goals that \na central repository will meet and that the nonproliferation for these \nshipments of foreign spent fuel is a good one. We do not want \nterrorists or rogue governments coming into possession of these \nweapons, but let's look at reality.\n  For example, when the program started in 1996, we were faced with \ntransporting spent fuel from a reactor in Bogota, Colombia. The spent \nfuel was moved from the reactor, loaded into a shipping cask, placed \ninto a semitractor trailer truck for shipment, and then what did we do? \nWe went to the Russians.\n  We chartered a Russian Antonov AN-124 airplane large enough to carry \ntanks and helicopters and drove the semi aboard the plane and flew the \nshipment to the seaport city of Cartagena and placed it on a freighter. \nIt then joined spent fuel already loaded from Chile. It was delivered \nto the Charleston weapons center where it was loaded on railcars to \nSavannah River.\n  This was the Department of Energy acting to pull out all stops, \nsparing no expense to complete this important shipment. Administration \npolicy then is to take nuclear fuel from foreign nations flying, \nshipping, and trucking all over the world and storing it at military \nfacilities, and even building interim storage sites in the United \nStates, but this administration will not address the waste generated by \nthe domestic nuclear power industry; it will not reconcile a policy to \naddress this in a responsible manner. It would rather leave it at the \n40 States in 80 sites. That is what this administration proposes to do. \nIt is unconscionable at a time when we are looking to the nuclear \nenergy for roughly 20 percent of the power generated in the United \nStates, and this administration does not accept its responsibility. \nThat is why I urge all my colleagues to look at this realistically: Do \nwe want the waste concentrated where it is in temporary storage, or do \nwe want it in a permanent repository where we have already expended \nsome $7 billion to place it?\n  I believe my time has expired or is about to expire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a minute and a half left.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. In a minute and a half, I note the Senator from \nCalifornia showed a beautiful picture of Death Valley. I will show you \na beautiful picture of the proposed location of the repository out at \nYucca Mountain.\n  This is it. It is not very pretty. We have had 800 nuclear weapons \ntests in the last 50 years. That is the area we are talking about.\n  Some suggest, why are we talking about this when we have other more \nimportant things to do? This is an obligation of this Congress. The \nHouse has acted. It is up to the Senate to act now and move this \nlegislation over the President's veto.\n  This is important. This costs the taxpayers money. We have an \nobligation. Furthermore, this is the pending business of the Senate at \nthis time because the House voted. It went down to the President. The \nPresident vetoed it. It is the standing order of business before this \nbody. So it is most appropriate that we resolve this matter today.\n  I encourage my colleagues this afternoon to vote to override the \nPresident's veto.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. In my 12 years in the Senate, I have to say this is the \nmost unfocused debate we have had on this issue. We are not here today \nto debate whether or not nuclear power is good or bad for the Nation. \nWe are not here today to debate whether interim storage is an \nappropriate response. We are not here to debate whether or not France \nhas no pollution, as some have suggested, because they have nuclear \nreactors. I must say, parenthetically, I am not aware that France \npropels its automotive fleet through nuclear power. But perhaps we can \ndiscuss that at some other date.\n  Very simply, what we are here to talk about is a piece of legislation \nwhich the President of the United States has courageously vetoed that \nwould alter the health and safety standards for the Nation. That is the \nissue. Every American--regardless of his or her politics--should be \nproud of the President's position.\n  Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have taunted our \ncolleagues who support the position that my colleague from Nevada and I \nhave been advocating, as well as the distinguished Senators from \nCalifornia and New Mexico today, saying: What are you going to tell \nyour constituents when you return home? The answer that every Member \ncan give, with a straight face, in responding to that question is: \nLook, I voted to uphold the health and safety standards of the Nation. \nI was not prepared for any industry, even though I might support \nnuclear power, to reduce the health and safety standards for millions \nof people in this country. I will not do it for nuclear power. I will \nnot do it for anything else. I will not be beholding to a special \ninterest. I am voting in the best interests of my constituents and the \nNation in upholding public health and safety.\n  That is the answer. That is the most powerful response that can be \ngiven.\n  May I inquire how much time I have left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twelve seconds.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Twelve seconds.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/02/senate-section/article/S3222-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3222]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the hour of 2:15 \np.m. having arrived, there will now be 30 minutes under the control of \nthe Senators from Nevada, Mr. Reid and Mr. Bryan, and 30 minutes under \nthe control of the Senator from Alaska, Mr. Murkowski.\n  Who seeks time?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I yield 6 minutes to my good friend, \nthe Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I have been around this place a long time \nand a lot of things have happened that I can't quite understand, one of \nthem being the veto of this measure by the President of the United \nStates. If you stop and think, you see that it is purely political. For \nthat reason, I hope this Senate will not hesitate to vote to override \nthe veto of S. 1287, the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2000.\n  The President's decision to veto this vital legislation is just \nfurther evidence that the Clinton administration has no energy policy, \nexcept the appeasement of the doctrinaire environmentalists.\n  Because of the President's purely political veto, the United States \nwill continue to have spent fuel assemblies piling up at all nuclear \ngeneration facilities throughout the United States--including five \nfacilities in North Carolina.\n  The taxpayers of my state alone have paid more than $700 million into \nthe Nuclear Waste Disposal Fund justifiably expecting that the spent \nfuel assemblies would be transported to Yucca Mountain, Nevada, for \npermanent storage.\n  But no, it was not to happen, according to the environmentalists, and \ntherefore according to the President of the United States, who \nimmediately got his pen out and vetoed it.\n  A portion of the monthly electric bill payments of North Carolinians \nand other states goes into this fund, but while the Administration \nplays its political veto game, North Carolina's utility companies have \nbeen forced to construct holding pools or dry cask storage facilities \nto store this used material. This has caused additional expense for the \nutilities and higher prices for their customers.\n  Why did Mr. Clinton veto this legislation? Clearly it was to appease \nthe self-proclaimed environmentalists, who so piously proclaim their \nconcern about the air Americans breathe. We are all concerned about \nthat.\n  Mr. President, it has long been self-evident that these so-called \nself-proclaimed environmentalists are opposed\n\n[[Page S3223]]\n\nto nuclear energy production--which is, behind hydro-power, the \ncleanest source of electricity. Nuclear power generation does not emit \ngreenhouse gasses into the atmosphere.\n  The question is inevitable. Is it not better for the environment that \nno fossil fuels are burned?\n  So while the President plays politics to please the self-proclaimed \nenvironmentalists the spent fuel assemblies continue piling up all over \nthe country in spite of the availability of the Yucca Mountain storage \nsite which--according to the experts-- poses absolutely no \nenvironmental risks for the permanent disposal of the spent fuel \nassemblies.\n  A handful of North Carolina anti-nuclear activists are complaining \nabout the on-site storage of this material. If these activists were \ntruly concerned about the environment, they would support this \nlegislation and urge the federal government to complete construction of \nthe national storage site at Yucca Mountain in one of the most remote \nareas of the United States.\n  I have at hand a copy of a letter sent to President Clinton by the \nExecutive Director of the Public Staff of the North Carolina Utilities \nCommission urging the President to sign S. 1287. I ask unanimous \nconsent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         North Carolina Public Staff Utilities Commission, \n           Raleigh, NC,\n                                                   April 11, 2000.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: As Executive Director of the Public \n     Staff-North Carolina Utilities Commission, I am keenly aware \n     of the need for an effective federal nuclear waste management \n     program, and I strongly encourage you to sign S. 1287 passed \n     earlier in the year by the Senate and House.\n       Nuclear energy accounts for nearly half of the electricity \n     produced in North Carolina. Our state's electricity consumers \n     have paid more than $700 million into the Nuclear Waste Fund. \n     The national repository for nuclear spent fuel, however, is \n     currently not scheduled to open until 2010, twelve years \n     behind the statutory obligation in the Nuclear Waste Policy \n     Act of 1982.\n       The two nuclear plant operators in North Carolina--as well \n     as those around the country--are being forced to undertake \n     costly, alternative measures to compensate for the delays and \n     shortcomings in the federal program.\n       The nuclear waste legislation on the table will be a \n     positive step in the right direction and will provide nuclear \n     plant operators and the communities around their facilities \n     some assurance that the Federal Government will fulfill its \n     obligations in this matter. It is not sound public policy to \n     force nuclear plants to continue indefinitely on-site interim \n     storage of their spent fuel. It is a more responsible course \n     to consolidate the spent fuel in a central facility designed \n     for safe, permanent disposal.\n       I understand you have reservations about S. 1287. The bill \n     may be imperfect, but it represents a sensible and long \n     overdue first step in restoring public confidence in a \n     federal program that is a vital component of our national \n     energy policy.\n       I request your support of S. 1287.\n           Sincererly,\n                                                 Robert P. Gruber.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield myself 12 minutes.\n  This debate is not about nuclear power. It is not about whether you \nare in favor of nuclear power generation or opposed to it. But it is \nabout health and safety concerns in America we should have for nuclear \nwaste and other such issues. It is about health and safety. That is \nwhat S. 1287 is all about--lowering health and safety standards \nrelevant to nuclear waste.\n  My good friend, with whom I have worked for many years on the water \nsubcommittee of Appropriations--I have great respect for the chairman \nof the Budget Committee--came to this floor this morning and spoke in \nfavor of overriding the Presidential veto. My friend, the senior \nSenator from New Mexico, said ``radiation standards are irrelevant.'' \nThat is a quote. I can't imagine anyone saying that, including my good \nfriend from New Mexico, who is someone who should know better--\n``radiation standards are irrelevant.''\n  I guess that is what they said earlier in this century when we had \npatent medicines. They advertised, saying they would cure all kinds of \ndiseases--arthritis, lumbago, and pleurisy--and the medicines wound up \nkilling people. It is the same when they talk about x rays being \nirrelevant. Radiation from x rays is irrelevant, except it kills \npeople. My father-in-law was an x ray technician. He died as a young \nman from cancer of the blood as a result of being exposed to x rays.\n  Radiation standards are relevant. They are as relevant today as they \nwere then. They are as relevant today as they were when we were told 50 \nyears ago that aboveground nuclear tests were OK, that radiation was \nnot relevant. We sent soldiers and others into these nuclear clouds and \nthey died, and some are still sick as a result of that.\n  Radiation is relevant. It is relevant in the transportation of \nnuclear waste. It is relevant in the storage of nuclear waste. That is \nwhat this debate is all about.\n  Of course, this is a challenge. We have 100 sites that are generating \nnuclear power today. They are indicated on this chart. But to say we \nare going to eliminate all 100 sites and wind up with one in Nevada is \nnot true. We will wind up with 100 of them. With the one additional \nnuclear waste site in Nevada, instead of 108 we will have 109. These \nplaces aren't going away. Some are generating nuclear waste. Those that \naren't generating nuclear waste will be nuclear repositories for many \nyears to come.\n  The reason radiation is relevant is we have a nuclear nightmare. I \nhave placed on this chart only the railways where nuclear waste will be \ntransported. I haven't added the highways. This is a nuclear nightmare \nbecause accidents are happening every day, literally.\n  This is from a recent newspaper account in LaGrande, OR. An accident \nhappened because a rail was a little out of line, causing this terrible \naccident. Locomotives are dumped all over. Here are locomotives which \nyou can just barely see. You can see a little bit of yellow down here. \nHere is one dumped in the marsh.\n  We have a farm back here. One of my staff members happens to be here \non the floor today, Kai Anderson. This was his family's farm. This \ntrain derailed where people lived.\n  These accidents happen all the time--3 engines, 29 cars derailed. You \ncan see stuff dumped out all over.\n  Radiation matters. Radiation is not, as my friend said, \n``irrelevant.'' We have a challenge, as we indicated. But this debate \nis not about whether or not you are in favor of nuclear power \ngeneration. This debate is not about Nevada. It is about our country. \nIt is about health and safety standards for our country.\n\n  If this bill is allowed to pass, 43 States will have nuclear waste \npassing through them without appropriate health and safety standards.\n  My friend from North Carolina talked about not understanding why the \nveto took place. I made notes as he spoke. He said it was \n``political.'' If the President were political, he certainly wouldn't \ngo against 40 States, many of them very heavily populated States. He \nwouldn't go against the biggest businesses in those States--utilities. \nHe did it because he believed in the health and safety of the people of \nthis country. He could have gone with where the numbers were. He \ndecided not to do that.\n  The citizens of North Carolina, he said, deserve to know why he is \ndoing it. It is an easy answer why the President did this--because the \npeople of North Carolina deserve health and safety standards just as \neveryone else. They may have some stored nuclear waste there. But they \nneed to have it stored in a safe manner.\n  As I said this morning, if you are wondering what we are going to do \nwith our nuclear waste, it is an easy question to answer. What we are \ngoing to do with our nuclear waste is what they are doing at various \nsites around the country. They are storing it onsite.\n  We have already spent in the State of Nevada over $7 billion \ncharacterizing Yucca Mountain. You could store it onsite safely in dry \ncask storage containers. You could establish a nuclear waste repository \nsite where the waste is generated--where the power is generated. You \ncould do that for $5 million. It would be safe. It would not be subject \nto terrorist threats.\n  We don't have to worry about transportation. We don't have to worry \nabout the loss of public confidence. It would be cheap. We could save \nthis country and the utilities money. My friend from North Carolina \ntalked about not millions but billions of dollars. Ground water would \nbe protected. There would be no risk to children.\n\n[[Page S3224]]\n\n There would be decent radiation protection standards.\n  I can't express enough my appreciation to the President and the Vice \nPresident for their support on this issue, and also the courageous \nSenators--Democrats and the two Republicans. The Senator from Rhode \nIsland and the Senator from Colorado, with untold pressure being placed \non them, are going to vote to sustain the Presidential veto. The 33 \nvery powerful and courageous Democrats--and I say the same about my 2 \nRepublican friends--I am very appreciative of their support and \ncourage.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I grant 5 minutes to Senator Sessions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nAlaska. I appreciate his leadership on this issue.\n  I see the poster the Senator from Nevada has of a train wreck. But I \nhave heard many others say on this floor that if a train carrying \nnuclear waste wrecks, the nuclear waste doesn't blow up; it just lies \non the ground. There was once a train with chemicals on board wreck \nabout 200 yards from my mother's house. That was a very dangerous train \nwreck; with explosions and chemicals leaking into the air and on the \nground. Had it been nuclear waste, it would have been sealed up and \nwould not have blown up, or have gone into the air, or seeped onto the \nground. It would have just sat there--posing little risk to people or \nthe environment. It is just not that dangerous to transport. In fact, \nas Senator Domenici has noted, ships and submarines with nuclear fuel \nin them ply the oceans every day. Those ships use the same fuel and \ncreate the very same nuclear waste which we are looking to dispose of \ntoday.\n\n  I will note that this debate is a political issue. There was an \nexcellent film on global warming on ``Frontline'' about 2 weeks ago. \nBasically, they concluded our energy needs could not be met and our \nenvironmental needs could not be met without nuclear energy. There was \nno other conclusion you could reach from watching that, but an activist \nwho opposed nuclear energy said the main reason she opposed it was \nbecause we could not get rid of the waste. That is an absolutely bogus \nargument.\n  We have the ability to solve this problem. But until we do, we have, \nin effect, shut off our ability to produce a cleaner environment and \nget on with emission free energy production at a reasonable cost.\n  The President has noted, in the State of the Union, that we have to \ndo something about global warming. He attempted to get us to ratify the \nKyoto treaty to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 7 percent from the \n1990 levels. But this Senate, voted unanimously, 95-0, against the \nagreement.\n  Our greenhouse gas emissions have gone up 8 percent since 1990. So to \nmeet the Kyoto agreement, we would have to have over a 15-percent \nreduction in greenhouse gas emissions between now and 2012. There is no \nway that can be done without nuclear power.\n  The Energy Information Agency predicts a 30-percent increase in \ndemand in electricity in this country by the year 2015. 20 percent of \nour power today comes from nuclear energy. France produces over 60 \npercent, and Japan, nearly 50 of its electricity from nuclear power \nsources.\n  Between 1973 and 1997, nuclear power generation avoided the emission \nof 82.2 million tons of sulfur dioxide and 37 million tons of nitrous \noxide into the atmosphere. In 1997 alone, emissions of sulfur dioxide \nwould have been about 5 million tons higher and emissions of nitrogen \noxide, 2.4 million tons higher, had fossil fuel generation replaced \nnuclear. Billions of tons of carbon and millions of tons of methane--\nbelieved to be the most significant greenhouse gas--are not emitted \nbecause of nuclear power. The building blocks of ozone, a proven \nirritant and health risk to sensitive children and the elderly, is not \nemitted at all by nuclear power plants. Ozone precursors are emitted in \nall other fossil production of power.\n  Sixteen percent of the world's electricity is coming from nuclear \npower, but we here in the U.S. have a strained situation because we \ncannot dispose of the waste. This problem drives up the cost of nuclear \npower which makes this cleanest of all power generation sources almost \nuneconomical. Certainly, one of the main reasons we are not building \nany new plants today is because of our inability to solve the waste \nproblem.\n  Even as some in the environmental movement are changing their views \non nuclear power, the Vice President is not. In the April 22, edition \nof the Congressional Quarterly:\n\n       Vice President Gore stated he does ``not support an \n     increased reliance on nuclear power for electricity \n     production'' but would ``keep open the option of relicensing \n     nuclear power plants.''\n\n  I visited the Tennessee Valley Authority's existing plant a few weeks \nago in north Alabama. They set a record for safe operation without one \nshut down in over 500 days. It produces no environmental discharge. One \nthousand workers are there, quite happy, making excellent wages and \nproviding a steady, 24-hour-a-day supply of clean electricity for the \nTennessee Valley Authority.\n  That is good for this country. It means we are not having to burn \ncoal. It means we are not having to import oil to generate our power.\n  But members of the Administration are not unanimous in their position \non nuclear power. In 1998, Under Secretary of State Stuart Eizenstat \nremarked:\n\n       I believe very firmly that nuclear has to be a significant \n     part of our energy future and a large part of the Western \n     world if we're going to meet these emission reduction \n     targets. Those who think we can accomplish these goals \n     without a significant nuclear industry are simply mistaken.\n\n  Another administration official, Ambassador John Ritch, speaking to \nthe North Atlantic Assembly said:\n\n       The reality is that, of all energy forms--\n\n  This is the President's own appointee--\n\n       capable of meeting the world's expanding energy needs, \n     nuclear power yields the least and most easily managed waste.\n\n  I agree with Senator Domenici. We are almost at the point of lunacy \nif we cannot choose a place in the desert of this country--where we had \nhundreds of bombs exploded while developing our nuclear weaponry--to \nbury nuclear waste deep down a tunnel, under a solid rock mountain and \nsecure it there. What is it that we cannot do? We are storing this \nwaste in hundreds of nuclear powerplants all over America and we cannot \nput it out in the desert and seal it up, yet we have ships traveling \nall over the world powered by nuclear energy that have this same spent \nfuel in them?\n  This is not wise. I call on the people of this country to rethink our \nposition on nuclear power. There are 40,000 tons of spent nuclear fuel \nstored in 71 sites around this country. We have the ability to safely \nsolve this waste problem and move ahead with a viable nuclear program \nto supply clean, low cost energy to our country.\n  I thank the Chair and the distinguished chairman of this committee \nfor his excellent work. I do hope this veto will not be sustained.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, how much time do we have on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 19 minutes. The \nSenator from Nevada has 21 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend from Alabama said if there was an \naccident it would not be nearly as bad as a chemical accident, a \ntrainload of chemicals compared to a trainload of nuclear waste because \nthe container would not breach.\n  I do not know where my friend got that information because we have \nalready established there is no container that can sustain an accident \nwhere the vehicle is going more than 30 miles an hour or, in fact, if \nit was a diesel fire.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on this legislation we are talking about \n12,000 shipments through Illinois, 11,000 shipments through Nebraska \nand Wyoming, 14,000 shipments through Utah. We have already had seven \nnuclear waste transportation accidents. The average has been one \naccident for every 300 shipments.\n  S. 1287 would result in 10 times as many shipments of nuclear waste \nover longer distances. Currently, the statistics would lead us to \nexpect, scientifically, 150 more accidents for this\n\n[[Page S3225]]\n\ntransportation plan. Are you ready to take that risk? I say to anyone \nthe answer should be emphatically no.\n  It would be no because let's assume there would not be a nuclear \nexplosion when the train wrecked or the truck wrecked. But, remember, \nwe are talking about the most poisonous substance known to man. If \nthere is a breach in the container, a tiny, tiny breach, the amount of \nplutonium on the end of a pin would make you sick, if not kill you. \nThese transportation risks are expensive and dangerous.\n  The Department of Energy estimates an accident with a small release \nof radioactivity in a rural area would contaminate a 42-square mile \narea, require almost 2 years to clean up, and cost almost $1 billion to \nclean that up, one accident--the Department of Energy, in their own \nwords: ``A small release.''\n  This is something that is very dangerous. We are talking about the \nhealth and safety standards for the people of America. They deserve the \nbest. This legislation gives them the worst.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to point out a couple of \nthings. We can show all the pictures we want around here about ``what \nif's'' but the facts remain. There was no nuclear waste associated with \nthat particular photograph of the unfortunate train wreck.\n  Let's talk a little bit about how this is stored. There have been \n1,500 tests performed to confirm and approve container safety. In the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission tests, transportation canisters have been \nsubject to some very tough tests, as they should be, tests that \nconfirmed that they did not break open. They survived a 30-foot free-\nfall onto an unyielding surface, which is the same as a crash into a \nconcrete bridge abutment at 120 miles an hour. Puncture tests, as well, \nwere done, allowing the container to fall 40 inches onto a steel rod 6 \ninches in diameter; 30 minutes in a fire of 1,475 degrees that engulfs \nthe whole container; submerging the container under 3 feet of water for \n8 hours. It goes on and on. It is rather interesting to note, about 10 \nyears ago we were looking at flying nuclear waste for reprocessing from \nJapan to France. At that time, the requirement was to design a cask \nthat would withstand a free-fall from 30,000 feet. We were advised it \nwas technically available.\n\n  What we have here is almost a Nevada litmus test. Everyone has to be \nagainst Yucca Mountain. I know there is a good deal of pressure on \nMembers, out of allegiance to my good friends from Nevada, from those \nwho do not want the waste in their State. That is the bottom line. If \nthey have to kill the nuclear waste industry to achieve it, that is \nwhat will happen.\n  I am holding a copy of the U.S. Navy Nuclear Propulsion Program. This \nis the so-called ``Mobile Chernobyl,'' some 90 reactors moving all over \nthe world. It is entitled ``Over 117 Million Miles Safely Steamed on \nNuclear Power.'' That is the record of our Navy. What we are hearing \ntoday is nothing but fear tactics of the worst kind, and this is \nemanated by the veto of the President.\n  Let's be realistic; the EPA has the sole and final authority to issue \na radiation standard. I do not want to hear any Member reinterpreting \nthat any other way. They--the EPA--must set forth a scientific basis \nfor the rule. That is the best science. On June 1, 2001, they--meaning \nthe EPA--are free to issue whatever standard they deem appropriate. \nThey have the final say. We can only hope it makes a sensible and \nachievable interpretation and is based on sound science.\n  We talk about the science. In the President's veto message, he talks \nabout the science. The Vice President talks about the science. We are \ntalking about the best science--the EPA, the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission, and the National Academy of Sciences, with the EPA having \nthe sole and final authority. There is absolutely no question about \nthat if you read the bill.\n  Let's look at something else. Taking the waste is a Federal \nresponsibility, the sanctity of a contract. The deadline was 1998. The \nratepayers have paid $16 billion to the Federal Government to take that \nwaste. The taxpayers have spent some $6 billion already at Yucca \nMountain where we have the hole in which to put the waste.\n  The longer the delay, the more liability the Federal Government has \nfor not taking the waste because the utilities are suing the Federal \nGovernment for not taking the waste. That is some $40 billion to $80 \nbillion. It is estimated it will cost each taxpaying family in the \nUnited States $1,300.\n  I will talk about foreign-domestic transportation. We have seen 300 \nsafe domestic shipments over the last 30 years--no injury, no \nradiation. This chart shows the network all over the country. Since \n1996, transport of foreign reactor fuel has come into this country from \n41 other nations. That is over 20 tons over the next 13 years.\n  To where does it go? It goes into Concord, CA, Sacramento River, and \nmoves up to Idaho. On the east coast, it goes to the Charleston Naval \nWeapons Center by rail up to Savannah River, and by truck on the \nhighways. It is shipped as high-level waste from other countries. In \nthe debate, the Senators from Nevada never acknowledged that exists. \nThey never acknowledged there is an inconsistency in our policy.\n  We accept it from foreign governments, and we store it in the United \nStates, but this administration will not address its obligation to take \nthe domestically produced waste from our own utilities and the \nratepayers have paid the Government to take it. That is the \ninconsistency. That is what is wrong with the administration's policy.\n\n  One example of this is U.S. participation in foreign shipments. A \nsemi truck full of spent fuel was loaded into a chartered Russian \nAntonov AN-124 cargo plane and flown from Bogota, Colombia, to \nCartagena so it could join a shipment from Chile bound for Charleston \nby freighter. The flight was believed to be necessary to avoid \nterrorists in Colombia, and the shipment went off without a hitch.\n  The point of this message is obvious. We are doing it for foreign \nnations. We are shipping it all over the world to two places in the \nUnited States: Concord, CA, and Charleston, SC. I do not know if the \nSenators from those States are concerned about it. I do not see them \nspeaking on the floor about it in indignation. Do we want to leave the \nspent fuel at 80 sites in 40 States, as this chart shows? That is the \nalternative.\n  I leave all Members with one thought. Putting politics aside, how \nwill you as a Senator explain why today you voted to leave the waste in \nyour State, subjecting your taxpayers to continued liability for broken \npromises of this administration?\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to override the President's veto. Let's \nput this issue behind us once and for all. If we do not, it will come \nback at a greater cost to the taxpayers.\n  Finally, on the issue of health and safety, about which we have heard \nso much from our good friends from Nevada, this waste is spread out at \n80 sites in 40 States, as I have indicated. I have another chart which \nshows that. These might be determined to be 80 mini Yucca Mountains, \nbut they were not designed for permanent storage. They were designed \nfor short-term storage, just as we have seen at Calvert Cliffs in \nMaryland. The current onsite storage was designed for short-term \nstorage, not long-term storage.\n  In conclusion, I encourage my colleagues to remember that in the 1999 \nDepartment of Energy draft EIS report, it said:\n\n       Leaving the waste onsite represents considerable human \n     health risks as opposed to one central remote facility in the \n     Nevada desert.\n\n  That is a statement by this administration relative to the issue of \nhealth and safety and leaving this waste where it is in these 40 States \nat these 80 sites.\n  Again, I encourage my colleagues to reflect on what they are going to \nsay to their constituents when they go home and say, I guess I voted to \nleave the waste in my State, when, indeed, they had an obligation and \nan opportunity to move it to one central facility that has been \nselected at Yucca Mountain, an area where we had 800 nuclear weapons \ntests over a 50-year period and where we did our experimentation with \nthe nuclear bomb--an area, frankly, that is probably already so \npolluted that it can never be cleaned up.\n  I ask my colleagues to read the letter, which is printed earlier in \nthe\n\n[[Page S3226]]\n\nRecord, from Governor George E. Pataki, who indicated that the citizens \nof New York State have been forced to temporarily store more than 2,000 \ntons of radioactive waste and urged the President to sign this bill \ninto law, and the statement that disposal of this waste is one of the \nmost important environmental concerns facing New York and other States \nwith nuclear facilities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to yield to my colleague from \nIllinois 3 minutes of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the issue of nuclear waste is an important \none in my home state of Illinois. More than half the electricity \ngenerated in our state comes from nuclear power plants. We have an \nextraordinarily large amount of nuclear waste in our state. We would \nlike to see it moved, once and for all, to a safe facility away from \npopulation centers in Illinois and virtually in every other state.\n  In that respect, I admire the Senator from Alaska for his tenacity in \ntrying to come forward with a nuclear waste bill that will put to rest \nan issue that literally will challenge us for centuries to come.\n  This nuclear waste, once transported, is still dangerous. We have to \nfind a politically and scientifically acceptable way to move it to a \nsafe spot in America where we can not only store it for the future \ngenerations that we can think of, but also for the generations in \ncenturies to come who could still be exposed to this hazard.\n  Having said that, the nuclear waste bill supported by the majority, \nand vetoed by President Clinton, fails the most important test. This \nbill, S. 1287, the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2000, is not \nenvironmentally responsible.\n  First, it prevents the Federal Government from taking ownership and \nlegal responsibility for the nuclear waste in Illinois and around the \nnation. The omission of this provision undermines the U.S. Department \nof Energy's efforts to resolve lawsuits with utilities and to focus on \nthe development of a permanent repository for this waste.\n  In addition, this bill establishes unrealistic deadlines for the \ncompletion of a repository and the transportation of waste to that \nfacility. The bill sets deadlines for the Department of Energy under \nterms that the Department of Energy says they cannot meet. They are \nphysically impossible. Failure to set realistic deadlines threatens \npublic health and safety and the environment, and will only lead to \nfurther lawsuits in the future.\n  Finally--I believe this is the most telling point--this bill \npurposely bars the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency from \nestablishing a radiation safety standard for the national waste site \nuntil after the Presidential election. The science will not change \nafter the Presidential election, but many writing this bill hope the \nPresident will change and that they will be able to elect a President \nwho has a different environmental point of view.\n  When it comes to the safety of future generations from radiation \nhazards, it should not be determined by the outcome of an election. It \nshould be determined by scientists who take into account public health \nand safety.\n  I refuse to be part of this deal that plays politics with the health \nand safety of Illinoisans and millions of Americans. I want the nuclear \nwaste safely removed from my state and stored safely so it will never \nendanger future generations. The President was right to veto this bill. \nI support his position.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I begin by thanking Senator Murkowski \nfor his efforts in introducing and promoting the Nuclear Waste Policy \nAmendments Act which addresses an issue of critical importance to the \nnation and in particular to the State of Illinois. I rise today to ask \nmy colleagues to join me in voting to override the President's veto of \nthis vital legislation.\n  Nuclear waste disposal policy is one of the most significant issue \nfacing our nation and my home State of Illinois. Illinois is home to 11 \noperating nuclear units which account for 38.4 percent of the \nelectricity generated in Illinois in 1998. Nuclear energy also provided \n20 percent of the electricity consumed by the nation as a whole last \nyear.\n  Nuclear power also yields a large amount of nuclear waste. Since we \ndo not presently reprocess this material, it must be stored, usually on \nsite at nuclear facilities in communities throughout our nation.\n  Illinois is home to over 4,300 metric tons of commercial nuclear \nwaste out of 30,000 tons located throughout the nation. This is more \ncommercial nuclear waste than is found in any other State in the Union.\n  Utility companies from Illinois and throughout the country along with \ntheir consumers have paid approximately $16 billion into a fund to \nprovide for a central national site for the storage of this waste \nmandated by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. But as of yet, there \nhas been no action taken by the Department of Energy to take this waste \nas it was mandated to do by 1998. Illinois consumers alone have \ncontributed $2.14 billion to the federal Nuclear Waste Fund since 1983. \nThis is about 12.5 percent of the total amount contributed to the fund \ntoday.\n  The DOE was required by statute to take possession of this waste in \n1998. It failed to do so, and we now have a very serious problem. We \nneed to decide the best way to allocate the costs of storage at \nexisting facilities. To this end, Senator Murkowski offered this \nlegislation which addresses DOE's failure and requires the Department \nto take responsibility for the costs associated with its failure to \nact.\n  I again thank Senator Murkowski for his longstanding support on this \nissue of critical importance to my State of Illinois and the nation. It \nis my hope that we can enact Senator Murkowski's legislation and I urge \nall of my colleagues to vote to override the President's veto.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Illinois because he has \nencapsulated the essence of this argument. This is not about science. \nThis is about politics, as he reminds us. Because the time is short, I \nwill respond to some of the issues that have been raised.\n  First of all, we have heard many paeans to the nuclear power \nindustry. Whether you are for or against nuclear power is not the \nissue. I might say, parenthetically, there is nothing preventing any \ncommunity that wants to establish a nuclear reactor from doing so. That \nis a matter of community choice. The fact that for 20 years no \ncommunity has chosen to do so may tell us the concerns people have \nabout their health and safety.\n  We have heard the Kyoto agreement discussed and interim storage. None \nof those are the issues. We have talked about why Paris apparently has \nless pollution than the United States because of nuclear power. All of \nthese things have no relevance.\n  Here are the issues--and the only issues. The question is one of \nhealth and safety. Who is going to make that determination? Is it going \nto be the Environmental Protection Agency, which, by law, for 20 years \nhas provided that standard?\n  What this is all about, when striped to the bare bones, is an attempt \nto circumvent the standard proposed by the EPA of 15 millirems. That is \nwhat we are talking about today.\n  My friend from Illinois is so right. They want to put this off until \nnext year, hoping that a new political process, with a new President, \nmight change the results in a measure far more favorable to the nuclear \npower industry. That is politics.\n  We hear over and over again the deadline of 1998 has been missed. It \nis true that the deadline for accepting the waste was missed in 1998. \nAnd where does the fault lie? It lies right here in the Congress. It is \npolitics. Because the original nuclear waste bill said that we would \nsearch all over the entire country and look for the best geology, the \nbest site. That was the science in 1987, when the legislation focused \non one site and one site only. That was politics. The geology of that \nsite is immensely complex. We will not know for some years whether or \nnot that is scientifically suitable.\n  We are told about the costs that are incurred by utility ratepayers. \nIndeed, there have been costs incurred. But for more than a decade this \nSenator and this administration has said to each\n\n[[Page S3227]]\n\nutility that incurs costs as a result of not having a 1998 permanent \nrepository open that we will reimburse them for the cost.\n  If in this legislation we said, look, take title and eliminate the \npotential liability that the reactor utility sites would have and \ncompensate the utilities for any expenses they have incurred because of \nthe delay, this Senator would support that legislation.\n  What is involved here is not compensation or reimbursement or delay; \nit is to change the basic science. Health and safety is the issue.\n  Let me say to my friend from Alaska, with whom I agree on many other \nissues, the area depicted by the photo, when he repeatedly made \nreference to Yucca Mountain, is 25 miles from Yucca Mountain. That is \nthe Nevada Test Site. We are talking about an area that is totally \ngeographically removed.\n  Let me talk about the issue that the nuclear utilities run all of \nthese full-page ads, that rather than 101 sites--we heard today 80 \nsites--how about a single site? Just have a single site in Nevada. That \nis a bogus issue, a red herring.\n  So long as each nuclear reactor continues to generate power, there \nwill be a nuclear waste site at that reactor. As those spent fuel rods \nare removed from the reactor, they are placed in pools about which the \nsenior Senator from North Carolina talked. That has nothing to do with \nwhether Yucca Mountain is established or not established. That is the \nway these spent fuel rods are first addressed. There will be storage at \nthose sites for years to come if Yucca Mountain were determined \ntomorrow to be suitable.\n  The proposed site contemplates that, if approved, there will be a 25- \nto 30-year period of shipments. So the notion that somehow this \nlegislation will establish a single site is a bogus argument.\n  Let me talk about transportation for a moment because that has been \ntreated very lightly, in my judgment, by colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle. Transportation is a legitimate issue. We are talking \nabout 43 States. We are talking about 51 million Americans who live \nwithin a mile or less of these sites.\n  This map shows the highways in red, the rail in blue, going through \nall of the major cities, particularly in the eastern part of the United \nStates.\n  What about the accidents? The Department of Energy itself says over \nthe lifetime of this disposal process, one could expect 70 to 310 \naccidents.\n  Each year in America there are 2,000 derailments. Each year there are \napproximately 200 collisions. We are talking about shipments of a \nmagnitude that we have never seen before: 35,000 to 100,000 shipments \nover this 25-year period of time.\n  Although these casks have been described as having fallen from the \nheavens, in point of fact, the casks that the Department of Energy \nwould like to use are much larger than any that have been previously \ntested. There have been no tests conclusively done with respect \nthereto. They are an earlier model.\n  What does this all really amount to? It amounts to congressional \nirresponsibility, to yield to the pressure of a special interest group \nthat wants to change the rules that are designed to protect 270 million \nAmericans.\n  Finally, I would say the answer to the question that the Senator from \nAlaska propounded--how do you explain, as a Senator, your vote to \nsustain the President's veto?--that ought to be a proud moment for \nevery Senator. Because every Senator could stand up and say: I resisted \nthe pressures of a special interest lobbying group, the nuclear \nutilities in America. What I voted for was what was right for the \ncountry and that is to protect the health and safety of the American \npublic--270 million of us who rely upon the Environmental Protection \nAgency standard, a standard that was unchallenged for 20 years that \nexists with respect to the nuclear repository in New Mexico, the so-\ncalled WIPP site, at 15 millirems.\n  Remember, the original version of S. 1287--we tend to forget that is \nthe bill before us, which admittedly has been modified--would have set \nhealth and safety standards where the American public--each citizen--\ncould be exposed to twice the amount of radiation that the EPA has said \nis safe for us.\n  Is that what we really want in America, to set health and safety \nstandards to accommodate the interests of the special interest groups, \nthe nuclear utilities, or should we not as Senators, Democrats and \nRepublicans, from the Northeast to the Southwest, from Seattle to \nTampa, be saying that we ought to support the health and safety \nstandard that protects the American public?\n  We can debate energy policy in America. That is a debate for another \nday. However, as Americans, how can we provide less safety, less \nprotection than the Environmental Protection Agency? Every Senator on \nthis floor knows, as do I think most Americans who follow the issue, \nthe only reason we would propose to change the standards--not sites, as \nmy friend from Illinois reminds us --is that it is politics, with the \nhopes that perhaps in November there may be a new administration that \nis beholden to the nuclear power industry and will make it easier, at \nthe risk of public health and safety, to site nuclear waste somewhere \nin America.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 8 minutes. The \nSenator from Nevada has 4 minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to my good friend, \nthe Senator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, this has been a very difficult issue for \nus to try to resolve. It is with a great deal of thought and \nconsideration that I come to the floor to announce that I will be \nvoting to override the President's veto. It is a very difficult vote, \nobviously, but a correct and necessary vote for my State of Louisiana.\n  The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 required the Department of \nEnergy to provide a Federal repository for used nuclear fuel no later \nthan January 31, 1998. Here we are, 2 years after that deadline, and \nthere is still no central repository for spent nuclear fuel in 40 \nStates. In fact, according to the Department of Energy's latest \nprojections, the placement of waste underground at Yucca, which I have \nvisited, would take place, at the earliest, in 2010, and only then if \nit receives full regulatory approval. That leaves us at least 12 years \nbehind schedule.\n  Meanwhile, millions of American families and businesses have been \npaying, not once but twice, for this delay. They pay once to fund the \nFederal management of used nuclear fuel at a central repository and \nagain when electric utility companies have to build temporary storage \nspace. As a result, since 1983, American consumers have paid \napproximately $16 billion to this nuclear waste fund through add-ons to \ntheir utility bills without a real satisfactory result. Still, the \nFederal Government continues to collect nearly $700 million a year from \nelectricity consumers. Future generations of Americans, our children \nand grandchildren, will pay a high price for continued inaction. We \nmust push to do something, and that is what this debate is about.\n  Also, the situation for the more than 100 operating nuclear \npowerplants storing used fuel onsite grows ever more urgent. Plants are \nrunning out of storage space. In Louisiana, we have two nuclear \npowerplants: Riverbend Reactor in St. Francisville and Waterford near \nNew Orleans. These plants will reach maximum storage capacity very \nsoon, and waiting until 2010 poses definite problems for my State.\n  This legislation is a necessary step toward meeting the Federal \nGovernment's legal obligation to safely and responsibly manage used \nnuclear fuel and high-level nuclear waste. It provides the necessary \ntools to begin moving used nuclear fuel to a central facility for \ndisposal if scientific investigation demonstrates that the Yucca \nMountain repository site in Nevada is suitable. This is an important \nstep that we need to take.\n  S. 1287 establishes three definitive deadlines for developing a \nrepository for used nuclear fuel at Yucca Mountain. First, it reaffirms \nthat by December of 2001, the Secretary of Energy must make a \nrecommendation to the President on whether Yucca Mountain\n\n[[Page S3228]]\n\nis a suitable site for a nuclear waste repository. Second, it requires \nthe President to make a subsequent recommendation regarding Yucca \nMountain's suitability to Congress by March 2002. Third, it requires a \ndecision on the construction authorization application for a repository \nat Yucca Mountain by January 2006. In addition, the bill enhances an \nalready safe transportation system with more training and state \ninvolvement in routing.\n  According to the President's veto message issued on April 25th the \nadministration has two primary concerns with S. 1287. First, ``the bill \nwould limit the EPA's authority to issue radiation standards that \nprotect human health and environment and would prohibit the issuance of \nEPA's final standards until June 2001.'' In fact, under the bill the \nEPA retains authority to establish radiation standards that protect \npublic health and the environment near Yucca Mountain. The bill seeks \nthe participation of experts on radiation safety at the National \nAcademy of Sciences and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in order to \nestablish the best public health and environmental standards possible. \nSecond, the administration argues that ``the bill does little to \nminimize the potential for continued claims against the Federal \nGovernment for damages as a result of the delay in accepting spent fuel \nfrom utilities.'' I point out that the federal government bears \nresponsibility for this delay and should not be completely absolved. \nUnder the legislation the Energy Department is given specific authority \nto reach settlements with the utility companies that have filed \nlawsuits for the Department's failure to meet the congressionally \nmandated requirement to move used nuclear fuel. In addition, the \nDepartment is prohibited from using the funds accumulated in the \nNuclear Waste Fund for settlements, except when the funds are used for \ncontainers or other aspects of storage that would be required to meet \nthe Department's obligation to move the fuel to a repository.\n  Mr. President, it is difficult to come to the floor to speak on an \noverride. It will be very rare, I hope, in my career that I will vote \nto override any President because I do respect the office, but I also \nrespect the role of the Congress.\n  I think this is the right vote for the Congress and for my State.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada has 4 minutes \nremaining. The Senator from Alaska has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I want to make a point one more time on the \nissue of transportation. This has often been characterized as an issue \nof Nevada versus the entire country. As more and more people around the \ncountry are aware of the implications for their families and their own \nsecurity in terms of health and safety, we are beginning to get the \nattention of the public. Just this past week, the Deseret News in Salt \nLake City, UT, strongly supported the President's veto. That \npublication does not have a long track record of being supportive of \nthis administration and particularly this President. But it indicates \nthe nature of the concern.\n  Here again, take a look at the routes that are involved in the \ntransportation. This will occur around the clock for 25 to 30 years: \n30,000 to 100,000 shipments. It is said that, gee, we have had \ntransports before and nothing has happened. That is true; we have had \nno fatalities as a result, but we have had 58 accidents. I suppose \nbefore the disaster of the Challenger we could talk proudly about our \nspace program and the shuttle launches that never had a fatality.\n  It is not a question of what the history has been as to whether or \nnot there has been a fatality. We are talking about something of a \nmagnitude many times greater, and I think our colleagues must look at \nthat. There are many States--43 States and 51 million Americans. But it \nhas been said repeatedly that we have to do something. The deadline has \nbeen missed, there is no question. But as I pointed out a moment ago, \nthis Congress bears the responsibility. It politicized the action. Had \nwe let the Nuclear Waste Policy Act unfold as it was originally \ncontemplated back in 1982, we might very well have had the solution to \nthe permanent repository issue.\n\n  This health and safety standard ought to anger every American \nwatching. It is cynical for a political and a special interest \npurpose--this is what this bill is all about, special interest \nlegislation--to change a health and safety standard that is designed to \nprotect the Nation.\n  Finally, just a reference that comes up again and again. We were told \nby someone obliquely that if we don't do something, somehow the waste \nwill pile up and we will not be able to generate nuclear power.\n  Twenty years ago this summer, the same argument was advanced by the \ndistinguished chairman's predecessor--that if we did not get, what was \nthen referred to, away from an active program on line, we would soon \nhave to shut down nuclear reactors around the country. It was not true \nthen, and it is not true now. No reactor waste is exposed because of \nspace. There is dry cask storage available, it is licensed, and \napproved for up to a period of 100 years.\n  Let's do this right. Let science and not politics prevail.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as we wind down our debate, I \ncompliment my friends from Nevada for their points of view. But I would \nlike to remind all of my colleagues of the obligations we have.\n  Senator Durbin from Illinois expressed concern about why we are \nwaiting until 2001.\n  We are all very much aware that this administration and the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency came down today without a doubt to set \na standard that was unattainable. Make no mistake about it, that is \nwhat some of these folks would like to see happen.\n  I quote from the press release of my friend, Senator Reid, of \nFebruary 9:\n\n       Under this bill, the Environmental Protection Agency will \n     have full authority to set radiation standards for Yucca \n     Mountain, which many experts say will ultimately prevent the \n     site from ever being licensed as a nuclear waste dump.\n\n  There you have it. They don't want to ever see it accomplish its \npurpose.\n  We talk about courage. We talk about health. We talk about safety. \nBut the real issue is politics, and it is Nevada politics against the \nrecognition of the rest of the country that we have this waste at 80 \nsites in 40 States, and this administration is simply caving in to \nNevada politics.\n  Let me talk about courage.\n  It is going to take courage to tell your constituents the money they \npaid to move the waste has been taken by the Federal Government and the \nwaste is still not moved.\n  It is going to take courage to tell your constituents the Federal \nGovernment has broken its word again, and you support that Government, \nyou support that decision, and you support the President who tells you \nhe has justification for overriding the veto.\n\n  It takes courage to tell your constituents you think this waste is \nsafer near their homes, their schools, their hospitals, and their \nplaygrounds than it is in one site in Nevada.\n  It takes courage to tell your constituents to ignore the findings of \nthe administration's draft EIS that found that leaving the material \nspread around the country would ``represent a considerable health \nrisk.''\n  There you have it. There you have the capsule of what this is all \nabout.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to override the President's veto and to \nmeet our obligation as Senators to resolve this problem once and for \nall.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues on the other side of the issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 3:15 \np.m. having arrived, the Senate will now vote on the question of \noverriding the President's veto.\n  The question is, Shall the bill pass, the objections of the President \nof the United States to the contrary notwithstanding? The yeas and nays \nare mandatory under the Constitution. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The Legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Roth) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 64, nays 35, as follows:\n\n[[Page S3229]]\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 88 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--64\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Edwards\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kerrey\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--35\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bryan\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee, L.\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Lautenberg\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n       \n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Roth\n       \n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I change my vote to no, and I enter a motion \nto reconsider the vote by which the veto message was sustained, and I \nsend the motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to reconsider would be premature \nuntil the vote is announced.\n  On this vote, the yeas are 64, the nays are 35. Two-thirds of the \nSenators voting not having voted in the affirmative, the bill on \nreconsideration fails to pass over the President's veto.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I enter a motion to reconsider the vote by \nwhich the veto message was sustained, and I send a motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is entered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to express my personal \ndisappointment that today the Senate was unable to override the \nPresident's veto of S. 1287, the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of \n2000.\n  Twelve years have passed since Congress directed the Department of \nEnergy (DOE) to take responsibility for the disposal of nuclear waste \ncreated by commercial nuclear power plants and our nation's defense \nprograms. Today, there are more than 100,000 tons of spent nuclear fuel \nthat must be dealt with. DOE is absolutely obligated under the NWPA of \n1982 to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel from utility sites. Today \nDOE is no closer in coming up with a solution. This is unacceptable. \nThis is in fact wrong--so say the Federal Courts. The law is clear, and \nDOE has not met its obligation.\n  The President sent his message--once again he chose not to enact \nsound energy policy. Once again, he chose to ignore the growing energy \ndemands of this nation. Therefore, it became Congress's duty to vote \nfor sound science, fiscal responsibility, safety, and honoring a \nfederal commitment to tens of millions of consumers across the nation \nwho benefit from nuclear energy.\n  This should be a bipartisan effort for a safe, practical and workable \nsolution for America's spent fuel storage needs. The proper storage of \nspent fuel should not be a partisan issue--it is a safety issue. This \nbill incorporates key concepts embraced by the Congress, the \nAdministration, and the nuclear industry.\n  Where is the Administration? Where is DOE? Where is the solution? All \nof America's experience in waste management over the last 25 years of \nimproving environmental protection has taught Congress that safe, \neffective waste handling practices entail using centralized, permitted, \nand controlled facilities to gather and manage accumulated waste. It is \nthe goal of our nation's nuclear waste management policy to develop a \nspecially designed disposal facility. The federal government is now 12 \nyears behind schedule in managing nuclear waste from 140 sites in 40 \nstates. The sites have spent fuel sitting in their ``backyard,'' and \nthis fuel needs to be gathered and accumulated. This lack of a central \nstorage capacity could very possibly cause the closing of several \nnuclear power plants. These affected plants produce nearly 20 percent \nof America's electricity. Closing these plants just does not make \nsense.\n  This bill would permit early receipt of fuel at Yucca Mountain \nfollowing issuance of a repository construction authorization by \nfederal regulators. In the meantime, improved environmental and public \nsafety would be provided at the site and during transportation from the \nstates to a federal repository.\n  The citizens, in some 100 communities where fuel is stored today, \nchallenged the federal government to get this bill done. It is \nunfortunate that this goal has not yet been achieved.\n  The nuclear industry has already committed to the federal government \n$16 billion exclusively for the nuclear waste management program. The \nnuclear industry continues to pay $700 million annually with only one-\nthird of that amount being spent on the program. The federal government \nneeds to honor its commitment to the American people and the power \ncommunity. The federal government needs to protect those 100 \ncommunities. This bill would ensure adequate funding for the lifecycle \nof this program and limit the use of these funds.\n  To ensure that the federal government meets its commitment to states \nand electricity consumers, it is vital that there be a mandate for \ncompletion of the nuclear waste management program--this program would \ngive the federal government title to nuclear waste currently stored on-\nsite at facilities across the nation, a site for permanent disposal, \nand a transportation infrastructure to safely move used fuel from \nplants to the storage facility.\n  Mr. President, nuclear energy is a significant part of America's \nenergy future, and must remain part of the energy mix. America needs \nnuclear power to maintain our secure, reliable, and affordable supplies \nof electricity. We have realized this year more than ever that this \nAdministration lacks a sound energy policy. The President's veto of the \nNuclear Waste Storage Act is a prime example.\n  Mr. President, this federal foot dragging is unfortunate and \nunacceptable. It is in the best interest of this nation for Congress to \noverride the President's veto. This is achievable, and I look forward \nto the opportunity to revisit this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank my good friends, Senator Reid \nand Senator Bryan, for the spirited debate on this nuclear waste \nlegislation on the President's veto override.\n  I also thank the professional staff on the other side who assisted \nwith this bill and my own staff: Colleen Deegan, Andrew Lundquist, and \nKristin Phillips, Trici Heninger, Jim Beirne, Bryan Hannegan.\n  I also thank the leader for his guidance and counsel. As we look at \nthis vote, which, as I understand, officially was, prior to the \nreconsideration, 65-34, we have one Republican Senator out today, the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth. We would have had, had \nhe been here, 66 votes. We are 1 vote shy. It is my understanding, \naccording to the rules of reconsideration, that this matter may come up \nagain at the pleasure of the leadership because it does remain on the \ncalendar. Is that correct, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is correct; it would \ntake a motion to proceed.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Again, I thank my colleagues for their confidence and \nrecognition that this matter still remains to be resolved by either \nthis Senate in this session or at a later time because the contribution \nof the nuclear industry is such that we simply cannot allow it to \nstrangle on its own waste. We really do not have that alternative.\n  I yield the floor and thank the leader for his courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the leader does not mind--I see him \nstanding--I also extend my hand of congratulations to the Senator from \nAlaska. He has been a gentleman during this entire debate. We have \nappreciated his courtesies. We also appreciate the leader working out a \ntime arrangement for us. It saved everybody a lot of time and effort.\n  Of course, part of the wait was because there were a number of \nRepublicans who were missing last week, and\n\n[[Page S3230]]\n\nwe thought it appropriate they be here when the vote took place.\n  We are in a parliamentary position now where the leader, at any time \nhe desires, can call this forward. It is a nondebatable motion to \nproceed. I hope, however, that the leader will continue the good faith \nthat has been shown by all parties on this issue for many years, not \nonly this year, and that if, in fact, something comes up because of \ntravel or illness the leader will give us an opportunity to know when \nthis matter will come forward.\n  Mr. LOTT. Will the Senator yield? Mr. President, I assure the \nSenators from Nevada that we have proceeded in good faith on both sides \nof the aisle on this issue from day one. I have always understood how \nimportant it is and how difficult it is for the Senators from Nevada. I \nalso understand, on the other side, how important this issue is to \nSenators all across America who have nuclear waste in their respective \nStates in cooling pools or in conditions of uncertainty where something \nneeds to be done.\n  There will not be a surprise on this issue. If there is a decision \nmade that we will need to reconsider, it will not be based on absentees \nor something of that nature. But I do think  it is such an important \nissue and it is so close now--really 1 vote--keeping that option open \nfor a while longer is worthwhile, but I will certainly notify Senator \nReid and Senator Bryan, as I have in the past, before we proceed on it.\n\n  Mr. REID. I thank the leader.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, will the leader yield for a moment?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I express my appreciation for the leader's \nforthrightness in indicating that we have tried to accommodate each \nother in terms of the time. I recognize that, as the leader, he has a \ndifficult schedule to maintain. This is an issue that for Senator Reid, \nfor me, and for Nevadans is of paramount importance. We think it is \nimportant for the country. I appreciate the spirit of the Senator's \nresponse. I appreciate the spirit in which the chairman of the Energy \nCommittee has conducted this debate. We disagree, but he, as well, has \nbeen courteous and very responsible in the exchange.\n  I thank three members of my staff who have done an extraordinary job: \nBrock Richter, Brent Heberlee, Jean Neal, and previously Joe Barry; \nthey have worked on this issue for many months, some for the past 12 \nyears. I acknowledge and thank them for their efforts. Again, I thank \nthe leader for his commitment. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, on February 10th of this year, the Senate \npassed S. 1287, the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments of 2000. I commend \nthe distinguished Chairman and Ranking Member of the Energy Committee \nfor the time and effort they have dedicated to this issue. However, I \ndid not vote for this bill, because it contains many of the same flaws \nas in past bills, including safety and licensing issues, inadequate \ndelivery schedules, and a failure to address specific storage problems \nof some companies.\n  One of the companies in our region of the country that has such a \nstorage problem is Northern States Power, NSP. Minnesota state law \nprevents NSP from expanding its nuclear waste storage capacity. As a \nresult, NSP will be forced to shut down its Prairie Island nuclear \npower plant when it runs out of storage space in January, 2007. Mr. \nPresident, this is an issue of critical concern. NSP serves 1.5 million \nelectricity users in five states, including 84,000 customers in my own \nstate of North Dakota. If NSP is forced to close its Prairie Island \nplant, the resulting impact on electricity customers in our region \nwould be devastating. Grid reliability could be compromised, and the \nenergy costs of many North Dakotans could increase substantially. In a \ncold-weather state such as mine, any increase in electricity costs is a \nmatter of great concern. In short, this utility is caught between a \nstate law and federal inaction--and we need to address the problem.\n  While I agree with the Administration's decision to veto the nuclear \nwaste bill, I am also disappointed by its failure to proactively work \nwith Congress to reach a compromise on nuclear waste storage, \nparticularly in light of the fact that North Dakotans have invested \nnearly $14 million to pay for the construction of a permanent waste \nstorage facility with little to show for it.\n  In the coming weeks, I will be working with the Appropriations \nCommittee to craft a solution to the problems brought on by state laws \nthat limit or restrict the storage of spent nuclear fuel. I encourage \nthe participation of the Administration and my colleagues in the Senate \nin this effort. I hope that this will be one of many efforts to address \nthe outstanding issues that have, up to this point, prevented \ncomprehensive nuclear waste legislation from becoming law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/02/senate-section/article/S3230-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3230-S3248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES ACT--Resumed\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report S. 2.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2) to extend programs and activities under the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe the pending business is the \nEducational Opportunities Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, as we get ready to resume general debate on \nthis bill, let me say again how important this issue obviously is in \nAmerica. People across this country in every State put the highest \npriority on the need to improve the quality of our education to have \nsafe and drug-free schools, to have accountability, to have rewards for \ngood teachers, and have a way of making sure our education system is \nbased on learning and that it is child centered. This legislation does \nthat.\n  I listened yesterday and participated in the debate. I thought there \nwas excellent debate. A number of Senators came to the floor and made \nstatements. I do not know how many, but probably 12 to 15 Senators \nspoke yesterday. There are a number of Senators on both sides who wish \nto speak further today.\n  There are some legitimate disagreements about how to proceed on \nimproving the quality of education in America and the accessibility of \neducation. There are those who say the current system is working fine \nand we ought to keep it the way it is. I do not agree with that.\n  There are people who say the Federal Government must have control and \ndictate or the right things will not be done by the States, the local \nschool districts, the administrators, and the teachers. I do not agree \nwith that.\n  It is legitimate to have debate because we have spent billions of \ndollars since 1965 trying to improve the quality of education in \nAmerica, and the test scores show we are, at best, holding our own and \nslipping in a number of critical areas. We need to think outside the \nbox. We need to think of different and innovative ways to provide \nlearning opportunities for our children in America.\n  I think it calls for flexibility as to how the funds are used at the \nlocal level. I think it calls for rewards for good teachers, but \naccountability for all teachers and for students. I think we need some \nevidence, with the flexibility, that our children are actually making \nprogress.\n  So this is an important debate as we go forward. I am glad we are \nhaving it. We have spent a lot of our time on education this year in \nthe Senate. We passed the education savings account bill earlier this \nyear to allow parents to be able to save for their children's needs, \nwith their own money, for their children K through 12. Now we are going \nto have this continued debate and amendments of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act.\n  Later on this year, when we get to the Labor-HHS and education \nappropriations bill, I am sure we are going to have some good \ndiscussion about the funding level for higher education--loans, grants, \nthe work-study program. We need the whole package to improve education \nand to make our children capable of competing in the world market, to \nbe trained to do the job they need to make a good living for their \nfamilies.\n  So this is an important debate. I am glad we got an agreement to stay \non general debate today. We are hoping to go forward tomorrow with the \nfirst four amendments on education, two on\n\n[[Page S3231]]\n\neach side, so that we can have some legitimate debate about how to best \nhelp education in America and help learning for our children in \nAmerica.\n  But I am worried about a lot of what I am hearing. I am hearing there \nmay be amendments to the education bill on everything from agriculture, \nto NCAA gambling, to campaign finance reform, to minimum wage, to guns. \nWhere is the limit on all the subjects that could be raised on an issue \nthat is No. 1 in the minds of the American people--education?\n  We are not starting off by saying we are not going to do this or not \ngoing to do that. We are starting. We are going forward. We are \nstarting in kindergarten. We are going to go to the first grade. We are \ngoing to have general debate and education amendments and take stock of \nwhere we are.\n  If there is a center ground that must and should be found in America \non any subject, it is education. What we have--the status quo--is not \nworking well enough. The Federal Government has a role. We need for it \nto be a more positive role and a results-oriented role.\n  So let's have the debate. Let's have amendments on education. I hope \nmy colleagues--on both sides of the aisle--will not make this important \nlegislation a piece of flypaper to attract every amendment that is \nflying around in this Chamber. It would be a terrible discredit to a \nvital issue in the minds and hearts of the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. We are commencing further debate on the ESEA, the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act. I think it is important that we \ndo spend this time on general debate because it is a big bill. There \nare a number of very important problems to be discussed. Hopefully, we \nwill reach a consensus at some point so that the bill will pass.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take a little bit of time today, until \nothers arrive, to talk about the role of teachers in our efforts to \nimprove educational opportunities for young people. S.2 includes some \nimportant changes related to the critical job of providing teachers \nwith opportunities to enhance their professional skills. Supporting our \nNation's teachers must be at the foundation of our education reform \nefforts because the better our Nation's teachers are--the better chance \nour Nation's students will have to ``make the grade'' in the 21st \ncentury.\n  A 1999 survey by the U.S. Department of Education on the preparation \nand qualifications of public school teachers reported that continued \nlearning in the teaching profession is ``key to building educators' \ncapacity for effective teaching, particularly in a profession where the \ndemands are changing and expanding.'' An investment in our Nation's \nteachers is a wise one. And we need to make wise investments with our \nFederal resources to ensure that the Federal dollars for professional \ndevelopment support activities that will foster improvements in \nteaching and learning that benefit students in the classroom.\n  Our Nation's classrooms are changing. All across this country, \nstudents are expected to learn to higher standards and perform at \nincreasingly challenging levels. We will never get students to where \nthey ``need to be'' unless our Nation's teachers have the knowledge \nbase to teach to those demanding standards. While there is near total \nagreement that strong, capable teachers are the ones that will make the \nmost significant, positive difference in the education of our nation's \nstudents, we have not done enough to help them be at the top of their \ngame.\n  There are still too many educators teaching outside their field of \nexpertise. Too often, teachers are offered one-shot, one-day workshops \nfor professional development that do little to improve teaching and \nlearning in the classroom. Professional development activities often \nlack the connection to the everyday challenges that teachers face in \ntheir classrooms. The most recent evaluation of the Eisenhower \nProfessional Development program notes that ``The need for high-quality \nprofessional development that focuses on subject-matter content and how \nstudents learn that content is all the more pressing in light of the \nmany teachers who teach outside their areas of specialization.''\n  Title II of this bill addresses these serious deficiencies in \nprofessional development ``head on.'' S. 2 draws on the strongest \nelements of the Eisenhower program while including authority for other \ninitiatives that have an impact on ``teacher quality.'' The bill \nprovides flexibility to school districts to address the specific needs \nof individual schools through programs such as: recruitment and hiring \ninitiatives; teacher mentoring and retention initiates and professional \ndevelopment activities.\n  It prohibits Federal dollars from being used for ``one-shot'' \nworkshops that have been criticized for being relatively ineffective \nbecause they are usually short term; lacking in continuity; lacking in \nadequate followup; and typically isolated from the participants' \nclassroom and school contexts.\n  The bill before the Senate provides significant resources--$2 \nbillion--to school districts to improve the quality of teaching in the \nclassroom. It combines funds and authorities from the Eisenhower \nprogram and the class size reduction program in an effort to give \nschool districts the flexibility that they need to make decisions about \nwhat investments in ``teacher quality'' will have the greatest impact \non learning in their schools.\n  In an effort to set the record straight, I would like to clarify a \npoint that has been made by my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle with regard to hiring teachers. The language in Title II makes it \nvery clear that only certified or licensed teachers can be hired under \nthis program. I would like to read from the text of the bill on page \n210, Section 2031(b)(1):\n\n       Each Local Education Agency that receives a subgrant to \n     carryout this subpart may use the funds made available though \n     the subgrant to carryout the following activities: (1) \n     Recruiting and hiring certified or licensed teachers, \n     including teachers certified though State and local \n     alternative routes, in order to reduce class size or hiring \n     special education teachers.\n\nThis language is very straight forward and to the point--if you use \nTitle II funds for hiring teachers--they must be certified or licensed.\n  There has also been some criticism about what kind of professional \ndevelopment programs can be supported under this bill. The language in \nS. 2 is very strong on this point. The bill ensures that professional \ndevelopment funded with Federal dollars be related to the curriculum \nand tied to the academic subject the teacher is responsible for \nteaching.\n  Professional development must be tied to challenging State or local \nstandards; tied to strategies that demonstrate effectiveness in \nimproving student academic achievement and student performance or be a \nproject that will substantially increase the knowledge and teaching \nskills of the teacher. They must be developed with extensive \nparticipation of teachers and other educators and must be of sufficient \nintensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on the \nperformance of a teacher in the classroom. It prohibits ``one-shot, \none-day'' workshops unless they are part of a long-term comprehensive \nprogram.\n  This bill--for perhaps the first time in Federal law--makes it \ncrystal clear that Federal funds must be used for activities that will \nimprove teaching and learning in the classroom--not for fad-type \nactivities that have no relationship to what teachers want and need to \nknow to be better at their jobs.\n  The structure of title II makes a great deal of common sense and will \nresult in a real improvement in teacher quality. My home State of \nVermont serves as a good example of success through local \ndecisionmaking. Vermont strongly supports the class size money. Yet, \nsince the first dollar was appropriated for class-size reduction, \nVermont sought greater flexibility to use that money for professional \ndevelopment activities that would improve the quality of the teacher in \nthe classroom. Because Vermont already had small classes--sizes that \nhappen to meet the Federally mandated standard of 18--those dollars \nwere able to go for professional development.\n  I want other States to do what Vermont has done if that is what is in \nthe best interest of their students. Reducing class size is important. \nHaving a dynamic, qualified teacher at the head of the classroom is of \nequal or greater importance. Title II of this bill supports both \nefforts--high quality\n\n[[Page S3232]]\n\nprofessional development and hiring teachers to reduce class size--\nyet does it in a way that allows school districts to come up with their \nown recipe for improvement that will work for its students.\n\n  S. 2 has a new focus on the needs of other educators as well. In all \nthe schools I have visited over the years, I can tell almost \nimmediately if the school is a good one by meeting the principal. \nPrincipals have the ability to transform the environment at a school \nand make it a place where inquiry, collaboration, and learning \nflourish. That is why I am so pleased that Title II of this bill \nincludes a new program to support professional development for school \nleaders. The program is based in large part on a Vermont model--the \nSnelling Center for School Leadership. It will support training in \neffective leadership, management and instructional skills and practice; \nenhancing and developing school management and business skills; \nimproving the effective use of education technology; and encouraging \nhighly qualified individuals to become school leaders.\n  In general, I am pleased that S. 2 makes a significant and thoughtful \ninvestment in programs that will give our nation's teachers the \nknowledge and ``know-how'' to educate our nation's young people. \nSupporting our nation's teachers is one of the best ways that we can \ninvest in the future well-being of our Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Are we under time control?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no control of time.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise to respond to some of the points made by some \nof our colleagues on the other side of the aisle during the debate \nyesterday because, unfortunately, they have attempted, I believe, to \nmischaracterize our bill as it comes forward. The reason for \nmischaracterizing it I don't understand. Maybe they are not fully \ninformed about it or they simply believe the bill is so strong that \nthey can't defend it when they talk about it in its real form; \ntherefore, they must characterize it as a fantasy and then attack the \nfantasy as being inappropriate.\n  Let's begin with the Senator from Massachusetts who came to the floor \nyesterday and said that the flexibility we are suggesting to the States \nwill just revisit the situation where States were spending education \ndollars on things such as uniforms and tubas. I must say, I think the \nSenator from Massachusetts is in a time warp on this point. That \nhappened back when tubas and uniforms were bought, and I think one or \ntwo schools actually did that.\n  Title I was passed in 1965. That was 35 years ago. I think it is \nimportant that people catch up with today and the events of today. It \nis important that people catch up with the events of today and the \neducational system of today. We have had 35 years of title I, the \nproposal as structured by a Democratic Congress for the purpose of \naddressing the issue of education of low-income children. That Congress \nwas controlled by the Democrats for the vast majority of those 35 \nyears.\n  What have we gotten as a result of that? We have spent $120 billion \nto $130 billion on title I, and the achievement level of low-income \nchildren has not improved; it has either decreased or it has stayed the \nsame. We know low-income children in the fourth grade are reading at \ntwo grade levels lower than the other children in that grade level. We \nknow the low-income children in our inner cities are reading at grade \nlevels significantly lower, and some can't read at all as they head \ntoward high school graduation.\n  We know, for example, as this chart shows, that 70 percent-plus of \nour students in high-poverty schools are below the basic levels in \nreading, 60 percent-plus are below the basic levels in math, and almost \n70 percent are below the basic levels in science. We know the program \nhas not worked. Yet Members from the other side decide to stroll onto \nthe floor and start citing problems from 30 years ago and acting as if \nthey have corrected those problems over the last 35 years.\n  They haven't corrected the problems in education. They have \naggravated the problems in education. Generation after generation of \nchildren have been put through a system that has not allowed them to \nachieve. Low-income children have been denied the American dream \nbecause they haven't been educated to read and to write. They are \ncomplicit in this. They say the status quo works. They basically say \nthey have the answers.\n  Let me quote from the President on this point. I like to hold up \nthese charts myself, and I can read them. This is from the Washington \nPost in which the President is quoted. He told the reporters the \nFederal money for new teachers does not belong to the States and local \nschool districts. ``It is not their money,'' he said.\n\n  That is the attitude on the other side, that it is not their money. \nWell, whose money is it? Where does this money come from? It is \nobviously the taxpayers' money, and it obviously is coming out of the \nlocal school districts and States. It comes to Washington. But for some \nreason, the mentality on the other side is that we then capture this \nmoney here in Washington, send it back to the States, and tell the \nStates exactly what to do with it--categorical, targeted, and \nstraitjacketed programs; programs after programs, regulations after \nregulations, 900 pages of new law. What do they get for it? What have \nwe gotten for it after 35 years? Very little. Our low-income kids have \ngotten even less--virtually no improvement in their academic efforts.\n  So the Members on the other side come to the floor and they say \nthings such as, ``This money will be spent, once again, as it was 35 \nyears ago, if flexibility is given to the States, on tubas and football \nuniforms.''\n  I guess they didn't read the bill because it is very specific. For \nthe first time, we are expecting achievement in exchange for giving the \nStates these flexibility opportunities with these funds. This bill, as \na result of the Republican initiative, says there must be academic \nachievement. It must be provable. It must be academic achievement which \ncan be shown to have occurred through tests that have been given at the \nlocal level. The academic achievement must occur amongst our low-income \nkids so they are not left behind.\n  We are not suggesting dumbing down, as has occurred, regrettably, in \ntoo many school systems. We are not suggesting lowering the average so \nthat it looks as if the low-income child is getting closer to the norm. \nNo, we are saying low-income children's achievement must improve as a \nresult of low-income kids actually doing better in math and science and \nreading in relationship to their peers.\n  Equally important is that the achievement accountability standards in \nthis bill are very specific in saying they will be disaggregated. What \ndoes that mean? That means they are not going to be able to hide the \nperformance of low-income kids behind throwing them in with the \naverage; you will have to look at groups on the basis of their \nabilities and their classification so we will know whether poor \nchildren from the inner city are actually improving in their \neducational efforts, and we won't have a poor child being claimed to \nhave improved because he or she is put in a pool with kids who have \nhigher incomes and who are attending different school systems.\n  So we have very specific achievement requirements in this bill. You \ncannot, in any way, come down here and, in fairness, or with \nobjectivity, or, in my opinion, with an accurate reading of our bill, \nclaim this is the type of program that occurred 30 or 35 years ago and \nit is, therefore, not going to work today.\n  This is entirely different. It is an attempt to acknowledge what \nstudy after study has shown. Study after study has shown it is not \nFederal programs and title I that have worked to help kids; local \ncommunities and States focusing on kids' education have helped kids. In \nthose States that have actually seen an increase in the achievement \nlevels of low-income kids, such as Texas and North Carolina, success \nhas been specifically achieved because the local schools had \nflexibility and control over the State money. It wasn't because of \nFederal dollars. In fact, a NEPA study by the National Education Goals \nPanel reported that ``the study concludes that the most plausible \nexplanation for test score gains are found in the policy\n\n[[Page S3233]]\n\nenvironment established in each State''--not in any policies that came \nout of Washington.\n\n  The point is this: The other side is trying to mislead us. It is \nmaking representations which are totally inaccurate on the issue of how \nthese dollars, which are put into more flexible arenas such as Straight \nA's portability, will be used.\n  There is specific accountability. Straight A's requires that States \nestablish annual numeric goals for increasing the percentage of \neconomically disadvantaged students, of minority students, and of \nstudents with limited English proficiency. It requires that those kids \nmeet higher abilities of proficiency and that they advance in their \nability in math, science, and English.\n  This representation, which we have now heard for at least a day and \nwe have heard in the press for numerous days, about the ability to just \nsimply throw money in the school systems and allow them to spend it for \nwhatever they want--tubas, footballs, or uniforms--is a fantasy being \nmade by people who are living in a time warp, not only a time warp \nrelevant to that fantasy, but it is a time warp about what is the \nproper way to approach education. They are unwilling to look at any \nchange. They are so mired in the status quo that they are unwilling to \nconsider any change--even one such as we put forward as an options \napproach versus an approach which requires the States to do something. \nWe say the States should have the option to try these new ideas. We \ndon't say they must try the ideas.\n  Another area: There was a representation that Straight A's would end \nup undermining the ability of kids to achieve in the sense that the \nschool will get the money, that the money won't flow to the low-income \nchild, and that it will be used on some other activity within the \nschool system. They are not talking here about tubas and uniforms. They \nare talking about another school activity which might end up benefiting \nthe average-income student versus the low-income student. That may be.\n  But the point is, of course, that at end of the day the school system \nmust prove the academic achievement of the low-income child has \nincreased to get the money. However they spend the money, the results \nof spending the money must be that the academic achievement of the low-\nincome child must improve. This is the new trust we put into this bill. \nWe are concerned about the achievement of the low-income child, and we \nare not willing to spend another 35 years throwing money at a problem \nand creating a status quo in education that loses another generation or \ntwo of kids.\n  Senator Murray came to the floor. She said this is a block grant. \nFirst, it is not a block grant because it has all of the categorical \nprograms still in place. The money flows into the States. The States \nstill have the categorical programs. They can spend it on any one of \nthose programs. But they will have the ability to move it amongst those \nprograms. They have the accountability standard which we put in place.\n  But, more important than that, she goes on and says block grant \nprograms are always easy to cut and therefore we shouldn't do this \nbecause the programs might get cut and might end up reducing funding.\n  I point out that it is this Republican Congress that has \nsignificantly increased funding for education over the last 4 years. We \nhave increased Federal funding for K through 12 by 67 percent. That is \na big improvement.\n\n  Equally important, it is this administration--and specifically on the \nother side of the aisle--that has suggested cutting block grant \nprograms. Title VI, which is the only true block grant under ESEA, has \nbeen put in for zeroing out and for cutting in every Clinton/Gore \nbudget. That is a block grant program that has been proposed as zeroing \nout.\n  There is a certain disingenuousness when Members on the other side of \nthe aisle come down here and give us crocodile tears about cutting \neducational spending--especially block grant educational spending--when \nit is their side that has proposed time and time again in their budgets \nthat we do exactly that.\n  It is our side that has proposed and has succeeded in significantly \nincreasing funding for the various functions of education--elementary \nand secondary specifically--and this bill does the same.\n  It is an important debate we are pursuing right now because it is a \ndebate over the fundamental question of how we improve education for \nour children, and specifically for our low-income children. It does \nnone of us any good to have a mischaracterization and a \nmisrepresentation of the proposals that are brought to the floor.\n  Regrettably, the other side has participated in hyperbole of a rather \naggressive nature. I suggest if they really wanted to debate the issue \nof education, they would turn from hyperbole to getting into substance.\n  Explain to us why we shouldn't put pressure on the local school \ndistricts to require that low-income children succeed.\n  Explain to us why we should not empower parents, teachers, \nprincipals, and school board members to make the decisions as to how to \nbetter educate low-income children.\n  Explain to us why they believe--by ``they'' I mean the people here in \nWashington who represent the educational establishment in Washington--\nthey know more about educating a child, a low-income child \nspecifically, in the town of Rye, or the town of Epping, or the town of \nGrantham, NH, than the people who spend their whole life in Rye, in \nEpping, and in Grantham, NH, working to educate that child, and the \nparents of that child who happen to be totally committed to its \neducation.\n  Why do we believe we know more and can do a better job?\n  We have put forward a series of proposals which say to the States: \nYou do not have to take any of them. You can continue this program \ncalled title I exactly as it is, if that is what you desire. But if you \nwant to try something more creative, we are going to give you four or \nfive really good options that have worked in other States such as \nArizona, or in other cities such as Seattle. And you can undertake \nthose proposals. But it is up to you to make that choice.\n  The other side needs to come down here and explain to us \nsubstantively why it is inappropriate to give States those options when \nwe don't deny that there is a chance to use title I. They refuse to do \nthat. They refuse to address the substance of the issue. Instead, they \nuse hyperbole and go back 56 years to find a problem that has no \nrelationship to today. It is a meager response to this bill coming from \nthe other side of the aisle. Regrettably, it does not do them a service \nand it doesn't do this debate a great deal of service.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I will propound a unanimous consent \nthat the other speakers be Senator Sessions of Alabama, Senator \nHutchinson of Arkansas, and Senator Grams of Minnesota, which I think \nis in keeping with our normal protocol of those who have arrived in the \norder in which they arrived.\n  I propound that unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the unanimous consent agreement, the Senator from Alabama is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Hampshire. \nHe served on the Education Committee for a number of years. You can see \nthe passion, the conviction, and the knowledge he brings to bear on \nthis issue, as the Chair himself has done over the years.\n  It is time for some changes. The Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct was passed as part of President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society in \n1965.\n  I have been in schools in Alabama. I have talked to teachers. I have \nbeen in 18 schools in Alabama since January 1 of this year.\n  I was in Selma, AL, just Friday afternoon and spent some time with \nthe new and innovative school they have created. All of the sixth grade \nis in one building. They call it a ``discovery school.'' They emphasize \nart, music, and special programs that give the kids electives. But the \nfaculty has gotten together and created a system in which those \nelectives are very substantive.\n\n[[Page S3234]]\n\n One of the classes was sports math for kids who like sports. There is \na lot of useful mathematics in sports. They are teaching them batting \naverages and how to calculate all sorts of factors relating to sports \nprograms. That was their idea.\n  The faculty of that school got together with the principal in the \ntown of Selma to create a better way to educate sixth graders in that \ncommunity.\n  We are not capable of doing that here. We will have to vote one day \non the defense budget.\n  We have never been elected to run education in America. We were not \nelected to do that. The same people who elect us, as the Senator from \nWashington many times has eloquently said, elected our school board \nleaders to run education in our communities. They didn't elect us to \nrun education. They elect them to run education. Education is \nfundamentally a local State community project. It needs to be done by \npeople who know our children's names, who care about them, who know the \nschool buildings, who know the offices.\n  We are not doing that. We are trying to micromanage education from \nWashington. We have 700 Federal Government education programs in this \ncountry. Imagine that, 700. We talk about empowering schools to develop \nplans of excellence, and some of our friends from the Democratic side \nsay we don't believe in accountability.\n  It finally dawned on me, their definition of ``accountability'' is a \nFederal mandate stating precisely how the money has to be spent in \ntheir school system. They define that as accountability. That is not \naccountability. We are pouring millions of dollars into schools in \nwhich learning is not occurring. Under all these programs and all the \ngrants and the 700 programs, nobody knows whether or not learning is \noccurring.\n  That is not exactly so. We are beginning to understand that learning \nis not occurring in many of the schools. Children are operating far \nbelow their grade level. That is no longer acceptable.\n  We need a system of real accountability, a system that tells the \nAmerican people and parents whether or not learning is occurring. We \ndon't want some national test that will be pushed on every school. In \nAlabama, we have a very tough new testing system in the 4th, 8th and \n12th grade. Students do not get their diploma if they do not take the \ntest and pass. Kids are getting worried. I asked a teacher in Selma the \nother day did they think kids were actually wising up and were their \nparents getting more energized and were they aware they were not going \nto get their diploma unless they met certain minimum standards. The \nteacher said teachers and parents understand it, children understand \nit, and they are doing a better job of doing their homework and taking \nlearning more seriously instead of just going through the motions of \ngoing to school every day and expecting the diploma to be handed to \nthem when they finish school.\n  I remember somebody talked about textbooks and how good our textbooks \nought to be. What good is a $500 textbook, the best words ever written, \nif the child is not going to read and is not motivated to read it and \nthe parents are not engaged in helping them read it and there is no \nsense of urgency or motivation in learning?\n  Obviously, that is the key to education in America. We will not \nmandate from Washington, DC. It has to come from the local communities. \nThat is consistent with what modern management is all about.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire indicated this is old thinking: Run \nany business from the top down. Every good CEO knows, that all the new \nmanagement techniques are to empower people at the lowest level who are \nactually doing the job that is necessary for success. You empower them, \nmotivate them, and encourage them to use their creative power to do \nthat job better every day. That is what we ought to do with an \neducation bill. That is so fundamental to me as to be without dispute.\n  I taught 1 year in the sixth grade in the public school. My wife \ntaught a number of years. It was a great time but challenging. Our \nteachers are working desperately to try to educate on a daily basis. \nSometimes our regulations and paperwork are unnecessarily adding to \ntheir daily burdens. They complain to me about it at every school I \nvisit. I always try to visit classrooms, talk to the principal and try \nto have an hour or so with a teacher just to talk to them about what \nthey think is important. They are complaining to me about Federal \npaperwork on a regular basis at every school. They say it is much too \nburdensome and unnecessary, and it keeps them from doing what they \nwould like to do to improve education in their school.\n\n  I am excited about this legislation. We have, in this Congress, \nincreased funding for education every year. We spent more last year on \neducation than the President asked for. We believe in education. We \nwant children to learn. We are not here to feather the nests of \nbureaucrats. I know people get scared when we talk about a system that \ndoesn't guarantee this program will continue as it has for 35 years. It \nscares people. The people who are working in those programs are \ntalented and they will be needed in our school system. People are not \ngoing to be fired. But we need changes. Every business, every \ngovernment agency needs to make some changes. Thirty-five years is \nenough. After 35 years, it is time we reevaluate what we are doing and \nmake some decisions.\n  We want to see education improve. What does that mean? That means \nlearning is occurring. When children go to class in September and come \nout in May, they have learned something. The more they have learned \nduring that time, the better we are as a nation. This is critical. We \nhave to figure out how to do that. We will not do it by polling data \nfrom Washington setting up 701 Government programs. That is not the way \nto do it. We have to, with humility, recognize our limits as a Senate \nand as a Congress. We have to trust the people we have elected in our \nlocal communities to run our education systems. We have to encourage \nparents to be involved in education, both in the schools and in their \nchildren's homework and learning. We have to insist local schools have \ntesting programs that actually determine whether or not they are \ngetting better in their mathematics, reading, English, and science.\n  We want them to improve. We don't want to be at the bottom of the \nworld in test scores in science and mathematics. That is not acceptable \nin the greatest nation the world has ever known. We cannot allow that \nto continue. But it will not be business as usual. There will have to \nbe some changes. This legislation will give States an option, a chance \nto say to the Federal Government, let us try, give us the free reign to \nrun. Let us present to you a program of excellence. Our teachers have \nsigned on, our principals have signed on, the community has signed on. \nWe will have the special sixth grade, this discovery school for sixth \ngraders, and they will learn a lot of different things, including, as \nthey did in Selma, dance, ballet, tap, and music as part of their \neducation curriculum. We believe children will learn better. We know \nthese children. We love this community. We love this school. Give us a \nchance to do some of these things and inculcate that as part of their \nschooling.\n  I believe we will see progress. I believe that is the only way we \nwill see progress. I am excited that what has been produced by this \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions--and this is my \nfirst year serving on that committee. I believe this is a good step in \nthe right direction. We will be sending more Federal dollars than ever \nbefore to our classroom. We will be sending it down to the classroom, \nto the principals and teachers who know our children's names. We will \nbe challenging them to provide programs of excellence in which actual \nlearning occurs. That is what we should do. I thank Chairman Jeffords \nand the others who have worked on it.\n\n  I see Senator Hutchinson, who has been such an outstanding champion \nof these values. We have worked together on a number of issues. He \nshares our concerns about empowering our teachers and helping them as \nthey teach in the classroom. We can do better, and this bill is a step \nin that direction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Arkansas is recognized.\n\n[[Page S3235]]\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Madam President, I commend Senator Sessions from \nAlabama. The Senator from Alabama has been a strong voice for change on \nthe HELP Committee. He has been a very influential member in the \nwriting and offering of this legislation, as has the Senator from \nWashington, who has been one of the outstanding leaders in this Nation. \nHe returns periodically from our recesses and reports on his visits to \nthe schools in Washington State. He made a conscientious effort to gain \nthe input of local educators, the ones to whom we ought to be \nlistening. I commend his great efforts in this debate.\n  This is an important debate. As I said yesterday, I believe this is \nthe most important issue and the most important debate the Senate will \nhave in this Congress. It is important, as Senator Gregg said, for us \nto have this debate on the substantive issues. There are very real, \nphilosophical issues as to what should be the Federal role in \neducation. It is that philosophical difference that should be debated. \nI am afraid, as I listened to the other side yesterday during their \nspeeches, that what I saw was a straw man being erected and knocked \ndown. That is a very common practice in debate but not very \nilluminating when it comes to what ought to be the public policy of the \nUnited States regarding our public schools.\n  During the 35 years of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, \nWashington made its imprint very deeply; it engraved it into the status \nquo. The ``status quo,'' that is what Ronald Reagan used to say is \nLatin for ``the mess we are in.'' If you look at the statistics and \nstudies and reports, you cannot help but conclude that American \neducation is a mess today.\n  American 12th graders rank 19th out of 21 industrialized nations in \nmathematics. Only Cyprus and South Africa fared worse. You can take a \nwhole smorgasbord of studies and facts and statistics to indicate the \nstatus quo is not sufficient.\n\n  The Democratic side, the other side in this debate, has clearly \naligned themselves with the status quo. They said it explicitly. They \nsaid it forthrightly. They said it candidly. Senator Kennedy, who is \nalways very articulate and succinct in the way he expresses himself, \nsaid we should stick with the tried and the tested. That is an \nhonorable position to take. It is a position we deserve to debate on \nthe floor of the Senate, not misrepresenting or mischaracterizing the \nbill the committee has presented.\n  If you want to preserve the status quo, if you want to stay with the \ntried and the tested, then clearly the bill the HELP Committee has \nproduced is not the bill for you. This is a bill that takes a \ndramatically new approach. It is a bill that says the past may have \nbeen tried and tested, but it is also a past that has clearly been \nflawed. While American 12th graders have been ranked 19th and 21st \namong industrialized nations in mathematics since 1993, 10 million \nAmerican kids reach 12th grade without having learned to read at the \nbasic level.\n  Senator Gregg said it very well: That is the problem in American \neducation today. We have young people who are reaching 12th grade, \npreparing to graduate from high school, who cannot read and write. It \nis not sufficient. It is irresponsible, and it is reprehensible for \nthis Senate to defend that kind of status quo.\n  Twenty million high school seniors cannot do basic math, and 25 \nmillion are illiterate in American history. That should embarrass us as \nAmericans. It certainly ought to embarrass us as U.S. Senators.\n  What about middle school test scores? Two-thirds of American eighth \ngraders are still performing below the proficiency level in reading. \nBut it is not only high school and middle school students being \nshortchanged by our Washington cubical-based system; over three-\nquarters of fourth grade children in urban high-poverty schools are \nreading below basic on the National Assessment of Education Progress. \nThose kids, in particular, are the ones title I was intended to help \nmost.\n  The Elementary and Secondary Education Act, as it originated 35 years \nago, was created to help those disadvantaged children who were from \ndistressed urban schools. Yet it is these very children, three-quarters \nof whom are in the fourth grade, who are reading below the basic level. \nThose are the children we are failing, those we had promised we were \ngoing to help when we established the ESEA 35 years ago.\n  Last year--and I think this will demonstrate the tragic failure of \nAmerica today--when the Children's Scholarship Foundation, a private \nscholarship fund--no public dollars, no Federal dollars, no ESEA \ndollars; private dollars, a private scholarship fund--offered 40,000 \nscholarships for tuition, 1.25 million applications were received. Even \nthough families were required to make a matching contribution from \ntheir own pockets of $1,000, 1.25 million applications were received \nfor 40,000 scholarships from the Children's Scholarship Foundation.\n  Does that not tell us that the status quo has tragically failed \nAmerican families and American children? In urban districts, the \nChildren's Scholarship Foundation demand was high. A staggering 44 \npercent of eligible parents in Baltimore applied; 33 percent of the \nparents in Washington, DC, applied for these scholarships. In the \npoorest communities, parents simply are not satisfied with their \nschools.\n\n  So I say to my colleagues, one could make the argument our country's \neducation system is in a state of emergency, and you would have \ncompelling data to back up that claim. Clearly, the ``tried and tested \nprograms'' are flat busted. They even say that expanding Washington \ncontrol would fix the multitude of programs. That is nothing more than \nrobbing our kids of their future.\n  I mentioned yesterday that the President a year ago, as quoted in the \nNew York Times, said he wanted Washington to have more control over \neducation. I will say again, we have too much Washington control. Just \nlast week, back in the State of Arkansas during our recess, I visited \nan elementary school in North Little Rock. I spoke to a very, very \nimpressive class of fourth graders. I had been invited to come and talk \nto them about government. They were seated around. For 45 minutes we \ndid a give-and-take. They asked me questions and I asked them \nquestions. I asked them questions to try to get an idea of where they \nwere in their understanding of American government. It was \ninspirational. Frankly, they knew more than many civics classes and \ngovernment classes in high schools that I had visited and to whom I had \nspoken.\n  The key wasn't any ESEA program. Frankly, it wasn't any title I \nprogram. It was that they had a tremendous teacher. I am convinced more \nand more as I visit schools, the key to good education is good \nprincipals and good teachers who are excited about their job and want \nto communicate facts and information and truth to children.\n  So I went to this school. While I was at the school, after I made my \npresentation, the principal, who sat through the 45-minute session with \nthe fourth graders, half jokingly--I say, only half jokingly--\nintroduced me to one whom he described as ``his boss.'' He said, ``Meet \nmy boss, the title I coordinator for our schools.''\n  I thought in that little joking comment there was a real truth that \nwas being communicated. The other side has said that title I is only 7 \npercent of the local school district's budget, it is only 7 percent of \ntheir funds, but I think when a principal says, ``Meet my boss, this is \nthe title I coordinator,'' it says that while it may only be 7 percent, \nit wields tremendous influence on the decisions made by local \neducators. It is a revealing comment, indicative of the extent to which \nour Federal bureaucracy has assumed control of our local schools. While \n7 percent of the education dollars come from the Federal Government, I \nam repeatedly told by educators, half of all the paperwork is done to \nobtain Federal grants and comply with Federal regulations.\n  Child-based education is the focus of the bill the HELP Committee has \nproduced. The pending legislation before us is based upon children; not \nsystems and bureaucracies, but what is best for the children. Make no \nmistake about it, we have a bill that is about educating America's \nchildren, not keeping a failing, dilapidated system on life support.\n  The bill before us pioneers a new direction for the Federal \nGovernment's role in education. It includes four student-focused \ninitiatives, including the\n\n[[Page S3236]]\n\nStraight A's program, which we have heard a lot about and which I think \nis the heartbeat of this legislation. It is a 15-State demonstration \nprogram. As Senator Gregg said, no State has to do it. No State is \ncompelled to do it. No State is required to get into the Straight A's \nprogram.\n  If they want to continue with the calcified system of bureaucracy \nthat we have created over the last 35 years, they can do it, but 15 \nStates will be given the opportunity to exchange the mandates, the \nregulations, the prescriptive formulas from Washington, DC, for freedom \nto mingle and merge those funds and use them as they deem most \nimportant for those children. The bill before us moves us in that \ndirection.\n  It also has a Teacher Empowerment Act. It has child-centered funding, \nand it has public school choice, all geared to students, under the \npremise that no child ought to be chained in a school that has failed \nyear after year. The Department of Education tells us there are \nliterally hundreds of schools that have been adjudged failing schools \nin which children are trapped. No child ought to be trapped in those \nschools.\n  I have listened carefully to the bill's opponents who claim our \nlegislation is nothing more than a blank check to the States. Having \nserved in the State legislature in Arkansas and worked with local \nschool boards, I do not subscribe to the notion that Washington is \nsomehow omniscient. It is not. Nor do I subscribe to the notion that \nthe States are incompetent or uncaring.\n  Beyond that, this bill is not a blank check. It requires \naccountability and student performance measures in exchange for \nflexibility and discretion by States and local schools. That is \nsomething the current system does not have and opponents fail to \nmention.\n  I say to all my colleagues, when they listen to the eloquent speeches \non the other side of the aisle and when they speak about blank checks \nand lack of accountability, ask yourselves what kind of accountability \nexists in the current system. I will tell you what accountability means \nunder the current ESEA. It means: Did you fill out the grant \napplication correctly? Did you get the ``i's'' dotted and the ``t's'' \ncrossed? Did you fill it out in the correct manner?\n  The second thing accountability means under the current system is: \nDid you spend the money in the prescribed way? That is all \naccountability means. There is no accountability as to whether kids are \nlearning. There is no accountability as to whether academic progress is \nbeing attained. In fact, if you fail, the likelihood is we will just \nfund your failure at a higher level.\n  That is not real accountability. Rather than cubical-based \nbureaucrats in Washington pulling the funding strings, funding will be \nallocated directly to the States and based on how well each school's \nstudents are performing.\n  Let me illustrate what is happening under the current Washington-\nbased, top-down system.\n  School districts currently receive funds under more than a dozen \nFederal categorical grant programs. The only accountability for many of \nthese programs lies in how the money is spent, not in improving student \nachievement. Washington requires schools to spend money on technology, \nbut there are no requirements for what matters most: Are the kids \nlearning?\n  Officials in an elementary school in my home State think that one of \ntheir greatest needs is to remediate children early. This is referring \nto a principal whom I talked with last night and again today in a \nsituation that arose in her elementary school.\n  She thought the greatest need was to begin remediation early, as soon \nas the deficiency could be identified, rather than waiting until the \nend of the school year and sending the children to summer school. To \nachieve this, the principal wanted to implement a concept known as \npoint-in-time remediation, which is designed to help underachieving \nstudents before they fall irreversibly behind.\n\n  This principal needed to hire a new teacher who would spend time each \nday working in different classrooms throughout the school assisting \nstudents who were struggling below grade level. In her desire to do \nwhat she believed was best for her children and to utilize this point-\nin-time remediation, she made an application for a Federal grant. Her \ntitle I coordinator rewrote her grant application as a request for \nfunding to hire a teacher to reduce class size, and the application was \nthen approved.\n  She now had an approved grant for class size reduction, which has \nbeen one of the hallmarks of what the other side said we needed to be \ndoing: provide 100,000 teachers from the Federal level to reduce class \nsize. That is what this title I coordinator did. She rewrote the \nprincipal's application so it would comply with the program that was \nmost likely to get approved--class size reduction. The application was \napproved.\n  Here is the problem: The school does not have a class size problem. \nThey do have a desire to work with students to keep them from falling \nbehind. Unfortunately, for many of the children of this Arkansas \nelementary school, under our current one-size-fits-all, overly \nprescriptive Federal education system, arbitrarily lowering class size \nis more important than meeting the real needs of children. This \nprincipal is faced with the alternative: I either fudge, I cheat, I do \nnot follow the prescription of the grant application and what the grant \nwas given for or I cheat my children whom I care about, for whom I want \nto do point-in-time remediation.\n  That was the choice this principal was facing. That is the choice our \none-size-fits-all approach to education from the Federal level gives \neducators over and over.\n  The arguments I have heard repeatedly from the other side echo the \narguments we heard a few years ago when we sought to reform welfare: \nblock grants, blank checks, cannot trust the States; they are going to \nhurt people; they are not compassionate.\n  What happened is, nationwide welfare caseloads have fallen in half \nsince we passed welfare reform and gave the States the same kind of \nlatitude that we now would like to give them in regard to education. \nThe sky did not fall. Disaster did not occur. The States did not turn \ntheir backs upon the needy. But hope and opportunity and a way up and \nout was created for millions of Americans who had been trapped in a \nwelfare system that did not do anyone justice.\n  Now we are hearing the same arguments regarding education: You cannot \ntrust the States; they will build swimming pools; it is a blank check; \nthey are not compassionate; they do not care; they are not going to do \nwhat is right for the children.\n  I reject that, and I think the American people reject the notion that \nwisdom flows out of the beltway in Washington, DC.\n  Under the Straight A's Program, States do not receive a blank check. \nBefore a State is even eligible to participate in the optional \ndemonstration program, it must have a rigorous accountability system in \nplace. It must establish specific numeric performance goals for student \nachievement in every subject and grade in which students are assessed. \nIt must establish specific numeric goals to reduce the achievement gap \nand to increase student achievement for all children. No more \naveraging. No more aggregating the test results so as to conceal the \nfailure of the current system. They must establish numeric goals \nreducing the achievement gap, which is still all too real between the \ndisadvantaged students and those who have more advantages.\n  Under our bill, it must establish an accountability system to ensure \nschools are held accountable for substantially increasing student \nperformance for all children, regardless of income, race, or ethnicity. \nThat is far from a blank check. That is not the end.\n  Then a State signs a performance contract with the Secretary setting \nforth the performance goals by which the State's progress will be \nmeasured and describing how the State intends to improve achievement \nfor all students and narrow that achievement gap. Unlike current law, \nStraight A's forces States to measure the progress of all children by \nrequiring States to take into account the progress of students from \nevery school district and school in the State so that no community is \nleft behind.\n  States must make improvements in the proportion of students at \nproficient and advanced levels of performance from year to year so that \nno child is left behind.\n\n[[Page S3237]]\n\n  Most importantly, States must include annual numerical goals for \nimproving student achievement for specific groups of children, \nincluding disadvantaged students, so that no child is left behind.\n  Right now, title I--I know my good friend, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Minnesota, cares about disadvantaged children--only serves two-\nthirds of the eligible children. That is a tragedy. That is a disgrace. \nUnder the bill our committee has produced, every title I eligible child \nwill be assured of being served.\n  For the first time, the Federal Government will not make schools fill \nout paperwork to show us what they are spending their money on, but we \nwill make States show us that every child in every school in every \nschool district is learning.\n  Block grants. I heard Senator Kennedy say this yesterday, and I think \nsome others on the other side of the aisle also said this: Block grants \nwill surely result in abuses.\n  We are, of course, investigating this, but let me point back to the \nexample of a school building a swimming pool with a block grant. First \nof all, I do not know if that is accurate, and I do not know if they \nwere violating the law at the time, if it did occur. But beyond that, \nthere is no honest way to compare the block grant experience of the \n1960s with the accountability provisions that are required in the \nStraight A's proposal in the legislation before the Senate. It is \napples and oranges. It is not even fair to make such a comparison. But \nthey do so.\n  In that allegation, in that attack upon this bill, there is the \ninsinuation or the suggestion that currently, under the status quo--\nwhich is so roundly defended--there is somehow accountability and those \nabuses do not occur. On that, I know they are wrong.\n  Let me give you an example. I want to show some pictures.\n  Last August, during a recess, I toured a lot of the Delta area in \nArkansas, which is the poorest area in the State of Arkansas. It is \nalso the poorest area in the United States. We hear about Appalachia. \nToday, the Delta of the Mississippi River is the poorest area in this \nNation. So I spent almost 2 weeks in the Delta area of Arkansas.\n  During that time, I visited the rural health clinics, I visited the \nhospitals, and I visited schools. But one I will never forget--I had \nstaff go down this past week to verify that I had my facts straight--\nwas the Holly Grove school in southern Arkansas in the Delta.\n  It is about 95 percent minority--95 percent African American. They \nare in a 50-year-old building. The building is older than the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act. They have a very low property \ntax base, so they have very little funding. Frankly, it is an issue the \nState needs to address in the equitable distribution of State funds. \nBut that is not my point at this moment.\n  So I went into the building. It is 50 years old. It is dilapidated, \nfalling down. We hear about inner-city schools falling down. This rural \nschool surely is as bad as any inner-city school I have ever visited or \nseen or heard about.\n  The ceilings are 12 feet high, so it is very difficult to heat. That \nin itself makes it a very bad learning environment. The lighting is \nvery poor. Then, worse yet, the ceiling is collapsing. Tiles are \nfalling down, tiles are missing. There are big water stains. You can \nsee it in this picture. These are the water stains in the tile of the \nceiling. There are missing tiles in the ceiling. This picture gives you \nan idea of the conditions in the building.\n\n  This picture shows the outside of the school, the school door. This \none school building, by the way, houses Head Start through the 12th \ngrade. As you can see from the picture, the paint is in very poor \ncondition. The building itself, while brick, is 50 years old.\n  I want to show you an amazing thing. I toured the school. The \nprincipal took me through the school. There were broken windows. The \nceiling was, as I said, collapsing. We opened this one door, and I had \nthe most amazing sight. I saw state-of-the-art exercise equipment.\n  Here is a picture of it. This was taken last week. These are \ntreadmills--I suspect better than what we have in the Senate gym. There \nwere a number of treadmills. And then, if you don't like treadmills, \nthey had Stairmasters, a number of Stairmasters. This is brand new \nequipment. This was all purchased last year. If you want to go beyond \nthe Stairmasters and the treadmills, there is Nautilus equipment, \nstate-of-the-art, brand new Nautilus equipment, a big room full of this \nequipment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Let me finish my story. Then maybe I will answer the \nquestion and be glad to yield.\n  After having looked at the terrible conditions in the building, the \nconditions to which the students were being exposed every day, I asked \nthe principal: Where did you get the money? Where did you get the money \nto buy all of this state-of-the-art equipment? And he said, rather \nsheepishly: This was a Federal grant.\n  We went back and talked about it. He applied for this grant. The \nschool applied for the grant. This was the way they could spend the \nmoney. Then he said: I would much rather have spent the money on \nimproving my facilities. I would much rather have lowered the ceiling, \nput good lighting in, painted the rooms. I would much rather have had \nsome resources to do that.\n  The answer on the other side is: Well, we will just start a school \nconstruction program from up here. Do you know what will happen then? \nWe will spend school construction money where they don't need school \nconstruction. What we had here was a typical Federal Government \napproach, a prescriptive categorical grant. Do you know how much money \nthey got? They got $239,000 for the Holly Grove school to buy athletic \nequipment.\n  To my colleagues, I say that is the insanity we must end. I am not \nsaying that is not good. I am glad they have the equipment. I am sure \nthe community can come in and use it in the evening. There is probably \nsome good coming out of this state-of-the-art athletic equipment. But \nthat is not what they needed, and the principal knew it.\n  Under our legislation, that principal and the school district, \nworking together with the school board, would be able to decide what \nwas needed most.\n  For a lot of schools, maybe it would be nice. I don't know. For an \nafterschool learning program, maybe they could use the equipment. Or \nmaybe a school could use computers, or maybe they could use tutors, or \nmaybe they could use new textbooks. But when they talk about swimming \npools from block grants, I want you to remember this picture because \nthat is the current system.\n\n  I am not shy about how I feel about education. As is Senator \nSessions, I am excited about the legislation this committee has \nproduced. This is a debate about education, not elections. It is a \ndebate about student achievement, not bureaucratic preservation.\n  If the underlying bill is passed and signed into law, the American \npeople will be the beneficiaries, the American children will know they \nhave a better opportunity in the future, and we will know we did our \njob.\n  I think this bill is so good and the facts so clear and the message \nso strong that proponents of the status quo are worried this could \nactually happen. In fact, some colleagues have already stated their \nintentions to offer amendments that they know darn good and well will \nkill this bill--kill it.\n  I am elated that so far the debate has been about educating our kids. \nI hope it continues. However, I understand a gun and gun violence \ndebate is coming. Who knows? Possibly campaign finance, maybe \nprescription drugs, too--all important issues in their own place, to be \nsure. But there isn't any American who follows this debate who does not \nunderstand what that would do to this bill. It would kill it. That is \nwhat they want to do.\n  I respect any Member's right to have their amendment debated on the \nfloor of the Senate. I, too, have that right. I want to preserve it. \nBut the Senate has already debated a juvenile crime bill. Members have \nstated their positions, and they have taken tough votes. What we need \nto do is ensure that this debate remains on education.\n  I implore my colleagues on the other side to reject the temptation to \noffer extraneous, unrelated, nongermane amendments to this bill. Let's \nhave an honest debate on education. We can disagree and disagree \nvehemently. We\n\n[[Page S3238]]\n\ncan have an honest philosophical difference over what the role of the \nFederal Government ought to be. Let's have that debate and take those \narguments to the American people. But let's not clutter this up with \nextraneous, nongermane issues.\n  With millions of American students struggling to read, millions of \nAmerican students who don't know the basics of U.S. history or don't \nexhibit basic mathematic skills, you would think we could collectively \nimprove student performance by passing the pending legislation. We will \nsoon see if we can bring our children to the halls of learning or keep \nthem outside spinning endlessly on the merry-go-round of Washington \npolitics.\n  I will conclude by quoting a former Secretary of Education, Bill \nBennett. He used this analogy, and it is appropriate in our debate on \nthe floor of the Senate. This was back in 1988, and it is true today \nunder the ESEA:\n\n       If you serve a child a rotten hamburger in America, \n     Federal, State and local agencies will investigate you, \n     summon you, close you down, whatever. But if you provide a \n     child with a rotten education, nothing happens, except that \n     you're likely to be given more money to do it with.\n\n  That is the current system. That is the status quo. I won't defend \nit. We want to change it. This legislation does that. I hope as this \ndebate goes forward we will have an opportunity to vote on the \nsubstance of the Educational Opportunities Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Minnesota, Mr. Grams, is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for 10 seconds?\n  Mr. GRAMS. Yes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. A number of Republicans have spoken, four or five in a \nrow. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Harkin follow the Senator \nfrom Minnesota, Mr. Grams, and that I be allowed to follow him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nDomenici be added to the end of that list.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to \ndiscuss an amendment that I hope to offer later to the proposed \nEducational Opportunities Act. To get right to the needs of this \namendment, it would permit States to fulfill the assessment \nrequirements of this bill by testing students at the local district \nlevel, or at the classroom level, and with a nationally recognized \nacademic test, such as the Iowa Test of Basic Skills, and also to \nprovide school districts a choice of State-approved standards from \nwhich to teach their students.\n  This is an amendment that seeks to maintain more authority at the \nlocal level where decisions are best made. It would provide more \nflexibility for schools to choose their own assessments to meet State \nstandards without losing any of the accountability needed to ensure \nstudents are achieving. Basically, it would offer schools an option on \nhow they want to measure the academic standards for achievements of \ntheir students--not to have this cookie-cutter-type proposal out of \nWashington that says this is the only way it can be done but to allow \nsome flexibility for States that might want to use a different \nmeasuring stick.\n  In Minnesota, the Federal requirements to implement a set of State \nstandards and accompanying State assessments have resulted in a highly \ncontroversial State content standard called the ``profile of \nlearning.'' Many parents in Minnesota have expressed to me their \nconcern about the vague and indefinite nature of the profile standards \nand also the consequential decline of academic rigor in the classroom. \nParents also object to some of the intrusive test questions that have \nbeen asked of the students. A poll taken a few months ago showed that \nonly 9 percent of public school teachers support continuation of the \nprofile as it is currently written in the State of Minnesota.\n  The students who visit my Washington office on school trips almost \nuniversally believe the time spent on fulfilling the profile \nrequirements has shortchanged them from obtaining real academic \ninstruction. Some of the assessments, entitled ``performance packages'' \nin Minnesota, can take from 3 to 6 weeks to complete, sacrificing some \nvery valuable class time for students. The performance packages \nrequired under the profile are often assigned to groups of students, \nand inevitably some students end up pulling more of the weight than \nothers. It is hard to see how this group system ensures that each \nstudent is assessed based upon his or her individual performance or \neffort.\n  I won't get into many particulars of the profile standards, but they, \nunfortunately, focus too much on politically fashionable outcomes and \nnot enough on transmitting to students a core body of knowledge. For \ninstance, one of the profile ``performance packages''--let me explain \nthis to you--was for a student to ``violate a folkway,'' which means to \ndo something odd or unexpected in a public place; and then they would \nhave their partner come along with them who, in the background, would \nwatch how people reacted and write down that reaction. I think it would \nbe an understatement to say that a school project such as that would be \nof extremely questionable value, just as an example.\n  The Thomas P. Fordham Foundation, which publishes a review of State \nstandards nationwide, stated that in the English portion of the profile \n``a large number of standards are not specific, measurable, or \ndemanding.''\n\n  We have another expert, a standards expert, Dianne Ravitch, who wrote \nthe following about the profile:\n\n       I will be candid because I don't have time to be \n     diplomatic. In the area of social studies, the Minnesota \n     standards are among the worst in the Nation. They are vague. \n     They are not testable. I advise you to toss them out and \n     start over.\n\n  A professor at one of the Minnesota State universities describing the \nprofile wrote:\n\n       The detail, the record keeping, the assessment for each \n     individual is enough to make one's head spin. The time that \n     will be devoted to paperwork will, of necessity, distract \n     teachers from planning, preparation, reflection, working with \n     students, and other essential tasks. I pity the poor teacher \n     who tries to bring it off and any nonlinear-thinking student \n     who falls victim to Minnesota-style results-based learning.\n\n  It is obvious that in Minnesota we have a real problem with education \nstandards. In fact, the Minnesota House of Representatives voted last \nyear to scrap the profiles completely, but unfortunately that bill was \nnot adopted by the full legislature.\n  Our children's education is too important to be the subject of \nexperimentation with the latest politically correct instructional fad. \nI want Minnesota students to excel, and I want to make sure Minnesota \nschool districts have a choice of standards--again, not a cookie-cutter \nmodel from Washington or imposed by Washington to qualify for any \nfunding. I believe Minnesota will adopt new standards and assessments, \nif not this year, then in the near future. I want to help ensure school \ndistricts are not forced to follow a fad, but that they have some \noptions in how to assess their students' education.\n  Though the profile has not been replaced, there is a strong \ngrassroots movement toward rigorous academic standards in Minnesota \nwhich has been embodied in legislation that creates an alternative \nacademic standard that emphasizes very clear, rigorous standards, local \ncontrol, and accountability to parents.\n  This State legislation has been entitled the ``North Star Standard,'' \nand it is the intent of the bill's sponsors to implement this standard \nas a local option so that local school districts can choose between the \nNorth Star Standard or the profile. They can stick with the new \npolitically correct system or they can go to an academically rigorous \nsystem that allows students to learn more.\n  My amendment would clarify that there can be two sets of standards \nand assessments from which local school districts can choose. Again, \nthat is all my amendment asks for. It says it would clarify that there \ncould be two sets of standards and assessments from which local school \ndistricts could choose--again, not the one dictated standard of how to \nget it done but leaving some options and allowing at least\n\n[[Page S3239]]\n\na second set of standards that parents and teachers could choose.\n  For districts choosing the North Star Standard, students may be \nassessed at the classroom or local district level, not the State level. \nTo ensure true accountability, the North Star Standard sets up strict \nreporting requirements. Teachers would have to provide parents a \ncomplete syllabus, information on the curriculum, homework assignments, \nand testing. Thus, the parents would know what their students are \nlearning and what their children are being tested on, protecting \nagainst the temptation to ``dumb down'' any of the tests to make things \nlook better.\n  While academic rigor is currently being compromised in Minnesota \nthrough a system of standards and assessments that aren't challenging \nand involve time-consuming projects that take valuable time away from \nclassroom instruction, it would be returned through local ``full \ndisclosure'' requirements to parents. Local testing would be tied to \nthe curriculum, and the testing would also include a nationally \nrecognized test such as the Iowa Test of Basic Skills.\n  The North Star Standard would also create an alternative, State-level \nset of academic standards that are clear, unambiguous, and present what \na student should know, without dictating a specific curriculum or how \nteachers are to teach that body of information. In other words, we \ndon't want tests written and then teachers teaching to the tests. I \nbelieve this standard is closer to what was intended under the ESEA of \n1994.\n  The theme of this reauthorization bill has been more State and local \nflexibility in exchange for accountability. I believe we can maximize \nthat accountability if we leave it to local school boards and parents. \nThe North Star Standard is an appropriate response to the shortcomings \nof the State-level standards and assessments experiment in Minnesota.\n  I firmly believe that nothing we do here in Congress should inhibit \nthe efforts of citizens to reform their school systems in a manner they \nchoose, and that they know what is best for their children.\n  Parents are the moving force behind development of the North Star \nStandard. These parents, some of which are current and former local \nschool board members, feel passionately about the education of all \nchildren, and have carefully crafted a standard and assessment \nstructure that they believe, and I believe, will improve the education \nof Minnesota students.\n  Again, this amendment is designed not to create a mold for one size \nfits all, but to allow states to have two sets of standards and \nassessments and to allow a local school district and teachers the \nopportunity to choose their own assessment that meets the outcomes we \nall want. I urge my colleagues to help my constituents restore the \nproud history of excellent educational achievement in the Minnesota \npublic schools by supporting this amendment when I have the opportunity \nto offer it later this week.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nGorton be added to the list of Republicans who are to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as we enter the 21st century, the American \npeople have their eyes firmly focused on the future, and they know \neducation is the key to that future. This morning's USA Today newspaper \nreported that of all the issues the American people care about or they \nwant their Presidential candidate speaking about, education is No. 1. \nEighty-nine percent rank it as the most important issue in determining \ntheir vote for President.\n  That is why this debate is so important. It has been 6 years since we \nhad the elementary and secondary education bill on the floor and I am \ndelighted that we are finally having this debate. I am hopeful it will \nbe a full and open debate with amendments that address the broader \nissue of education in this country.\n  Yesterday, there was a lot of discussion about the failure of Federal \neducation programs. We heard a lot of talk yesterday about how the \nachievement gap has widened and U.S. students are near the bottom of \ninternational assessments, teachers are not qualified, too many \nstudents can't read, and on and on. We heard all of these horror \nstories yesterday.\n  I wish to state at the outset, first of all, that, like so many of my \ncolleagues, I have traveled around the world. I have visited education \nsystems in other parts of the globe. I wouldn't trade one education \nsystem anywhere in the world for the public education system we have in \nAmerica. I wouldn't trade this public education system we have in \nAmerica for anything anywhere else in the world because we invest in \npublic education so that every child, regardless of how rich, or how \npoor, no matter where that child is born or raised, has a chance to \nfulfill his or her dreams. It is not so in other countries.\n  You might say the math scores are higher here or there. But, then \nagain, in some other education systems they take the brightest kids \nthrough testing and put them in mainstream schools. They may take other \nkids who maybe don't test as well and put them in technical schools. \nWhen it comes to some of these international assessments, some \ncountries are only testing the kids who are the brightest.\n  We don't believe in that kind of a structured education system in \nAmerica. We don't have one set of kids here, another set of kids here, \nand another set of kids here. We believe in universal education so that \nevery child has the ability to learn, to grow, and to develop. Yet even \nkids with disabilities have the ability to learn, to grow, and to \ndevelop. We have expanded the concept of public education time and time \nagain to include more under that umbrella.\n  When I was a kid growing up and going to public schools, you would \nnever see a kid in a wheelchair in school, or a kid on a respirator, or \nsomeone who had a mental disability in a school, or a kid with Down's \nsyndrome, for example. But today it is commonplace. And I say we are a \nbetter country because of it.\n  When my daughter was in public grade school recently there were kids \nin school with disabilities right in the classroom. I used to visit her \nin the classroom. I thought it was good for the kids with disabilities, \nand it is good for the kids without disabilities. It brings people \ntogether. You won't find that in very many foreign countries. Why don't \ntalk about that as a source of pride in this country, and what we do \nfor all of our kids in this country? Listening to the speakers \nyesterday you would think we had the worst education system in the \nworld; that it is just the pits. I beg to differ.\n  We have great teachers, we have great schools, and we have great \nkids. We have come a long way in this country in making sure that \nuniversal education is the right for all.\n  Does that mean we don't have problems? Of course, we have problems to \nfix. Just as we opened the doors with kids with disabilities and said \nthat you can't keep kids out of school, you can't keep kids out of \nschool because of race, you can't keep kids out of school because of \nsex.\n\n  Again, I hear these terrible stories about schools. I wonder where \nthe people are coming from who I heard speak so much yesterday. What do \nthey want? Do they want to privatize all of American education? Do they \nwant to have a system of education as some foreign countries have where \nthe brightest kids at an early age when they are tested get put into \nspecial schools, and maybe kids who don't have the intellectual \ncapacity of others are put in technical schools? They just learn a \ntrade, and that is all they do. Is that what people want around here? \nIf so, why don't they have the guts to get up and say so if they want \nour education system to be like some foreign countries, where their \nnational governments, not local school districts control education.\n  After listening to the debate yesterday, you come to the conclusion \nthat the Federal Government is solely responsible for public education \nin this country, and it is the Federal Government that is solely \nresponsible for the failure of our schools.\n  Let's set the record straight. Right now, of all of the money that \ngoes to elementary and secondary education in America, only 6 percent \ncomes from the Federal Government.\n\n[[Page S3240]]\n\n  That 6 percent of the money that comes to the Federal Government has \nruined all of the kids in America, has ruined our schools. Forget that \na lot goes for Title I reading and math programs, forget a lot of the \nFederal help goes to IDEA, Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, \nand other programs such as that. For some reason, that small amount, 6 \npercent, has ruined our schools. That is an odd case to make for those \narguing that the Federal Government is to blame for this.\n  Second, education is only 2.3 percent of the Federal budget. Out of \nevery $1 the Federal Government spends, only 2.3 cents goes for \neducation.\n  I make the opposite argument. I think it ought to be more than that. \nI think on a national level we need more of a national commitment to \nour public schools. Because our investment in public education is so \nsmall--only 6 cents out of every dollar--we have to be careful where it \ngoes.\n  First, we ought to make sure every child is educated in modern public \nschools connected to the Internet. Schools that have the best \ntechnology.\n  Second, we must make sure every child has an up-to-date teacher who \nis an expert in the subjects he or she is teaching.\n  Third, we must make sure every child has a chance to learn and be \nheard. You cannot do that in overcrowded classrooms. We need to make \nour class sizes smaller.\n  Fourth, we have to make sure children have a safe place to go during \nthe hours between the end of the school day and the time their parents \ncome home from work.\n  People talk about safety in schools. We are all concerned about \nsafety in schools. However, we need to keep our focus on where the \nproblem is. Schools are one of the safest places for our children, most \nof the problems happen after they leave school in the afternoon, in the \nevening, and on weekends.\n  We all decry the tragedy at Columbine, and tragedies at other \nschools. Those incidents capture our attention; they cry out for some \nkind of involvement and some kind of a solution. But keep in mind that \nonly 1 percent of the violence done to kids is in school. We need to \nmake sure we have an after school program to help keep these kids safe \nand secure.\n  Fifth, we have to continue to expand our help to local school \ndistricts to help kids with special needs in special education and for \nTitle I reading and math programs so that students can master the \nbasics.\n  Finally, we must demand accountability for our investments.\n  I think this is a clear, comprehensive, and accountable national \neducation agenda.\n  But the pending legislation before the Senate does not establish this \nclear agenda. In fact, the bill retreats on our national commitment to \neducation. It does not answer the tough questions. It simply says we \nare going to throw it back to the States; we will not provide any kind \nof leadership on the national level.\n  Finally, as has been said before by Senator Kennedy, Senator Daschle, \nand others, this is the first time this reauthorization is coming to \nthe floor as a partisan bill. The first time since the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act was passed in the 1960s that we have not had a \nbipartisan bill on the floor. It came out of committee on a straight \nparty line vote.\n  This bill gets an A for partisanship, but it gets an F for \neducational progress. The centerpiece is the Straight A block grant. It \nsends the dollars back to the States for any educational purpose they \nsee fit.\n  As was stated in the committee, one of our Senators, Mr. Gregg on the \nother side, admitted this could mean private school voucher programs if \nthe State has such a program. In return for the blank check, the State \nhas to show improvements in student achievement  after 5 long years. It \nis a risky proposal and will not guarantee any improvements in \neducation.\n\n  We heard a lot of talk yesterday about the burden of filling out all \nthese forms that schools have to fill out to get Federal grants. First \nwe are told the Federal grants are not any good. Then we are told it is \ntoo burdensome. Do they want to make it easier or cut it out? We don't \nknow the answer to that.\n  I have a Federal Class-Size Reduction Program application from the \nMarion Independent School District in Marion, IA. This is for class-\nsize reduction. It is one page, two pages, three pages. Three pages is \nburdensome? Anyone could fill this thing out in no time flat. To hear \nsome people on the other side talk, one would think it necessary to sit \ndown for a whole week and hire consultants to complete this paperwork.\n  This administration, under the leadership of President Clinton and \nVice President Gore, in reinventing government, have simplified and \nclarified a lot of the processes. To hear some of my colleagues talk \nabout it, you would think we were back 20 or 30 years ago under the \nReagan administration, or even before that, when you did have to fill \nout volumes and volumes of material.\n  Here is the bill, S. 2. We hear the talk on the Republican side about \nall the mandates, local control, and the reporting requirements. Here \nis an amendment that takes up a page, section 4304: Disclaimer On \nMaterials Produced, Procured Or Distributed From Funding Authorized By \nThis Act.\n\n       All materials produced, procured, or distributed, in whole \n     or in part, as a result of Federal funding authorized under \n     this Act shall have printed thereon--\n       (1) the following statement: ``This material has been \n     printed, procured or distributed, in whole or in part, at the \n     expense of the Federal Government. Any person who objects to \n     the accuracy of the material, to the completeness of the \n     material, or to the representations made within the material, \n     including objections related to this material's \n     characterization or religious beliefs, are encouraged to \n     direct their comments to the Office of the United States \n     Secretary of Education;\n       (2) the complete address of an office designated by the \n     Secretary to receive comments from members of the public.\n\n  And it goes on. Every 6 months they have to prepare a summary of all \nof this.\n  And the Republicans are talking about simplifying? This requirement \nwill be burdensome.\n  I want to talk about one issue on which I will offer an amendment, \nproviding authorization for the national effort to modernize and make \nemergency repairs to our Nation's public schools. The conditions of our \nschools are well known.\n  In 1998, the American Society of Civil Engineers--not a political \ngroup the last time I checked--did a report card on the Nation's \nphysical infrastructure, covering roads, bridges, mass transit, water, \ndams, solid waste, hazardous waste, and schools. The only subject to \nreceive an F in their quality in terms of our national infrastructure \nwere our schools. That is from the American Society of Civil Engineers.\n  We know that 74 percent of our schools, three out of four schools, \nwere built before 1970 and they are over 30 years old. The average age \nis about 42 years right now. I was on the floor when the Senator from \nArkansas was discussing the school he visited. The ceiling was falling \nin, rain was coming in, insulation was peeling off. It looks dismal. He \ntalked about how there was exercise equipment in the school.  I don't \nknow about the exercise equipment, but I do know about the \ninfrastructure, and he is right. There are schools like that in \nArkansas and Iowa and all across this country. Many of these schools \nare in low-income areas where they do not have a very large property \ntax base so they are unable to generate the revenue they need to fix up \ntheir schools. This is a national problem, and it requires a national \neffort and a national solution.\n\n  It is a national disgrace that the nicest things our kids see as they \nare growing up are shopping malls, movie theaters, and sports arenas \nand some of the most run down things they see are the public schools \nthey attend. What kind of message are we sending to our kids about how \nmuch we believe in their public education?\n  In 1994, there was a title XII that was added to the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act in that reauthorization. I had been \ninstrumental in that, both from the authorizing end and also from the \nappropriation end, because I have long believed this is a national \nproblem. Just as our roads and our bridges, our dams, and our water \nsystems are all constructed, built, and maintained locally, we still \nprovide a national input into those facilities.\n  I then tried, on the Appropriations Committee, to get money for Title \nXII. I have not been all that successful, I\n\n[[Page S3241]]\n\nmust admit. I did get a pilot program which is showing that a federal \ninvestment in school facilities can make a big difference. A modest \nfederal investment can make school safer by bringing them up to state \nand local fire codes. A modest federal investment can spur new \nconstruction projects as well.\n  Here is that report card that says our schools rate F in \ninfrastructure. We know there are some $268 billion needed to modernize \nschool facilities all over America. We know our local property \ntaxpayers are hard pressed in many areas to increase their property \ntaxes to pay for this. So that is why we need a national effort.\n  But this bill, S. 2--I can hardly lift it, it weighs so much--S. 2, \nthe reauthorization, strikes out title XII. We put it in, in 1994. I \nremember it was not objected to on the Republican side. It was not \nobjected to on the Democratic side. It had broad support in committee. \nIt had broad support in the Congress. Now, for some reason, 6 years \nlater when we have not even taken the first baby step to help modernize \nour schools on a national basis, the Republicans have taken it out--\njust excised it. I offered an amendment in committee to restore this \nimportant program, and I lost on a straight party line vote.\n  In the next day or so, whenever I have the opportunity, I will be \noffering an amendment to restore title XII. My amendment will \nreauthorize $1.3 billion to make grants and zero interest loans to \nenable public schools to make the urgent repairs they need so public \nschools such as the one talked about by my friend from Arkansas could \nuse that money to fix the leaking roof, repair the electrical wiring, \nfix fire code violations.\n  From my own State, the Iowa State Fire Marshal reported that fires in \nIowa schools have increased fivefold over the past several years, from \nan average of 20 in the previous decades to over 100 in the 1990s. Why \nis that? It is because these old schools, 31 percent of them built \nbefore World War II, have bad wiring. After all these years, they are \ngetting short-circuits. Maybe they have tried to air-condition; they \ngot a bigger load factor, and they are getting more and more fires all \nthe time in our public schools.\n  This is something you will not believe, but 25 percent, one out of \nevery four public schools in New York City, are still heated by coal. \nOne out of every four public schools in the city of New York is heated \nby coal. Talk about pre-World War II.\n  I think there is a clear national need to help our school districts \nimprove the condition of their schools for the health, the safety, and \nthe education of our children. I hope the Republicans will do what they \ndid in 1994 and support it again, broadly based, so we can have a \nnational effort to provide funds. The President put $1.3 billion in his \nbudget that would go out under title XII. Yet the Republicans have \ntaken title XII completely out of the bill. So I am hopeful in the next \nday or two we can put it back in and authorize this money.\n\n  Having said all that, is everything in this bill absolutely bad? Not \nby a long shot. There are some really good things in that bill, and I \nwant to talk about one of those. Right now, children, especially little \nkids, are subject to unprecedented social stresses coming about from \nthe fragmentation of families, drug and alcohol abuse, violence they \nsee every day either in person in the home or on the streets or on \ntelevision or in movies, child abuse, and of course grinding poverty.\n  In 1988, 12 years ago, the Des Moines, IA, Independent School \nDistrict recognized the situation and they began a program of expanded \ncounseling services in elementary schools. They called it ``Smoother \nSailing,'' and it operates on the simple premise: Get the kids early to \nprevent problems rather than waiting for a crisis.\n  As a result, the Des Moines School District more than tripled the \nnumber of elementary school counselors to make sure there is at least \none well-trained professional guidance counselor in every single \nelementary school building in the Des Moines School District. In some \nthere is more than one, but no school is without one. It started in 10 \nelementary schools. Forty-two elementary schools now have this program. \nThe ratio is 1 counselor for every 250 students, as recommended by \nexperts. The national figure for counselors for students in elementary \nschool is one counselor for every 1,000 students--1 counselor for every \n1,000 kids. There is no way 1 counselor can get to 1,000 kids. In Des \nMoines, we went down to 1 for every 250.\n  It is working. It has been a great success. Assessments of fourth- \nand fifth-grade students show they are better at solving problems, and \nthe teachers tell us there are fewer fights and there is less violence \non the playgrounds. It has worked. Smoother Sailing was a model for the \nElementary School Counseling Demonstration Program, and I am pleased \nthe program is reauthorized in S. 2.\n\n  We are discussing the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act and I am hopeful we can make some changes in S. 2 to \nreflect our national priorities. I just spoke about one. I also serve \non the Appropriations Committee, and my question is: How are we going \nto fund it? Mr. President, the budget resolution we adopted cuts \nnondefense discretionary spending by $7 billion.\n  I am working with Senator Specter, chairman of the education \nappropriations subcommittee, to find the money and do more than talk \nabout these problems. We are going to have a lot of debate on it. The \nPresident submitted a budget that I think makes a good start at funding \nthese programs--title I, after school programs, class-size reduction, \nschool modernization, school technology. All of these are vitally \nimportant. But where is the money when the budget resolution cut our \nnondefense discretionary spending by $7 billion?\n  We will have more debate about that in the future. I thought I might \ngive a heads up to my fellow Senators and say, it is all fine to \nauthorize this, but when the crunch comes on money, let's step up to \nthe bar and vote because we may need 60 votes. There will probably be a \npoint of order, and we will need 60 votes. We will see then if Senators \nreally want to invest in public education in this country. It is one \nthing to authorize it, but then sometime later this year we are going \nto have to step up and vote the money to solve these problems.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank Senator Harkin for his \nstatement. I am going to build on a couple points he has made.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator John Kerry--in the order that \nhas already been established--follow Senator Gorton. I believe Senator \nGorton is last on the list, and Senator Kerry wants to be included in \nthat list of speakers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I have a sequence of thoughts I want to put forward, \nand I will not do this, hopefully, in a haphazard way. I say to Senator \nHarkin, since he talked about appropriations, I want to talk about my \nState of Minnesota and the need for investment in some of these \ncrumbling schools. He is right on the mark. I hear about that all the \ntime.\n  I also want to talk about a wonderful book by Mike Rose called \n``Possible Lives'' based upon his experience in classrooms and all the \ngoodness he sees.\n  I agree with the very first point Senator Harkin made today about \nwhat is going on makes sense. But on the appropriations, the Senator \nfrom Iowa is right on the mark. Every breed of politician likes to have \ntheir picture taken with children. Everybody is for education. \nEverybody is for the children. Everybody is for the young. They are the \nfuture. But it has become symbolic politics.\n  Frankly, I hear a lot of concern about children and education, but \nthe question is whether or not we will dig into our pockets and make \nsome investment. The Senator from Iowa is right on the mark.\n  When I listen to some of my colleagues, I hear them talk about a \ncouple different points. First, I hear them say this piece of \nlegislation represents a step forward and Senator Ted Kennedy somehow \nrepresents the past. I thought we were going to have a bipartisan bill, \nbut this piece of legislation before us represents a great step \nbackward. This is not about a step forward;\n\n[[Page S3242]]\n\nthis is a great step backward. This legislation turns the clock back \nseveral decades and basically says no longer do we, as a nation, say we \nhave a commitment to making sure vulnerable children--namely, homeless \nchildren; namely, migrant children--will, in fact, get a good \neducation, or that we at least enunciate that as a national goal. We \nretreat from that in this legislation.\n  With all due respect, there is a reason that we, as the Senate and \nHouse of Representatives--the Congress--said we are going to make sure \nthere are some standards, we are going to make sure we live up to this \ncommitment, and that is because, prior to targeting this money with \nsome clear guidance, these children, the most vulnerable children, were \nleft behind.\n  Second, my understanding is the National Governors' Association has \nsaid, when it comes to title I, they want to keep it targeted. This \nparticular piece of legislation is so extreme that it even gets away \nfrom the targeting of title I money.\n  Third, to go to Senator Harkin's point about appropriations, when I \nhear my colleagues on the other side talk about how we want change, we \nwant to close the learning gap, we want to make sure poor children do \nas well, that children of color do as well, this piece of legislation \nis the agent of change, and we are for change, change, change, the \nquestion I ask is: If that is the case, then--I said this the other \nday--why don't we get serious about being a player in prekindergarten?\n\n  With all due respect, most of K-12 is at the State level. As a matter \nof fact, if we are going to say--Senator Harkin made this point--that \neducation is not doing well and they are going to present this \nindictment of teachers and our educational system, remember that about \n93, 94 percent of the investment is at the State level.\n  With all due respect to some colleagues on the floor, when I hear \nsome of the bashing, either explicit or implicit, of education and \nteachers, I say to myself that some of the harshest critics of public \neducation could not last 1 hour in the classrooms they condemn.\n  If we are serious about this, then why don't we make a real \ninvestment in pre-K? It is pathetic what is in this budget when it \ncomes to investing in children before kindergarten. The learning gap is \nwide by kindergarten, and then those children fall further behind. We \ncould make such a difference. We could decentralize it and get it down \nto the community level, and we could make a real difference. But no, \nthat is not in this bill or any piece of legislation from my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle.\n  Senator Hutchinson, a friend--we disagree, but we like each other--\ntalked about how the bill, S. 2, provides title I money for all the \nchildren in the country. I do not get that. I do not know how it can. \nRight now, we have an appropriation that provides funding for--what, I \nask Senator Harkin--about 30 percent of the children that will be \navailable? Fifty percent? I do not see in the budget proposal or in any \nappropriations bills that are coming from the Republican majority a \ndramatic or significant increase in that investment at all.\n  If my colleagues want to present a critique of what is going on, let \nme just give you some figures from my friend Jonathan Kozol who just \nsent me the Chancellor's 60-day report on New York City Public Schools. \nIt is pretty interesting. In New York City, they are able to spend per \nyear, per pupil, on average, $8,171. Fishers Island is $24,000, \nrounding this up; Great Neck, $17,000; White Plains, $16,000; Roslyn, \n$16,000; and other communities, $20,000, $21,000.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Is that per student?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Per student, two times and three times the amount.\n  Here is another interesting figure. This is median teacher salaries. \nIn the Democratic proposal--I will be honest about it, I cannot help \nit. I do not think the administration's proposal is great. I do not \nthink we should be talking about their proposal when it comes to early \nchildhood development. I would like to see much more in education. But \nI think with what we have heard on the floor, I say to Senator Harkin, \nis that the investment in rebuilding our crumbling schools, the focus \non lowering class size, the focus on having good teachers and making \nsure we put money into professional development basically is \neliminated.\n\n  I hear some of my colleagues--I think the Senator from Alabama--\ntalking about how poor we are performing in mathematics. The Eisenhower \nprogram, a great professional development program--teachers in \nMinnesota love this program--is eliminated.\n  This is pretty interesting. For New York City and in surrounding \ncounties: The median teacher salary in New York City is $47,345; the \nmedian teacher salary in Nassau County is $66,000; in County, it is \n$67,000; in Westchester, it is $68,400.\n  Jonathan Kozol can send me these figures because he wrote the book \n``Savage Inequalities.'' But with all due respect to my colleagues, if \nyou are concerned about the learning gap, if you are concerned about \nthe tremendous disparity in opportunities of students in our country--\nand all too often students are able to do well or not do well because \nof income or race--then we would want to make sure we live up to the \nopportunity-to-learn standard, where every child has an opportunity to \nlearn and do well.\n  If that was the case, we would be talking about the whole problem of \nfinancing, which is based so much on the wealth of the school district; \nwe would be talking about incentives for the best students, and \nincentives for executives and people in other areas of life who are in \ntheir 50s who want to go into teaching, all of whom can go into \nteaching; we would be talking about a massive investment, the \nequivalent of a national defense act, when it comes to child care; we \nwould be talking about afterschool programs; we would be talking about \ninvesting in the crumbling infrastructure of our schools.\n  I do not see it in this piece of legislation. I said it yesterday, \nand I will say it one more time: I do not see it in the Ed-Flex bill.\n  I said it last time, and I will say it again, that when I am in \nMinnesota and I am in cafes and I am talking to people, nobody has ever \ncome running up to me saying: I need Ed-Flex. They do not even know \nwhat it is. But they sure talk about the holes in the ceilings or the \ninadequate wiring or the schools that do not have heating. They talk \nabout how terrible it is that kids go into those schools. It tells \nthose kids that we do not care about them. They sure talk about all \nthese other issues.\n  I will conclude in a moment, but this is for the sake of further \ndebate.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator pointed out the disparity in teacher salaries \nand the amount of money spent per student. It raises in my mind this \nquestion, again, of why that is. Why is it? I ask the Senator, where is \nit in the Constitution of the United States that public education in \nAmerica is to be funded by property taxes? Why is this so? I asked a \nrhetorical question. Obviously it is not in the Constitution of the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague, we have had some important \nlitigation that I know he is familiar with, some really important \nSupreme Court decisions in the past on this question.\n  The challenge is this. The 14th amendment talks about equal \nprotection under the law. I think many of us believe that when the \neducation a child receives is so dependent upon the wealth or lack of \nwealth of the community he or she lives in, that that isn't equal \nprotection under the law because a good education is so important to be \nable to do well and to fully participate in the economic and political \nlife of our country.\n  So the answer is, it is extremely unfortunate that we rely so much on \nthe property tax system. If my colleagues want to present a critique of \npublic education, they ought to look back to the States.\n  I say to my colleague from Iowa, I love being a Senator. I do not \nmean this in a bashing way. But Washington, DC and the Senate is the \nonly place I have ever been where when people talk about grassroots, \nthey say: Let's hear from the Governors. They say: The grassroots is \nhere. The Governors' Association has just issued a statement.\n  Boy, I tell you, I don't hear that in Minnesota or in any other State \nI have\n\n[[Page S3243]]\n\nbeen in. People tend to view the grassroots as a little bit more down \nto the neighborhood, the community level.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for bringing up these points again. \nWe tend to get into these debates, and we really forget what is at \nessence here. What is at the essence of our problem is the big \ndisparity, as Jonathan Kozol has pointed out time and time again, \nbetween those who happen to be born and live in a wealthy area and \nthose who are born and live in a poor area.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is right.\n  Mr. HARKIN. It should not depend on the roll of the dice of where you \nwere born as to what kind of school you attend.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague, I thank him for mentioning \nJonathan Kozol because I love him. I believe in him. The last book he \nwrote--although he has another book that is now coming out--that was \npublished--and my colleague may very well have read it--is called \n``Amazing Grace: Poor Children and the Conscience of America.''\n  If you read that book, the sum total of that book is that any country \nthat loved and cared about children would never let children grow up \nunder these conditions and never abandon these children in all the ways \nwe have. I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, there \nis precious little, if anything--precious little; I do not want to \noverstate the case--in S. 2 that speaks to that question.\n  When you get to where the rubber meets the road, and the budget \nproposal we have and, therefore, the appropriations bills we will have, \nare we going to see any of the kind of investment that deals with any \nof these conditions which are so important in assuring that all the \nchildren in this country have a chance to succeed? The answer is no. \nThe answer is no, no, no.\n  I will finish up because I see my colleague from New Mexico is on the \nfloor. I know others want to speak.\n  Two final, very quick points. One, I want to speak to Senator \nHutchinson's example. Again, he is not here. He is very good at making \nhis arguments. I know he will have a counterpoint, so I am not going to \npresent this as: You are  wrong; you were inaccurate. But Senator \nHutchinson came out with graphics about gym facilities, workout \nequipment. It looked like a Cybex system. He was basically saying: Here \nyou have, in a school that has a decaying infrastructure, this \nbeautiful workout facility; this is an outrage because basically this \nis what we have right now with this Federal bureaucracy which dictates, \nhey, this is where you can get the money.\n\n  I say that I know of no Federal grant program that requires any \nschool to purchase exercise equipment. I do not know whether this was a \npart of an afterschool program or part of another program in which \nperhaps the school officials decided this is what they needed for the \ncommunity. But that is a very different point.\n  But I want to make it clear--and Senator Hutchinson may be able to \nadd to the Record and make it perfectly clear that what I have said is \nnot perfectly clear--I do not have any knowledge --I wanted to ask him \nabout this--of any Federal grant program that would require a school to \npurchase this equipment. I think that is important.\n  Finally, I have heard my colleagues talk about bureaucracy and all of \nthe rest. I find it interesting that when I look at the opposition, and \nI see the National Association of Elementary School Principals or the \nNational Association of Secondary School Principals, much less the \nAmerican Federation of Teachers, the National Education Association, \nthe Council of the Great City Schools--these people do not work at the \nFederal level; these people are down there in the trenches--the \nNational Association of Secondary School Principals or the National \nAssociation of Elementary School Principals--we are talking about men \nand women who have a great deal of knowledge about what is working and \nwhat isn't working. I think that we might want to take heed of their \nopposition to this bill  because we are not talking about bureaucrats; \nwe are talking about teachers, about principals. I don't know where the \nPTA is. I think they are also in opposition.\n\n  So for the record, I will concede--and Senator Domenici is great in \ndebate, and he will jump up and debate me--that the National PTA--and \nhe says I am right--doesn't represent all the parents, and I concede \nthat the teachers unions don't represent all the teachers, and I \nconcede the Association of Secondary School Principals, or Elementary \nSchool Principals, don't represent all the principals at either level; \nbut you have to admit that these people, these organizations, do \nrepresent a considerable number of principals. They do represent a lot \nof teachers. They do represent a lot of people who work there at the \nschool level. I find it interesting that they oppose this bill. They \ndon't see this bill as a great step forward for education or for the \nchildren they represent.\n  So for my colleague from New Mexico, after 30 seconds I will yield \nthe floor. In that 30 seconds, I say to the majority leader, let's have \nat it. Let's have the amendments out here and let's have a good debate. \nLet's not fold after 2 or 3 days. This is a major bill. I remember, \nwhen I first came here, we had major bills out on the floor and we took \n2 weeks, and we might have 60, 70, or 80 amendments. We worked from the \nmorning until the evening. Let's do it.\n  I have a number of amendments that I think would make a difference \nfor the children in my State and in other States. Other Senators have \namendments. But, for gosh sakes, let's allow the Senate to be at its \nbest and not insist that we have only a few amendments and that will be \nit, and then we basically shut this down. The people in the country \nwant us to have the debate. I think it is important to do so. People \nalso want to see some good legislation. This bill, in its present form, \nis not good legislation, in my view. I think it is fundamentally \nflawed. I don't think it represents anywhere close to the best of what \nwe can do as a Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, before the Senator leaves the floor, I \nwill say this on a subject we will be together on. I understand that \nthe parity for insurance purposes for the mentally ill in America \nbill--the Domenici-Wellstone bill for total parity--not some piece of \nparity, no discrimination of outreach, we are going to have a hearing \nsoon, right?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, we are going to have a hearing before \nthe health committee. I think we both thank Senator Jeffords and we are \nready to move it forward. It is great to have a chance to work with the \nSenator on this. I wish he wasn't wrong on every other issue.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Some people will recognize that, even according to \nWellstone, Domenici is right sometimes. I thank the Senator very much.\n  I wish to take a few minutes to speak now because I am not at all \nsure that tomorrow, or even the next day, I could speak to this issue, \nso I am going to do it tonight. I want to start by saying that it is \nreally good for Americans--whoever watches C-SPAN, or whoever pays \nattention to what we are saying on the floor--to hear speeches about \nhow we are going to improve education for every child in America, or \neven to hear speeches about the Federal Government needing to do more \nof what it has been doing, or speeches saying if we just paid attention \nand took care of things, all these children in America the education \nsystem would improve.\n  Let's be realistic, for starters. We don't pay for much of public \neducation. Now, considering the tone of the arguments about what we \nought to be doing for education and for all our children, one would \nnever believe that we only pay for about 7 to 8 percent of what it \ncosts to educate a child in the public schools of Pennsylvania, \nMinnesota, Iowa--I won't say New Mexico because we get about 9 percent, \nbecause we have a lot more children who are dependent upon the Federal \nGovernment in terms of military establishments, plus our Indian \nchildren. But let's make sure everybody knows that this great national \ndebate on education is talking about 7 percent of what is used to fund \nthe public schools of America in the 50 sovereign States.\n  Let's make sure we understand fundamentally the States--in some \nplaces counties, in other places cities--collect local taxes, in some \ncases property taxes, in other cases sales taxes, in other cases income \ntaxes--not here in\n\n[[Page S3244]]\n\nWashington, but in the capital of Santa Fe, NM, or in the great State \nof Pennsylvania, or the State of Oregon or Washington--they collect the \nmoney, they have the programs, and they decide between the State, the \nlegislature, the school districts, and in many places, commissioners of \neducation, what to do with all the real money that is applied to the \npublic education system and, thus, the students of America.\n  So it may shock some to know that education reform is occurring in \nthe State capitals, at the education departments across America, and \nour debate is about a little, tiny margin of 7 to 8 or 8\\1/2\\ percent \nof what goes into each student. We are doing this in the context of \ntrying to improve and help our public schools, because we have been \ngreatly enhanced, as a nation, during past generations, when the public \neducation system of America was the model for the world. What many of \nus are trying to do is take it back to the glory days when every \nstudent received a better education and the manifold problems that \nteachers experienced in the classrooms today were, in some way, \nalleviated so more of our children can learn.\n  In doing that, the issue is, for this little share that the Federal \nGovernment sends down to our school districts by way of special grants, \nhundreds of categorical programs, title I programs, which is $8 billion \nor $9 billion, all of those programs go down and help in some way in \nthe total mix of dollars and programs that the cities and counties and \nStates and commissioners of education put together.\n\n  The question is, Can we do better with our small amount of money than \nwe have been doing? Let me assure the Senators that whichever side they \nare on on this bill, to reform the education system, which is reported \nout by our Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, that \nthis is one of their education functions--this bill, in essence--and it \nmay shock people to know this--provides an opportunity to leave things \njust as they are. So for those on that side of the aisle, or perhaps \none or two on our side of the aisle--I don't know--that say they want \nthe Federal Government to continue to be involved in all these programs \nand to be telling everybody how to run them, so that 7 or 8 percent of \nthe money generates 50 percent of the paperwork, we want that to \ncontinue. Just wait and read the bill in its entirety and if that is \nwhat you like, the school boards, the commissioners of education, or \nthe Governors who run education in our States can decide to leave it \njust as it is.\n  Now, I can't understand how schoolteachers can be against an approach \nthat says this is not working as well as it should. But if you like it, \nplease understand this bill says you can keep having it like it is. \nThat is why we call it a menu.\n  You get to look at a menu. If you went out to eat, you wouldn't like \nto have in front of you three items we have been having for 15 years. \nAnd our nutrition isn't working well, and our bodies aren't feeling \nwell, but we get the same restaurant menu of the same three things. \nWouldn't we like it if the menu added a few other things just to try?\n  This is a new approach only in that you can keep it as it is or you \nhave another couple of choices.\n  What is wrong with some choice which might bring some innovation, \nwhich might cause us to do better with our 7 or 8 percent of education \nthan we are doing, because it might let the States, the school \ndistricts, the education commissioners, and the principals meld our \ndollars into their needs in a better way.\n  If you want to keep it as it is, you can come down here and say: That \nis what I want; I am voting for this bill; and I sure hope my State \nkeeps it as it is. Right? We sure hope whoever wants to say that, that \nwe will keep the same menu we have been having, and we don't want to \nadd to the menu, we don't want to add to the choice.\n  It is wonderful to be a Republican who can come to the floor and say: \nWe don't think the menu we have been delivering to the schools of \nAmerica with our 8 percent is a very good menu. It is not the best \nmenu, and we are going to provide some additional items of choice.\n  I want to thank a few Senators for taking the early lead on this.\n  In that regard, I want to recognize Senator Slade Gorton because he \nis the first one who came up with the idea, albeit it was a piece of \neducation, to say let them choose down there, but if they don't want to \nchoose, let them keep on doing what they are doing, but here is a new \nopportunity to handle those Federal dollars differently.\n  That imaginary, innovative, visionary idea has been expanded so now \nthere are a number of really interesting choices that those who educate \nour children in our sovereign States can choose.\n  Essentially, if I went no further and did not explain the choices on \nthis menu, I think I might have performed a minor service for those who \nare interested to find out that the bill we are talking about says the \nold menu doesn't work, let's try a new menu and put some new items on \nit--not mandatory, but that you can choose.\n  Let me tell you how poorly we do our job at the national level when \nwe decide we are going to do more than that and we are going to put a \nlittle bit of money in and tell everybody what to do. Let me talk about \nspecial education for a minute.\n  Special education is an admirable commitment--in fact, some would \nthink one of the greatest civil commitments that could be made in the \nfield of education. The National Government began not many years ago to \nsay you are going to educate children who are hard to educate, who are \nspecial education children, and special needs children. And we came \nalong and said exactly how you should do it; if you want our money, you \ndo it this way. The courts interpreted and told you in even more detail \nhow you are going to do it. Lo and behold, we said we will pay for 40 \npercent and the States and localities will pay for 60 percent.\n  Is anyone interested tonight? Take out a piece of paper and write \ndown your guess of this year as to how much we are paying of the 40 \npercent. If you think we must be paying 35 or 38, you are desperately \nwrong. We are currently paying 11 percent instead of the 40 percent to \nwhich we committed, and the years have passed us by.\n  If you run the school and you get Federal money, don't you think you \nwould be a little bit upset if we came along and told you how to do it, \nand then we didn't give you the money but our law  said we would give \nyou the money?\n\n  I have to compliment a couple of Senators who have said the best \nthing we could do is put more money in special education so the schools \nwouldn't be paying so much for it, and that would loosen up money for \nthem to do other things with. In particular, Senator Judd Gregg has \nbeen a leader on that initiative.\n  It goes unnoticed because it is not very politically sexy, at least \nto the general public, to say we have increased the funding for special \neducation by 4 or 5 percent in the last 3 or 4 years. That doesn't \nsound like coming to the floor and giving a speech about how we want to \ntake care of every child in America, when we are only paying for 8 \npercent of the bill, and how we ought to be taking care of all those \nneeds out there when the Government doesn't even try to take care of \nmost of them.\n  We still have a commitment to 40 percent. We are only paying for 11 \npercent of that. We come along and have a bill, and people want more of \nthe same. I think educators would like to try something different.\n  I congratulate the committee because they reported out a bill that \nhas some very exciting items added to the menu. I suggest people can \ncall it what they like in terms of trying to describe the new items on \nthe menu. But I see it as an opportunity on the part of the \nconstitutionally enfranchised leader in a State, whether it is a \ncommissioner of education, or the legislature, or the Governor. This \nbill says you can collapse the strings, you can collapse the rigid \nboundaries in two different ways--at least two. One is an approach that \nis called Straight A's.\n  The Straight A's Program says there is an option for 15 States--not \nall of them, and they don't need to take it. But 15 States can opt for \na State demonstration program. It will be for at least a 5-year \ncommitment on the part of the Federal Government and up to--isn't that \ninteresting?--13 big grant programs and little grant programs can be \ncollapsed.\n\n[[Page S3245]]\n\n  The thing that makes them rigid and makes them kind of a one-shoe-\nfits-all concept on education is that up to 13 can be collapsed. They \ncan collapse five of them, if they choose, and leave the other eight as \nbeing as rigid as they currently are.\n  In that ability to collapse under Straight A's is an option to use \ntitle I money--our biggest program--in that manner along with other \nprograms.\n  That is not going to be free to the school districts of America, nor \nto the principals and teachers, because commensurate with it is going \nto be an agreement on the part of the States. The States are going to \nagree, if they take this option, this added menu item, to a significant \nnew standard of student achievement within their schools.\n  They are going to figure out a way locally to see if collapsing these \nprograms and administering them differently helps the schools. We are \ngoing to say you can continue to do this if you have a plan to improve \nstudent achievement, which we choose to call accountability.\n  We also talk about the collapsing of the rigidity of the program--the \nrigid boundaries. We call that flexibility.\n  I think it is kind of better to say you are permitted to collapse the \nprograms, administer them less rigidly, and require student \nachievement, and in return measure student achievement. But if you want \nto choose the Straight A's Program, my guess is that 15 States are \ngoing to run quickly to get it and it will be used by 15 States. In the \nend, they are going to be saying: Let's try this new thing. Let's see \nif we can collapse these programs and do a better job. The agreement \nwith the Government will require that achievement occur at every level, \nincluding those covered by the current Title I program.\n  We have said if you do not want that menu item, because it is a \npretty big step away from what we have, there is another one called \nPerformance Partnerships which the Government permitted. You can \ncollapse up to 13 programs, but that cannot include Title I, the \nprogram whereby we measure aid to schools based upon the number of poor \nchildren in the school.\n  What we are saying there is the Secretary of Education will still be \nable to determine the boundary and use of Title I money. That is a \nsecond option--collapsing up to 13. But the Secretary still keeps his \nfinger on the Title I money. The Governors thought that would be a very \ngood option, and we put that in.  I don't see anything wrong with that.\n\n  Then we say for 10 States and 20 school districts, in exchange for \nnew accountability, new agreements on student achievement, you can \nswitch the current Title I funding from school based to a child-\ncentered approach. Isn't that interesting? We are not interested in \nschool-based education programs. That is just a mechanism for talking \nabout an institution that educates children.\n  It seems to me what we are talking about is that all the programs \nshould be child centered and we are going to give 10 States and 20 \nschool districts the option to choose a new funding mechanism for Title \nI. Eight billion dollars is my recollection of the $14.6 billion we \nspend on elementary and secondary education. It is more than half. We \nare going to say for these few States and few school districts, you \nwant to be bold? Want to enter into a student achievement agreement? In \nexchange for that, you get the opportunity to have Title I money follow \nthe students.\n  I close by saying that the committee did another exciting thing. We \nare all concerned about improving teacher quality. Whether we have \nexcellent teachers or not, I don't think we ought to pass judgment on \nthe floor. We hear many of the schools are worried that teachers are \nnot necessarily as highly qualified as the principals, the \nsuperintendents, the school boards, and the parents want them to be. We \nunderstand that is a major, major concern. We think part of it is \nbecause we don't have an adequate way of helping develop better \nteachers.\n  We have decided to have a new State teacher development grant \nprogram, with a substantially larger amount of money, about $2 billion \nfor fiscal year 2001, that focuses on the long term and sustained \ndevelopment of teachers, and includes professional development for \nadministrators and principals. There will be some who will come to the \nfloor and say right now that we don't have all this in one pot of \nmoney. We have some very special programs--one is the Eisenhower \nprogram--that we want to leave alone. Why do we want to leave them \nalone? Shouldn't we give the States an option to say they don't need \nall that preciseness, if they want to use it in their school districts \nin their State to produce long-term benefits by way of teachers being \nbetter equipped to teach their subject matter?\n  There is much more to say and I will have printed the 13 programs \nthat can be collapsed and made less than 13 in either the Straight A's \nor the performance partnership. I will include that list in the Record \nto be attached to my comments. Some of the attached lists are \ntechnical, but those in the education community who would be interested \nwill know what the programs are.\n  Let me summarize. For those on the other side of the aisle who want \nto talk about education as if we are debating the funding of public \nschools in America, let's put it back where it belongs. We are debating \nfunding 7 to 8 percent of the public education in America. That is all \nwe provide. One would not guess it from the rhetoric about what we \nought to get done with that 7 or 8 percent.\n  We will hear speeches that we ought to totally perfect the education \nsystem and take care of every child in America. What is the \nresponsibility for the 93 percent of the dollars that come from the \nState or the county? They are doing that with that money.\n  First, we will say, if you want to keep the system, keep it. It is \nalmost hard to understand how the other side and the President can get \nso worked up they won't pass this bill. Really, they could say to their \nconstituents, we are so sure our programs of the past are good, we will \nvote for this bill and you can choose to go with a program of the past. \nThe bill says that. If you want a program from the past, you can have \nit.\n  That is the debate. They want the programs of the past reiterated but \nwe say, no, no, let's give you that choice and give you a few other new \nchoices. The choices are exciting because we may find by entering into \na multiyear student achievement agreement  called accountability, where \nsome flexibility is provided, that 7 or 8 percent might make a \ndifference. It might be such that at the end of 5 years, using it that \nway by choice, you might really have an impact.\n\n  If we continue the way we are, we will produce a bill, or no bill, if \nthe President insists on getting what he wants. I have not argued 1 \nsecond today about who will put the money in the program. We are \nprobably going to put as much money in the program as the Democrats in \nthe appropriations process. We will fund at very close to the same \namount of dollars. Let's not get off on the side that the Republicans \ndon't want to pay for education. We want to try a different approach.\n  There are some who will say to be different we want to offer a whole \nbunch of amendments for the Federal Government to do new things. We \nwill tell them how to do things. We have been doing that and every 5 \nyears we have another list, but it is the Federal Government's list of \nhow to fix up our kids. However, if you look back, it isn't working. It \nis not the Federal dollar that is not working. We are just a little bit \nof the money. We ought to try to figure out how our little bit of the \nmoney can be the most helpful to those spending all the money--93 \npercent of the dollar in some cases. How can we help them do a better \njob? I think it is a shame if this bill and this concept gets defeated \nin the Senate because we don't want to try a new approach, or if we \nwant to add to it a variety of measures not relevant to this education \nbill.\n  These are issues that must be debated. Some Members want to put them \non this bill to either kill it or make us vote on issues not part of \nthis. Whoever does that, the final judgment will be simple. If you kill \nthis bill with this innovative approach of different items on the menu \nfor our schools in America's sovereign States, if you kill that either \nby nonperformance or an outright vote against it and kill it, you have \ndecided the Federal Government in all cases knows best and we ought to \ncontinue to tell our educators, superintendents, and commissioners of \neducation precisely how they can help\n\n[[Page S3246]]\n\ntheir children with our dollars. No more, no less; do it our way.\n  I frankly believe, although I hate to say this in political tones, I \nthink for the first time, in the case of this Senator--and I have been \nhere awhile--we can debate this any way we want. We won't lose this \ndebate. We win this, unless we let somebody pull the wool over our eyes \nabout what we are trying to do, what we have been doing and just how \nmuch of the Federal money is involved versus the State and cities that \nwe don't control-- States, counties and school boards. I think \neverybody will understand we ought to permit innovation, not rigidity \nby dictating specifically how moneys ought to be used.\n\n  That is a little lengthy for tonight. Some people know it is not so \nlengthy for me. But it is the second speech I made today. I spoke about \nnuclear power with as much energy and enthusiasm as I did on this bill.\n  I am saying, as I leave the floor of the Senate, there are some very \ngood Senators who will take over and I am satisfied will close out the \nday with some pretty good remarks about where we ought to be trying to \nmove in lockstep with those who really want to change education at the \nlocal level, instead of walking along, kicking at them, telling them do \nit our way. I think we ought to walk along in some sort of lockstep by \nletting them have some real choice.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from the great State of Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I hope the Senator from New Mexico knows we do not \nconsider that a terribly long speech.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the first four amendments in \norder to the bill be the following, and that they be first-degree \namendments, offered in alternating fashion, and subject to second-\ndegree perfecting amendments only, and that the second-degree \namendments be relevant to the first-degree.\n  The amendments are as follows: Gorton, technical, Straight A's; \nDaschle, alternative; Abraham-Mack, merit pay-teacher testing; and \nKennedy, teacher quality.\n  Both sides have agreed to this.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. What was the Kennedy amendment? I didn't hear the \ntitle.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Teacher quality.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from the State of Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, if there were a secret poll taken in this \nbody to determine an MVP, Most Valuable Player, my own suspicion is \nthat would be the Senator to whom my own vote would go, the senior \nSenator from New Mexico, who has just spoken to us with such eloquence. \nHe manages to work thoughtfully on the widest range of issues of any \nMember of this body that I know. The minute the debate on the budget \nresolution, with which he is charged, is over, he is on to another \nsubject, whether it is energy or national defense or education or \nSocial Security. It is a privilege to be his colleague. It is a \nprivilege to be his friend. It is also a little bit difficult at times \nbecause after his introduction to this bill, this Senator, even as an \nauthor of the bill, can do nothing to improve on the remarks of the \nSenator from New Mexico but maybe only to rephrase them slightly and \noffer his support for them.\n  I think what we gain from this debate, from what the Senator from New \nMexico has said, what we heard from the Senator from Georgia and the \nSenator from New Hampshire and others, is that there may not have been \nanother instance in the last half dozen years on any major subject--\nperhaps the Senator from New Mexico might agree with me, with perhaps \nthe exception of the debate on welfare reform--in which the old and the \nnew were so magnificently and so dramatically contrasted as are the \nnew, fresh ideas, fresh approaches to this problem outlined in this \nbill and outlined by its supporters as opposed to the passionate \ndefense of the status quo by so many on the other side.\n  The Senator presiding and the Senator from New Mexico will  remember \nthat was the essential division in the debate over welfare reform. We \nwere told of all of the disasters that would take place if we \ndramatically reformed our welfare system. Now, a few years later, no \none, for all practical purposes, can remember that he or she opposed \nthat reform; it has been so magnificently successful.\n\n  Mr. President, I predict the same fate for this debate if, in fact, \nwe are successful in carrying out the dramatic and innovative and \nconstructive changes that are included in this bill.\n  We have heard basically two arguments from the other side of the \naisle.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. GORTON. I will.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. As I indicated a while ago, I was planning to leave the \nfloor. But my friend caught my attention when he, it seemed to me, \nwanted me to stay around. I have been around long enough to hear his \nkind remarks about me, and I thank him. Before I make a speech as I did \ntonight, I do try to understand what I am talking about. Sometimes I go \nback to my office after hearing something down here, or watching it, \nand say, I'll wait a week and really know something about this. But I \nthink I do know something about this.\n  I was a teacher once. I can tell you things have changed very little. \nYou talk about the disparity in the preparation of children. The one \nyear I taught I had one class in mathematics. One half of the class \ncould not add or subtract, and the other half of the class was doing \nalgebra. This was a long time ago. I was 22 years old, so that is how \nlong ago. Sunday I will be 68. We still have the same thing. We have a \ndifficult job for teachers.\n  I think the Senator is correct. He is the one who offered the first \nbill to provide some choice instead of rigid, bound-up programs where, \ninstead of walking together, we were kicking them to do it our way or \nnot use our money. You were the starter, the charger of that, along \nwith Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee. A little bit of that expertise \ncame about by accident out of the Budget Committee, on which you both \nserve. We had a task force, the Senator may recall. We asked the GAO--a \nvery significant number of them worked with your staff and his staff on \nthe Budget Committee and told you about the programs that were out \nthere hanging around, but they wondered what they were doing. You \nprovide the first opportunity to pull some together and collapse the \nrigidity. Right?\n  Mr. GORTON. Does the Senator from New Mexico remember the dramatic \ntestimony that our Budget Committee task force took of the then-\nsuperintendant of public schools for Florida?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. GORTON. To the effect that he had almost four times as many \npeople in his office to manage the 8 or 10 percent of the money that \ncame in from the Federal Government than he did to manage the 90 \npercent-plus of the money that came from the State government for \neducation?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes. That is right.\n  Mr. GORTON. That was a dramatic learning experience for this Senator \nand I think for the Senator from New Mexico as well, and really \ncontributed magnificently to where we are today.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I can also remember when you first thought about this \nidea. We were walking down one of the halls here and you were saying \nyou didn't quite understand how you could get around all the opposition \nto trying something different. I think I pulled on your arm and said, \n``Why don't you give them the option to leave it like it is?''\n\n  You are pretty quick. You never asked me again. But that has become \nthe cornerstone, from your bill to this bill. For those who think what \nwe are doing is really good and really right, that we are not trying to \ntake it away. Right? Those people who say that is not enough, what must \nthey be saying?\n  Mr. GORTON. They are saying, essentially--and we have heard it on the \nfloor of the Senate in the last hour--that we cannot trust the school \nauthorities in any State in the United States of America, or any school \ndistrict in any one of those States, to make these decisions on their \nown without guidance from this body acting as a sort of supernational \nschool board.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Right.\n  Mr. GORTON. When it gets right down to it, that is what their \nposition amounts to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Or they could be saying that if you give them the \nchoice,\n\n[[Page S3247]]\n\nthey will all take what the Republicans are offering here today.\n  Frankly, that is thought by some to be a very good argument against \nthe bill, right? I think it is a very good argument in favor of it, I \nwould think, if what we are doing is so good that under all \ncircumstances a significant portion of the school districts and \nsuperintendents and commissioners of education would go down the same \npath for another 5 years.\n  Mr. GORTON. This Senator, for example, believes that if there is a \nshortcoming in this bill, it is that Straight A's is limited to 15 \nStates only and not all the States in the country.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank my friend from New Mexico. I will go back to what \nI see as two distinct currents of criticism from the other side.\n  The first of those is that if we have not reached the goals they set \n35 years ago, 30 years ago, 20 years ago, 10 years ago, 5 years ago, we \nstill have to keep running up against that same wall, and the reason we \nhave not succeeded is that we have not imposed enough rules and \nregulations on schools all across the United States. So what we really \nneed to do--they call it accountability--is to impose more rules and \nregulations on States and on school districts and on principals and \nteachers all across the United States to make sure they do exactly what \nwe tell them to do.\n  I strongly suspect that any alternative they come up with will \ninclude dozens, if not hundreds, of additional rules and regulations to \nbe imposed on our school districts.\n  There is a second element, a second part of their proposal, and that \nis if 12, 16, 74, 276 Federal education programs have not really done \nwhat they ought to have done, we need another half dozen programs. \nAgain, in the last hour or so, we have heard of some new ways, some new \nFederal programs which we ought to authorize and on which we ought to \nspend money.\n  They make that proposition in spite of the dramatic point made by my \nfriend from New Mexico that the most prescriptive of all of the Federal \nprograms--the education for disabled act, the special education \nprovisions--required us as long as almost 30 years ago to come up with \n40 percent of the money. It is only in the last couple of years, with \nthe efforts of Members on this side of the aisle, that it has cracked \ntwo digits and has reached 11 percent.\n  Instead of saying why don't we properly fund what we promised to fund \nin programs that carry with it a tremendous number of rules and \nregulations, why don't we do that? No, no, let's think of half a dozen \nnew programs and let's not abolish any.\n  Now that I think of that last statement, I guess I have to amend it. \nThey do want to abolish one, or at least the President wants to abolish \none. He wants us to appropriate no money at all to the sole program in \nthe present education bill which allows the States to spend the money \non their own priorities without any controls from the Federal \nGovernment. It is a very modest part of our present education system--a \nvery modest part. That is the only one the administration, and I \nsuspect the other side, would just as soon abandon.\n  We, on the other hand, as the Senator from New Mexico points out, do \nnot even go so far as to say we know everything, nothing is right with \nthe present system, no one should be allowed to use it under any \ncircumstances. Running from top to bottom through the proposal we have \nbefore this body right now is the right of any State's educational \nauthorities who believe the present system is the best we can come up \nwith to continue to follow it, to continue to use it, to continue to \nfile all of the forms and abide by all of the rules and regulations of \nthe present system.\n  All we are saying, modestly in some respects but I think quite \ndramatically in other respects, is that you are going to have a choice, \neducation commissioners of the 50 States and, in many cases, the school \ndistricts of the several States; you can try a dramatic new system \ncalled Straight A's, or 15 of you--and I am very sorry it is only 15--\ncan try a dramatic new program called Straight A's under which a dozen \nor a baker's dozen of the present education programs can be collapsed \ninto a single program, rules and regulations thrown out, forms tossed, \nadministrators turned into teachers, as long as you make a legal \ncommitment to one single goal: The kids in your State will get a better \neducation and you will prove it by achievement tests that you design \nand that you agree will show that improvement over a period of 3 to 5 \nyears.\n\n  Accountability under the present system means you have filled out all \nthe forms correctly, you have made absolutely certain that you have not \nspent a dollar that we have said ought to be spent on one purpose for \nanother education purpose or for another student, no matter how well, \nhow validly you have spent that dollar.\n  Accountability under our system means our kids are better educated, \nthey are better fitted to deal with the world in the 21st century.\n  In describing that choice under Straight A's, my friend from New \nMexico omitted only one element, but it is an important element. That \nelement is that as against the form of accountability the other side \nwishes, punishment--you are going to lose your money; you are going to \nlose your ability to make your own choices; you are going to be fined; \nor you are going to get a bad audit--we offer a carrot. We say that if \nafter 35 years in which we have failed to close the gap between \nunderprivileged students who are entitled to title I support and the \nother more privileged students, if you close that gap by raising the \nachievement of the underprivileged students, you will get more money; \nyou will get a reward; you will get a bonus.\n  They never thought of that in connection with the present program. We \ndo. We do have to supply some discipline, some loss of ability to make \nyour own choices for States that are miserable failures, but we think \nit every bit as important, perhaps more important, to provide a reward \nfor those systems that do the job right.\n  I must confess that I have a reservation about our own proposal in \nthis connection. We are demanding a great deal because we are demanding \nthat States, in order to get Straight A's, agree to a contract under \nwhich the performance of their students will improve, and they sign \nthat contract in order to get control over 5 or 6 or 7 percent of the \nmoney they are going to spend on their students, the really modest \ncontribution made by the Federal Government.\n  I would feel a lot more comfortable in the form of accountability we \nhave designed ourselves if the demands we make were more directly \nproportional to the amount of money we are putting into the system. \nEven so, I believe there are a minimum of 15 States that will jump at \nthis opportunity to get the Federal bureaucrats off their backs and to \nsay, as we are saying here: Let the decision about what is best for the \neducation of our students be made, by and large, by the people who know \ntheir names--the parents, teachers, and principals, and above them, \ntheir superintendents and their elected school board members. Let's no \nlonger claim that we in Congress, that people downtown in the \nDepartment of Education know all of the answers, and that one set of \nanswers fits every school district, no matter how rural or how urban, \nno matter west or east or north or south in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  This bill goes beyond just Straight A's for 15 States. It has, as the \nSenator from New Mexico described, performance partnership agreements, \na modified form of Straight A's, a form that still retains some of the \nrules and regulations, more than I would like, but also provides a far \ngreater degree of choice and policy-setting authority to our local \nschool boards and to our States and does have two great advantages:  \nOne, it is strongly supported by the Governors--Republicans and \nDemocrats--and, two, it is applicable to all of the States.\n\n  So, even at that level, some States will get three choices, and all \nwill get two: Straight A's, performance partnership agreements, or the \npresent system.\n  Beyond that, our proposal includes the Teacher Empowerment Act, which \ngives much more flexibility to the way in which we compensate our \nteachers, train our teachers, and determine what the requirements for \nthose teachers are, and a very real degree of choice\n\n[[Page S3248]]\n\nwith respect to title I, especially for failing schools, where instead \nof saying that title I is focused on schools and on systems, we will \nsay, again, for those States and for those communities that wish to do \nso, title I will be focused on the individual students who are \neligible, the underprivileged students who are eligible, so that they, \nand not the systems and not particular schools, will be the goals of \ntitle I.\n  Has the present title I been so successful that it cannot stand a \nchange, even a change that offers an option to States and to individual \nschool districts? That is what we hear from the other side of the \naisle, that it would be terrible. We have 35-year-old reports cited \nconcerning things that happened two generations ago as an argument \nagainst any kind of innovation today and as an argument for maintaining \na system that, bluntly, has not worked, that has not worked at all.\n  At its most fundamental level, this is a debate about who knows best \nand who cares most: Members of this body and people working in the \nbowels of the Department of Education in Washington, DC, or those men \nand women all across the United States of America who are concerned \nabout the future of their children, those men and women all across the \nUnited States of America who have dedicated their entire professional \nlives to providing that education for our children--their teachers and \ntheir principals and their superintendents--and those men and women \nacross America who, in almost every case without compensation, have \nentered the political arena and have run for and have been elected to \nschool boards in their various communities.\n  Our opponents of this bill say that none of these people should be \ntrusted; only we should be trusted. We say we want to repose far more \ntrust and confidence in those individuals all across the United States \nof America, we want to hold them accountable, but we want to hold them \naccountable on the basis of their results, and their results only.\n  That is what the debate will be about for the balance of this week \nand perhaps next week, as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/02/senate-section/article/S3248-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. GORTON.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a great \nAmerican, Ming Chen Hsu. Last December, Ms. Hsu retired from the \nFederal Maritime Commission (FMC), where she served as a Commissioner \nfor nine and one-half years. Ms. Hsu was first appointed to the \nCommission by President George Bush and confirmed by the Senate in \n1990. She was reappointed and reconfirmed in October, 1991.\n  Many of my colleagues may not realize it, but the ocean shipping \nsystem is vital to international trade and is the underpinning for the \ninternational trade on which the vitality of our Nation's economy \ndepends. A fair and open maritime transportation system creates \nbusiness opportunities for U.S. shipping companies and provides more \nfavorable transportation conditions for U.S. imports and exports. \nEnsuring a fair, open, competitive and efficient ocean transportation \nsystem is the mission of the FMC. The Commission has a number of \nimportant responsibilities under the shipping laws of the United \nStates, including: the responsibility to ensure just and reasonable \npractices by the ocean common carriers, marine terminal operators, \nconferences, ports and ocean transportation intermediaries operating in \nthe U.S. foreign commerce; monitor and address the laws and practices \nof foreign governments which could have a discriminatory or adverse \nimpact on shipping conditions in the U.S. trades; and enforce special \nregulatory requirements applicable to carriers owned or controlled by \nforeign governments.\n  Mr. President, for almost a decade, Ms. Hsu played an active and \nimportant role in the life and decisions of the Commission. The \nCommission and the Nation have been fortunate in her service. During \nher tenure, Ms. Hsu's experience and judgment helped guide the \nCommission through a number of challenges and actions which will \ncontinue to shape the work of the Commission long after her retirement.\n  In 1998, the Congress passed and the President signed the Ocean \nShipping Reform Act (OSRA), which amended the Shipping Act of 1984, the \nprimary shipping statute administered by the FMC. As I have said \nbefore, the OSRA signaled a paradigm shift in the conduct of the ocean \nliner business and its regulation by the FMC. Where ocean carrier \npricing and service options were diluted by the conference system and \n``me too'' requirements, an unprecedented degree of flexibility and \nchoice will result. Where agency oversight once focused on using rigid \nsystems of tariff and contract filing to scrutinize individual \ntransactions, the ``big picture'' of ensuring the existence of \ncompetitive liner service by a healthy ocean carrier industry to \nfacilitate fair and open commerce among our trading partners will \nbecome the oversight priority. This week marks the one-year anniversary \nof the implementation of the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998. It is \nmost fitting that we take the time to remember the career of Ming Chen \nHsu this week.\n  Mr. President, Ms. Hsu clearly recognized the important change in the \nbusiness and regulation by the FMC of ocean shipping brought about by \nthe Ocean Shipping Reform Act. During the Commission's consideration of \nregulations to implement OSRA, Ms. Hsu played a critical role in \nworking with the other Commissioners and FMC staff to ensure that the \nregulations embodied the spirit of the new law. As she told a large \ngathering of shippers and industry representatives, ``This has been not \nonly a long journey, but a long needed journey * * * With the passage \nof the Ocean Shipping Reform Act and the FMC's new regulations, I \nbelieve the maritime industry will be far less shackled by burdensome \nand needless regulations * * * I believe we can now look forward to an \nenvironment which gives you the freedom and flexibility to develop \ninnovative solutions to your ever-changing ocean transportation \nneeds.''\n\n  Ms. Hsu's wisdom and experience was also instrumental in helping the \nCommission navigate one the Commission's most difficult and highly-\npublicized actions in recent years. In 1998, the Commission took action \nagainst a series of restrictive port conditions in Japan. As a result \nof these conditions, both U.S. carriers and U.S. trade were burdened \nwith unreasonably high costs and inefficiencies. Because of the \nCommission's action, steps were taken by Japan to initiate improvements \nto its port system. If ultimately realized, these improvements will \nsubstantially facilitate and benefit the ocean trade of both nations.\n  Mr. President, during her career at the Commission, Ms. Hsu led a \nnumber of Commission initiatives. Among others, in 1992 Ms. Hsu served \nat the request of then FMC Chairman Christopher Koch as Investigative \nOfficer for the Commission's Fact Finding 20. Under her leadership, the \nFact Finding held numerous hearings across the United States in an \neffort to examine and understand the experience of shippers \nassociations and transportation intermediaries under the Shipping Act \nof 1984. Fact Finding 20 ultimately led to Commission efforts to ensure \nthat shippers associations and transportation intermediaries received \nall of the benefits intended by Congress in enacting the 1984 Act.\n  Commissioner Hsu's service at the Federal Maritime Commission is just \nthe most recent milestone in a remarkable life and career. A \nnaturalized U.S. citizen, Ming Chen Hsu came as a student to the United \nStates from her native Beijing, China. Prior to coming to the \nCommission, Ms. Hsu has had an extensive career in international trade \nand commerce in both the public and private sectors. She was a Vice \nPresident for International Trade for the RCA Corporation in New York, \nwhere she held a variety of executive positions in the areas of \ninternational marketing and planning. She played a pivotal role in \ngaining market access for RCA in China in the 1970's. She was appointed \nby former Governor Thomas H. Kean of New Jersey as Special Trade \nRepresentative and as Director of the State's Division of International \nTrade, a position she held from 1982 to 1990. In her positions with RCA \nand the\n\n[[Page S3249]]\n\nstate of New Jersey, Ms. Hsu led over thirty trade missions to \ncountries throughout the world.\n  Mr. President, Ms. Hsu has served on several U.S. Federal advisory \ncommittees, having been appointed by the President, the Secretary of \nDefense, the Secretary of Commerce and the U.S. Trade Representative. \nShe is a recipient of numerous awards including the Medal of Freedom \nand the Eisenhower Award for Meritorious Service. She is listed in \nWho's Who of America. Ms. Hsu is a founding member and director of the \nCommittee of 100, an organization of prominent Chinese Americans and is \na member of the National Committee on United States-China Relations. \nShe also serves on the National Advisory Forum to the U.S. Holocaust \nMemorial.\n  Ms. Hsu is a Summa Cum Laude graduate of George Washington University \nand member of Phi Beta Kappa. At New York University, she was a \nPenfield Fellow for International Law. Ms. Hsu was the recipient of the \nGeorge Washington Alumni Achievement Award in 1983 and holds several \nhonorary degrees.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate Ming Chen Hsu on her exemplary career \nat the Federal Maritime Commission and salute her contributions to the \nocean transportation industry. I add my voice to those who say ``thank \nyou'' for her service to the Nation. And finally, I wish her smooth \nsailing in her future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/02/senate-section/article/S3249-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3249-S3251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   IMPORTANCE OF PRIVATE PROSECUTIONS\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, last week, during the debate on a \nproposed constitutional amendment to protect the rights of crime \nvictims, Senator Leahy made several lengthy statements challenging some \nof the facts set forth by supporters of the amendment, including \nmyself. We responded to many of those arguments at the time--and, I \nbelieve, refuted them. I do want not burden the record now by repeating \nall our contentions or making new ones.\n  However, there is one argument that the Senator from Vermont made \nduring the waning hours of debate on the amendment that I find \nparticularly troubling. It involves the role of victims in criminal \nproceedings at the time our Constitution was written. Because I believe \nthe Senator's comments contradict the clear weight of American history, \nI feel compelled to respond.\n  Here is the argument Senator Leahy disputes: At the time the \nConstitution was written, the bulk of prosecutions were by private \nindividuals. Typically, a crime was committed and then the victim \ninitiated and then pursued that criminal case. Because victims were \nparties to most criminal cases, they enjoyed the basic rights to \nnotice, to be present, and to be heard under regular court rules. Given \nthe fact that victims already had basic rights in criminal proceedings, \nit is perhaps understandable that the Framers of our Constitution did \nnot think to provide victims with protection in our national charter.\n  The Senator from Vermont tried to rebut this argument. Citing an \nencyclopedia article and a couple of law review articles, he claimed \nthat, by the time of the Constitutional Convention, public prosecution \nwas ``standard'' and private prosecution had largely disappeared.\n  Because Senator Leahy's comments suggest that some confusion about \nthis issue lingers among my colleagues, I would now like to provide \nsome additional evidence demonstrating that private prosecutions had \nnot only not largely disappeared in the late 18th century but in fact \nwere the norm.\n  First, it is important to concede one point: some public prosecutors \ndid exist at the time of the framing of the Constitution. Certainly, by \nthen, the office of public prosecutor had been established in some of \nthe colonies--such as Connecticut, Vermont, and Virginia. But just \nbecause some public prosecutors existed in the late 18th century does \nnot mean that they played a major role or that public prosecution had \nsupplanted private prosecution. In fact, criminal prosecution in 18th \ncentury English and colonial courts consisted primarily of private \nsuits by victims. Such prosecutions continued in many States throughout \nmuch of the 19th century.\n  Thus, contrary to Senator Leahy's suggestion that a ``system of \npublic prosecutions'' was ``standard'' at the time of the framing of \nthe Constitution, the evidence is clear that private individuals--\nvictims--initiated and pursued the bulk of prosecutions before, during, \nand for some time after the Constitution Convention.\n  Let's look, for example, at the research of one scholar, Professor \nAllen Steinberg, who spent a decade sifting through dusty criminal \ncourt records in Philadelphia and wrote a book about his findings. \nBased on a detailed review of court docket books and other evidence, \nProfessor Steinberg determined that private prosecutions continued in \nthat city through most of the 19th century.\n\n  In Professor Steinberg's words, by the mid-19th Century, ``private \nprosecution had become central to the city's system of criminal law \nenforcement, so entrenched that it would prove difficult to dislodge. . \n. .''\n  Of course, Philadelphia was the city where the Constitution was \ndebated, drafted, and adopted. And for decades it was our new nation's \nmost populous city--and its cultural and legal capital as well.\n  It is difficult to reconcile the assertion that a ``system of public \nprosecutions'' was ``standard'' at the time of the Constitution \nConvention with historical research showing that, in the same city \nwhere the Convention was held, private prosecutions--inherited from \nEnglish common law--continued to be ``standard'' through the mid-19th \ncentury.\n  It is not surprising that the Senator from Vermont would conclude \nthat public prosecution had replaced private prosecution by the late \n18th century. A cursory exam of historical documents might lead to such \na conclusion, for the simple reason that documents regarding public \nprosecutors and public prosecutions (what few there were) are easier to \nfind than documents regarding private prosecutions. As Stephanie Dangel \nhas explained in the Yale Law Journal:\n\n       [e]arly studies concentrating on legislation naturally \n     over-emphasized the importance of the public prosecutor, \n     since a private prosecution system inherited from the common \n     law would not appear in legislation. Examinations of \n     prosecutorial practice were cursory and thus skewed. The most \n     readily accessible information relating to criminal \n     prosecutions predictably concerned the exceptional, well \n     publicized cases involving public prosecutors, not the vast \n     majority of mundane cases, involving scant paperwork and \n     handled through the simple procedures of private prosecution \n     . . .\n\n  Dangel has summed up recent historical research into the nature of \nprosecution in the decades leading up to the framing of the \nConstitution as follows:\n\n       First, private individuals, not government officials, \n     conducted the bulk of prosecution. Second, the primary work \n     of attorneys general and district attorneys consisted on non-\n     prosecutorial duties, with their prosecutorial discretion \n     limited to ending, rather than initiating or conducting, \n     prosecutions.\n\n  Regarding the prevalence of private prosecution in the colonies, \nDangel noted:\n\n       Seventeenth and eighteenth century English common law \n     viewed a crime as a wrong inflicted upon the victims not as \n     an act against the state. An aggrieved victim, or interested \n     party, would initiate prosecution. After investigation and \n     approval by a justice of the peace and grand jury, a private \n     individual would conduct the prosecution, sometimes with the \n     assistance of counsel. . . . Private parties retained \n     ultimate control, often settling even after grand juries \n     returned indictments. Contemporaneous sources confirm the \n     relative insignificance of public prosecutions in the \n     colonial criminal system. Only five of the first thirteen \n     constitutions mention a state attorney general, and only \n     Connecticut mentions the local prosecutor. Secondary \n     references are similarly rare. Finally, the earliest judicial \n     decision voicing disapproval of private prosecution did not \n     appear until 1849. No decision affirming public prosecutors' \n     virtually unreviewable discretion appeared before 1883.\n\n  The historical evidence is clear: Because victims were parties to \nmost criminal prosecutions in the late 18th century, they had basic \nrights to notice, to be present, and to participate in the proceedings \nunder regular court rules. Today, victims are not parties to criminal \nprosecutions, and they are often denied these basic rights. Thus, a \nconstitutional victims' rights amendment would restore some of the \nrights that victims enjoyed at the time the Framers drafted the \nConstitution and Bill of Rights.\n  If this historical evidence about prosecutions in the colonies is not \nenough, I would repeat a point Senator Leahy\n\n[[Page S3250]]\n\nmade himself last week: that in England, any crime victim had the right \nto initiate and conduct criminal proceedings all the way up to the \nmiddle of the 19th century. As we know from Senator Byrd's enlightening \nremarks last week, many of the rights and liberties of our \nConstitution--such as those for criminal defendants--have their roots \nin English history and the English constitution.\n  Given the fact, then, that virtually all the protections for criminal \ndefendants in the Bill of Rights have English antecedents--including \nhabeas corpus, trial by jury, due process, prohibition against \nexcessive fines, and so on--it is hardly a stretch to think that the \nlack of rights for crime victims in the Bill of Rights would reflect an \nEnglish antecedent as well: the long-established right of victims to \nprosecute crimes themselves.\n  Let me be clear: I do not support a return to the old system of \nprivate prosecution. My only point is that we can cogently explain why \nthe Framers did not include a single word on behalf of crime victims in \nthe Constitution. And, given the relatively recent development in the \nUnited States of a system of 100% public prosecution, we can offer \nstrong reasons to restore basic rights for victims in our criminal \njustice system.\n  Just so there is no more confusion on this point, let us return to \nProfessor Allen Steinberg, a legal historian who researched and wrote a \n326-page book on prosecutions in 19th century Philadelphia--the most \nin-depth study of private prosecution in the United States.\n  Did Professor Steinberg find that public prosecution was ``standard'' \nin Philadelphia even decades after the Constitution and Bill of Rights \nwere adopted, as Senator Leahy suggests? No. In fact, he found that \nvictims directly prosecuted crimes in Philadelphia until at least 1875.\n  The fact that Professor Steinberg's research is on Philadelphia is \nundeniably important. Not only did the Framers live in Philadelphia \nwhile debating and drafting the Constitution, but many had resided \nthere earlier as well.\n  For example, James Madison--sometimes called the Father of our \nConstitution--was not only a delegate at the Philadelphia Convention, \nhe served in the Continental Congress in Philadelphia from March 1780 \nthrough December 1783. I have little doubt that Madison knew that the \nbulk of criminal prosecutions in Philadelphia consisted of private \nprosecutions. Here is what Professor Steinberg writes about private \nprosecutions in Philadelphia:\n\n       [T]he criminal law did have a central place in the everyday \n     social life of mid-nineteenth-century Philadelphia. Private \n     prosecution--one citizen taking another to court without the \n     intervention of the police--was the basis of law enforcement \n     in Philadelphia and an anchor of its legal culture, and this \n     had been so since colonial times . . . Well past mid-\n     century, private prosecution remained popular among a \n     broad spectrum of ordinary Philadelphians. Familiar and \n     frequent, it was rooted in a complex political and legal \n     structure that linked political parties, courthouses, \n     saloons and other centers of popular culture, real crime \n     and dangerous disorder, and ordinary disputes and \n     transgressions of everyday life . . . Through the process \n     of private prosecution, the criminal courts of \n     Philadelphia developed a distinctive set of practices and \n     a culture that was remarkably resilient in the face of \n     constant official hostility and massive social change. . . \n     .\n\n  He continues:\n\n       Private prosecution refers to the system by which private \n     citizens brought criminal cases to the attention of court \n     officials, initiated the process of prosecution, and retained \n     considerable control over the ultimate disposition of cases--\n     especially when compared with the two main executive \n     authorities of criminal justice, the police and the public \n     prosecutor . . . Private prosecution . . . [was] firmly \n     rooted in Philadelphia's colonial past. [It was an] example[] \n     of the creative American adaptation of the English common \n     law. By the seventeenth century, private prosecution was a \n     fundamental part of English common law. Most criminal cases \n     in England proceeded under the control of a private \n     prosecutor, usually a relatively elite person, and often \n     through a private society established for that purpose.\n\n  Professor Steinberg concludes that before the second half of the 19th \nCentury, private prosecutions were the ``dominant'' mode of criminal \njustice in Philadelphia. He explains how this system worked:\n\n       When a person wanted to initiate a criminal prosecution, he \n     or she went off to the nearest alderman's office, complained, \n     and usually secured a warrant for the arrest of the accused. \n     After the alderman's constable escorted the defendant to the \n     office, the alderman conducted a formal hearing, and the \n     process was underway. Most often, private prosecutors charged \n     their adversaries with assault and battery, larceny, or some \n     form of disorderly conduct. Well before 1850, aldermen and \n     litigants established patterns of case disposition that would \n     last through most of the century. Most criminal cases were \n     fully disposed of by the alderman . . .\n\n  Professor Steinberg also notes that:\n\n     [m]uch of the time, people used the criminal law in their \n     private affairs in order to combat a perceived injustice or \n     to assert basic rights they felt were violated. There was no \n     better example of this than battered wives. Women regularly \n     brought charges against men for assault . . .. Most often, . \n     . . the batterer was punished in some manner . . . .\n\n  And what of the public prosecutor? Contrary to Senator Leahy's \nsuggestion that public prosecutors had consolidated control over \nprosecutions by the late 18th century, Professor Steinberg found that--\neven by the mid-19th Century--the Philadelphia public prosecutor did \nlittle more than act as a clerk to victims who were pursuing private \nprosecutions. Here is what Professor Steinberg found:\n\n       One of the major reasons for the weakness of the court \n     officials was the limited power of the public prosecutor. \n     Most discretion was exercised by the magistrates and private \n     parties, some by the grand and petit juries, and little by \n     anyone else. As late as the mid-1860s, for example, jurists \n     agreed that, despite their importance on the streets, the \n     police had no role in ordinary criminal procedure. More \n     importantly, the same was basically true for the district \n     attorney. In an 1863 outline of criminal procedure, Judge \n     Joseph Allison did not mention the police and gave no \n     discretionary role to the district attorney in the ``usual \n     and ordinary mode of procedure.'' . . . . The discretion of \n     the private parties in criminal cases was not checked by \n     the public prosecutor. Instead, the public prosecutor in \n     most cases adopted a stance of passive neutrality. He was \n     essentially a clerk, organizing the court calendar and \n     presenting cases to grand and petit juries. Most of the \n     time, he was either superseded by a private attorney or \n     simply let the private prosecutor and his witnesses take \n     the stand and state their case.\n\n  And the dominance of private prosecutions was certainly not unique to \nPhiladelphia. Other legal historians who have sifted through court \nrecords have reached similar conclusions to Professor Steinberg.\n  In a 1995 article in the American Journal of Legal History, for \nexample, Robert Ireland concluded that ``By 1820 most states had \nestablished local public prosecutors. . . . Yet, because of \ndeficiencies in the office of public prosecutor, privately funded \nprosecutors constituted a significant element of the state criminal \njustice system throughout the nineteenth century.''\n  In a 1967 article in the New York University Law Review, William E. \nNelson found that private prosecution was commonplace in a typical \nMassachusetts county between 1760 and 1810. Criminal trials, he writes, \nwere ``in reality contests between subjects rather than contests \nbetween government and subject.''\n  And the list goes on: other scholars who have acknowledged the \nprevalence of private prosecution in the American colonies and \nfledgling United States include Richard Gasjins (Connecticut), Michael \nS. Hindus (Massachusetts and South Carolina), William M. Lloyd, Jr. \n(Pennsylvania), and Edwin Surrency (Philadelphia). Indeed, William F. \nMcDonald notes in the American Criminal Law Review that a system of \nprivate prosecution was preferred by many around the time of the \nAmerican Revolution because of a fear of tyranny associated with \ngovernment prosecutors and because it was less expensive.\n  In the face of this overwhelming historical evidence that the bulk of \nprosecutions at the time of the Constitutional Convention were private, \nthe Senator from Vermont suggested instead that public prosecutions \nwere ``standard.'' He relied on several sources for that conclusion: a \nfour-page article in a legal encyclopedia and a few law review article \nquotes, one lacking citation and the rest citing the same four-page \nencyclopedia article.\n  Of particular importance seems to be a quotation from an article in \nthe Rutgers Law Review that asserted that ``[b]y the time of the \nRevolution, public prosecution in America was standard, and private \nprosecution, in effect, was gone.'' But reading closer, one finds that \nthe support for this statement was none other than a statement in the \noft-cited four-page encyclopedia\n\n[[Page S3251]]\n\narticle that ``by the time of the American Revolution, each colony had \nestablished some form of public prosecution. . . .''\n  Again, however, we have seen that the mere existence of ``some form \nof public prosecution'' at the time of the American Revolution does not \nmean that public prosecution was ``standard.'' And it certainly does \nnot mean that public prosecutors handled the bulk of prosecutions or \nhad much a prosecutorial role. They did not. Rather, the weight of \nhistorical evidence on this subject--a subject which has been \nextensively researched and reviewed by some of our country's most \ndistinguished legal historians and other scholars--suggests that \nprivate prosecutions were dominant.\n  Mr. President, I am glad to have the chance to correct the historical \nrecord on this point. I have the utmost respect for my distinguished \ncolleague from Vermont and I thank him for his thoughtful remarks on \nthe history of prosecution in this country. However, I believe that my \nmain point stands: we need to restore rights that crime victims enjoyed \nat the time the Framers drafted the Constitution and Bill of Rights.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/02/senate-section/article/S3251-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           IN RECOGNITION OF NATIONAL NEUROFIBROMATOSIS MONTH\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT.

Mr. President, during the debate last week on the proposed \nconstitutional amendment on victims' rights, a number of editorials and \nthoughtful essays were printed in the Record. Because of the way in \nwhich the Senate ended its consideration of S.J. Res. 3, I did not have \nan opportunity to include in the Record all such materials. \nAccordingly, I included additional materials yesterday and do so again \ntoday, in order to help complete the historical record of the debate. I \nask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record editorials from a \nnumber of sources around the country in opposition to the proposed \namendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Philadelphia Inquirer, Apr. 22, 2000]\n\n                             Misguided Bill\n\n       Crime victims need justice and compassion, not the ability \n     to usurp the rights of others.\n       If ever there was a likely booster for the cause of \n     empowering crime victims, it's Bud Welch of Oklahoma City.\n       After his 23-year-old daughter, Julie, perished in the 1995 \n     federal building bombing there, Mr. Welch recalls wanting to \n     see the co-conspirators ``fried'' rather than tried in court.\n       But the latest push in Congress to enshrine a victims' bill \n     of rights in the U.S. Constitution does not enjoy Bud Welch's \n     support. Nor does it have the backing of numerous groups \n     equally as concerned as Mr. Welch with seeking justice for \n     victims.\n       The amendment's opponents include advocates for battered \n     women, the families of murder victims--plus the nation's top \n     state judges, civil-rights groups and veteran prosecutors.\n       All of them, whether knowingly or not, are heeding James \n     Madison's wise directive that the Constitution be amended \n     only on ``great and extraordinary occasions.''\n       This isn't one of those occasions.\n       These groups understand that the proposals before Congress \n     would completely restructure federal and state criminal \n     justice systems. As such, the victims' rights measure is \n     dangerous to fundamental rights that protect all Americans. \n     In the Oklahoma case that Mr. Welch knows so well, he cites \n     the plea bargain that led to key testimony by an accomplice \n     of Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols.\n       Had victims been able to contest that plea--as provided by \n     the rights proposals in Congress--the case might have been \n     more difficult to prosecute or might even have unraveled.\n       That's just a hint of the practical problems in according \n     crime victims such rights as court-appointed counsel, a say \n     in prosecution decisions, and the like. How could anyone \n     think things are working so well in the nation's clogged \n     criminal courts that they could handle this wrench tossed \n     into the works?\n       There's a more fundamental problem, through, with giving \n     crime victims a virtual place at the prosecutors's table.\n       It presumes the guilt of a person charged with a crime \n     before the courts have spoken. With that, out the courtroom \n     window goes a fair trail--and in comes a threat to all \n     Americans' rights.\n       What crime victims are owed is compassion, the chance to \n     seek compensation, consideration of the demands a trial \n     places on their time and psyches, and a full measure of \n     justice. That's the intent of victims' rights provisions \n     already enshrined in law or state constitutions by all 50 \n     states.\n       For instance, the Pennsylvania statute provides for \n     notifying victims of court proceedings, allowing them to \n     comment on--but not to veto--plea bargains, the right to seek \n     restitution, and notification of post-conviction appeals and \n     even convicts' escapes. These are good ideas that don't \n     deprive rights.\n       Shame on Congress if it seriously considers a measure that \n     could jeopardize the right to a fair trial. Ditto if the \n     victims' rights cause is turned into just another cynical \n     vehicle to make political hay--like the flag-burning \n     nonsense.\n       The region's senators should not be party to that--no \n     matter what their party.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Providence Journal, Apr. 27, 2000]\n\n                         The Quality of Justice\n\n       Bud Welch, whose daughter Julie was one of the 168 victims \n     of the bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma \n     City five years ago, testified before the U.S. Senate \n     Judiciary Committee against the proposed Victims' Rights \n     Amendment to the Constitution. ``I was angry after she was \n     killed that I wanted McVeigh and Nichols killed without a \n     trial. I probably would have done it myself if I could have. \n     I consider that I was in a state of temporary insanity \n     immediately after her death. It is because I was so crazy \n     with grief that I oppose the Victims' Rights Amendment.''\n       Mr. Welch is right. Giving the victims of crime the \n     constitutional right to influence bail decisions and plea \n     agreements would turn the principle of innocent until proven \n     guilty, the foundation of the American system of justice \n     embodied in our Bill of Rights, on its head. Other countries, \n     notably France, are still striving to incorporate this \n     principle into their legal codes. It would come as a shock to \n     see the United States move away from it, a move that would be \n     rightly perceived as a step backward into law's dark, \n     despotic past--the days of an eye for an eye and a tooth for \n     a tooth.\n       If that seems a hard indictment of an amendment that sounds \n     so eminently reasonable and fair, consider the provision \n     granting victims the right to a trial ``free of unreasonable \n     delay.'' The very phrase should send chills down the spine. \n     One person's ``expedited'' trial is another's ``legal \n     lynching,'' to borrow Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas' \n     phrase. And, like most amendments to the Constitution, there \n     is no telling where this amendment would lead. Would an \n     assault against a Ku Klux Klan member marching with thousands \n     of co-bigots mean that the state has to notify and consult \n     with every racist marcher ``victim'' in prosecuting the \n     criminal?\n       The United States is a country that abhors the miscarriage \n     of justice. It is, or should be, the key element of our \n     national character. No one would contend that it is good that \n     victims sometimes suffer further in the administration of \n     justice, and proponents of this amendment, such as Mothers \n     Against Drunk Driving, fight a noble cause in trying to \n     protect the rights of victims in the justice system. But \n     amendment the Constitution is not the way to do it. Victims' \n     rights laws are on the books in 35 states, including Rhode \n     Island. Strengthen and enforce these laws. That is the way to \n     ensure all Americans, victims and accused, have a fair trial.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From the Richmond Times-Dispatch, Apr. 16, 2000]\n\n                          Differently Situated\n\n       Complaints about partisan rancor in Congress are \n     commonplace. But sometimes it's even worse when Republicans \n     and Democrats agree.\n       Take the resolution sponsored by Republican Senator John \n     Kyl and Democrat\n\n[[Page S3252]]\n\n     Dianne Feinstein. It proposes a victims' rights amendment to \n     the Constitution guaranteeing a right to be notified of, \n     attend, and testify at the defendant's trial. Thirty-three \n     states already codify such protections, and there is little \n     wrong with them. But an amendment would sully the \n     Constitution with (to borrow a turn of phrase) a new indoor \n     record for missing the point.\n       At a recent news conference supporting the proposed \n     amendment, Mothers Against Drunk Driving president Millie \n     Webb said, ``Many Americans don't realize that victims have \n     no guaranteed rights under our current law,'' whereas ``the \n     system caters to the rights of defendants.'' Such \n     statements--with which many Americans, including 41 Senate \n     co-sponsors of the Kyl-Feinstein resolution, would agree--\n     reflect a cavernous lack of understanding regarding the \n     machinery of justice in America.\n       That machinery exists for the very purpose of defending \n     rights, such as the right to physical safety and the right to \n     property. Legislatures pass laws forbidding assault, murder, \n     theft, fraud, and a host of other crimes. Policemen patrol \n     the streets to prevent those crimes. When a crime is \n     committed and a victim created, police hunt down the \n     likeliest suspect and arrest him.\n       Government attorneys then prosecute. The courts sit in \n     judgment, impose prison time, and order restitution where \n     appropriate. Corrections departments imprison--and sometimes \n     execute--offenders, not only to punish them for the misdeed \n     in question but also to prevent them from violating the \n     rights of additional victims. This vast legislative, \n     judicial, and executive machinery expends a great amount of \n     time and energy to guarantee the rights of innocent citizens.\n       The procedural rights of defendants exist for a good \n     reason. The right to trial by jury, the right to an attorney, \n     the right to an appeal, the right not to have a confession \n     beaten out of you--all are in place because a defendant \n     stands in a markedly different position from a crime victim. \n     The state wields its immense coercive power on behalf of the \n     victim--and against the defendant.\n       Some mechanism is necessary to ensure that powerful \n     machinery does not run out of control and crush someone it \n     should not. Though they sometimes are abused, the \n     constitutional protections guaranteed to a defendant are not \n     catering to the guilty, but to the innocent. They exist to \n     make sure the apparatus functioning on behalf of victims does \n     not create another one, or several other ones. If sloppy law \n     enforcement sends an innocent person to prison, then it \n     leaves the real perpetrator free--to strike again.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, \n                             Apr. 21, 2000]\n\n                   Victim Amendment Undoes Prior Work\n\n       With the drive to enshrine its tenets in the U.S. \n     Constitution, the victims' rights movement is in danger of \n     undoing much of the good it has done.\n       Granted, the proposed amendment to the Constitution, which \n     is scheduled for a vote Tuesday in the U.S. Senate, is \n     emotionally appealing. If approved by Congress and ratified \n     by three-fourths of the state legislatures, the amendment \n     would, among other things, require that victims be notified \n     of any court proceedings involving their accused assailants \n     and be told of an offender's release or escape.\n       These provisions are fairly innocuous; others in the far-\n     reaching proposal are not.\n       For example, the amendment would give victims the right to \n     attend all public proceedings stemming from the crime. But \n     there are compelling reasons for victim witnesses to be \n     excluded from the courtroom except when they are testifying. \n     Their presence could bias the testimony of other witnesses \n     sympathetic to what the victims have endured, and on hearing \n     other witnesses testify, victims might tailor their own \n     testimony to minimize any inconsistencies.\n       Another new ``right'' would authorize victims to submit a \n     statement at all public proceedings held to accept a \n     negotiated plea. That risks the possibility of victims \n     becoming equal partners with prosecutors in deciding when to \n     plea-bargain cases. Therein lies the crux of our objections.\n       The government prosecutes crimes on behalf of the \n     community, not just victims, even though victims routinely \n     suffer the greatest toll. It is the community's best \n     interests that should receive the highest consideration by \n     prosecutors.\n       One surprising opponent of the amendment voiced his \n     concerns simply: ``I think crime victims are too emotionally \n     involved,'' said Bud Welch of Oklahoma City, whose daughter \n     died in the bombing of the federal courthouse there.\n       Welch and his organization, Citizens for the Fair Treatment \n     of Victims, are joined in opposing the proposal by the \n     National Coalition Against Sexual Assault, the National \n     Network to End Domestic Violence and Murder Victims' Families \n     for Reconciliation.\n       Already, 32 states have passed victims' rights statutes or \n     amendments to their state constitutions. This is how it \n     should be, as the vast majority of crimes are prosecuted on \n     the state level. It is far too radical a step to amend the \n     federal Constitution for what is essentially a state matter.\n       All victims' rights run the risk of being diluted if this \n     proposal becomes the 28th amendment to the U.S. Constitution. \n     That should convince Washington's senators, Democrat Patty \n     Murray and Republican Slade Gorton, to vote no Tuesday.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the South Bend Tribune, Apr. 27, 2000]\n\n            Proposed Victims' Rights Amendment Is Misguided\n\n       A proposed constitutional amendment to codify rights for \n     crime victims may be sincere in intent, but it is misguided \n     and should be defeated when the Senate votes today.\n       The most sacred tenet of the United States' system of \n     justice says that all those accused are innocent until proven \n     guilty. The Victims' Rights Amendment could jeopardize that \n     constitutional protection by giving victims an active role in \n     virtually every stage of prosecution, from plea bargaining to \n     punishment and parole.\n       Under terms of the amendment, victims would be allowed to \n     remain present in the courtroom throughout a trial, even if \n     they are witnesses for the prosecution.\n       Crime victims deserve sympathy and support, but inserting \n     them into the criminal justice system as proposed in this \n     amendment is an invitation to substitute vengeance for \n     justice. If Congress wants to establish a fund to help \n     victims recover emotionally, physically and financially it \n     should do so. It should not, however, seek to alter core \n     principles of the law.\n       Congress is developing an annoying tendency to legislate by \n     pandering to the public's feelings as a substitute for \n     thoughtful consideration. Amending the Constitution may \n     create many unintended consequences and should not be \n     undertaken when there are other ways to reach the goal \n     desired.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the St. Petersburg Times, Apr. 25, 2000]\n\n                         A Wrong Set of Rights\n\n       The so-called Victims' Rights Amendment isn't all that it \n     seems. Politically motivated, it would tilt cases in favor of \n     prosecutors and strike a blow to constitutional guarantees of \n     due process and fairness for the accused.\n       The Constitution was purposely made hard to amend to shield \n     it from political whims, but that hasn't stopped Congress \n     from trying to alter this great document. In this 106th \n     Congress, at least 53 constitutional amendments have been \n     introduced concerning every hot-button issue from flag \n     burning to school prayer. The latest assault on individual \n     rights is the so-called Victims' Rights Amendment, a \n     wrongheaded attempt to give crime victims rights in criminal \n     proceedings.\n       The amendment is popular because any measure that appears \n     to favor victims over criminals is going to sail through \n     Congress. But the amendment has more to do with political \n     pandering than conscientious lawmaking. This helping hand for \n     crime victims is really about tilting the balance in favor of \n     prosecutors. It would substantially reduce the Constitution's \n     guarantees of due process and fairness for the criminally \n     accused.\n       While victims often complain that they are ignored or \n     mistreated by the criminal justice system, there are fixes \n     short of amending the Constitution. Florida, for example, has \n     codified victims' rights in statute and made it part of the \n     state Constitution. A caveat, though, prevents the exercise \n     of victims' rights from interfering with the defendant's \n     constitutional rights. But if the federal Constitution were \n     amended, this key protection for defendants would be \n     nullified.\n       Among the disturbing provisions, the Victims' Rights \n     Amendment would give crime victims the right to be present at \n     any public proceeding, to expect a trial free from \n     unreasonable delay and to have their safety considered \n     relative to a defendant's release from custody. While these \n     measures don't sound excessive on their face, they could \n     seriously handicap a defendant's right to a fair hearing.\n       For example, a victim who demands to sit in on every day of \n     trial could also be a key witness to the crime. By listening \n     to all other testimony, he could tailor his comments to avoid \n     inconsistent statements--complicating the defense's job.\n       Similar problems arise in interpreting the victim's right \n     to a quick resolution. A victim's demand for speed could \n     truncate the defense attorney's time to prepare for trial, \n     making it difficult to present a full defense. It is also \n     unclear how the victim's right to a speedy resolution would \n     impact the defendant's right of habeas corpus. Habeas claims \n     of wrongful imprisonment sometimes comes many years after \n     conviction.\n       Multiple concerns also are raised by the provision \n     requiring that the safety of victims be considered before a \n     defendant is released. At minimum, the accused could be \n     denied reasonable bond, but the provision could also give the \n     state the power to hold prisoners indefinitely after their \n     prison terms based on some minimal showing of fear by the \n     victim.\n       The amendment is scheduled to come up for action in the \n     Senate this week, and if it passes by the two-thirds majority \n     necessary, it's expected to fly through the House. The \n     amendment would then need to be passed by three-fourths of \n     state legislatures before becoming part of the Constitution. \n     Florida's Republican Sen. Connie Mack has already signed on \n     as a sponsor, but Democrat Bob Graham, as usual is waiting \n     until the last minute to reveal his position.\n       What seems to elude amendment supporters is that the rights \n     of defendants are not enshrined in the Constitution to \n     protect criminals. They are there to ensure that those \n     falsely accused by government get a fair trail. So really the \n     Constitution already provides for victims' rights: victims of \n     overzealous government prosecution, that is.\n\n[[Page S3253]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                [From the Wichita Eagle, Apr. 27, 2000]\n\n    Not Again--Victim's Rights Don't Merit Constitutional Amendment\n\n       There's no question that victims of crimes too often feel \n     victimized a second time by the justice system.

Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., argue \n     that the Constitution currently guarantees 15 rights to \n     criminal defendants yet extends none to victims. They want to \n     equalize the importance of defendant and victim, guaranteeing \n     the latter the right to be present at court hearings, speak \n     at sentencing, have a say in plea agreements, see the cases \n     resolved quickly and seek restitution.\n       But the proposed amendment is rife with problems:\n       It would step on existing statutory and constitutional \n     safeguards in 32 states, including Kansas.\n       It could end up conflicting with or compromising \n     defendants' rights.\n       It lacks even the support of some advocacy groups such as \n     Victim Services, which is focusing its resources and energy \n     elsewhere.\n       And, as Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., noted, \n     it ``is longer than the entire Bill of Rights.''\n       Authorities obviously need to do a better job respecting \n     and enforcing existing state victims'-rights laws and taking \n     pains not to treat victims like afterthoughts. But there are \n     good reasons why the 11,000 attempts to amend the \n     Constitution over the defining document's 213-year history \n     have succeeded only 27 times. The plight of crime victims is \n     heartrending, but it should be dealt with by appropriate \n     laws, not by this kind of intensive meddling with the \n     Constitution.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the Winston-Salem Journal, Apr. 27, 2000]\n\n                            Victims' Rights\n\n       The victims of violent crimes and their loved ones often \n     have reason to feel that they have fewer rights under the \n     justice system than does the criminal. Many victims say that \n     they feel victimized all over again by the time the court \n     proceedings are done. Clearly there is much that ought to be \n     done to ensure that courts and related offices treat victims \n     with respect, compassion and efficiency. But a victims' \n     rights amendment to the U.S. Constitution, under discussion \n     this week in the Senate, is the wrong way to make those \n     improvements.\n       It's a bad idea to amend the Constitution for a problem \n     that could be handled by less sweeping and less permanent \n     legislation. The Constitution has remained strong for more \n     than 200 years precisely because the Founders did not address \n     the details of every issue that might arise. It is unwise to \n     amend it to deal with problems that can be addressed through \n     less drastic means.\n       Even more important, the drive for a victims' rights \n     amendment is based on a misunderstanding of the role of the \n     criminal-justice system. The courts are set up to protect the \n     rule of law and the greater interests of society, not to \n     exact personal vengeance. When a criminal is sentenced to \n     imprisonment or some other punishment, he is paying his debt \n     to society, not to the victim. He is being punished for \n     violating the rule of law that we all agree to as citizens \n     for our mutual protection.\n       Advocates of an amendment argue that the Constitution \n     establishes many rights of the accused, but none for victims. \n     But the Constitution is designed to provide the protection of \n     laws and fair and efficient justice for all. Crime victims \n     are suffering because a law has been broken, and the function \n     of the courts is to punish the lawbreaker. The rights of the \n     accused are spelled out because defendants are in danger of \n     having rights taken from them as punishment. Though the \n     victims of crimes deserve public sympathy and support, they \n     do not deserve special treatment by the legal system.\n       The move for victims' rights has arisen out of frustrations \n     when the court system, far from giving victims special \n     treatment, seems to disregard them. Among the rights in the \n     proposed amendment would be notification of proceedings, \n     speedier proceedings and notification of release or escape of \n     an offender.\n       Some of these rights exist but aren't honored because of \n     overcrowded courts and lack of staff. Those are problems that \n     Congress and state legislatures can address without an \n     amendment. They can also pass laws to make things more smooth \n     and comfortable for victims and to give victims a voice in \n     such proceedings as parole hearings. Some laws providing \n     restitution are appropriate.\n       A constitutional amendment is not needed to achieve any of \n     these worthy goals. Senators should make it clear that they \n     support the goals but don't want to pursue them in the wrong \n     way.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Times, May 2, 2000]\n\n                      Constitutional Pandora's Box\n\n                          (By Debra Saunders)\n\n       Just when you thought that Congress was a totally craven \n     institution full of pandering pols who would sell out the \n     Constitution for a friendly story on Page 3 of the local \n     paper, the Senate up and takes a stand on principle. An \n     unpopular stand even.\n       I refer to a proposed Crime Victims' Amendment to the \n     Constitution. Last week, Senate sponsors Dianne Feinstein, \n     California Democrat, and Jon Kyl, Arizona Republican, pulled \n     a vote on the measure because they didn't have the two-thirds \n     vote needed for passage. Finally, some good news.\n       Of course, I support crime victims' rights, and the stated \n     goals of the measure. The amendment, among other things, \n     would give victims the right to be notified of legal \n     proceedings where they would have a right to be heard, to be \n     notified if a perp is released or escapes, and to weigh in on \n     plea bargains.\n       As Mrs. Feinstein explained in a statement, ``The U.S. \n     Constitution guarantees 15 separate rights to criminal \n     defendants, and each of these rights was established by \n     amendment to the Constitution. But there is not one word \n     written in the U.S. Constitution on behalf of crime \n     victims.''\n       I, for one, value that omission. The Founding Fathers wrote \n     the document when being a victim was not a badge of honor. If \n     it were written today in the decade of the victim, the \n     Constitution probably would read like a 12-step pamphlet.\n       More importantly, while the Constitution does not pay \n     homage to victims' rights per se, the entire process of \n     prosecution, of using the government to exact punishment for \n     wrongdoing against individuals, recognizes the government's \n     responsibility to protect citizens from lawless individuals.\n       Of course, there have been some victim horror stories that \n     give the measure legitimacy. One need look no further than \n     Littleton, Colo., where authorities have sold video-tapes of \n     the bloodstained high-school shooting crime scene for $25. \n     This is a true outrage, but it is best remedied by parents \n     suing the daylights out of these cruel civil servants.\n       'Tis better to sue than to revamp the U.S. Constitution. \n     Law enforcement generally is a local matter. A constitutional \n     amendment then would give federal judges another excuse to \n     butt in and tell local lawmen and women what to do. No \n     thanks.\n       I'll add that because a constitutional amendment has so \n     much force, and is so difficult to change, there must be a \n     compelling reason to pass it, and lawmakers should have a \n     clear idea of its effects.\n       But it's not clear how judges would interpret it. The \n     American Civil Liberties Union's Jennifer Helburn argues that \n     some judges, for example, could interpret the right of \n     victims to ``be present, and to submit a statement' at all \n     public legal proceedings to mean indigent victims would have \n     a right to publicly funded legal representation.\n       The ACLU also warns the provision could ``allow victims to \n     be present throughout an entire trial, even if they are going \n     to be witnesses.'' A Senate aide explained a judge would \n     determine whether victims could be present before testifying \n     or could testify first, and then attend the rest of the \n     trial. So, the provision could make life harder for \n     prosecutors. Not good.\n       Legal writer Stuart Taylor Jr. of the National Journal \n     worries that mandating victim output--even if it is not \n     mandatory that prosecutors obey it--could scuttle plea \n     bargain arrangements that might be unpopular but result in a \n     better outcome than letting murderers walk free.\n       Sen. Fred Thompson, Tennessee Republican, warned that the \n     measure is ``very, very disruptive in ways that there is no \n     way we can possibly determine. We are opening up a Pandora's \n     box.''\n       Except, last week, the Senate didn't open up Pandora's box. \n     And in not opening the box, it nonetheless released one \n     precious item: hope.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/02/senate-section/article/S3253-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3253-S3254]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I am deeply honored to rise in \ntribute to over 3,000 courageous professional Navy Nurses of the Korean \nWar, undaunted in the face of danger, who unselfishly answered the call \nof duty. They came from every corner of the nation. They came from all \nwalks of life. They joined the Navy because they wanted to serve their \ncountry. They wanted to share their professional nursing skills and to \ncare for those injured in body, mind and spirit.\n  The Navy nurses of the Korean War claim they did nothing special, \nthey were just doing their job. But in the hearts of all who served \nwith them, the doctors and the corpsmen, and their patients, Navy \nNurses of the Korean War are true American heroes.\n  During the Korean War, whole blood could only be kept for eight days. \nHospital ships were in Korean waters for weeks, months. Navy nurses \ngave their own blood for patient transfusions. Many aboard the hospital \nship Haven were found to be anemic from giving so much of their blood \nfor the injured.\n  Nurses worked around the clock during the mass casualties brought in \nfrom battles like Chosin Reservoir. Many times they worked 96 hours \nwith just two hours of sleep in between swells of patients. Ever \nresilient and effervescent, Navy Nurses of the Korea War volunteered to \nassist orphanages in Inchon and Pusan caring for sick and wounded \nchildren. Severely injured children were brought back to hospital ships \nfor surgery like having shrapnel removed from head wounds.\n  Nurses ventured into POW camps to ensure that children in these camps \nwere treated and inoculated. Whether the nurses were stationed close to \nthe fighting aboard hospital ships in Korean waters, at Naval Hospital \nYokosuka, Japan, at other medical facilities in the Far East or on the \nhome front, nurses were always there for their patients . . . their \npatients always came first.\n  Fifty years ago, Navy Nurses who served during the Korean War came \nhome to quietly live their lives. For fifty years our nation has not \nknown about this group of patriotic nurses who volunteered to serve our \ncountry. And they did it because they wanted to. They did it because \nthey cared about our nation. They did it because they wanted to share \ntheir nursing skills. They did it because of their respect for life.\n  Let us not wait a day longer. Let us remember how these courageous, \npatriotic women answered the call of their country. And let us remember \nthose Navy nurses who made it home in spirit only to live on in the \nhearts of family, friends and their fellow countrymen. Let us remember \nthose Navy Nurses of the Korean War who are now in nursing homes and \nlong-term care facilities. These nurses who once fought so valiantly to \nsave the lives of their patients, now fight each day for their own \nsurvival.\n  Navy Nurses of the Korean War, you are forgotten no more. You shall \nremain in the hearts and spirits of all Americans. Let your story be \ntold. Let your story be heard. Let your story be preserved in our \nhistory and remembered for decades to come. Your sacrifices and \nuncommon valor sparks the fire of patriotism, the foundation of our \nnation.\n  Navy Nurses of the Korean War, your unfaltering commitment of service \nto our country brings pride and honor to us. Mr. President, I ask my \ncolleagues in the Senate to join me in remembering these quiet heroes--\nthe Navy Nurses of the Korean War.\n  Navy Nurses of the Korean War . . . thank you from the bottom of our \nhearts. You are our heroes. You are forever remembered in the hearts \nand souls of your fellow countrymen. You are forever remembered in the \nhistory of our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/02/senate-section/article/S3254-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3254]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SALUTING ROGER DeCAMP\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to salute the \nachievements of a man who has dedicated most of his life to improving \nthe quality and safety of Alaskan and Pacific Northwest seafood, and \nwhose efforts have made a positive and permanent impact on America's \nfood industry.\n  Roger DeCamp is by no means a household name. Roger has never sought \nrecognition or fame. Yet it is not too much to say that he has made a \nprofound contribution to the welfare of America's seafood consumers.\n  In just a few short weeks, Roger DeCamp will retire as the Director \nof the National Food Processors Association Northwest Laboratory, in \nSeattle, Washington.\n  In 1960, Roger joined the Association as a microbiology and \nprocessing engineer. In 1964, he moved to Seattle to become the head of \nthe microbiology and thermal processing division at the Northwest \nfacility, and in 1971, he became the assistant director for the entire \nfacility. He has been the director since 1981.\n  Unlike some who achieve senior positions, Roger has not ceased his \nwork ``in the trenches.'' He has remained accessible to anyone who \nneeded his assistance, and as one of the most knowledgeable individuals \nin the world about seafood quality control and safety, his advice has \nbeen widely sought.\n  One of the major achievements in Roger's career has been the \nmodernization and direction of the Canned Salmon Control Plan, which \nassures the safety and integrity of the millions and millions of pounds \nof canned salmon produced annually in Alaska, and which is shipped \nworldwide. Canned salmon is one of the United States' most successful \nseafood exports. That success owes a great deal to the control plan, \nwhich gives buyers everywhere the confident knowledge that American \ncanned salmon is a wholesome and beneficial protein source.\n  Under Roger's direction, the Canned Salmon Control Plan, with \nparticipation from industry, the Food and Drug Administration, and the \nNational Food Processors Association, received the Vice-Presidential \nHammer award for its unique approach to meeting the highly complex, \ntechnical, and sometimes conflicting requirements of the industry and \nthe government agencies that regulate it.\n  Roger has continually worked to modernize the practices and \nprocedures of the industry, and has represented it with distinction in \nthe development of regulatory guidelines at both the state and federal \nlevels.\n  He provided much of the impetus and expertise that led to the \ndevelopment of new Alaska seafood inspection regulations, has counseled \nthe Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute technical committee on seafood \nquality since its creation in 1981, and led the development of the \nHazard Analysis/Critical Control Point approach to seafood processing. \nThe latter revolutionized seafood safety requirements, and when put in \nplace in Alaska, became the model on which later federal regulations \nwere constructed for seafood products nationwide. This same technical \napproach is now being applied not just to seafoods, but to meats and \nother products as well.\n  Roger also has been active on international trade issues of critical \nimportance to the seafood industry. Among other things, he played a \ncrucial role in obtaining agreement on a method of certifying seafood \nfor the European Union market without resorting to the imposition of \nnew user fees on the industry.\n  Finally, it must be noted that the respect in which Roger is been \nheld by both the industry and by government regulators has been key to \nthe successful negotiation of scientific and technical agreements \nbetween the industry and the Food and Drug Administration, to the \nmaintenance of a strong working relationship between them, and to the \nfederal agency's willingness to work cooperatively on even the most \ncomplex and technical issues of food handling and safety.\n  In no small way, both his industry and his country owe a debt of \nthanks to Roger DeCamp.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/02/senate-section/article/S3255-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S3255]]\n  HONORING THE NEVADA KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS FOR NINETY YEARS OF SERVICE\n\n Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nKnights of Columbus of Nevada, which will be celebrating their 90th \nanniversary on May 10, 2000.\n  The history of the Knights of Columbus stretches back 118 years, when \nFather Michael J. McGivney founded the fraternal order in New Haven \nConnecticut on March 29, 1882. Since the order's founding, the Knights \nof Columbus have promoted the Catholic faith and have practiced the \nprinciples of charity, unity and fraternity.\n  When Father McGivney passed away in 1890, there were 5,000 Knights of \nColumbus located in 57 councils in New England. Today, the Knights of \nColumbus are the largest Catholic lay fraternal organization in the \nworld and has 1.6 million members in the United States and twelve other \nnations around the world. Members of the organization and their \nfamilies donate over $100 million to charities in addition to the 50 \nmillion hours of their own time that they volunteer each year.\n  Since May 10, 1910 in the State of Nevada, the Knights of Columbus \nhave been committed to the highest ideals and principles of \nhumanitarianism, and it gives me great pleasure to congratulate them on \nnine decades of volunteer service that has certainly enhanced and \nimproved the quality of life for all Nevadans.\n  Mr. President, the members of the Knights of Columbus of Nevada, are \ntruly deserving of recognition for their nearly century-long dedication \nto promoting the teachings of the Catholic Church, and for living those \nteachings by serving those in need in their community. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in offering congratulations to the Brother \nKnights and their families on the occasion of their 90th anniversary, \nand in wishing them continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/02/senate-section/article/S3255-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HONORING VETERANS ADMINISTRATION NURSES\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, as we prepare to celebrate \nNational Nurses Week during the week of May 6 through May 12, 2000, I \nwould like to give special recognition to the dedicated nurses who \nserve the largest healthcare system in the world, the Veterans Health \nAdministration. I rise today to recognize our Veterans Administration \nnurses for the critical care which they have provided throughout our \nnation's history and continue to provide today.\n  The first VA nurses served the needs of veterans of the Spanish-\nAmerican War and World War I. In the 1930's, the VA Nursing Service was \ncreated, and employed 2,500 registered nurses. Throughout World War II, \nKorea, Vietnam, and the Persian Gulf War, VA nurses continued the \ntradition of outstanding service to our nation's veterans. The number \nof VA nurses has grown substantially, and today the Veterans Health \nAdministration employs 34,000 registered nurses and 26,000 licensed \npractical nurses and nursing assistants, serving an average of 25 \nmillion outpatients and 1 million inpatients annually. The VA Nursing \nService maintains its tradition of excellence by encouraging nurses to \npursue higher education, and was a forerunner in introducing advanced \nemployment and educational policies. These trained professionals work \nin a nationwide system of VA health facilities located throughout the \ncontinental United States and its territories.\n  I have been privileged to personally witness the hard work and \ndedication of Veterans Administration nurses. From 1946 until 1985, my \nmother served as a VA nurse at several hospitals including Aspinwall \nVeterans Hospital in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Butler Veterans \nHospital in Butler, PA. As Chief of Nursing for 32 years, my mother can \nattest to the commitment which is typical of VA nurses everywhere. \nDuring times of low funding and limited staffing, VA nurses worked \nharder than ever to care for the needs of their patients. While my \nexperience on the Senate Armed Services Committee has served as \naffirmation of the dedication of Veterans Administration nurses, it \npales in comparison to the hard work and sacrifice that I personally \nwitnessed as the son of a VA nurse.\n  As we celebrate National Nurses Week, it is imperative that we \nremember those who have faithfully served and continue to care for our \nNation's veterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/02/senate-section/article/S3255-3", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO REVEREND JAMES A. SCOTT\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Rev. \nJames A. Scott on the occasion of his retirement as Pastor of the \nBethany Baptist Church in Newark, NJ.\n  For more than three decades, Rev. James A. Scott has devoted his life \nto building a new legacy for the Bethany Baptist Church congregation \nand the Newark community. Since its founding in 1871, Bethany Baptist \nhas evolved into an international network. The church's more than 2,000 \nmembers represent 22 different countries, including many in the \nCaribbean and Africa. Under Reverend Scott's leadership, Bethany \nBaptist helped establish a daughter church in Johannesburg, South \nAfrica, and renovated a church in Cuba. The church also provides \nscholarship funds for students to attend the Moscow Baptist Seminary, \nand it educates primary students in Kenya.\n  Reverend Scott is not just building bridges to the international \ncommunity, he is also playing a major role in the rebirth of Newark and \nsurrounding areas. In the Roseville Avenue neighborhood, for example, \nReverend Scott's church helped build 100 affordable homes. His church \nalso helped build a community outreach building in Newark as well as \nthe Newark-Bethany Christian Academy Day School.\n  These facilities have created a sense of stability and rootedness in \ntheir respective neighborhoods.

Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the memory \nof Grace Walsh of Eau Claire, WI, who passed away on Monday, April 24. \nI will remember Grace as a wonderful person and brilliant teacher, \nsomeone who taught me lessons in debate and in life that I have relied \non so often throughout my career in public service.\n  Grace coached her debate team to six national championships at the \nUniversity of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, where she co-founded the Speech \nDepartment and served as both a professor and director of forensics. \nDuring the summer of 1970 when I was still in high school, I was lucky \nenough to study debate with Grace at the Eau Claire Debate Institute. \nGrace was a consummate teacher who brought out the best in her \nstudents, and a fierce competitor who built a debating dynasty in Eau \nClaire. With warmth, wit, and a mastery of forensics, Grace quickly won \nher students' respect. While small in size, Grace was commanding in \nstature, thanks to her keen understanding of how to coach winning \ndebaters. ``Always slip them the blade nicely,'' she told us.\n  Many years after I attended that summer debating program at Eau \nClaire, I saw Grace again. I gave a talk in Eau Claire after I won an \nupset victory in the Democratic primary in 1992, and who was in the \nfront row but Grace Walsh, urging me again to ``slip them the blade \nnicely, Russell.'' She was still coaching me, and displaying a love of \ndebate that made her a coaching legend in Wisconsin and around the \ncountry.\n  Grace passed away last week at the age of 89, but her spirit lives on \nthrough all those who knew her and had the opportunity to learn from \nher. As her student, I am grateful for her guidance, and as a \nWisconsinite, I am proud of her many achievements. Her work did honor \nto our state, and I think it only fitting that we pause to honor and \nremember her here today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/02/senate-section/article/S3255-5", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3255-S3256]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n[[Page S3256]]\n\n                       executive message referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/02/senate-section/article/S3256-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3256]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  A 6-MONTH PERIODIC REPORT ON THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO \n SIGNIFICANT NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS CENTERED IN COLOMBIA--MESSAGE FROM \n                         THE PRESIDENT--PM 102\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  As required by section 401(c) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 \nU.S.C. 1641(c), and section 204(c) of the International Emergency \nEconomic Powers Act (IEEPA), 50 U.S.C. 1703(c), I transmit herewith a \n6-month periodic report on the national emergency with respect to \nsignificant narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia that was \ndeclared in Executive Order 12978 of October 21, 1995.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to deter \nthe smuggling of tobacco products into the United States, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               TOBACCO SMUGGLING ERADICATION ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Tobacco \nSmuggling Eradication Act.\n  When Congress last debated tobacco legislation, Big Tobacco raised \nthe specter of rampant smuggling to defeat the legislation. Of course, \nthe public only found out recently that Big Tobacco itself is a major \nplayer in the smuggling game. A tobacco company executive recently \npleaded guilty to money laundering charges in a case involving nearly \n$700 million worth of cigarettes on the Canadian black market. Although \nthe company denies knowledge of the scheme, they clearly profited from \nit.\n  The best way to address smuggling concerns is to prevent any large-\nscale smuggling problem from arising in the first place. The Tobacco \nSmuggling Eradication Act contains several common-sense provisions to \ncombat smuggling of tobacco products, and associated tax evasion.\n  The bill will require unique serial numbers on all tobacco product \npackages manufactured or imported into the United States, and will \nrequire all packages bound for export to be marked for export. Under \ncurrent law, export-bound products that re-enter the U.S. too often \navoid tax assessment, and are sold at discount, in competition with \nproducts on which taxes have been paid. Likewise, re-imported products \nunder current law often evade counting for purposes of the multi-state \nsettlement, and thus cheat Americans twice--once in avoidance of tax, \nand again in avoidance of MSA assessment.\n  The bill would require retailers to maintain tobacco-related records, \nwhich may consist simply of ordinary business records. This provision \nwould ensure that invoices for tax-paid tobacco products match sales, \nand that the retailer is not an outlet for product on which tax has not \nbeen paid.\n  The bill also would require wholesalers to keep records on the chain \nof custody of tobacco products. This requirement already exists for \nmanufacturers, exporters, and importers. This requirement needs to be \nstrengthened in order to ensure that product marked for export is not \ndiverted back into the domestic market without appropriate taxes having \nbeen collected.\n  In addition, the bill would amend the Contraband Cigarette \nTrafficking Act, which assists states in enforcing and collecting their \nexcise taxes, by lowering the threshold of jurisdiction to 30,000 \ncigarettes (from 60,000) and expanding it to cover other tobacco \nproducts. Federal law should ensure that states have the necessary \ntools to stop interstate bootleggers who routinely move tons of tobacco \nproducts from low-tax states to higher-tax states.\n  Mr. President, this is important legislation which would crack down \non bootleggers and black marketeers. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis bill. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2493\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Tobacco Smuggling \n     Eradication Act of 2000''.\n          TITLE I--AMENDMENTS TO INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986\n\n     SEC. 101.

Such regulations shall include requirements for the \n     size and location of the label.\n       ``(g) Definition of Package.--For purposes of this section, \n     the term `package' means the innermost sealed container \n     irrespective of the material from which such container is \n     made, in which a tobacco product is placed by the \n     manufacturer and in which such tobacco product is offered for \n     sale to a member of the general public.''.\n\n     SEC. 103.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide \ncompensation and benefits to children of female Vietnam veterans who \nwere born with certain birth defects, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n       children of female vietnam veterans' benefits act of 2000\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I introduce, on behalf of myself and \nSenator Murray, legislation that would aid the children born with birth \ndefects to female Vietnam veterans. This legislation, the Children of \nFemale Vietnam Veterans' Benefits Act of 2000, is long overdue. As we \ncommemorate the 25th anniversary of the end of the war, it is a \nparticularly appropriate time for passage of this important \nlegislation.\n  Women played a critical role in Vietnam. As nurses, they provided \nlifesaving care to the wounded and comfort to the dying. Their \ncompassion and selflessness is legendary. Others served in countless \nother ways, as clerks, mapmakers, photographers, air traffic \ncontrollers, Red Cross and USO workers, and other volunteer roles. \nTheir support was crucial to the war effort.\n  Last year, the VA completed study on women Vietnam veterans which \nconcluded that there was a ``statistically significant increase in \nbirth defects'' in their children. VA generally does not have the legal \nauthority to provide health care and compensation to the children of \nveterans, except in the case of spina bifida.\n  The legislation we are sponsoring would apply to children of women \nVietnam veterans born with birth defects, other than spina bifida, \nwhich resulted in permanent physical or mental disability, except for \ncertain birth defects determined by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs \nto result from genetics, birth injury, or fetal or neonatal infirmities \nwith well-established causes. The benefits would include health care, \nvocational rehabilitation services, and financial compensation, \ndepending on the degree of disability.\n  In closing, I emphasize that the health care and benefits provided by \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs play a crucial role in supporting \nthe healing process I spoke of earlier. While no amount of remuneration \ncan ever truly compensate for bodily injury and emotional trauma, we \nhave the responsibility to provide the tools for coping and to ease the \ndifficulties of daily life. I urge my colleagues to support this \nmeasure.\n  This bill will provide health care and compensation to the children \nof women Vietnam veterans who were born with permanently disabling \nbirth defects. Though they have waited 25 years for this \nacknowledgment, this legislation has the ability to significantly \nimprove the lives of women veterans and their disabled children. These \nwomen and children have endured incredible and ongoing hardships for \nthis country, and their significance must be realized. We can no longer \nignore the responsibility the government owes to women veterans.\n  This bill has its origin in a study the Department of Veterans \nAffairs did on women Vietnam veterans. In response to the concerns of \nmany women Vietnam Veterans, Congress required that VA perform a \ncomprehensive study of any long-term adverse health effects that may \nhave been suffered by these women. This mandate led to three separate \nbut related epidemiologic studies of women Vietnam-era veterans: 1) a \npost Vietnam service mortality follow-up; 2) an assessment of \npsychologic health outcomes; and 3) a review of reproductive health \noutcomes. This particular study, released in 1999, analyzed the \nreproductive outcomes of over 4000 women Vietnam veterans, compared \nwith 4000 women Vietnam-era veterans.\n  The study revealed that the risk of a woman Vietnam veterans having a \nchild with birth defects was significantly elevated, even after \nadjusting for age, demographic variables, military characteristics, and \nsmoking and alcohol consumption of the mothers. Upon review of the \nresulting conclusions, the VA study's task force recommended that the \nSecretary seek statutory authority to provide health care and other \nbenefits to the offspring of women veterans with birth defects. \nSecretary West approved of this recommendation. The tragic realization \nof the birth defects present in so many of the children of women \nVietnam veterans brings light to a situation that cries out not only \nfor our sympathy, but for an acceptance of governmental responsibility \nand action.\n  VA does not have the authority under current law to provide health \ncare or other benefits to the children of women Vietnam veterans \ndisabled from birth defects other than spina bifida. Thus, the enabling \nlegislation that I introduce today is absolutely necessary in order to \naddress the compelling needs of these children.\n  Currently, VA has the authority to compensate and aid veterans, and \nthe dependents of these veterans, for disease or injury to the veteran \ndue to service. Millions of veterans, from every branch of the Armed \nForces, have been helped by this benefit. These small amounts of \ncompensation can in no way fully redress the physical and psychological \ninjuries that war has caused these veterans, their children, and their \nspouses. But it does serve to assist these veterans to live active and \nfulfilled lives, and it would assist with making up for lost income \nover the years, due to the injuries. However, no benefits have been \nextended to the children of veterans, for their own harm.\n  In 1996, VA was given special authority to provide benefits and \ncompensation to the children of Vietnam veterans for their own disease \nassociated with their parent's service--for those children born with \nspina bifida. The legislation I am introducing today is modeled after \nthat ground breaking spina bifida legislation. We owe that same debt to \nthe children born with birth defects to women Vietnam veterans. My \ncosponsors and I believe that providing this assistance to children \ndisabled by birth defects associated with their mother's military \nservice would be a fitting extension of the principle of providing \nbenefits for disabilities that are incurred or aggravated as a result \nof service on active duty in the Armed Forces of the United States.\n  I am seeking to aid the children of women Vietnam veterans who have \nbeen tragically affected by birth defects. These women fought for their \ncountry, and served this Nation with honor and courage. They \nvolunteered to be placed in harm's way, without knowledge of what \neffects their service may bring later. Many were nurses who cared for \nwounded soldiers, and offered enormously important support services to \nall those in active duty. Indeed, these women provided such an \nincredible nursing service to injured soldiers that less than 2% of all \ntreated casualties during the war died. These women saw death and \ndisease, and they experienced their own forms of disillusionment with \nthe war. These women\n\n[[Page S3261]]\n\nfought on the front lines; they were not kept away in safe places \nduring the conflict.\n  Further, I want to add that these women performed a service for women \nwho have been in any way involved in the Armed Forces since then, by \ncontributing to the changes in the military structure of the 1970s and \nsince. Women performed critically important roles during the Vietnam \nwar. Their ongoing contributions were recognized as altogether \nessential. Disastrously, some of their children have suffered because \ntheir mothers were so courageous, and it is time for them to begin to \nbe repaid for that suffering.\n  Though long overdue perhaps, now is a particularly appropriate time \nfor passage of this important legislation. As we celebrate the 25th \nanniversary of the end of the Vietnam War, we must remember the women \nVietnam veterans who served this country so well, all those years ago. \nThese women paid for their service not only with their own bodies, but \ntoo often with the bodies of their children who were born years later. \nIt is my opinion that this legislation is late in coming, but there is \nno time like the present. As we take these recent months to remember \nthe Vietnam War, I can think of no more fitting time than this for this \nbill. After all, though the fighting in Vietnam came to an end 25 years \nago, the consequences of that fighting are still dramatically present.\n\n  At the heart of this legislation, this bill would apply to children \nof women Vietnam veterans born with birth defects, other than spina \nbifida, which resulted in permanent physical or mental disability, \nexcept for birth defects determined by the Secretary of Veterans' \nAffairs to result from familial disorders, birth-related injuries, or \nfetal or neonatal infirmities with well-established causes.\n  The legislation authorizes VA to provide or reimburse a contractor \nfor health care delivered to the disabled children for the birth defect \nand associated conditions. This health care would include home, \nhospital, nursing home, outpatient, preventative, habilitative, \nrehabilitative and respite care. It also includes pharmaceuticals and \nsupplies required by the birth defect, such as wheelchairs, if \nappropriate.\n  The legislation also provides compensation from the VA to the \nchildren at four payment levels. The benefits would be for $100, $214, \n$743, and $1,272, per month, depending upon the severity of the child's \ndisability. Future cost-of-living adjustments would be based on the \nConsumer Price Index, just as other veterans and Social Security \nbenefits are adjusted.\n  This bill also authorizes VA to furnish the disabled children with \nimportant vocational rehabilitation services. The services would \ninclude: VA design of a training plan that is individually designed, \naccounting for the individual needs of the child; placement and post-\nplacement services, personal and work adjustment training. It may also \ninclude education at an institution of higher learning. The programs \nwould generally run 24 months, but if necessary, the Secretary may \nextend the program for an additional 24 months.\n  This legislation would be effective one year after the date of \nenactment, in order to allow time for regulations to be established. VA \nestimates that the costs for this legislation would be approximately \n$25 million over five years.\n  In conclusion, I believe that we must help the children born with \ndisabling birth defects associated with their mother's service in \nVietnam. It is the logical extension of our policy to provide benefits \nfor disabilities that result from service. It's the compassionate thing \nto do--to ensure that these children have the health care and other \nbenefits they need to survive. As a nation, it is our unwavering \nresponsibility to deal with all the consequences of war, not just the \neasy and obvious ones.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill fact sheet be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2494\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The \n     reproductive outcomes of over 4,000 Vietnam women veterans \n     were compared with 4,000 Vietnam-era women veterans.\n       VA currently has authority to compensate veterans and \n     dependents for disease or injury of the veteran due to \n     service. VA was given special authority in 1996, to provide \n     benefits to children of Vietnam veterans for their own \n     disease resulting from their parent's service--for those \n     children born with spina bifida\n\n\n                              Legislation\n\n       This bill would apply to women Vietnam veterans' children \n     born with birth defects (other than spina bifida) which \n     result in permanent physical or mental disability, except for \n     birth defects determined by the Secretary of VA to result \n     from familial disorders, birth-related injuries, or fetal or \n     neonatal infirmities with well-established causes.\n       This bill is modeled after the 1996 spina bifida \n     legislation.\n       It authorizes VA to provide or reimburse a contractor for \n     health care delivered to the disabled children for the birth \n     defect and associated conditions. This health care would \n     include home, hospital, nursing home, outpatient, \n     preventative, habilitative, rehabilitative and respite care. \n     It also includes pharmaceuticals and supplies required by the \n     birth defect, such as wheel chairs, if appropriate.\n       It provides compensation from the VA to the children at \n     four payment levels. The benefits would be for $100, $214, \n     $743, and $1,272, depending upon the severity of the \n     disability. Future cost of living adjustments would be \n     indexed and based on the Consumer Price Index, just as other \n     veterans' and Social Security benefits are adjusted.\n       This bill also authorizes VA to furnish the disabled \n     children with vocational rehabilitation services. The \n     services would include: VA provision of a training plan that \n     is individually designed, accounting for the individual needs \n     of the child; placement and post-placement services; and \n     personal and work adjustment training. It may also include \n     education at an institution of higher learning. The programs \n     will generally run 24 months, but if necessary, the Secretary \n     may extend the program for an additional 24 months.\n       The legislation would be effective one year after the date \n     of enactment, in order to allow time for regulations to be \n     established.\n       VA estimates that the costs for this legislation would be \n     approximately $25 million over five years.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n       By Mr. MOYNIHAN (for himself, Mr. Cochran, and Mr. Frist):\n\n  S. 2498. A bill to authorize the Smithsonian Institution to plan, \ndesign, construct, and equip laboratory, administrative, and support \nspace to house base operations for the Smithsonian Astrophysical \nObservatory Submillimeter Array located on Mauna Kea at Hilo, Hawaii; \nto the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n\n\n  legislation to authorize the smithsonian institution to construct a \n                     base facility in hilo, hawaii\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today, \nwith Senator Cochran and Senator Frist, legislation to authorize the \nconstruction of a base facility structure in Hilo, Hawaii, to house the \nstaff and laboratory operations of the Smithsonian Astrophysical \nObservatory's Submillimeter Array (SMA) atop the summit of the ancient \nvolcano Mauna Kea.\n\n  The advanced SMA is an array of eight moveable radio telescope \nantennas. Its combined images can produce high-resolution detail 50 \ntimes sharper than those achieved by any telescopes currently making \nobservations at these wavelengths. Ultimately, this telescope array \nwill be used to study a host of astronomical objects and phenomena \nemitting images in the submillimeter\n\n[[Page S3263]]\n\nrange, the narrow band of radiation between radio and infrared waves, a \nportion of the electromagnetic spectrum largely unexplored from the \nground. Using the latest technology, the array will be able to probe \nthe murky clouds of the Milky Way where stars are born, peer into the \nhearts of exploding galaxies, study cool faint objects of our own Solar \nSystem, and explore other great questions in astronomy, gaining insight \ninto the processes and cataclysmic forces involved in the ultimate \nformation and evolution of stars, planets and galaxies.\n  Like the innovative Chandra X-ray Observatory, which is now sending \nback stunning images from space, essentially all of the Submillimeter \nArray's equipment was designed and prototyped at the Smithsonian \nAstrophysical Observatory's facilities in Cambridge, Massachusetts. \nAnd, just as the Smithsonian collaborates with NASA on the \ngroundbreaking Chandra project, it collaborates with the Institute of \nAstronomy and Astrophysics of the Academia Sinica of Taiwan on the \nadvanced SMA.\n  On September 29, 1999, by tracking and observing 230 gigahertz (230 \nbillion cycles per second) of radiation from Mars, Venus, Saturn, and \nJupiter, SMA scientists made their first test observation--thereby \nachieving the submillimeter equivalent of ``first light''--and took a \ncritical step in the ultimate success of this project. This is but yet \nanother milestone in the history of the Smithsonian Astrophysical \nObservatory (SAO). Founded in 1890 by Secretary Samuel Langley as a \ncenter for ``the new astronomy,'' where one might study the physical \nnature of astronomical bodies as well as their positions and motions, \nSAO pioneered studies of the relationship between the solar and \nterrestrial phenomena. In the earliest days of the Space Age, SAO \nestablished and operated a worldwide network of satellite-tracking \nstations, including one on the island of Maui, and developed \nexperiments for some of the first orbiting space observatories. Today, \nSAO, the Smithsonian unit with the largest budget, is headquartered--in \na partnership with Harvard University--in Cambridge, Massachusetts. At \nthat facility more than 300 scientists are engaged in a broad program \nof astronomy, astrophysics, and earth and space sciences supported by \nFederal appropriations, Smithsonian trust funds, Harvard University \nfunds, and contracts and grants. In addition to the Submillimeter Array \nin Hawaii, SAO maintains a major data-gathering facility at the Whipple \nObservatory near Tucson, Arizona and operates the Oak Ridge Observatory \nin Massachusetts.\n  The legislation I am introducing today authorizes the Smithsonian to \nplan, design, construct, and equip approximately 16,000 square feet of \nlaboratory, administrative, and support space at the base of Mauna Kea, \nreplacing inadequate, temporary leased space. It further authorizes an \nappropriation of $2,000,000 in fiscal year 2001 and $2,500,000 in \nfiscal year 2002. This is a very modest investment to ensure the \ncontinuation of the scientific achievement and research excellence that \nhave been a tradition at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory for \n110 years.\n  I urge the speedy passage of this legislation and ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2498\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FACILITY AUTHORIZED.\n\n       The Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution is \n     authorized to plan, design, construct, and equip laboratory, \n     administrative, and support space to house base operations \n     for the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory Submillimeter \n     Array located on Mauna Kea at Hilo, Hawaii.\n\n     SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated to the Board of \n     Regents of the Smithsonian Institution to carry out this Act, \n     $2,000,000 for fiscal year 2001, and $2,500,000 for fiscal \n     year 2002, which shall remain available until \n     expended.\n\n Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, \nthe Senator from New York (Mr. Moynihan) and fellow Smithsonian \nInstitution Board Regent in introducing the legislation authorizing a \npermanent base facility structure at Hilo, Hawaii for the Smithsonian \nAstrophysical Observatory Submillimeter Array.\n  The Submillimeter Array is part of the world-class web of major data-\ngathering facilities of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. \nOther facilities are located in Arizona and its headquarters in \nMassachusetts. Together these facilities support some of the world's \nmost advanced studies and discoveries in astronomy, astrophysics, earth \nand space science.\n  This legislation will authorize the planning, design, construction \nand outfitting of the necessary laboratory and other operational space \nfor the array of radio telescope antennas installed atop the ancient \nvolcano, Mauna Kea. Funding is authorized in the amount of $2,000,000 \nfor Fiscal Year 2001 and $2,500,000 for Fiscal Year 2002. The new base \nstation will replace a current system of rented, overcrowded space \nshared with astrophysical operations of other organizations and \ncountries.\n  Mr. President, I am proud of the Smithsonian Astrophysical \nObservatory 110-year history and its reputation around the world. Its \nwork and discoveries are considered to be some of the most significant \nof the Twentieth Century. From the first orbiting space observatories \nto the newest images of our galaxy, the Smithsonian Astrophysical \nObservatory has worked independently and collaborated with the National \nAeronautics and Space Administration to explore and explain the wonders \nof the universe.\n  I hope the Senate will work quickly to pass this legislation so the \nwork of the Submillimeter Array can proceed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/02/senate-section/article/S3263-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3263-S3264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS--MAY 1, 2000\n\n\n                                 S. 636\n\n  At the request of Mr. Reed, the name of the Senator from Rhode Island \n(Mr. L.

Schulz in recognition of his lasting \nartistic contributions to the Nation and the world; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Charles M. Schulz was born on November 26, 1922, in St. \n     Paul, Minnesota, the son of Carl and Dena Schulz.\n       (2) Charles M. Schulz served his country in World War II, \n     working his way up from infantryman to staff sergeant and \n     eventually leading a machine gun squad. He kept morale high \n     by decorating fellow soldiers' letters home with cartoons of \n     barracks life.\n       (3) After returning from the war, Charles M. Schulz \n     returned to his love for illustration, and took a job with \n     ``Timeless Topix''. He also took a second job as an art \n     instructor. Eventually, his hard work paid off when the \n     Saturday Evening Post began purchasing a number of his single \n     comic panels.\n       (4) It was in his first weekly comic strip, ``L'il Folks'', \n     that Charlie Brown was born. That comic strip, which was \n     eventually renamed ``Peanuts'', became the sole focus of \n     Charles M. Schulz's career.\n       (5) Charles M. Schulz drew every frame of the ``Peanuts'' \n     strip, which ran 7 days a week, since it was created in \n     October 1950. This is rare dedication in the field of comic \n     illustration.\n       (6) The ``Peanuts'' comic strip appeared in 2,600 \n     newspapers around the world daily until January 3, 2000, and \n     on Sundays until February 13, 2000, and reached approximately \n     335,000,000 readers every day in 20 different languages, \n     making Charles M. Schulz the most successful comic \n     illustrator in the world.\n       (7) Charles M. Schulz's television special, ``A Charlie \n     Brown Christmas'', has run for 34 consecutive years. In all, \n     more than 60 animated specials have been created based on \n     ``Peanuts'' characters. Four feature films, 1,400 books, and \n     a hit Broadway musical about the ``Peanuts'' characters have \n     also been produced.\n       (8) Charles M. Schulz was a leader in the field of comic \n     illustration and in his community. He paved the way for other \n     artists in this field over the last 50 years and continues to \n     be praised for his outstanding achievements.\n       (9) Charles M. Schulz gave back to his community in many \n     ways, including owning and operating Redwood Empire Ice Arena \n     in Santa Rosa, California. The arena has become a favorite \n     gathering spot for people of all ages. Charles M. Schulz also \n     financed a yearly ice show that drew crowds from all over the \n     San Francisco Bay Area.\n       (10) Charles M. Schulz gave the Nation a unique sense of \n     optimism, purpose, and pride. Whether through the Great \n     Pumpkin Patch, the Kite Eating Tree, Lucy's Psychiatric Help \n     Stand, or Snoopy's adventures with the Red Baron, ``Peanuts'' \n     embodied human vulnerabilities, emotions, and potential.\n       (11) Charles M. Schulz's lifetime of work linked \n     generations of Americans and became a part of the fabric of \n     our national culture.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.\n\n       (a) Award Authorized.--The President is authorized to award \n     posthumously, on behalf of the Congress, a gold medal of \n     appropriate design to Charles M. Schulz in recognition of his \n     lasting artistic contributions to the Nation and the world.\n       (b) Design and Striking.--For the purpose of the award \n     referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury \n     (hereafter in this Act referred to as the ``Secretary'') \n     shall strike a gold medal with suitable emblems, devices, and \n     inscriptions, to be determined by the Secretary.\n\n[[Page S3267]]\n\n     SEC. 3. DUPLICATE MEDALS.\n\n       Under such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, the \n     Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of the \n     gold medal struck under section 2 at a price sufficient to \n     cover the costs of the medals, including labor, materials, \n     dies, use of machinery, overhead expenses, and the cost of \n     the gold medal.\n\n     SEC. 4. NATIONAL MEDALS.\n\n       The medals struck under this Act are national medals for \n     purposes of chapter 51 of title 31, United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 5.

The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton], for Mrs. \n     Feinstein, proposes an amendment numbered 3109.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Charles M. Schulz was born on November 26, 1922, in St. \n     Paul, Minnesota, the son of Carl and Dena Schulz.\n       (2) Charles M. Schulz served his country in World War II, \n     working his way up from infantryman to staff sergeant and \n     eventually leading a machine gun squad. He kept morale high \n     by decorating fellow soldiers' letters home with cartoons of \n     barracks life.\n       (3) After returning from the war, Charles M. Schulz \n     returned to his love for illustration, and took a job with \n     ``Timeless Topix''. He also took a second job as an art \n     instructor. Eventually, his hard work paid off when the \n     Saturday Evening Post began purchasing a number of his single \n     comic panels.\n       (4) It was in his first weekly comic strip, ``L'il Folks'', \n     that Charlie Brown was born. That comic strip, which was \n     eventually renamed ``Peanuts'', became the sole focus of \n     Charles M. Schulz's career.\n       (5) Charles M. Schulz drew every frame of the ``Peanuts'' \n     strip, which ran 7 days a week, since it was created in \n     October 1950. This is rare dedication in the field of comic \n     illustration.\n       (6) The ``Peanuts'' comic strip appeared in 2,600 \n     newspapers around the world daily until January 3, 2000, and \n     on Sundays until February 13, 2000, and reached approximately \n     335,000,000 readers every day in 20 different languages, \n     making Charles M. Schulz the most successful comic \n     illustrator in the world.\n       (7) Charles M. Schulz's television special, ``A Charlie \n     Brown Christmas'', has run for 34 consecutive years. In all, \n     more than 60 animated specials have been created based on \n     ``Peanuts'' characters. Four feature films, 1,400 books, and \n     a hit Broadway musical about the ``Peanuts'' characters have \n     also been produced.\n       (8) Charles M. Schulz was a leader in the field of comic \n     illustration and in his community. He paved the way for other \n     artists in this field over the last 50 years and continues to \n     be praised for his outstanding achievements.\n       (9) Charles M. Schulz gave back to his community in many \n     ways, including owning and operating Redwood Empire Ice Arena \n     in Santa Rosa, California. The arena has become a favorite \n     gathering spot for people of all ages. Charles M. Schulz also \n     financed a yearly ice show that drew crowds from all over the \n     San Francisco Bay Area.\n       (10) Charles M. Schulz gave the Nation a unique sense of \n     optimism, purpose, and\n\n[[Page S3269]]\n\n     pride. Whether through the Great Pumpkin Patch, the Kite \n     Eating Tree, Lucy's Psychiatric Help Stand, or Snoopy's \n     adventures with the Red Baron, ``Peanuts'' embodied human \n     vulnerabilities, emotions, and potential.\n       (11) Charles M. Schulz's lifetime of work linked \n     generations of Americans and became a part of the fabric of \n     our national culture.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.\n\n       (a) Award Authorized.--The President is authorized to award \n     posthumously, on behalf of the Congress, a gold medal of \n     appropriate design to Charles M. Schulz in recognition of his \n     lasting artistic contributions to the Nation and the world.\n       (b) Design and Striking.--For the purpose of the award \n     referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury \n     (hereafter in this Act referred to as the ``Secretary'') \n     shall strike a gold medal with suitable emblems, devices, and \n     inscriptions, to be determined by the Secretary.\n\n     SEC. 3. DUPLICATE MEDALS.\n\n       Under such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, the \n     Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of the \n     gold medal struck under section 2 at a price sufficient to \n     cover the costs of the medals, including labor, materials, \n     dies, use of machinery, overhead expenses, and the cost of \n     the gold medal.\n\n     SEC. 4. NATIONAL MEDALS.\n\n       The medals struck under this Act are national medals for \n     purposes of chapter 51 of title 31, United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 5. FUNDING AND PROCEEDS OF SALE.\n\n       (a) Authorization.--There is authorized to be charged \n     against the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund an \n     amount not to exceed $30,000 to pay for the cost of the \n     medals authorized by this Act.\n       (b) Proceeds of Sale.--Amounts received from the sale of \n     duplicate bronze medals under section 3 shall be deposited in \n     the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe agreed to, the bill be read a third time and passed, the amendment \nto the title be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3109) was agreed to.\n  The bill (H.R. 3642), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n  The title was amended so as to read: ``To authorize the President to \naward posthumously a gold medal on behalf of the Congress to Charles M. \nSchulz in recognition of his lasting artistic contributions to the \nNation and the world, and for other purposes.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/02/senate-section/article/S3269-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3269]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   FAIR ACCESS TO JAPANESE TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES AND SERVICES\n\n  Mr. GORTON.

Res. 275\n\n       Whereas the United States has a deep and sustained interest \n     in the promotion of deregulation, competition, and regulatory \n     reform in Japan;\n       Whereas new and bold measures by the Government of Japan \n     regarding regulatory reform will help remove the regulatory \n     and structural impediments to the effective functioning of \n     market forces in the Japanese economy;\n       Whereas regulatory reform will increase the efficient \n     allocation of resources in Japan, which is critical to \n     returning Japan to a long-term growth path powered by \n     domestic demand;\n       Whereas regulatory reform will not only improve market \n     access for United States business and other foreign firms, \n     but will also enhance consumer choice and economic prosperity \n     in Japan;\n       Whereas a sustained recovery of the Japanese economy is \n     vital to a sustained recovery of Asian economies;\n       Whereas the Japanese economy must serve as one of the main \n     engines of growth for Asia and for the global economy;\n       Whereas the Governments of the United States and Japan \n     reconfirmed the critical importance of deregulation, \n     competition, and regulatory reform when the 2 Governments \n     established the Enhanced Initiative on Deregulation and \n     Competition Policy in 1997;\n       Whereas telecommunications is a critical sector requiring \n     reform in Japan, where the market is hampered by a history of \n     laws, regulations, and monopolistic practices that do not \n     meet the needs of a competitive market;\n       Whereas as the result of Japan's laws, regulations, and \n     monopolistic practices, Japanese consumers and Japanese \n     industry have been denied the broad benefits of innovative \n     telecommunications services, cutting edge technology, and \n     lower prices that competition would bring to the market;\n       Whereas Japan's significant lag in developing broadband and \n     Internet services, and Japan's lag in the entire area of \n     electronic commerce, is a direct result of a noncompetitive \n     telecommunications regulatory structure;\n       Whereas Japan's lag in developing broadband and Internet \n     services is evidenced by the following: (1) Japan has only \n     17,000,000 Internet users, while the United States has \n     80,000,000 Internet users; (2) Japan hosts fewer than \n     2,000,000 websites, while the United States hosts over \n     30,000,000 websites; (3) electronic commerce in Japan is \n     valued at less than $1,000,000,000, while in the United \n     States electronic commerce is valued at over $30,000,000,000; \n     and (4) 19 percent of Japan's schools are connected to the \n     Internet, while in the United States 89 percent of schools \n     are connected;\n       Whereas the disparity between the United States and Japan \n     is largely caused by the failure of Japan to ensure \n     conditions that allow for the development of competitive \n     networks which would stimulate the use of the Internet and \n     electronic commerce;\n       Whereas leading edge foreign telecommunications companies, \n     because of their high level of technology and innovation, are \n     the key to building the necessary telecommunications \n     infrastructure in Japan, which will only be able to serve \n     Japanese consumers and industry if there is a fundamental \n     change in Japan's regulatory approach to telecommunications;

Con. Res. 81\n\n       Whereas Rabiya Kadeer, a prominent ethnic Uighur from the \n     Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (XUAR) of the People's \n     Republic of China, her secretary, and her son were arrested \n     on August 11, 1999, in the city of Urumqi;\n       Whereas Rabiya Kadeer's arrest occurred outside the Yindu \n     Hotel in Urumqi as she was attempting to meet a group of \n     congressional staff staying at the Yindu Hotel as part of an \n     official visit to China organized under the auspices of the \n     Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Program of the \n     United States Information Agency;\n       Whereas Rabiya Kadeer's husband Sidik Rouzi, who has lived \n     in the United States since 1996 and works for Radio Free \n     Asia, has been critical of the policies of the People's \n     Republic of China toward Uighurs in Xinjiang;\n       Whereas Rabiya Kadeer was sentenced on March 10 to 8 years \n     in prison ``with deprivation of political rights for two \n     years'' for the crime of ``illegally giving state information \n     across the border'';\n       Whereas the Urumqi Evening Paper of March 12 reported \n     Rabiya Kadeer's case as follows: ``The court investigated the \n     following: The defendant Rabiya Kadeer, following the request \n     of her husband, Sidik Haji, who has settled in America, \n     indirectly bought a collection of the Kashgar Paper dated \n     from 1995-1998, 27 months, and some copies of the Xinjiang \n     Legal Paper and on 17 June 1999 sent them by post to Sidik \n     Haji. These were found by the customs. During July and August \n     1999 defendant Rabiya Kadeer gave copies of the Ili Paper and \n     Ili Evening Paper collected by others to Mohammed Hashem to \n     keep. Defendant Rabiya Kadeer sent these to Sidik Haji. Some \n     of these papers contained the speeches of leaders of \n     different levels; speeches about the strength of \n     rectification of public safety, news of political legal \n     organisations striking against national separatists and \n     terrorist activities etc. The papers sent were marked and \n     folded at relevant articles. As well as this, on 11 August \n     that year, defendant Rabiya Kadeer, following her husband's \n     phone commands, took a previously prepared list of people who \n     had been handled by judicial organisations, with her to \n     Kumush Astana Hotel [Yingdu Hotel] where she was to meet a \n     foreigner'';\n       Whereas reports indicate that Ablikim Abdyirim was sent to \n     a labor camp on November 26 for 2 years without trial for \n     ``supporting Uighur separatism,'' and Rabiya Kadeer's \n     secretary was recently sentenced to 3 years in a labor camp;\n       Whereas Rabiya Kadeer has 5 children, 3 sisters, and a \n     brother living in the United States, in addition to her \n     husband, and Kadeer has expressed a desire to move to the \n     United States;\n       Whereas the People's Republic of China stripped Rabiya \n     Kadeer of her passport long before her arrest;\n       Whereas reports indicate that Kadeer's health may be at \n     risk;\n       Whereas the People's Republic of China signed the \n     International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on \n     October 5, 1998;\n       Whereas that Covenant requires signatory countries to \n     guarantee their citizens the right to legal recourse when \n     their rights have been violated, the right to liberty and \n     freedom of movement, the right to presumption of innocence \n     until guilt is proven, the right to appeal a conviction, \n     freedom of thought, conscience, and religion, freedom of \n     opinion and expression, and freedom of assembly and \n     association;\n       Whereas that Covenant forbids torture, inhuman or degrading \n     treatment, and arbitrary arrest and detention;\n       Whereas the first Optional Protocol to the International \n     Covenant on Civil and Political Rights enables the Human \n     Rights Committee, set up under that Covenant, to receive and \n     consider communications from individuals claiming to be \n     victims of violations of any of the rights set forth in the \n     Covenant; and\n       Whereas in signing that Covenant on behalf of the People's \n     Republic of China, Ambassador Qin Huasun, Permanent \n     Representative of the People's Republic of China to the \n     United Nations, said the following: ``To realize human rights \n     is the aspiration of all humanity.

The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3707) to authorize funds for the construction \n     of a facility in Taipei, Taiwan suitable for the mission of \n     the American Institute in Taiwan.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nbill, which had been reported from the Committee on Foreign Relations, \nwith an amendment to strike all after the enacting clause and insert \nthe following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``American Institute in Taiwan \n     Facilities Enhancement Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) in the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 (22 U.S.C. 3301 et \n     seq.), the Congress established the American Institute in \n     Taiwan (hereafter in this Act referred to as ``AIT''), a \n     nonprofit corporation incorporated in the District of \n     Columbia, to carry out on behalf of the United States \n     Government any and all programs, transactions, and other \n     relations with Taiwan;\n       (2) the Congress has recognized AIT for the successful role \n     it has played in sustaining and enhancing United States \n     relations with Taiwan;\n       (3) the Taipei office of AIT is housed in buildings which \n     were not originally designed for the important functions that \n     AIT performs, whose location does not provide adequate \n     security for its employees, and which, because they are \n     almost 50 years old, have become increasingly expensive to \n     maintain;\n       (4) the aging state of the AIT office building in Taipei is \n     neither conducive to the safety and welfare of AIT's American \n     and local employees nor commensurate with the level of \n     contact that exists between the United States and Taiwan;\n       (5) AIT has made a good faith effort to set aside funds for \n     the construction of a new office building, but these funds \n     will be insufficient to construct a building that is large \n     and secure enough to meet AIT's current and future needs; and\n       (6) because the Congress established AIT and has a strong \n     interest in United States relations with Taiwan, the Congress \n     has a special responsibility to ensure that AIT's \n     requirements for safe and appropriate office quarters are \n     met.\n\n     SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       (a) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated the sum of $75,000,000 to AIT--\n       (1) for plans for a new facility and, if necessary, \n     residences or other structures located in close physical \n     proximity to such facility, in Taipei, Taiwan, for AIT to \n     carry out its purposes under the Taiwan Relations Act; and\n       (2) for acquisition by purchase or construction of such \n     facility, residences, or other structures.\n       (b) Limitations.--Funds appropriated pursuant to subsection \n     (a) may only be used if the new facility described in that \n     subsection meets all requirements applicable to the security \n     of United States diplomatic facilities, including the \n     requirements in the Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Anti-\n     Terrorism Act of 1986 (22 U.S.C. 4801 et seq.) and the Secure \n     Embassy Construction and Counterterrorism Act of 1999 (as \n     enacted by section 1000(a)(7) of Public Law 106-113; 113 Stat \n     1501A-451), except for those requirements which the Director \n     of AIT certifies to the Committee on International Relations \n     of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations of the Senate are not applicable on account of the \n     special status of AIT. In making such certification, the \n     Director shall also certify that security considerations \n     permit the exercise of the waiver of such requirements.\n       (c) Availability of Funds.--Amounts appropriated pursuant \n     to subsection (a) are authorized to remain available until \n     expended.\n\n  Mr. GORTON.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 521, S. Res. \n272.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 272) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate that the United States should remain actively engaged \n     in southeastern Europe to promote long-term peace, stability, \n     and prosperity; continue to vigorously oppose the brutal \n     regime of Slobodan Milosevic while supporting the efforts of \n     the democratic opposition; and fully implement the Stability \n     Pact.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution, which had been reported from the Committee on Foreign \nRelations, with an amendment to strike all after the resolving clause \nand insert in lieu thereof the following:\n\n       Whereas the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO's) \n     March 24, 1999 through June 10, 1999 bombing of the Federal \n     Republic of Yugoslavia focused the attention of the \n     international community of southeastern Europe;\n       Whereas the international community, in particular the \n     United States and the European Union, made a commitment at \n     the conclusion of the bombing campaign to integrate \n     southeastern Europe into the broader European community;\n       Whereas there is an historic opportunity for the \n     international community to help the people of southeastern \n     Europe break the cycle of violence, retribution, and revenge \n     and move towards respect for minority rights, establishment \n     of the rule of law, and the further development of democratic \n     governments;\n       Whereas the Stability Pact was established in July 1999 \n     with the goal of promoting cooperation among the countries of \n     southeastern Europe, with a focus on long-term political \n     stability and peace, security, democratization, and economic \n     reconstruction and development;\n       Whereas the effective implementation of the Stability Pact \n     is important to the long-term peace and stability in the \n     region;\n       Whereas the people and Government of the Former Yugoslav \n     Republic of Macedonia have a positive record of respect for \n     minority rights, the rule of law, and democratic traditions \n     since independence;\n       Whereas the people of Croatia have recently elected leaders \n     that respect minority rights, the rule of law, and democratic \n     traditions;\n       Whereas positive development in the Former Yugoslav \n     Republic of Macedonia and the Republic of Croatia will \n     clearly indicate to the people of Serbia that economic \n     program and integration into the international community is \n     only possibly if Milosevic is removed from power; and\n       Whereas the Republic of Slovenia continues to serve as a \n     model for the region as it moves closer to European Union and \n     NATO membership: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n       That the Senate--\n       (1) welcomes the tide of democratic change in southeastern \n     Europe, particularly the free and fair elections in Croatia, \n     and the regional cooperation taking place under the umbrella \n     of the Stability Pact;\n       (2) recognizes that in this trend, the regime of Slobodan \n     Milosevic is ever more an anomaly, the only government in the \n     region not democratically elected, and an obstacle to peace \n     and neighborly relations in the region;\n       (3) expresses its sense that the United States cannot have \n     normal relations with Belgrade as long as the Milosevic \n     regime is in power;\n       (4) views Slobodan Milosevic as a brutal indicted war \n     criminal, responsible for immeasurable bloodshed, ethnic \n     hatred, and human rights abuses in southeastern Europe in \n     recent years;\n       (5) considers international sanctions an essential tool to \n     isolate the Milosevic regime and promote democracy, and urges \n     the Administration to intensify, focus, and expand those \n     sanctions that most effectively target the regime and its key \n     supporters;\n       (6) supports strongly the efforts of the Serbian people to \n     establish a democratic government and endorses their call for \n     early, free, and fair elections;\n       (7) looks forward to establishing a normal relationship \n     with a new democratic government in Serbia, which will permit \n     an end to Belgrade's isolation and the opportunity to restore \n     the historically friendly relations between the Serbian and \n     American people;\n       (8) expresses the readiness of the Senate, once there is a \n     democratic government in Serbia, to review conditions for \n     Serbia's full reintegration into the international community;\n       (9) expresses its readiness to assist a future democratic \n     government in Serbia to build a democratic, peaceful, and \n     prosperous society, based on the same principle of respect \n     for international obligations, as set out by the Organization \n     for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the United \n     Nations, which guide the relations of the United States with \n     other countries in southeastern Europe;\n       (10) calls upon the United States and other Western \n     democracies to publicly announce and demonstrate to the \n     Serbian people the magnitude of assistance they could expect \n     after democratization;\n       (11) recognizes the importance of opposition mayors in \n     Serbia, and encourages the effort of the Administration to \n     include such mayors in the humanitarian and democratization \n     efforts of the United States in Serbia; and\n       (12) recognizes the progress in democratic and market \n     reform made by Montenegro, which can serve as a model for \n     Serbia, and urges a peaceful resolution of political \n     differences over the abrogation of Montenegro's rights under \n     the federal constitution.\n\n  Mr. GORTON.

Mr. President, I wish to say a few words as we embark on \ndebating ESEA. I hope not to be very long. First, I am glad we are \ndebating this bill, because education is such an important issue to \nAmerica as we move into the 21st century. We have moved into an economy \nthat is based on ideas. Alan Greenspan put it best. He said that high \nvalue is added no longer by moving things--when you make a car with \nmoving things, such as putting in a carburetor here or brakes there--\nbut, rather, by thinking things. All the new technology, such as the \nInternet, information systems, allow an idea to be transported quickly \nand inexpensively, which gives ideas so much more power.\n  In that kind of society, we can't afford to have an educational \nsystem that is even second. As we all know, our education system, at \nleast elementary and secondary, isn't even in the top 10. If we want to \nstay the leading economic power of the world, which I think we all do, \nwe have to make our educational system better.\n  In the past, the Federal Government has stayed away from education. I \nargue that there is a national imperative for us to be more involved, \nnot to dictate to the localities what they have to do--that has been a \nmistake this Government has entered into far too much in the past--but \ncertainly to help and aid in education.\n  I note that education in America is funded by the property tax, by \nand large. That is the least popular tax in America, and it puts a real \ncap on what can be done. Education is done locally, and so there isn't \ntoo much ability, when you have thousands and thousands of school \ndistricts, to have people think beyond the day-to-day need of providing \nteaching and other educational services in schools.\n  The need of the Federal Government to be involved with resources and \njust as important, if not more important, taking ideas and helping \nspread them, ideas that have worked in one corner of the country but \ndon't spread to the rest of the country because it is not a \ncapitalistic system--usually we spread ideas because somebody makes \nmoney by doing that, but that doesn't happen in public education--is \nvital.\n  So when the Federal Government says we should have higher standards, \nthat is a good thing. I believe and I agree with those who believe in \nhigher standards. I don't believe in social promotion. If you are \nreading at a third-grade level, you should not be in the seventh grade. \nI agree with my conservative friends in that regard. But I think my \nmore liberal friends are right in that we have to help keep the bar \nhigh, and conservatives are right about that, but we ought to help \npeople get over that bar. If education were completely left up to each \nlocality, that probably would not happen. The bar would not be set high \nenough and the effort to help people get over the bar might not be \nforthcoming. So, in my judgment at least, we need more Federal \ninvolvement. I think the American people share that judgment. From the \ndata I have seen, that is pretty clear.\n  Another problem we face is that our system is probably going to be \nunder more stress, not less, in the future. The number of people \nenrolled is expected to increase by 11 percent. The schools age; the \nsame exact school was in better shape in 1990 than in the year 2000. I \nhave recently visited school districts, fairly affluent ones, on Long \nIsland where the facilities were simply a mess. They had been built \nduring the baby boom in the fifties, sixties, and seventies, and, quite \nfrankly, even those rather affluent districts didn't have the money to \nfix the schools. They were sort of a mess; they were not great places \nto look at. Paint was peeling from some of the ceilings.\n  Most importantly an area I have chosen to focus on, which we will \ntalk a little bit about, is the fact that we are going to have a crisis \nin teaching. We don't today, but we will in the next 5 or 10 years \nbecause so many of our teachers are over 50 years old and they are \ngoing to retire. Quite frankly, many of the new teachers who take their \nplace are not up to speed, or at least not of the same quality as the \nold teachers.\n  When we have a starting salary of $26,000, which we do for teachers \nin America, and the private sector can pay double that, particularly in \ncertain areas such as math and science and technology, we are not going \nto be getting the best.\n  In the past, we had captive audiences with cohorts of groups who \nwould teach in the 1930s and 1940s. There were lots of Depression \nbabies. ``Go get a civil service job so you will never risk that \nhorrible feeling of being unemployed and unable to provide for your \nfamily.'' In the 1950s and 1960s, women taught; they didn't have other \nopportunities.\n  I had so many great teachers when I went through New York public \nschools.\n  The last cohort which is now retiring in large numbers is my \ngeneration--I am 49--the Vietnam war generation, as you may recall. \nYoung men were given a draft exemption if they taught and hundreds of \nthousands did. They made very fine teachers. But we don't have those \ncaptive audiences, so we have a crisis in having quality teaching.\n  I will be talking more about that when we do our Democratic \namendment. I am happy to have the Inspired Scholarship Program as part \nof it. We will talk, hopefully, about other amendments that are on this \nfloor, including some of mine which would allow teachers, if they \ntaught for 5 years, to forgo repaying their student loans--we would \nprovide a test in math and science--to give teachers a $4,000-a-year \nstipend so they would continue teaching. We have some true excellence. \nI will be talking about all of those later.\n  What I would like to talk about now is just two things, one on this \nbill. I truly pray that the majority leader will not cut off debate \nquickly. We have debated education. We debate it only once every 5 \nyears. The last time we did I believe was in 1994--6 years ago. \nOriginally it was 5.\n  In the area where about 37 percent of Americans consider the most \nimportant thing the Federal Government can do, to have a 1- or 2-day \ndebate really doesn't make much sense. It doesn't live up to what this \nbody is about, which is helping people in need.\n  To say that because we passed Ed-Flex--a nice program but really \nrather minor in what it does, and only one new State has joined since \nwe passed again the bill last year, or earlier this year--and to say \nthat educational savings accounts, which I believe the President might \nveto, but even if he does not, don't deal with the hard-core issues of \nhigher standards, better teachers, better classrooms, and smaller class \nsize--to say, having done those two things, that we have done enough \nand sort of wash our hands of it and walk away would be nothing short \nof disgraceful. Yet that is the talk.\n  We should be debating amendments that will make our schools better. \nThere are lots of them. Some of the proposals will pass; many will \nfail. To have that debate not only helps educate America but it also \nhelps educate each of us. It helps educate one another of us and helps \nus come to consensus because I believe we will not wait 5 years to do \nanother education bill. I believe within the next 2 or 3 years the \ncrisis, which is looming largely on the horizon now, will be so upon \nus; whether the new President is Al Gore or George W. Bush, we will be \ntalking about education with frequency. We had better get used to it, \nand we shouldn't delay that now.\n  A number of us have gotten together and agreed to do an amendment \nabout school safety dealing with guns. We don't want to have 20, 30, or \n40 amendments. There is no attempt whatsoever to delay or bog down this \nbill. We want to see this bill moved and passed. But school safety is \nan important issue.\n\n  The fact that so many of us believe strongly in gun control and have \ncome together and put together one amendment which will be offered by \nthe Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Lautenberg, who has been such a leader \non this issue, is no attempt to divert us or to slow this bill down. If \nwe wanted to do that, we would have asked for many amendments.\n  If the majority leader, in his wisdom, should decide to pull the bill \nbecause there is that one amendment, I think most Americans would \nbelieve we really do not want to debate education and that it was just \nan excuse.\n  The second thing I would like to talk about a little bit is the block \ngrant,\n\n[[Page S3273]]\n\nwhich is really the main debate we will be having.\n  Is the Federal Government going to be involved in education and just \ngiving the money unfettered--how I would characterize it--to the States \nor to the school districts or, rather, we should say: Here is a need \nand here is some money; We are not forcing you to use it; This is not a \nmandate; But if you want the money, you have to meet certain rules, \ncertain standards, and apply under certain standards.\n  The greatest area I have experience with in this realm is the issue \nof crime. We tried the block grant route with crime. It was a fiasco. \nGovernor after Governor, locally-elected official after locally-elected \nofficial--the LEA program, the law enforcement assistance grant, a \nblock grant devised by Jimmy Carter and certainly supported by many \nDemocrats--just wasted the money.\n  We had instances of a tank being purchased by one State. I think it \nwas in the State of Indiana where the Governor purchased an airplane \nunder LEA so he could fly to Washington to discuss crime issues. Money \nwas wasted.\n  A few short years after LEA was passed and the money was \nappropriated, it was withdrawn with its tail between its legs. That \nissue could be repeated in education. I wasn't around. I was actually \nin high school when we passed the block grants in 1965. Again, this was \ndone by Democrats. Imagine it is 1965--it was a Congress that was \noverwhelmingly Democrat--and the same thing that happened to crime \nhappened in education; money was just wasted.\n  Here is an example. There were blank checks: $35,000 was spent on \nband uniforms, $2,200 was spent on football uniforms, $63,000 was spent \nto purchase 18 portable swimming pools, and $16,000 was spent on \nconstruction of two lagoons for sewage disposal.\n  Do we want to repeat that? Do we want to see that kind of waste and \npatronage when we give a locality money? They don't have to sweat to \nraise the taxes for it. They are getting free money, and we say, \nbasically, spend it on what you want. It is a formula for disaster. \nThat is what it seems we are headed towards. It is just incredible to \nme.\n  There is an even deeper point, which is this:\n  We are all critical of our present educational system. We say it is \nnot working the way it should. Instead of changing, instead of trying \nto improve it, instead of saying here are ways, such as reducing class \nsize, or making classrooms better, or having better teachers, or having \nstandards, or having some accountability, we just give the money to the \nvery same school districts we criticize and say: Do whatever you want \nwith it. It is illogical.\n  The only way there should be a block grant is if we think the school \ndistricts are doing a great job and simply don't have enough money.\n  That is not a conservative argument. You hear more of that from the \nliberals. Yet the conservatives in this body are supporting block \ngrants--no standards, little accountability, no direction, spend it on \nwhat you wish. I am utterly amazed.\n  I think there are a lot of good debates we can have. I understand the \ndesire to keep schools locally controlled. But a block grant, a formula \nfor waste, and much of it going to the Governors so that money doesn't \neven trickle down?\n  If you ask the American people if they prefer a block grant or prefer \ntethered money to reduce class size, or to raise standards, or to \nimprove the quality of teachers, there is no question what they would \ndesire.\n  I hope my colleagues will listen to the debate we are going to have \non this bill. As I said before, I hope it is a fulsome debate. I hope \nit is a long debate. We cannot spend time on any issue that is more \nimportant than education.\n  I hope they will look at the proposals I have brought forward to \nimprove teachers. They are not ideological. Some involve tax breaks, \nsome involve raising standards. I hope we will decide that the role of \nthe Federal Government should be to raise the bar--because enough \nlocalities have not--and help people get over that bar rather than just \ngive them a sack of coins and say, ``Do what you will.''\n  I look forward to this debate. I think it is one of the most \nimportant we can have.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/02/senate-section/article/S3273-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3273]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
