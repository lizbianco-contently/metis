Before \nthat, he was at the First Baptist Church in Pawhuska, OK, which is \npretty close to my home town of Ponca City. He is really one of the \nmost respected leaders we have had in our state, and we still consider \nhim an Oklahoman. We are delighted to have him as guest Chaplain and \nvery much appreciate his opening our day with a beautiful prayer this \nmorning.\n  I thank Pastor Estep for joining us.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I, too, thank our guest Chaplain for being \nwith us today.

The distinguished Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. I now ask unanimous consent that there be 10 minutes of \ndebate, equally divided, between Senators Hutchison and Boxer prior to \nthe cloture vote on the Hutchison amendment No. 1603.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may we have order in the Senate so we may be \nable to hear the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from West Virginia \nis correct. We will not proceed until the Senate is in order.\n  If the distinguished Senator from Washington would repeat his \nrequest, please.\n  Mr. GORTON. I ask unanimous consent that there be 10 minutes of \ndebate equally divided between Senators Hutchison and Boxer prior to \nthe cloture vote on Hutchison amendment No. 1603.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, before it counts on my time, I ask the \nSenator from Texas if she wants to begin the debate or finish the \ndebate.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I will let the Senator from California \nproceed first.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  Once more, I tell the Senate, the reason I have taken the Senate's \ntime on this is twofold. First, it seems to me an amendment such as \nthis does not belong in the Interior bill. In essence, it is a very \nmajor policy change. Oil companies sign an agreement with the Federal \nGovernment that, when they have the privilege of drilling on Federal \nlands, be it onshore or offshore, they pay a percentage of the fair \nmarket value of the production to the Federal Government. This is very \nimportant because in the Federal Government we use that for the Land \nand Water Conservation Fund, which is so important for our environment, \nhistoric preservation, national parks, et cetera. The States use their \nshare to put the funds right into the classroom.\n  If this amendment is approved, if cloture is invoked and the \namendment is approved, the Land and Water Conservation Fund will lose \n$66 million. Because of this rider, which the Senator from Texas has \nput on these bills on three prior occasions, the Treasury has already \nlost $88 million. Mr. President, we badly need those funds for\n\n[[Page S11279]]\n\nthose important purposes of the environment and education.\n  What the Senator's amendment does is stop the Interior Department \nfrom collecting the appropriate amount of royalties. How do we know we \nare not getting the appropriate amount of royalties? We have \nwhistleblowers who have come forward and have told of a scheme to \ndefraud the United States of America of the due amount of royalties.\n  Just last month, a few weeks ago, Chevron agreed to settle a case on \nroyalties, $95 million. This is a headline from the Wall Street \nJournal: Chevron to Pay $95 Million to End Claim It Shortchanged U.S. \non Royalties.\n  The companies are settling these claims at an unbelievable rate--$5 \nbillion has already been settled by seven States. Twenty-five percent \nof these companies are cheating us, and they don't have a leg to stand \non. They don't want to go to court. Therefore, they are settling.\n  What we know, for example, is that in one of the recent suits that \nwas filed, the United States of America has joined two whistleblowers--\nand this is the first time this has ever been made public--outlining \nseven schemes by the oil companies to cheat Uncle Sam, cheat the \ntaxpayers out of the money. We have heard of the seven wonders of the \nworld, and we have heard of the 7 years war and the seven seas and \nseventh heaven and the 7-year itch and 007 and many 7s, but we have \nnever heard of the seven schemes of the oil companies until now. In \nessence, all seven schemes have one goal; that is, to show that the \nvalue of the oil is less than what it really is.\n  I think it is time to put an end to this. The USA Today headline says \nit all: It is Time to Clean Up Big Oil's Slick Deal with Congress.\n  Reading directly from the article:\n\n       Imagine being able to compute your own rent payments and \n     grocery bills, giving yourself a 3 percent to 10 percent \n     discount off the market price. Over time, that would add up \n     to really big bucks. And imagine having the political clout \n     to make sure nothing threatened to change that cozy \n     arrangement.\n\n  This amendment offered by my friend from Texas allows the oil \ncompanies to continue this cozy arrangement whereby they decide, these \n25 percent of the oil companies, what they are going to pay the Federal \nGovernment. In every case, it is below the fair market value.\n\n  This $66 million, as I said before, could do a lot of things. We \ncould hire 1,000 teachers with it, or put 44,000 new computers into the \nclassroom, or buy textbooks for 1.2 million students, or provide 53 \nmillion hot lunches for schoolchildren.\n  So let us not think, when we have this vote, it is a free vote. This \ncloture vote is very important. The Senator from Texas just about \nmustered enough votes. She doesn't have one vote to spare. If just one \nof my colleagues would hear my plea, stand up and say no to this \ncloture, we could stop this thievery in its tracks. That is what it \nis--out-and-out thievery. We need the funds for the functions of \ngovernment. We need the funds for the people of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on cloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute of my 5 to the junior \nSenator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Louisiana is \nrecognized for 1 minute.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Chair.\n  There have been so many misstatements and mischaracterizations and \nexaggerations and a confusion of facts, as stated by my distinguished \ncolleague from California, I literally don't know where to begin. This \nis not about the Land and Water Conservation Fund because there is no \nsuch real fund where this money goes, and she most certainly knows \nthat. It flows directly to the State treasury. I would know, since the \nState of Louisiana contributes 90 percent of the money to the so-called \nfund that doesn't exist.\n  This is not an environmental issue. This is about a very complicated \naccounting law governing what huge companies owe the Federal \nGovernment. They want to pay their fair share. They are actually \nbegging to pay their fair share. They want a law that makes clear what \ntheir fair share is, and they are willing to pay it. That is what this \nargument is about because the current rule makes it more complicated \nand more costly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the distinguished Senator has \nexpired.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. May I have 30 more seconds? Fifteen more seconds to \nfinish?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Just finish the statement.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I urge my colleagues to rethink their votes on our \nside. I am actually disappointed there are not more than five of us who \ntruly understand this issue, with all due respect. I hope some of them \nwill think about changing their vote so we can get on with the business \nof the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the senior Senator \nfrom Louisiana, Mr. Breaux.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, this question is really about whether we \nare going to pause for 12 months and negotiate or whether we are going \nto litigate for 5 years. I think the Hutchison amendment is very \nhelpful in that it says: Let's pause and, instead of fighting it out in \nthe courtroom, let's get people to talk about it in their offices, \nbetween Interior and industry, over what is a fair market value.\n  It is well worth a 12-month pause to try to negotiate instead of \nlitigating from here on after--that is all the Hutchison amendment \ndoes--in order to find out what a fair market value truly is. We should \nsupport it.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today over one-third of the price of a \ngallon of gasoline is taxable. This chart shows the average price of \ngasoline, around $1.20; crude oil is 64 cents, the light part of this \nchart; taxes are 56 cents.\n  Now, what the Senator from California would do is raise the price of \ngasoline for every working American by raising the taxes to go up and \nup. In fact, that is what has been happening over the last 10 years. \nFrom 1990 to 1997, the average per gallon motor fuel tax has gone from \n27 cents per gallon to 40 cents per gallon. The retail price net of \ntaxes has stayed approximately the same, going down from 95 cents to 88 \ncents. It has actually gone down, but taxes have gone up. Therefore, \nthe price of gasoline in 1990 went from $1.21 to $1.29 per gallon in \n1997.\n  What the Senator from California would do is add taxes on expenses. \nWe have always taxed at the wellhead. Today, we would tax the expenses, \nthe transportation expenses, that you have to make to get the oil to \nits destination, the marketing expenses. Can you imagine the concept of \ntaxing advertising being done by an agency without congressional \napproval and raising the price of gasoline for every working American? \nThat is what blocking this amendment will do. We have 60 votes to go \nforward; 60 people out of 100 in the Senate are saying we should go \nforward and have an up-or-down vote on this amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to do what is right and let us have an up-or-\ndown vote so that we don't raise the price of gasoline at the pump for \nevery working American.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from \nNew Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has approximately \n30 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, historically, the royalty has been \ncalculated at the wellhead. The essence of the problem is that MMS \ndecided they want to change that--in many instances, tax it as a \nroyalty many miles downstream. They contend there is a duty to market. \nA court has already ruled there is no duty to market. They want to come \nin by the back door and establish regulations and rules that will, \nindeed, tax beyond the real value of the oil, based upon rules and \nregulations. It is a new tax, a backdoor way of taking away our \nprerogative. That is why we have been fighting this for the last 3 \nyears.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, it will raise the price of gasoline at \nthe pump for every working American. I urge a vote for cloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time allotted to the distinguished Senator \nhas expired.\n\n[[Page S11280]]\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I yield my 3 hours to the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Boxer.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, for my own clarification, how much time do \nI have to speak on this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator has 1 hour.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, many people who have followed this debate \nover the last weeks and months, I am sure, are curious why the Senate \nhas been spending the amount of time it has on this particular issue. \nIt is an issue which is of great importance to many of us.\n  First, let me salute my colleague, the Senator from California, Mrs. \nBoxer. She has led this fight, and it has been a difficult fight. It \nhas involved many hours of debate. It has involved a lot of work on her \npart and that of her staff. I have been happy to join her and to add my \nvoice to her cause.\n  We have had what might be called a symbolic vote earlier which \nsuggests that ultimately the oil companies may prevail on this \namendment. But I really believe in my heart, if my colleagues, \nparticularly on the other side of the aisle, would just for a moment \nfollow this debate and come to understand what is at stake, they might \nhave a change of mind and a change of heart. Let me explain in the most \nbasic terms, as I understand them, why we are here and why we are \nfacing this debate.\n  Consider for a moment that we in the United States have many \ntreasures. Visitors to the Nation's Capitol can see ample evidence of \nthe legacy we have been given by previous generations. This magnificent \nbuilding and all the monuments and statues and museums in Washington, \nDC, are not owned by any person. They are owned by America. They are \nowned by the American people. But when it comes to our national \ntreasures, they also include public lands, many of them in remote \nplaces all across the United States, lands, frankly, that we as \ntaxpayers own and lands that have value.\n  This bill which we are considering, the Department of the Interior \nbill, is one which takes into account these lands and how they are \nmanaged. The Senate and the House, each in its role, has a chance each \nyear to make policy decisions about how we will manage these lands. \nThis year, on the Department of the Interior appropriations bill, \nseveral of my colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle have \noffered what have been called environmental riders.\n  To put that in common words, it is an amendment offered by a Senator \ntrying to limit, for example, the Department of the Interior in doing \ncertain things in relation to these public lands. So we have had a \nparade of amendments involving these public lands and how they will be \nused.\n  There have been amendments, for example, to initiate the mining of \nlead in the Mark Twain National Forest in Missouri. It is a suggestion \nopposed by the two major newspapers in Missouri, by the Governor, by \nthe attorney general, and by every environmental group. But a rider was \nproposed by a Senator from Missouri that would allow lead mining in \nthis Mark Twain National Forest, an area that is used for recreation. \nThat amendment prevailed. One Democratic Senator joined Republican \nSenators in what was an otherwise very partisan rollcall.\n  Another amendment was offered which related to the mining of minerals \non public lands, so-called hard rock mining. This amendment, which was \noffered, I believe, by the Senator from Washington, said that when it \ncame to the mining of those minerals, when companies, private \ncompanies, would come onto the land owned by America's taxpayers, we \nwould change the rules and say when they dumped their waste after their \nmining, they could have more acreage to dump on when they wanted to \nleave the land behind.\n  Of course, the mining companies love to mine on public lands because \nwe charge royalties which are a joke. They date back to a law over 100 \nyears old. It is not uncommon for a private mining company, some even \nforeign companies, to be able to mine for minerals on public lands \nowned by the taxpayers and to pay as little as $5 an acre--$5 an acre \nto mine for gold, for example. These companies can literally bring \nmillions of dollars of profit out of the public lands owned by this \ncountry and pay to the Federal Government $5, $10, $15, $100, $1,000.\n\n  So the amendment proposed by the Republican Senator suggested that \nwhen they mine this land at these bargain basement royalty prices, they \nwill be able to leave more and more acreage of waste dumped behind at \nthe expense of future generations.\n  We had another amendment relative to grazing. Particularly in the \nWest, grazing is an important use of western public lands. I support \nit. But the question was whether or not the ranchers who grazed on \nFederal lands would be able to renew their long-term leases, how much \nthey would pay, and what restrictions they would have on how\n\n[[Page S11281]]\n\nmuch grazing would be allowed. A Republican Senator from New Mexico \noffered an amendment which said these leases for the grazing permits \nwould be renewed almost indefinitely. Frankly, many of us thought that \nwas something we should question--whether or not we should, from time \nto time, make environmental reviews of the use of grazing permits to \nmake certain the public land ended up being used for the best purpose \nfor America.\n  So time and time again, we have seen a clear difference in philosophy \nfrom the other side of the aisle, the Republican side of the aisle, and \nthe Democratic side of the aisle when it comes to public lands. I will \nonly speak for myself, but I will tell you what my philosophy is. I \nbelieve these public lands are a public trust. I have been honored to \nrepresent the State of Illinois in the Senate. I believe, in my actions \nand in my votes, I should never compromise the integrity of this legacy \nof public lands that have been left for my supervision, entrusted to \nme. I have tried my best to vote so I can say, whenever I leave this \nbody, I took this treasure of public lands and returned it to the next \ngeneration in as good shape as, or better than, I received it. I think \nthat is consistent with the idea of conservation. It is consistent with \nthe idea of protection.\n  I concede, people can use public lands for profitmaking. That is \ndone, of course, by ranchers for grazing and by the mining industry for \nminerals. It is done, as we have discussed earlier, by those who want \nto come in and, for example, drill for oil. I believe companies that do \nthat, whether they are cutting wood or drilling for oil, should pay to \nthe American taxpayers fair compensation for using the land so I could \nsay, if ever held accountable: Yes, it is true, we did allow people to \ncut down trees on public lands; they paid for it; it was not something \nthat was in derogation of the value of the land to be left for future \ngenerations.\n  That is my philosophy: Protect the public lands. If people use them, \nthey should pay fair compensation to America and its taxpayers for the \nuse of the public lands.\n  The philosophy on the other side--I will try to characterize as best \nI can--is that the public lands are in some way an intrusion of the \nFederal Government into many of these States. I think there is a \ngeneral resentment that the Federal Government owns so much acreage in \nWestern States. Yet the fact is, if the Federal Government had not \nowned this acreage, it is really questionable whether some of these \nStates would have finally become populated or become part of the Union. \nThe Federal Government took control of the lands in the initiation of \nour great country, and over the years many of these lands have stayed \nin our control. I can understand that if I lived in a Western State, I \nmight have a different view. But, frankly, I do not believe they should \nbe viewed as antagonistic. These lands are part of our national \ntreasure.\n  Second, the view on the other side of the aisle is, if a private \ncompany wants to come in and make money off these public lands, we \nshould bend over backwards to make it easy for them and subsidize them. \nThat is why we have not changed that mining act for 100 years. That is \nwhy these companies are paying $5 an acre and taking thousands of \ndollars of profits, millions of dollars of profits, off that acreage \nand not paying more to the taxpayers. That is why they want to be \ngrazing these lands without the oversight of departments which decide \nwhether or not they are doing something that could harm the lands \npermanently.\n  So there is a real difference in philosophy between the Democratic \nside of the aisle and the Republican side of the aisle. And rider after \nrider, whether they talk about mining or logging or grazing or drilling \nfor oil, comes down to this basic same debate.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, really calls \nin question the idea of how much oil companies should pay if they are \ngoing to drill for oil on public lands and which they turn around and \nsell at a profit.\n  Frankly, I have no objection if the drilling for that oil does not \ncreate an environmental hazard or environmental problem. These \ncompanies should be allowed to bid and to responsibly drill for oil. It \nis good for America's energy needs. It creates jobs in the area. It is \nsomething with which I do not have a problem.\n  The Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer, and I come to this Chamber \nto oppose an amendment being offered by the Senator from Texas. The \namendment says this: The Department of the Interior, which is to \nestablish the amount of money, the royalty, paid by the oil companies \nto drill on public lands, will be prohibited, by the Hutchison \namendment, from revising that royalty to reflect the cost and value of \nthe oil that is drilled.\n  I believe this is the fourth time we have gone through this where \nthey have stopped the Department of the Interior from revising upwards \nthe amount of money taxpayers receive in royalties for drilling oil on \npublic lands, despite the fact the law clearly says: Yes, owner of the \noil company, you can use public land, but you owe the taxpayers \nsomething; pay the taxpayers for profit you are taking out of their \nland.\n  Yet the Hutchison amendment says: No, we do not want to revise the \nroyalty schedule; we do not want to make certain that the taxpayers \nreceive fair compensation and the oil companies pay what they are \nrequired to pay under the law.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am so pleased the Senator is taking us back to the \nbasics of this amendment which, as he pointed out, has essentially been \noffered to the Interior appropriations bill on three previous occasions \nin the committee on which he serves, the Appropriations Committee. We \nhave tried to fight it in that committee only to be outvoted basically \non a party-line vote.\n  This is the first time, I know my friend is aware, we have had a vote \non this in the Senate. I underscore and ask a question of my friend.\n  My friend points out there is a problem with some of the oil \ncompanies, that they are not paying their fair share of royalties, and \nthe Secretary of the Interior, Bruce Babbitt, wants to make sure \neveryone pays their fair share.\n  Is my colleague aware that 95 percent of the oil companies are doing \nthe right thing? I want to make sure he understands the problem lies \nwith 5 percent of the oil companies that are ripping off the people. I \nhope he responds to that, and I have an additional question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from California, this chart \ndemonstrates what she has already stated. The percentage of companies \naffected by this rule is only 5 percent, 68 percent of the Federal \nproduction; 95 percent of the oil companies, particularly the small and \nindependent companies, are not affected by this debate. We are talking \nabout the big boys. We are talking about the big oil companies and \nwhether they are going to use our Federal public lands to make a profit \nand pay the taxpayers a fair share of their profit back to our \nTreasury.\n  When I heard the debate on the floor that I heard earlier suggesting \nthat if these big oil companies have to pay their fair share of \nroyalties, the price of a gallon of gasoline is going to go up at the \npump, it is almost laughable. We are talking about such a small amount \nof money in terms of these multimillion-dollar oil companies but a \nsignificant amount of money which would come back to Federal taxpayers \nand to the States that are affected for very important purposes.\n\n  The Senator from California is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend. I know he gets this completely. I also \nwant to make sure he knows and that he puts into his remarks the fact \nthat as a result of these three prior riders the Senator from Texas, \nMrs. Hutchison, has put on these bills, we have already lost to the \nFederal Treasury $88 million. Is my friend aware of it? And is my \nfriend aware what this particular amendment will do to add to that $88 \nmillion? I see he has a terrific chart which explains it all. I yield \nto him for an answer.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Just by coincidence, I happen to have a chart which \nillustrates this because this is a point we made during the course of \nthe debate. The cost of this amendment, offered by Senator Hutchison, \nto the taxpayers of America is $66 million. The amount of money the \ntaxpayers have lost to date is $88 million.\n\n[[Page S11282]]\n\n  With both amendments, if this amendment prevails today, America's \ntaxpayers will lose $154 million which these oil companies were \nrequired to pay for the purpose of drilling oil on public land, oil \nwhich, of course, has generated great profits for them and their \ncompanies.\n  This observation, that these companies have not paid their fair share \nfor the royalties, has been backed up by lawsuits. States which receive \nthe benefits of some of these royalty dollars have turned around and \nsued these oil companies and said they are not paying what they are \nrequired to pay under the law. In State after State, we have seen the \noil companies basically concede, yes, we are underpaying the royalties \nwe owe taxpayers.\n  Take a look at these recent oil undervaluation settlements. State by \nState: Alaska, $3.7 billion; Louisiana, $400 million; California, $345 \nmillion; Texas, $30 million. In all, we have collected $5 billion these \noil companies have underpaid, their statutory obligation to pay \nroyalties on this land.\n  For the proponents of this amendment to argue that it is \nfundamentally unfair to require private oil companies to pay these \nroyalties and that these formulas for payment are unfair is to ignore \nthe reality that time and time again, when the oil companies have been \nchallenged, they have been found guilty of having cheated the taxpayers \nout of the fair share of money they were supposed to pay.\n  The Hutchison amendment says we will not change this formula; we will \nnot update it; we will not hold these oil companies accountable. We \nwill say to the Department of the Interior: Walk away from it; let the \noil companies make the profit they want; do not let the taxpayers \nreceive the fair compensation to which they are entitled.\n  A lot of this money, incidentally, that goes to States is used for \npurposes which are absolutely essential. One of them is education. What \nis $66 million worth in terms of education? That is how much this \namendment will cost the Federal Treasury and how much it will leave in \nthe hands of the oil companies. What can one do with $66 million?\n  By Federal standards, people say: Don't you people deal in billions? \nWhat does $66 million mean?\n\n  With $66 million, you can hire 1,000 teachers. You can put 44,000 new \ncomputers in classrooms. You can buy textbooks for 1.2 million \nstudents. You can provide 53 million hot lunches for schoolchildren.\n  Mr. President, $66 million may be small change by some Senators' \nstandards, but when it comes to running schools and providing good \neducation, it turns out to be a very important part of the component of \nmeeting our obligation.\n  Also, this has been an issue which has received a lot of attention. \nIn fact, one of the articles which I think is extraordinary came from a \npublication which I rarely would run into, but it is Platt's Oilgram \nNews. I cannot say as I have ever read it or subscribed to it.\n  On Thursday, July 22, 1999, a retired employee from ARCO, one of the \nmajor oil companies involved in this debate, said that his company \ndeliberately underpaid the oil royalties to the Federal Government. \nThis was not a miscalculation. This was not an accidental occurrence. A \ncalculated decision was made by the oil company to shortchange \nAmerica's taxpayers by refusing to pay the royalties required by law \nbecause they felt that some day they may be sued as a result of that \ndecision and they would just as soon hold on to the money, declare it \nas profit, make interest on it, and run a risk they would have a \nlawsuit and a day of reckoning sometime in the future.\n  This gentleman, Mr. Anderson, is quoted at length in the article:\n\n       I was an ARCO employee, he said. Some of the issues being \n     discussed were still being litigated. My plan was to get to \n     retirement. We had seen numerous occasions, the nail that \n     stood up getting beat down.\n       . . .The senior executives of ARCO had the judgment that \n     they would take the money, accrue for the day of judgment, \n     and that's what we did. I would not have been there in any \n     capacity had I continued to exercise the right they had given \n     me to dissent to this process during the discussion stage. \n     But once we made our decisions, ranks closed . . . I did not \n     get to be a manager and remain a manager being oblivious and \n     blind to signals.\n\n  A calculated corporate decision to underpay the Federal Government: \nLeave the money in the bank and earn interest on it and wait to be \nsued.\n  So the Hutchison amendment basically says: The Department of the \nInterior should ignore this, ignore the fact that oil companies are \nbasically cheating the taxpayers out of the money to which they are \nentitled.\n  Recently there was a lawsuit filed, which the Senator from California \nbrought to my attention, that raised the question of this effort by the \noil companies. They came up, in that lawsuit, with what they call the \nseven schemes by which these oil companies were basically cheating \nAmerica's taxpayers:\n  No. 1, misrepresenting the actual value received for oil;\n  No. 2, buying and selling crude oil at values less than what would \nhave been received in an arm's length transaction;\n  No. 3, selling oil to their affiliates to mask the true value;\n  No. 4, claiming an artificially low value for oil refined by the \ncompany itself;\n  No. 5, falsely classifying high-valued sweet oil as lower-priced sour \ncrude oil;\n  No. 6, paying royalties on the basis of lower-valued oil, then \ncommingling it with higher-valued and selling it as high-quality oil;\n  No. 7, claiming payment of certain fees on commingled oil when such \nfees were never paid.\n  Those are schemes that have been used by these oil companies to avoid \npaying the royalty they are required to pay under law.\n  They want to drill on public lands. They want to make a profit. They \ndo not want to pay back to America the cost we have incurred in \nallowing them to take this oil from the land. They have been caught \ntime and time again with their hands in the cookie jar.\n  The Hutchison amendment says: We are not going to pursue these oil \ncompanies any further. We are going to say to the Department of the \nInterior: You cannot enforce the law. You cannot enforce the \nrequirement that these oil companies pay their fair share in royalties.\n  There are many special interests at work on Capitol Hill. I would be \nthe first to admit it, having served here for 17 years. This is one of \nthe more blatant examples I have seen, where companies have basically \ncome in and said: We want to be exempt from the law.\n  The Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer, has fought a valiant fight \nto bring this issue to public attention. Time after time, publications \nacross America, which have taken a look at this issue, have reached the \nconclusion that the Senator from California is right and this amendment \nis wrong.\n  In the USA Today--and this is from last year; same issue, same type \nof amendment--the editorial is entitled ``Time to clean up Big Oil's \nslick deal with Congress.'' Let me read just a few words here from the \nUSA Today editorial of August 26, 1998:\n\n       Imagine being able to compute your own rent payments and \n     grocery bills, giving yourself a 3% to 10% discount off the \n     market price. Over time, that would add up to really big \n     bucks. And imagine having the political clout to make sure \n     nothing [ever] threatened to change that cozy arrangement.\n       According to government and private studies, that's the \n     sweet deal the oil industry is fighting to protect: the \n     right to extract crude oil from public land and pay the \n     government not the open market price but a lower ``posted \n     price''--based on private deals--\n\n  The schemes I mentioned earlier--\n\n     the oil companies can manipulate for their own benefit.\n\n  They go on to talk about the fact that it is no secret that these oil \ncompanies are big players in Washington. They make contributions to \nMembers of Congress. And, of course, when the time comes, they expect \nat least a day in court, if not some help, when their issues come to \nthe floor. This is a classic illustration.\n  It just strikes me as odd that companies that otherwise enjoy \npositive reputations are willing to fight so viciously to protect what \nhas been unmasked as a scheme to defraud America's taxpayers.\n  In the scheme of things, if this 5 percent of the major oil companies \npaid $66 million more a year to the Federal Treasury, can you believe \nthat would affect their bottom line? I do not think the money is what \nis at stake here. I think what is at stake is the attitude, the \nattitude of these companies that\n\n[[Page S11283]]\n\nwe have no right as Members of the Senate to defy their scheme and to \nsay that the American taxpayers deserve a fair shake, that the American \ntaxpayers deserve better.\n  They believe, as some do in this body, that these public lands are \nthere as a disposable product to be used up, if necessary, and \ndiscarded, that future generations be damned. That is the philosophy \nthey follow.\n  That troubles me greatly because I know that Republicans and \nDemocrats alike understand that the law should be followed, understand \nthat private citizens and families and businesses are required to \nfollow the law as much as anyone, and, frankly, that even though we \nhave a good economy, getting away from the days of deep deficits, we \nstill have the need for money in our Treasury for valuable purposes \nsuch as, for example, education.\n  One of the things we will debate in the closing weeks of this session \nis whether or not this Senate, by the time we adjourn, will be able to \npoint to anything we have accomplished in the field of education.\n  When the session started, the leaders on the Republican side, who are \nin control of the House and the Senate, made important speeches about \nhow critical education was in the priorities of this Congress. Yet I \nwill tell you, quite honestly, if we held a gun to the head of any \nMember of Congress and said, I am going to pull the trigger unless you \ncan tell me something this Congress has done to help American families \nimprove education, I would have to tell them, fire away, because we \nhave done nothing.\n  This is an illustration, that we would walk away from $66 million, a \nportion of which goes back to the States for education, at a time when \nwe realize there are critical priorities in education all across \nAmerica. Our schools are becoming antiquated. They do not have the \nmodern technology they need. We know more and more kids are on the \nhorizon. They are going to be showing up and enrolling in schools. So \nthe demands are there for education to be improved in every State, and \ncertainly in Federal programs.\n  Why the Hutchison amendment would want to take away what the Federal \nTreasury is entitled to receive for the oil companies drilling on \npublic lands, taking that money away, shortchanging education, is \nbeyond me. It is beyond me.\n\n  Certainly we can have a spirited debate about whether we want to \nincrease taxes for given purposes. We have had that debate. I know it \nis one that is contentious. But this isn't about a new tax; this is \nabout existing law that requires these oil companies to pay their tax, \ntheir royalty, for drilling oil. For some reason, certainly a large \nnumber of the Members of the Senate believe these oil companies should \nbe able to walk away scot-free and not accept this obligation.\n  The Los Angeles Times editorial of July 20, 1999, characterized this \neffort, this amendment, the Hutchison amendment, and this scheme as \n``The Great American Oil Rip-Off.'' I quote the first paragraph:\n\n       America's big oil companies have been ripping off federal \n     and state governments for decades by underpaying royalties \n     for oil drilled on public lands. The Interior Department \n     tried to stop the practice with new rules, but Congress has \n     succeeded in blocking their implementation--\n\n  With this amendment that is before the Senate today--\n\n     and will again if a Senate bill calling for a moratorium on \n     the new rules, proposed by Senators Hutchison and Pete \n     Domenici of New Mexico and scheduled for a floor vote . . . \n     is enacted.\n\n  Let me read this paragraph:\n\n       Not since the Teapot Dome scandal of the 1920s has the \n     stench of oil money reeked as strongly in Washington as it is \n     in this case.\n\n  This amendment, frankly, brought to the floor may enjoy the support \nof a majority of Members and I am sure will enjoy the plaudits and \npraise of the oil companies benefited by it.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my friend yield on that point?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to.\n  Mrs. BOXER. My friend hits again on an issue that I think we should \nexplore because under the rules of the Senate we have up to 30 hours \nfor debate on this Hutchison amendment. I do not know if it will take \n30 hours, but it will take some time because it is important that the \nlight of day shine on this.\n  My friend from Illinois has hit on a really important point that, in \nessence, the scandal is the nature of this. I wonder if my friend could \ncomment on the perception people in this country have that if you are \nbig, if you are powerful, if you give millions of dollars in \ncontributions, you can get your way in something as obvious as this.\n  Why do I say obvious? The New York Times did a story on this just 2 \ndays ago.\n  I thought the opening lines were very important. I wonder if my \nfriend read them. I think he did. It said:\n\n       Oil companies drilling on Federal land have been accused of \n     habitually underpaying royalties they owe the government. \n     Challenged in court, they have settled lawsuits, agreeing to \n     pay $5 billion. The Interior Department wants to rectify the \n     situation by making the companies pay royalties based on the \n     market price of oil, instead of a lower price set by the oil \n     companies.\n\n  The author asks:\n\n       A simple issue? Not in the United States Senate.\n\n  We have a simple, straightforward issue. If the Senator or I or any \nof the people watching this debate around the country didn't pay their \nfair share of taxes, believe me, they would have a knock on their door \nfrom the IRS. Here they have a knock on the door from the Senate. They \nsay: It's OK; we will defend it.\n  I ask my friend whether he feels the power of this special interest \nis playing a role in this? Not just to pick on them--I know my friend \nhas taken on the tobacco companies time and time again--but I want my \nfriend to comment on the perception of people in this country that this \nSenate and this Congress does the bidding of the special interests over \nthe bidding of the people we are supposed to fight for and represent. \nHe can tie it into any issue he wants, but I think it is an important \npart of this debate.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I think the point of the Senator from California is well \ntaken: We do demand of families and businesses that they pay their fair \nshare of taxes. If they don't, they are held accountable. What we want \nto create with the Hutchison amendment is an exception for oil \ncompanies; to say to some of the most profitable companies in America \nthat they don't have to pay their fair share as required by law. That \nis what the Hutchison amendment does.\n  It says the Department of the Interior cannot review the amount of \nmoney being paid in royalties by these oil companies and stop them from \neven considering implementing and enforcing the law. We know, as the \nSenator from California has indicated, that in the past, time and \nagain, these companies have underpaid their required royalties to the \nFederal Government and to the States.\n  We have a letter, which was addressed to the Senator from California, \nfrom the Secretary of the Interior, Bruce Babbitt. He writes, on \nSeptember 8, 1999:\n\n       I am writing to call on you and your colleagues to reject \n     from the Fiscal Year 2000 Interior and Related Agencies \n     Appropriations Bill a Senate amendment extending the \n     moratorium prohibiting the Department of the Interior from \n     issuing a final rulemaking on the royalty valuation of crude \n     oil until October 1st, 2000. A similar letter has been sent \n     to the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n       Prior to a series of congressionally-imposed moratoria, the \n     Department was prepared to publish a final rule on oil \n     valuation on June 1, 1998. On March 4, 1999, I announced that \n     the Department would reopen the comment period for the \n     federal oil valuation rule. On March 12, 1999, we formally \n     reopened the comment period and held a series of public \n     workshops to discuss the rule. We believe that the process \n     set in motion will assure full and open consideration of all \n     new ideas for resolving the concerns that have been raised \n     and will lead to a solution that best meets the interests of \n     the American public.\n       Currently, we are reviewing the information gathered at the \n     workshops and are confident that we will be able to address \n     the outstanding issues raised by our stakeholders. The \n     moratorium [as suggested by the Hutchison amendment] would \n     simply delay our ability to implement a final rule until \n     October 1, 2000, although we may have resolved these key \n     issues well before then. This unnecessary delay will result \n     in losses to the Federal Treasury, States, and Indians of an \n     amount of up to $5.65 million per month.\n       We urge you to defeat any proposal to extend the moratorium \n     prohibiting the Department from issuing a final rule during \n     Fiscal Year 2000.\n       Sincerely, Bruce Babbitt [Secretary of the Interior]\n\n  Five point six million a month, owed to the Federal Treasury, owed to \nthe\n\n[[Page S11284]]\n\ntaxpayers for the use of public lands for private profit, that will not \nbe paid if the Hutchison amendment passes.\n  As I look across the aisle, I see a chart the Senator from Texas has \nused repeatedly to explain how complicated this is to come up with this \nvaluation. I haven't seen it in detail. I don't question the veracity \nof the Senator's statements about this process.\n  Let me suggest to my colleagues, when we are dealing with \nconglomerate oil companies, multinational, with large legal \ndepartments, large engineering departments, arguing over the value of \noil, trust me, it is not something that is done over lunch, where they \nwrite a figure on a napkin and agree to it. You have to bring in all of \nthe information, verify it, subject it to public comment, and then \nestablish the right royalty to be paid by the oil companies.\n  I think it might be interesting to see a chart of how much the oil \ncompanies are paying to bring this amendment to the floor and pass it, \nall of their corporate and legal departments and government departments \nthat are at work to try to save them over $5 million a month at the \nexpense of the Federal taxpayers.\n  The other day, I was on an airplane flying to Washington, which is a \nbig part of my life over the last 17 years. I sat on a plane next to a \ngentleman from Colorado who worked for MCI WorldCom. He quickly wanted \nto talk about politics, which is always a dangerous topic when one is \ncaptured on an airplane. He allowed as to how he was a libertarian and \nbelieved there was entirely too much government around and, frankly, \nthat is the way he voted.\n  I said: Let me tell you about an issue. Let me describe to you \nbecause you live in Colorado--a beautiful State that has a lot of \npublic lands--this issue about whether or not oil companies should be \nable to come on public land, drill on that land, take the oil out, sell \nit for a profit, and pay a royalty for that purpose.\n  He said: I don't have any problem with that; that's only fair. If \nthey are going to use the public lands that they don't own, they ought \nto pay something for them.\n  I said: Well, that is what the debate is all about.\n  The Hutchison amendment stops the Federal Government from collecting \nthe royalty these companies owe under the law. Whether you are a \nconservative, a libertarian, independent, liberal, this is just simple \njustice. It is fairness, as to whether or not these companies are going \nto get such a break from the Senate, that we are basically wrapping up \nin a beautiful little package with a nice big bow on top, 5.6 million \nbucks a month to these oil companies.\n\n  They hold tag days in the city of Chicago, which I am privileged to \nrepresent, for a lot of people who are homeless, people who need food \nand clothing, folks who need a break in life. These tag days give you \nlittle things to put in your lapel to show that you helped.\n  They are never going to have a tag day for a major oil company. These \ncompanies are doing OK. Frankly, for us to give them an additional \nsubsidy of $5.6 million a month is scandalous; that at this time in our \nhistory, when we know this money could be so well spent for education, \nfor health care, for things every American expects us to respond to, we \nwould literally turn our backs on $5.6 million a month, money that \nthese oil companies have conceded in lawsuits they underpaid the \nFederal Government.\n  That is what this amendment is all about. It is a real test. The oil \ncompanies, at the end of this debate, will get the vote. Senators will \nbe counted on: On one side, those who believe the oil companies need to \nbe treated a little more gingerly, a little more lightly, they should \nnot be required to make the payments they are required to make under \nlaw; on the other side, those of us who believe the public lands should \nbe protected and those who use them should make fair compensation for \nthe use of those lands.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague very much, the \nSenator from Illinois, for his comments. He has proven, once again, a \nvery important point around here; that is, that he speaks for the \npeople, all the people.\n  I think the primary issue in this amendment is, for whom do we stand \nup and fight? The oil companies, the tobacco companies, the special \ninterests, they are strong. I know Senator Feingold, who has spoken \nbefore, has been very eloquent on the point of the power of the special \ninterests in this country. They have the ability to really make things \ncome out the way they want. On the other hand, this is supposed to be a \ngovernment of, by, and for the people, which sometimes gets shut out. \nThere isn't an occasion I can recall in all the years I have served \nwith my dear friend from Illinois, Senator Durbin, not an occasion when \nhe didn't stand on the side of what was right. That is a pretty strong \nstatement. But I know when he gets up and speaks against the Hutchison \namendment, it is because he is as outraged as I am that the people are \nbeing forgotten by the Senator from Texas, and the very powerful are \nbeing represented.\n\n  Why did I take so much of the Senate's time on this? Because I feel \nso deeply that when you see people being hurt, you have to stand up on \ntheir side. Now, a newspaper in California said, well, it is only \n$600,000 a year to California. First of all, that is incorrect. It is \n$600,000 a year as their share of the royalties; but when more money \ngets put into the Land and Water Conservation Fund, the State of \nCalifornia gets back 10 percent of that. So it is really millions of \ndollars.\n  Mr. President, I would like to ask my friend, Senator Feingold, at \napproximately what time he would like to be heard on this.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Right now.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Since my friend from Wisconsin is here, I will retain the \nremainder of my time and yield for him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for her tremendous \ndetermination and leadership on this issue. I have watched this effort \nfrom the beginning, and her enthusiasm and determination is really \nmaking a difference. I am extremely impressed with it.\n  My purpose is to rise again in opposition to the Hutchison amendment. \nEarlier in the debate on this amendment, I engaged in a colloquy with \nthe Senator from California about the relationship between campaign \ncontributions and the continued reappearance of this amendment. I \nbelieve this is the fourth time similar provisions have been offered or \ncontained in the Interior appropriations bill, just since May of 1998.\n  I will return in a minute to the issue of campaign contributions. \nFirst, I want to share a few observations that highlight the overall \nimportance of the issue we are discussing. I ask unanimous consent that \nan article which appeared in the Wall Street Journal on September 10, \n1999, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 10, 1999]\n\n Chevron to Pay About $95 Million to End Claim It Shortchanged U.S. on \n                               Royalties\n\n                       (By A Llexei Barrionuevo)\n\n       Chevron Corp. has agreed in principle to pay about $95 \n     million to resolve civil allegations that it shortchanged the \n     U.S. on royalty payments, according to people close to the \n     negotiations.\n       The agreement would resolve allegations made in a 1996 \n     lawsuit filed in federal court in Lufkin, Texas, by two \n     whistleblowers under the federal False Claims Act. The suit, \n     originally filed against 18 large oil companies, alleges that \n     the companies knowingly undervalued oil extracted from \n     federal and Native American lands from 1988 on to reduce the \n     royalties they owed.\n       The case is scheduled to go to trial in March, but several \n     companies are moving to resolve the issues well before then. \n     Until recently, only Mobile Corp., based in Fairfax, Va., had \n     addressed the charges; it agreed to pay $45 million in a \n     settlement in August 1998.\n       Then, last week, Occidental Petroleum Corp. in Los Angeles \n     agreed to pay $7.3 million to settle the charges.\n       According to people close to the talks, BP Amoco PLC and \n     Conoco Inc. also have reached agreements in principal to \n     settle for about $30 million apiece. A document expected to \n     be filed today in federal court in Lufkin will ask the court \n     to cease discovery against Chevron, Conoco and BP Amoco on\n\n[[Page S11285]]\n\n     the basis that the government has reached preliminary \n     agreements with the companies.\n       The people close to the talks said Chevron and the Justice \n     Department must agree on the language of a final agreement, \n     which is expected in the next few weeks. Chevron is based in \n     San Francisco.\n       Chevron, Conoco and BP Amoco all confirmed they are \n     negotiating with the government, but they wouldn't elaborate. \n     Chevron spokeswoman Dawn Soper said the company hasn't yet \n     signed an agreement, and ``until we have a settlement \n     agreement signed, we are not going to comment on what we may \n     have offered or are offering.'' BP Amoco said it has an \n     ``understanding in principal'' to settle.\n       A spokesman for the U.S. Minerals Management Service said \n     discussions are continuing with all three companies, but it \n     wouldn't confirm that any settlements had been reached. The \n     companies' willingness to reach settlements were earlier \n     reported by an industry publication, Petroleum Argus.\n       Since 1996, the Interior Department, in separate actions, \n     has billed the oil companies for more than $400 million in \n     alleged underpayment of federal royalties stretching back two \n     decades.\n       In the Lufkin lawsuit, the whistleblowers allege that the \n     companies paid royalties based on a ``posted'' wellhead price \n     rather than the fair-market value. The Justice Department \n     intervened in the case in March 1998 against four companies: \n     Amoco Corp., Burlington Resources Inc., Conoco and Shell Oil \n     Co., a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group. The government later \n     intervened against Occidental Petroleum, Texaco Inc. and \n     Unocal Corp. In the suit, the government is seeking about $5 \n     billion from all the companies combined, which includes \n     actual damages trebled, plus civil penalties.\n       Attorneys involved in the suit say more companies are close \n     to settling. Still, Exxon Corp., which prevailed in a 14-\n     year-old royalties case in California recently, hasn't joined \n     the negotiations. Federal regulators argue that the Lufkin \n     case differs from the California case, because the federal \n     royalty agreements were more explicit.\n       Bob Davis, spokesman for Exxon USA, declined to comment on \n     the oil giant's litigation strategy or to say whether the \n     company would negotiate in the case. However, he added, ``in \n     these posted-price issues, it is the company's position that \n     we post our prices fairly and properly, and in complete \n     accordance with the terms of the contract. That applies \n     whether it be the city, state or federal land.''\n       The case was originally filed by two former Atlantic \n     Richfield Co. marketing executives, J. Benjamin Johnson Jr. \n     and John M. Martineck. They stand to receive 15% to 25% of \n     settlements paid in cases where the Justice Department \n     intervenes, or 25% to 30% where the government doesn't \n     intervene.\n       Efforts by the Interior Department to institute a rule \n     change that would allow the government to collect royalties \n     based on fair-market prices rather than a posted price remain \n     mired in politics. The department estimates the rule change \n     would require oil companies to pay $66.1 million a year in \n     additional royalty payments.\n       On Wednesday, Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R., Texas), \n     proposed an amendment to the appropriations bill that would \n     keep the rule change off the books for another year. In \n     defense of the move, she said that while larger oil companies \n     may be able to absorb the higher royalties, the rule changes \n     will hit small producers ``at a time when they are still \n     reeling from the historically low oil prices we have seen \n     lately.'' It was the fourth time since May 1988 that Sen. \n     Hutchison has sought to delay the rule change.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, since we have been engaged in debate on \nthe Interior bill, four major oil companies have reached tentative \nagreements with U.S. prosecutors who accused them of cooperating in \nschemes to shortchange the Government through their royalty payments by \nmillions of dollars. A tentative settlement, which was filed in Federal \ncourt in Lufkin, TX, involved about $185 million in payments and would \nend a case that alleged that companies underpaid royalties by \nundervaluating oil extracted from Federal and American Indian lands.\n  Though the settlement has not yet been finalized, it is a very \nserious matter. Chevron USA, Inc.; BP American Inc.; Amoco Oil Co.; and \nConoco, Inc.; agreed in principle to settle for $95 million, $32 \nmillion, $32 million, and $26 million, respectively. The Wall Street \nJournal reported that a 1996 lawsuit by two former Atlantic Richfield \nemployees alleges that 18 companies, their affiliates and subsidiaries, \nknowingly defrauded the Government on royalties derived from the \nproduction of crude oil from land spanning more than 27 million acres \nin 21 States.\n  The Justice Department entered the case against Conoco; Amoco; \nBurlington Resources; the Shell Oil Company; Occidental Petroleum; \nTexaco, Inc.; and the Unocal Corporation, which resulted in the recent \nsettlements. The Government is seeking triple damages of about $5 \nbillion from all the companies. The Interior Department has billed the \noil companies more than $400 million for the alleged underpayment of \nFederal royalties, stretching back two decades.\n  The Wall Street Journal article I referred to, reports that these \nrecent settlements aren't even the first of their kind. Several \ncompanies have been negotiating settlements. The Mobil Corporation \nagreed last year to pay $45 million, and Occidental Petroleum \nCorporation agreed in early September to pay $7.3 million.\n  I think this is a very troubling trend as these lawsuits are settled. \nI am very concerned that Congress is abdicating its responsibility. \nUnintentionally or not, Congress is making it possible for this issue \nto continue to go unaddressed because the royalty underpayment \nsituation is the issue that this rulemaking we are debating seeks to \ncorrect.\n  The proponents of this amendment have stated their concerns that \nregulators are straying onto Congress' turf by amending the \nregulations. Proponents of this amendment say they want Congress to act \non this matter; otherwise, the increase in royalties would amount to a \ntype of ``taxation without representation.''\n  I have to respectfully disagree with that argument. It ignores the \nfact that our Government agencies regularly update their regulations \nand they are authorized to do so by Congress. We don't require Congress \nto act every single time a regulation needs to be changed. We would \nnever be able to get to it.\n  For example, Congress enacted the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands \nAct. That law is intended to provide for orderly leasing of these \nlands, while affording protection for the environment and ensuring that \nthe Federal Government receive fair market value for both lands leased \nand the production that might result. The Outer Continental Shelf \nProgram is carried out by the Minerals Management Service of the \nDepartment of the Interior. Thus, Congress delegated the power to set \nroyalties to MMS.\n  In addition to ignoring the fact that Congress passed laws which give \nthe MMS the ability to set royalties, this argument that has been made \nrings hollow when you consider that Congress is not acting to prevent \nthe underpayment of royalties with this amendment. What it is doing is \npreventing the Interior Department from doing anything about it at all.\n  So this raises the question: Why is Congress doing nothing about this \nproblem? I think, certainly, the public will want to know why. The \nalleged underpayments involve more than 6,000 onshore and offshore \nleases in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, California, Alabama, Alaska, \nOklahoma, Arkansas, Colorado, Arizona, Florida, Kansas, Michigan, \nMontana, North Dakota, Nebraska, New Mexico, Nevada, South Dakota, \nUtah, and Wyoming.\n\n  So this is not just a coastal States problem, or even just a Western \nproblem. It affects a broad number of States, and it deserves attention \nas a national problem, the kind of attention the Senator from \nCalifornia has brought to it.\n  I have no doubt that one of the factors contributing to Congress' \ninaction on this issue of great importance to American taxpayers is the \nrole of campaign contributions in the political process. So I want to \nreview the figures I briefly presented when I ``Called the Bankroll'' \nlast time I joined the Senator from California on the floor. I call the \nbankroll from time to time in this Chamber to remind my colleagues and \nthe public about the undeniable, but sometimes hidden, role that money \nplays in the decisions we make.\n  During the 1997-1998 election cycle, the very large oil companies \nthat will benefit from this amendment gave the following political \ndonations to the parties and to Federal candidates:\n  Exxon gave more than $230,000 in soft money and more than $480,000 in \nPAC money; Chevron gave more than $425,000 in soft money and more than \n$330,000 in PAC money; Atlantic Richfield gave more than $525,000 in \nsoft money and $150,000 in PAC money; BP Oil and Amoco, two oil \ncompanies that have merged into the newly formed petroleum giant, BP \nAmoco, gave a combined total of more than $480,000 in soft money and \n$295,000 in PAC money.\n  So if you put that together, that is more than $2.9 million just from \nthose\n\n[[Page S11286]]\n\nfour corporations in the span of only 2 years. They want the Hutchison \namendment to be part of the Interior appropriations bill. As powerful \npolitical donors, I am afraid they are likely to get their way.\n  You will notice that all of these companies except for Exxon gave \nmore to the political parties in soft money than their PACs gave to \nindividual candidates. So, remember, and this is a key thing about soft \nmoney, which I don't think everybody in the country realizes; it took \nme a while to get it. Soft money comes right out of the corporate \ntreasury, right out of the treasury. This isn't money where you form a \nPAC and you get employees to contribute to it; it comes straight out of \nthe corporate treasury.\n  I am happy to yield without yielding my right to the floor. I ask \nunanimous consent that I can yield briefly to the Senator from North \nDakota so he can make a request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, pursuant to rule XXII, paragraph 2, I \nyield my 1 hour to the minority leader, Senator Daschle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, thank you. Let me get back to this \npoint.\n  Of the four companies I mentioned, only one of the four--that being \nExxon--didn't give more soft money than they did PAC money. The point I \nam trying to make is a very important point about what is going on with \nthese campaign contributions. This money came straight out of corporate \ntreasuries.\n  I would have thought a few years ago that these kinds of donations \nwere illegal. They are supposed to be essentially illegal under our \nFederal elections law.\n  The Tillman Act passed way back in 1907 in the Senate and in the \nCongress prohibited corporations from making campaign contributions. \nThat statute, which was codified in title 2 of the United States Code, \nat section 441(b), reads as follows:\n\n       It is unlawful for any national bank, or any corporation \n     organized by authority of any law of Congress, to make a \n     contribution or expenditure in connection with any election \n     to political office . . . or for any candidate, political \n     committee or other person knowingly to accept or receive any \n     contribution received by this section.\n\n  That sounds pretty simple and straightforward. Yet unfortunately, in \n1978, the Federal Election Commission made a ruling that opened up this \nsoft money loophole and allowed the political parties to begin \naccepting unlimited contributions of soft money from corporations such \nas Exxon, Chevron, and Atlantic Richfield to pay for party-building \nactivities and things such as get-out-the-vote campaigns and voter \nregistration. That is what it was supposed to be for.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that we all believed, based on the \nTillman Act, that contributions----\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I make a point of order that the subject \nmatter is not germane.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I certainly dispute that. I believe this \nis entirely relevant. I am talking about corporations and interests \nthat are very much behind this matter. I would certainly suggest that \nit is appropriate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would remind the Senator that under \nthe cloture, speeches must be relevant to the issue at hand.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I believe this presentation is entirely \nrelevant to this issue. I am going through the way in which these \ncorporations can technically legally provide this kind of help to this \ncause of trying to make this change. That is merely the background I am \ngiving at this point.\n  So let me return to the present. Soft money has grown exponentially \nsince those early days when corporate contributions were just going to \ngive the parties a little breathing room to cover party-building \nactivities, not campaigns. In the last Presidential campaign, in 1996, \nthe parties raised $262 million in soft money, three times as much as \nin the 1992 election cycle. The experts project we will see perhaps as \nmuch as $500 million or even $600 million in this next election, and \nabout 65 percent of the money is coming from corporate treasuries.\n  So as we look at an issue, such as Senator Boxer's concern with the \nHutchison amendment, we have to realize that what is before us is not \nsimply an amendment. It is an amendment supported by interests that \nhave been involved in an immense infusion of corporate cash that, \nunfortunately, is totally legal, even though I certainly don't think it \nshould be. We wonder why the American people are skeptical of what we \nare doing. We have heard the horror stories again and again. Parties \nhave special clubs for big givers and offer to the donors exclusive \nmeetings and weekend retreats with office holders. And it is totally \nlegal.\n  In other cases, in other bills, so we know this isn't an isolated \nincident, the tobacco companies have funneled nearly $17 million in \nsoft money to the national political parties.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I raise a point of order again, that \ncampaign finance is not the issue we are talking on, and I raise a \npoint of order on it.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, if I may be heard in response.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I believe it is clear that what I am \nsaying is not simply in the context of a debate on campaign finance \nreform, and that the Members of the Senate and the American people \nshould hear and understand the kind of money that is behind legislation \non the floor of the Senate.\n  I think it is relevant to this debate. I think it is relevant to the \ndebate on the subject matter involved. I have in the past on a number \nof occasions taken the opportunity to raise this issue. I have spoken \nabout campaign money in connection with 9 or 10 other bills, without \nobjection from anyone, to point out the money that is involved in those \nbills. As you know, my presentation here has not been exclusively on \nthe topic of campaign money. I have talked about the merits as well. I \nbelieve both are relevant, and I certainly would dispute the notion \nthat this is in any way appropriate for a point of order.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I think it is totally inappropriate. You \ncan talk about the campaign finance issue on any issue. On this issue, \nwe had a vote. This issue was designed to proceed for 30 hours. This \nissue was not to be done on campaign finance. I continue to raise a \npoint of order, and will continue to raise a point of order.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, may I be heard on this point of order? I \nask unanimous consent that I may be heard on this point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. THOMAS. I object. I at least would like to have some limit as to \nthe amount of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. For how long does the Senator wish to speak?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want to make a point in response, and I can do it, and \nraise a question for the Senator from Wisconsin, because he still \ncontrols the time.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I have no objection.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may yield for a question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I just got unanimous consent to speak. So I would take \nthat, and I thank my friend.\n  I want to make a point in support of Senator Feingold's amendment to \ncampaign contributions, but I want to do it in a way that I think is \nvery objective.\n  If you look at the New York Times article--he should make sure he \nlooks at this New York Times article as well--I say to all of my \nfriends, the title of this article is ``Battle Waged in the Senate Over \nOil Royalties by Oil Firms.'' The essence of the article goes to the \nheart of what my friend is saying. It goes to the heart of the issue of \ncampaign contributions.\n  So I surely believe the Senator from Wisconsin is in full order to \nconnect this amendment to the number of contributions that oil \ncompanies give, and I think his comments are on point and in order.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I would like to object. I would like to \ntake issue, as respectfully as I can, with my colleague from \nCalifornia,\n\n[[Page S11287]]\n\nwho came earlier to this floor. I don't have the quote, but I remember.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, what is the order?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. The order is----\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, could I ask what the order is in speaking? \nI thought the time belonged to the Senator from Wisconsin, and that it \nwas his chance to continue his remarks.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I am objecting to his remarks.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The Senator from Wisconsin got time to make a speech when \nhe has the floor, and he has an hour's worth of time. I would ask for a \nruling as to who asked for time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from California has \nexpired.\n  Mr. THOMAS. We just completed this question on germaneness. If you \nwould like me to read the ruling, I would be happy to do that.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is fine with us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. On germaneness of debate, if the Senate is proceeding \nunder cloture, debate must be germane. ``Germane'' means you have to be \non the subject. It doesn't mean you can sway off the subject to some \nirrelevant subject. This says it must be germane, and I again raise a \npoint of order.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. The only way it would be germane is if the Senator from \nWisconsin----\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, who has the time?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. On giving contributions----\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, who has the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senators will suspend.\n  There are precedents of the Senate that permit nongermane debate even \nunder cloture, notwithstanding the precedent cited by the Senator from \nWyoming.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin has the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I appreciate having the floor returned. \nI appreciate the ruling of the Chair.\n  Let me say that any attempt to gag the discussion on the floor of the \nSenate about the impact of soft money on this place is something I will \nfight tooth and nail with my colleagues on, and I was prepared, if \nnecessary, had the Chair ruled against me to appeal. But I am grateful \nfor the ruling and the precedents.\n  There is a notion that somehow saying the oil companies have \ncontributed money means we are accusing somebody of something illegal, \nor something that can't be done. But that isn't a necessary conclusion. \nContributions can be given innocently, but if the impact is that the \nprocess is greatly affected and the judgment is affected by the power \nof that money, I think it is relevant to this debate.\n  That is my concern about soft money. It is not so much the \ncontributions given to individual Senators. Individual Members can't \ntake soft money. It is this new phenomenon of the very large soft money \ncontributions being given to political parties that I think has changed \nthis place in a way that is extremely troubling and has allowed some \namendments such as the one before the Senate today to get the kind of \ncredibility I don't think they would have had without the power of soft \nmoney.\n  We have heard the horror stories again and again. Parties have \nspecial clubs for big givers and offer exclusive meetings and weekend \nretreats with officeholders to the donors. It is totally legal. In \nresponse to the Senator from Louisiana, I can see it is legal. I am not \nsuggesting that these parties or industries are involved in illegal \nactivity; it is legal, but it should be illegal. It is distorting to \nthe process.\n  The tobacco companies have funneled nearly $17 million in soft money \nto the national parties in the last decade, $4.4 million in 1997 alone, \nwhen the whole issue of congressional action on the tobacco settlement \nwas very much alive, and it is totally legal. In 1996, the gambling \nindustry gave nearly $4 million in soft money to the two major \npolitical parties at the same time that Congress was creating a new \nnational commission on gambling but with limited subpoena powers. It is \ntotally legal.\n  There are some in this body, despite what the Thompson investigation \nuncovered a few years ago and what news stories show on almost a daily \nbasis, who don't see or won't acknowledge the corrupting influence of \nthese unlimited soft money contributions which again are now totally \nlegal.\n  I remember a history lesson that one of our colleagues, the junior \nSenator from Utah, gave during a debate on campaign finance reform a \nfew years ago that was intended to convince Members there was nothing \nwrong at all with enormous campaign contributions. He recounted the \nvery frequently told story of how Senator Eugene McCarthy's \nPresidential campaign in 1968 was jump-started by some very large \ncontributions by some very wealthy individuals.\n  He also noted that Steve Forbes was apparently prepared to make \nsimilar contributions to support Jack Kemp for a run for the Presidency \nin 1996 but was prohibited from doing so by the Federal elections law \nand decided to run his own campaign, a decision from which we might \ninfer that money is more important than the candidate.\n  He also recounted the story of Mr. Arthur Hyatt, a wealthy \nbusinessman who gave large soft money contributions to the Democratic \nParty in 1996 but decided after the election not to give soft money to \nthe parties anymore but instead to fund an advocacy group that is \npromoting public financing of elections.\n  The point of the examples was to try to argue that wealthy donors are \nmotivated by ideology and to benefit the public as they see it, rather \nthan the desire to gain access and influence with policymakers through \ntheir contributions. I suppose that could sometimes be the case.\n  Of course, there are other examples, including the candid story of \nthe well-known incident of Mr. Roger Tamraz who testified under oath to \nour Governmental Affairs Committee that he never even votes and the \nonly reason he gave soft money to the DNC was to gain access to \nofficials he thought could help him with his business. It is my strong \nsuspicion that Mr. Tamraz' motives, if not his methods, are more \ntypical of big contributors than are those of Steve Forbes or the \nmillionaires who funded Eugene McCarthy's campaign.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Regular order. I renew my objection that the debate is \nnot germane.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. While the Chair continues to research the \nquestion, the Chair is not prepared to rule at this time. It will \ncontinue to research the question on the point of order.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I don't think the Senator should be allowed to \ncontinue if there is a question that this violates Senate rules.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I don't think the Senator from Texas can \nrewrite the rules of the Senate. It is my understanding the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin has time. He has now been interrupted three or four \ntimes in what I consider to be a crucial presentation which gets to the \nheart of this amendment. I hope he can continue his remarks until the \nChair has made a decision.\n  Mr. THOMAS. The Senator from California does not make precedent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. It is wrong. I think it borders on a personal attack \non Senators who I think are doing something they think is in the best \ninterest of this Nation.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin has the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I am shocked at the efforts of my colleagues to gag one \nof their colleagues who is trying to talk about a reality in this \ncountry that has occurred with regard to these campaign contributions \nthat affect what we are doing on this amendment. The notion that \nsomehow I should stop speaking while the Chair reviews the precedents \nis absurd. A Senator should be allowed to speak as long as he is \npermitted under the rules to do so, and there has been no such ruling \notherwise.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, will the Senator------\n  Mrs. BOXER. Regular order.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I believe I have the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I will not yield for a question at this point. I will \nlater.\n\n[[Page S11288]]\n\n  Mr. President, I am not cynical about this. There is a reason I hold \nsuspicions about the motives of soft money donors. The reason is, a \nsolid majority of soft money contributions to our political parties, as \nI mentioned before, comes from corporate interests. It simply cannot be \nargued that those interests are acting out of a public spiritedness or \nideological conviction. Corporations do not have an ideology; they have \nbusiness interests. They have a bottom line to defend. They have \nlearned over the years that making contributions to the major political \nparties in this country is a very good investment in their bottom line. \nUnfortunately, too often campaign money buys access and access often \npays off at the bottom line.\n  Corporate interests are special interests. Special interests have \nself-interested motives. They are concerned with profits, not only what \nis best for citizens or consumers or the country as a whole. They like \nto cast their arguments in terms of the public interest, and I am sure \nsometimes their beliefs are genuine. And they certainly will argue that \nif Congress follows their advice on legislation, the public will be \nbetter off. But in the end, it is their own businesses they most care \nof and not necessarily the broader public good.\n  Indeed, the boards of directors and management of corporations \nactually have a legal duty--this is not a criticism of the corporations \nat all--to act in the best interests of their shareholders. They are \nsupposed to do that, not to think of the broader public at large.\n  Let me make it clear to those Senators concerned about my remarks, \nthere is not a suggestion here that the corporations are acting \nillegally or suggesting that there is something wrong with corporations \ndoing what they should can for their own interests. I have no illusions \nabout it. It is OK with me that the corporate special interests are \nlooking out for No. 1 in the public debate. But I must object, and \nobject loudly and over and over again, when their deep pockets give \nthem deep influence that ordinary Americans simply don't have.\n\n  Corporations with business before the Congress, not disinterested, \npublic-spirited millionaires, and certainly not ordinary citizens, lead \nthe way in soft money giving. One interesting set of contributors \nproves that access, not ideology, is the main reason for soft money \ndonations. In the 1996 election cycle, 40 companies gave over $150,000 \nto both political parties. Guess what. Three of those double-givers \nwere the oil companies I have already mentioned here today. Double-\ngivers, they give to both parties: Atlantic Richfield, Chevron, and \nOccidental Petroleum. They cover their bases. This is not always about \nchoosing sides, but covering bases.\n  I suppose there might be some in the companies or in this body who \nargue that the double-givers just want to assist the political process, \nthat they are motivated not by the bottom line but by a keen desire to \nassist both parties in serving the public. If that is the case, why is \nit, in every Congress since I have been here, the industries most \nseriously affected by our work give huge contributions to Members and \nto the political parties?\n  In 1993-1994, it was the health care debate. Hospital insurance \ncompanies, drug companies, and doctors all opened up their wallets in \nan unprecedented way. In 1995 and 1996, the Telecommunications Act was \nunder consideration, and, lo and behold, the local and long-distance \ncompanies and cable companies stepped up giving. In the last Congress--\nand this one, for that matter--we have been working on bankruptcy \nreform and financial services modernization. The biggest givers of all \nin the 1998 cycle, according to Common Cause research, was security and \ninvestment companies, insurance companies, banks, and lenders eager to \nhave business interests protected or expanded.\n  What is going on here? I suggest this is not a spontaneous burst of \ncivic virtue. Since we didn't finish work on the bills last year, the \nmoney is flowing again this year. It has even been suggested that \nsometimes the very Members of Congress who most want a big bill to pass \nwill slow progress to keep the checks flowing in. That such a view of \nlegislators and public servants has gained currency in the public \ndebate, even if it is true, shows the depths of cynicism that this soft \nmoney system has inspired in those we represent.\n\n  Mr. President, the American people are not gullible or naive. They \nknow that these companies contribute these enormous sums to the parties \nbecause their bottom line is affected by what the Congress does and \nthey want to make sure the Congress will listen to them when they want \nto make their case. And they know that the big contributors get \nresults. We are seeing another example of that here today.\n  And frankly, it's a two-way street. The parties are hitting up these \ndonors because they know that most companies, unlike Monsanto and \nGeneral Motors have announced early in 1997 that they would no longer \nmake soft money donations--most companies don't have the courage to say \nno. Most companies are worried that if they don't ante up, their \nlobbyists won't get in the door. Our current campaign finance laws \nencourage old fashioned shakedowns, as long as they are done \ndiscreetly.\n  A growing number of business leaders are objecting to this system, \nand recognizing that it must be changed. The business group CED, the \nCommittee for Economic Development, has come out for a ban on soft \nmoney, and I think we will see more and more business leaders embracing \ncampaign finance reform in the future. An unhealthy democracy is not \nhealthy for business.\n  It is beyond me how any Senator could support this soft money system. \nIn a few weeks, we will have a chance to vote on a bill that bans soft \nmoney. Senator McCain and I are looking forward to that debate, and I \nwant to thank the Senator from California for giving me the opportunity \nto talk about it this morning, as part of her fight against this ill-\nadvised amendment to the Interior appropriations bill. If we can pass a \nsoft money ban this year, perhaps there will be fewer of these special \ninterest deals to contend with in the future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask for the regular order. I insist on \nthe point of order and insist on a ruling.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield the floor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I wish to be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is not sustained.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I appeal the ruling of the Chair and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absence of a quorum. Absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At the moment there is not a sufficient \nsecond.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Ask for a quorum call.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll to ascertain the \npresence of a quorum.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending appeal \nbe laid aside to be called up by the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am glad we can try now to get back on \nthe central subject of this debate, which is so important to many \npeople in our country and particularly to us in Louisiana because many \nof these oil companies reside in our State and most of the work in the \nproduction of oil and gas goes on off of our shore. So I have been \nactually anxious all morning to try to get some time on the floor to \nspeak about this issue of royalty valuation.\n  But I just feel compelled to say how disappointed I am in my \ncolleague from Wisconsin and the remarks he made, I think, directed to \nthis issue and to be backed up by the Senator from California. To say \nthat this issue, which is giving soft money contributions, ``is at the \nheart''--quote--of this\n\n[[Page S11289]]\n\ndebate, I think is really--it is offensive to the Members of the Senate \non both sides of the aisle. It is particularly offensive to those of us \nwho actually weren't supported by the oil and gas industry when we ran \nto get elected to the Senate but find ourselves having to speak on this \nissue of royalty valuation because of the principles involved, because \nof the facts involved, and because this is a very important principle \nat stake on this vote.\n  I also want to say, as the Senator from Wisconsin knows, I have been \na strong supporter of campaign finance reform. So I am particularly \noffended by the way he made the remarks in the context of this debate \nand hope in the course of the next 5 or 6 or 7 hours that have been \nagreed to on both sides, we can stay focused on the oil royalty \nvaluation and the issues regarding this because they are important.\n  So in that vein, let me just try to get us back to the subject at \nhand and remind all my colleagues what this debate is really all about \nbecause it is important.\n  It involves a lot of money. It involves a lot of businesses. It \ninvolves a lot of employees. It means a lot of jobs. It is about \ntaxation, and that is always important to everyone involved.\n  The Minerals Management Service of the Department of the Interior is \nresponsible, as has been made clear, for assessing and collecting \nroyalties from oil and natural gas production from Federal lands, \nincluding the Outer Continental Shelf.\n  Federal laws that date back to 1920--and while those laws have been \nmodified, the fundamental issue has not been changed since 1920--\nrequire that for the purposes of paying Federal royalties, the value of \noil must be assessed at the lease. That is interpreted and has been \ninterpreted to mean at the wellhead. It is at the lease.\n  These leases, as we know, are getting larger and farther from the \nshore. They are not just in the neighbor's backyard any longer. They \nare not just out on the rancher's property. They are hundreds of miles \noffshore.\n  The usual royalty rate for oil is one-eighth the value from land and \ndeep sea and one-sixth the value of oil drawn from offshore leases. In \n1988, oil and gas producers paid more--and I want the record to be \nclear about this--paid more, in 1 year, $4.7 billion in Federal \nroyalties and have paid more than $40 billion in the last 10 years. In \nfact, I happen to know because of another bill that many of us have \nbeen working on, that since 1955, the oil companies have paid in rents, \nroyalties, and bonuses $120 billion.\n  The thought that the oil companies would balk or would reject paying \nanother $60 million is actually ludicrous because they paid $4.7 \nbillion last year and will probably pay a similar amount next year. \nWhile my colleagues continue to talk about the $60 million figure, it \nis ludicrous that the oil companies that already pay this amount would \nflinch actually at paying $60 million more.\n  What is at issue is the principle of the way this is calculated. As \nwe know, before it is sold, the oil is typically transported, \nprocessed, and marketed for sale. Each of these costs incurred must be \nsubtracted from the purchase price in order to get back to the wellhead \nvalue. It is the determination of this wellhead value that can be \ncomplex and costly and lengthy, and many legitimate disputes have \narisen about the correct method of valuation.\n  Some of these were addressed as part of the Oil and Gas Royalty \nFairness Act enacted into law in 1996, but several other contentious \nissues remain. That is why we are debating this today. Both the \nindustry and Government agreed that royalty valuation needed to be \nupdated and simplified. When that law was passed to encourage \nsimplification, the agency responsible for interpreting the law, \ninstead of making a rule that is more simple, made it more complicated; \nthey made it more complex. The new rule is not very transparent, and it \nis unworkable.\n  The industry is stating, and I believe they make a legitimate \nargument when they say: We do not mind paying our fair share, but we \nwant the fair share we owe to be more clear so we can get out of the \ncourtrooms. The issue today is whether we want to spend 5 months trying \nto work this out, which is what I am proposing we do, along with the \nSenator from Texas, or we want to spend 5 years in court at great cost \nto the taxpayers, at great cost to the industry, at the loss of jobs in \nmany States throughout the Nation.\n\n  It simply makes no sense, and with all due respect to the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin, it has nothing to do, in my case and knowing the \nintegrity of the Members of this Senate, with campaign finance reform \nor lack thereof. It has to do with the legitimate difference of opinion \nover an accounting rule. It is not an environmental issue. It is not a \ncampaign finance issue. It is an issue regarding a complicated rule.\n  All we are asking is to take some more time to try to work it out so \nwe can get out of the courtroom and get on to business because I think \nthat is what the taxpayers of America want. I think the people in \nLouisiana, California, Wisconsin, and Texas want us to get back to work \ncreating jobs and to get out of the courtrooms. This rule--as has been \npresented in great detail by the Senator from Oklahoma earlier and as \nposted on the chart that is up for display for all to see--is more \ncomplicated, not less.\n  It is as if the opponents, led by the Senator from California, \nseemingly are arguing that if a taxpayer--in this case it happens to be \nan oil company, but tomorrow it could be the taxpayer next door; \ntomorrow it could be your neighbor. If their taxes are audited and a \ndiscrepancy is found, which often happens, it would be similar to \nallowing the IRS to simply raise their tax rate. That is not fair. It \nis un-American.\n  I do not think there are many people in the United States who support \nthat, but that is exactly what we are getting ready to do if we do not \nstop this rule from coming into effect. No agency should have the right \nto raise tax rates because of a legitimate difference over an auditing \nprocedure that is very complicated. If that precedent is set, there is \nno taxpayer in this Nation safe from having their taxes raised by an \nagency. If we want to raise the royalty rate, then we should do it. If \nwe want to raise the tax rate, this Congress should do it. We are \nsetting a terrible precedent, allowing an agency to raise a tax rate \nbased on a misinterpretation of a rule that is ill conceived and ill \nthought out and ill timed.\n  Also, with respect to my colleagues who have argued the other way, \nthis is not only a bad principle to set and a rule that should not be \nadopted, but the timing could not be worse. The oil and gas industry, \nthe domestic energy industry has just begun to recover from the last \nyear and a half which saw oil prices fall to one of the lowest \nconstant-dollar prices in history. We have been recovering over the \nlast several months. But as you know, this is very volatile. The prices \ncan go high; they can go low. Businesses open; they shut down. People \nare laid off. Savings accounts are used up. Industries and businesses \ngo out of business and come back. So we are used to it, but it is still \ntough. To be acting this way at this time for an industry that is \nrecovering--I do not know how much we want to push because 57 percent \nof all the oil and gas is now imported. That is up from 36 percent in \n1974.\n  No. 1, we should not be badgering this industry at this time. We \nshould be supporting them, particularly when they have a very \nlegitimate request. They are not requesting to reduce the royalties \nthey pay. They are not requesting their fair share to be delayed in any \nway. They are asking us, as we develop a rule, to help make the rule \nsimple, transparent, and clear so they know what they owe and we know \nwhat they owe. We can then get out of the courtroom and get back to the \nbusiness of running our Government. You yourself have been very \nsympathetic and very supportive and encouraging as we have attempted to \ncreate a real wildlife and land conservation trust fund for this \nNation, which was promised and never delivered because the money goes \ninto the general Treasury; it does not go into a real fund.\n\n  So many of us are working on that. That is why this issue is very \nimportant. That is why it is important we get this rule right and we \nget it straight. It is important that these royalties can flow into our \nTreasury and then, in turn, flow into a real account that some of us \nwant to establish so we can fund tremendous environmental programs \nthroughout this Nation, and so our States and our counties and our \ncities can count on these revenues to expand parks and recreation, \nwhich is important not only to\n\n[[Page S11290]]\n\nCalifornia and not only to Wisconsin but important to Illinois and to \nLouisiana and to Texas and to all the States and the people we \nrepresent.\n  So, yes, it is important to get it right. That is why some of us are \ntaking some time on the floor to urge our colleagues to vote to not \nallow this complicated and ineffective rule to go into place but to \ngive us the time to work it out so the oil companies can pay their fair \nshare.\n  I also have to say I find it sort of odd, because the oil companies \ndid not support me when I came to the Senate, I am feeling kind of odd \nabout having to speak so strongly, but I think there have been things \nsaid on this floor that are offensive.\n  Just because they are big oil does not mean they are bad oil. Just \nbecause they are oil and gas does not mean they are not a legitimate, \nterrific business that is doing their business in a better, more \nenvironmentally sensitive way. They create thousands of jobs directly \nin my State and around this Nation. Without the work of the oil and gas \nindustry, there would not be the lights lit in this Chamber; there \nwould not be the factories operating; we would not have the clothes on \nour back.\n  So I take offense at others who come to the floor and talk about them \nas ``thieves'' or suggest that they would--they did not use the word \n``bribe,'' so I will be clear that is not what was said, but to infer \nthat some companies would go so far.\n  We all know our system of campaign finance has to be changed and \naltered and improved. There is hardly anyone in this Chamber who does \nnot agree with that. But as a Senator who represents this industry--and \nI represent all the people in my State. I represent the big companies \nand the little companies, the employees, the people who do not work for \noil companies. That is my job. But I want to say on their behalf I am \noffended by some things I heard on the floor.\n  This is not a rip-off. This is not an intention to rip off the \ntaxpayer. This is not an effort to steal school lunches from \nschoolchildren. This is a legitimate and complicated business, \nfinancial and accounting issue that should be resolved, not by the \nbureaucrats but by the Members of this body. So by postponing this \nrule, hopefully, the Members of Congress can come up with a better way, \na clearer way to keep us out of court.\n  So I yield back the remainder of my time, if I can, to the Senator \nfrom Texas. I thank the Chair and hope we can stay on the central \narguments of this issue because it is important, and I think all \nSenators should have the right to be heard on the pros and cons of the \noil royalty valuation in the limited time we have and try to give the \nSenators an opportunity to speak on this important issue before the \ndebate is shut off.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague \nfrom Louisiana. I think she said it very well. The idea that we would \nin any way impugn the integrity of anyone in the Senate on this issue \nis wrong. I do not believe that was meant, but I do think that it came \nacross that way.\n  I am glad she spoke from her heart. I will, too. I had much the same \nexperience. I had not remembered it because I do not count \ncontributions, but I was not supported in the early stages when I first \nran because I was running against an incumbent. That did not make any \ndifference; I am representing all the people of Texas and doing what I \nthink is right for America.\n  What I think is right for America is to keep jobs in America. Oil \njobs are good jobs. Oil jobs are supporting families all over this \ncountry. What we are seeing is more and more jobs moving overseas. They \nare being lost by Americans and American families. That means we are \nnot only losing jobs in the oil sector, but we are also, unfortunately, \ndepending on imports for more and more of our basic oil needs in our \ncountry. We are getting ready to go into winter, and the last thing we \nneed is higher prices on oil. The last thing we need is higher prices \non gasoline at the pump. Yet if we do not pass this amendment, that is \nexactly what will happen. That is exactly what will happen. Every \nperson in America is going to pay higher gasoline prices if we do not \npass my amendment.\n  So I thank the Senator from Louisiana for her leadership, and her \ncolleague, Senator Breaux, for his leadership, in showing how important \nit is.\n  Senator Breaux earlier made a point that I think is very important. \nIt is shown by this chart. We all would like to have a simpler and \nfairer oil royalty tax on the oil industry so there isn't a dispute.\n  All the lawsuits that are being discussed are about disputes on how \nmuch is owed by oil companies. None of us want oil companies to cheat \nthe American schoolchildren or the Indian tribes--none of us. We want \nthe oil companies to pay their fair share. Part of the dispute is \nbecause it is so complicated. We would like to see a simpler system.\n  Unfortunately, what the Mineral Management Service has preliminarily \nproposed is this kind of trying to set oil royalty rates. Not only are \nthey making you have to go through all these hoops, but they do not put \nout any kind of ruling letter that would allow an oil company, an \nindependent producer to know what the precedent is. So that independent \nhas to spend thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of dollars every \ntime there is a dispute to determine what they owe to the people of our \ncountry.\n  Now, Mr. President, I would like to----\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I will.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I would like to yield back the remainder of my time, \nunder rule XXII, to Senator Gorton.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator from Louisiana for yielding that \ntime to Senator Gorton, but I hope we will not need it. I hope the \nSenator from California will not continue to hold up the Senate in \npassing the very important Interior appropriations bill that is \nimportant to her State, to my State, and every State in our country.\n  We are now into dilatory tactics. We are now into prolonging \nsomething that is already accomplished. It is a matter of letting the \nSenate do its will. Sixty people in the Senate believe we need an up-\nor-down vote on this amendment. We are going to have an up-or-down vote \non the amendment. I do not see a purpose, other than after an hour or \nso of legitimate debate--which I think the Senator has already \nreceived--of prolonging this. Particularly, I hope there will not be an \nattempt to prolong it with irrelevant and nongermane discussion.\n  So I am going to go back to the bill because I think it is very \nimportant. Our amendment seeks to simplify the rulemaking by the \nMineral Management Service. This is what is proposed. Who can figure it \nout? No wonder there is a dispute between the oil companies and the \nFederal Government or the State government. If this is what the Federal \nGovernment is putting forward, it is not a precedent for anything. I do \nthink we need to simplify.\n\n  The question is, Do we want to raise gas taxes? That is what the MMS \nwould propose to do in this circuitous route.\n  I want to talk about where we are on the price of gasoline at the \npump. Every American who fills up their tank knows that the price of \ngasoline has gone up. It is estimated that today the average price of \ngasoline in our country is about $1.20 a gallon. Of that $1.20, the \nlight part of this chart shows how much is taxes--I am sorry, the light \npart shows how much is crude oil. The light part is 64 cents. That is \nthe cost of crude oil in a gallon of gasoline. But the dark part is 56 \ncents, and that is taxes.\n  If the Senator from California succeeds in defeating my amendment, \ngas taxes are going to go up, because the MMS, with the circuitous \nroute they are proposing, in fact, is going to tax the price of \ngasoline, not at the wellhead, as it has always been and as is the \nstandard in the industry, but instead, after it goes through the \nmarketing process and through the pipelines, after it is transported, \nall of those costs will be included in what is\n\n[[Page S11291]]\n\ntaxed. Basically, what the MMS is doing is raising taxes on every \ngallon of gas that is bought at the pump by every hard-working \nAmerican. That is the essence of what will happen if my amendment \nfails.\n  The policy of taxing expenses in business is also something very new. \nI don't think a Federal agency should be able to change tax policy so \nwe now start taxing expenses because that is exactly what happens. If \nwe have the requirement that oil be marketed and transported and we \nraise the price accordingly and we tax that expense, we are talking \nabout a whole new era. Instead of a Federal excise tax on a Beanie Baby \nbeing made when the Beanie Baby comes out of the manufacturing shop, it \nwill be taxed on the retail shelf. That means every Beanie Baby that is \nmarketed in this country and transported by truck to a building, where \nit can be sold at retail, is going to be taxed. You are going to have \nto pay the added tax in the price of that Beanie Baby.\n  The price is already going up. We are talking about a whole new \nconcept that the MMS is trying to start with the oil industry, to set a \nprecedent--no vote of any Member of Congress. Then we will see that \nstart happening in other industries as well. It is a very dangerous \nprecedent.\n  This chart shows what has happened to the price of gasoline at the \npump in the last 10 years.\n  In 1990, the price of gasoline was about $1.21 per gallon. That was \nthe average price in 1990. Of that, 26 cents was gasoline taxes and 94 \ncents was the cost of the crude oil in that gasoline that was bought at \nthe pump. Move down to 1997; the retail price has moved up to $1.29. \nLook at what has happened to the costs. The costs have actually gone \ndown. The cost of the oil in that gallon of gasoline has gone from 94 \ncents per gallon to 88 cents per gallon. So if that is the case, why \nhas the price of gasoline at the pump gone up? It is because taxes have \nincreased from 26 cents per gallon to 40 cents per gallon. That is why \noil prices have gone up in the last 10 years.\n  The Senator from California wants to defeat my amendment, which will \nhave the effect of raising the taxes on oil, which means every American \nis going to pay a higher tax than 40 cents per gallon. It is going to \ngo up by however much MMS says. But if we start taxing the expenses of \nmarketing and transportation, we could see 50 cents a gallon going into \nthe price of gasoline at the pump and we could start looking at $1.39 \nbeing the average price of gasoline per gallon.\n  I think it is very important that we look at where the price of oil \nhas gone up and what is causing Americans to pay higher prices at the \npump. Because we import 57 percent of the oil from foreign countries \nand because OPEC has now limited what they are going to produce, the \nprice of the imported oil is also going up. So put added taxes, which \ndefeating my amendment will achieve, with the higher price of imported \noil--you cause oil companies to stop drilling in America because it is \nnow so expensive to do so, and it is going to be more expensive if my \namendment fails--and you have the triple whammy. You have our jobs \nmoving overseas, our dependency on foreign oil rising to 57 percent and \ncontinuing to go up, and the hard-working American paying higher prices \nfor gasoline at the pump.\n  That is not a good solution. We should not be allowing Federal \nagencies to raise the price of gasoline at the pump by raising the \nprice of oil, by taxing it at a higher rate, without so much as one \nvote by a Member of Congress who is accountable to the people.\n  If the Senators who want to defeat my amendment want to pass a tax \nincrease up or down based on the principles they are espousing from the \nMMS, let them do it. Let them do it on a straight-up vote. Let them \ncome to the Senate floor and defend raising gasoline taxes on every \nhard-working American. That is what the effect of defeating my \namendment will be.\n  Why not do it straight up? I call on the Senators who are trying to \ndefeat my amendment to say: OK, I want higher gasoline taxes; I want \nhard-working Americans to pay not $1.20 or $1.29 at the pump; I want \nthem to pay $1.39 or $1.49. If that is their goal, let's address it \nstraight on, because that is the effect of defeating the Hutchison-\nDomenici amendment.\n  I hope we can have a debate that is based on the issues affecting \nthis amendment. Let's talk about raising gasoline prices on hard-\nworking Americans who are seeing prices go up already. Let's talk about \nwhat will happen if we have a crisis in the Middle East and we have 5-\nhour gas lines and we have to pay higher prices to get the gasoline for \nwhich we wait 5 hours to fill our tanks. Let's talk about the real \nissue here, which is raising the price of gasoline at the pump on hard-\nworking Americans.\n  I don't think that is what Congress wants to do. I think that is why \n60 Members of Congress said let us have an up-or-down vote. That is the \nissue today, Mr. President.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Texas withhold her \nquorum call?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am happy to allow the Senator to be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator from Texas. I do look forward to this \ndebate. We have, for the first time, a debate about this particular \nrider to an appropriations bill on the Senate floor, finally.\n  (Mr. BUNNING assumed the chair.)\n  Mrs. BOXER. The Hutchison rider has been agreed to many times in the \ndead of night in the committee. But the Senate has never had time to \nexplore all that it means. It is a tough debate going on here. I think \nit is good because, again, it shows, in many ways, the difference \nbetween the two parties, who stands for whom, where we come out.\n  I thought comments of the Senator from Wisconsin about the role of \ncampaign contributions to the political parties, as he pointed it out, \nwas germane. We may have a vote about that later. He is simply pointing \nout a fact that has been noted in the USA Today, the Los Angeles Times, \nthe New York Times, which is that, in fact, campaign contributions \ntaint this debate. Even if everybody is pure of heart and pure of soul \nin this Senate--and I pray that is the case--there is an appearance \nhere. It doesn't look right when you realize that 5 percent of the oil \ncompanies--mostly big oil--are not paying their fair share of \nroyalties.\n  We show it right here on the chart. The cost of the Hutchison \namendment would represent $66 million that would otherwise go to the \ntaxpayers, to the Land and Water Conservation Fund, the national parks, \nhistoric monuments, and to the States to go into the classrooms. So it \nis very important that when these decisions are made, they are being \nmade by the pure of heart because you have a situation where the oil \ncompanies are not paying their fair share--5 percent of the oil \ncompanies--and the people are therefore not getting their fair share to \ngo into the classrooms and the national parks. Therefore, we want to \nmake sure the decision is based on the facts, not on campaign \ncontributions.\n  I thought the Senator from Wisconsin was absolutely brilliant in his \ndiscussion and laying down the facts that show these campaign \ncontributions. I hope if we do have a vote on whether that is germane, \nwe will, in fact, find that the Senator from Wisconsin can continue his \nremarks because I think it goes to the heart of the matter. So just to \nshow why I have taken the time of the Senate on this, I want to look \nagain at this chart, which I call ``Big Oil's Big Rip Off.'' Because of \nthis rider, we have lost $66 million from the Treasury--excuse me, we \nhave already lost $88 million from the Treasury. Under this amendment, \nwe lose another $66 million. That would mean if this amendment passes, \nthe total cost of the oil rider will be $154 million to the taxpayers.\n  I find it really interesting--a couple of things that the Senator \nfrom Texas now says--that if we collect the fair share of royalties, we \nwill see an increase in gasoline at the pump. Let me tell you why I \nfind that really interesting. We have debated this issue for many years \nnow, and we have heard every argument being used. It always changes.\n  The first argument as to why we should not allow Bruce Babbitt and \nthe Interior Department to collect a fair\n\n[[Page S11292]]\n\namount of royalties from the oil companies was that oil companies are \nbeing fair. Why, we are not cheating; we are paying the fair share. \nThey argue that. That didn't fly. The newspapers didn't buy it. Nobody \nreally bought it. So the next argument is, well, maybe there needs to \nbe a clarification. Maybe what we are paying isn't exactly right. We \ndon't admit that, but let's have a clarification. But we need more \ntime. So let's not allow the Interior Department to decide this matter \nnow; let's buy some time.\n  OK. Then they went to the third issue because that didn't fly very \nwell anymore. The third excuse was that we haven't had enough public \ncomment period on the rule. But go ahead and again open up public \ncomment, and we will be glad to pay our fair share. Well, there were 17 \nmeetings held, and then they opened up the public comment period again. \nWe have heard every excuse in the world, bar none, as to why we should \nnot be collecting the $154 million that is due taxpayers. The latest \none is: Oh, oh, you better not allow Bruce Babbitt to go after those \nroyalties because your prices will go up at the pump. Well, we know for \na fact--if you look at the amount of money this means to the oil \ncompanies--it is a tiny percentage.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at this point a \nchart that shows what these royalties mean to the big oil companies.\n  There being no objection, the chart was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                               1996 Total                            Percent of         Potential          Percent of\n                         Company                            Revenue (Oil and    1996 Roy Paid     Royalty Paid Vs.

The list that is going into the Record shows all of the \nbig oil companies and what this really means for them. It is so small \nthat these royalty payments, in some cases, can't even be measured. \nThey are so minuscule, they can't even be measured. The largest one is \n.07 percent of their revenues. So to stand up here and say your oil \nprices are going to go up is ludicrous. It is completely a new argument \nthat absolutely holds no weight. Even if they were to pass this on, it \nwould not even be a penny a gallon. It would not even be a mill.\n  Let's face it; this isn't anything about higher gas prices because it \ndoesn't even impact these companies. This isn't about any of that. It \nis about fairness; it is about justice. How do we know that it is about \nfairness and justice? The whistleblowers who work for big oil have \ntestified. Let me tell you about something I have not even mentioned \nbefore in this debate. Recently, there was a lawsuit filed on behalf of \ntwo whistleblowers from big oil, and the lawsuit is quite compelling. \nIt is so compelling that the Justice Department actually joined in as a \nparty to the lawsuit.\n  I know we have heard many seven schemes. We have heard of the Seven \nWonders of the World; the Seven Years' War; Seven Brides for Seven \nBrothers; the Seven Seas; Seventh Heaven; Seven Days of the Week; \nSeventh Inning Stretch--which is what we could probably use right now--\nSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs; Lucky Number Seven; Dance of the Seven \nVeils; the Seven Year Itch. How about even this biblical one: Forgive \nyour enemies 70 times 7; Seven Hills of Rome; the Magnificent Seven; \nSeven Days in May; the Seven Percent Solution. There is even a book \ncalled ``The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People''; Seven-Up. We \nhave heard of 7-Eleven stores; Seven Samurai; Double-O Seven; there is \neven Seven Sleepers of Ephesus.\n  So we have heard a lot about sevens in history, and today on this \nfloor of the Senate I am going to talk about another seven. This isn't \na pretty one. This isn't a movie. This isn't a song. This isn't a \nsaying. This is a lawsuit, a lawsuit that outlined the seven schemes of \nthe oil companies--the seven schemes of the oil companies to defraud \nthe taxpayers. I am going to speak to you from this lawsuit. I am going \nto read to you right from this lawsuit. Before you fall asleep and \nthink it is boring, it is not boring. These are two whistleblowers, \nformer ARCO executives, big boys in the echelon, who cleansed their \nsouls. This is what they said in a lawsuit under penalty of perjury:\n\n       Causes of action alleged herein arise from a nationwide \n     conspiracy by some of the world's largest oil companies to \n     shortchange the United States of America of hundreds of \n     millions of dollars in revenues known as royalties.\n\n  Let me repeat that because this is the crux of what is before us \ntoday. Two whistleblowers from the highest echelons of the big oil \ncompanies stated under penalty of perjury that there is a ``nationwide \nconspiracy by some of the world's largest oil companies to shortchange \nthe United States of America of hundreds of millions of dollars in \nrevenues known as royalties.''\n  What does this amendment do? Why am I taking the Senate's time? I \nwant to shine the light of truth on this issue.\n  The Department of the Interior knows this scam is going on, and they \nwant to fix it. What we have before us is an amendment to stop the \nInterior\n\n[[Page S11293]]\n\nDepartment. You can see from the poster by my good friend from Texas. \nNow the argument is: Turn your sights on the Interior Department; they \nare corrupt. This is a new argument about trial lawyers. I haven't \nheard that one before. I guess they keep taking a poll to see who is \npopular, and then they try to argue with us because they cannot argue \nwith us on the merits.\n  I think it is also very interesting because the Senator from Texas \nand the Senator from Wyoming tried to stop Senator Feingold from \ntalking about the oil company contributions. They are coming up with \nthe trial lawyers. I find it is interesting. That is fine. I don't mind \nthat. I wouldn't gag any of my colleagues. They can say whatever they \nwant because the issue here is clear. It is stated in a lawsuit:\n\n       There is a nationwide conspiracy by some of the world's \n     largest oil companies to shortchange the United States of \n     America of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue known \n     as royalties.\n\n  That is not a statement by trial lawyers; that is a statement under \npenalty of perjury by two former employees of big oil.\n  Let's see what else they say.\n  They say:\n\n       There is a pattern and a practice of carefully developed \n     and coordinated schemes targeted to defraud the United States \n     of America of its lawful share of royalties owed by the \n     defendants, the oil companies, for crude oil produced in \n     United States owned or controlled land.\n\n  In English language, it means that when these oil companies drill on \nlands that belong to the people of the United States of America, land \nof the United States, either onshore or offshore, they are not paying \ntheir royalties.\n  To continue:\n\n       The oil companies' unlawful conduct is continuing in nature \n     and these major oil companies operating in the United \n     States have underpaid oil royalties to the United States \n     by calculating the royalties based on prices less than the \n     total consideration actually received by the oil \n     companies.\n\n  In English language, these royalties are not being based on the fair \nmarket price, which is what they have to be, according to the lease \nthey sign. Let's take a look at that lease they signed because I think \nthat is pretty telling.\n  The Senator from Texas keeps referring to a royalty as a tax. A \nroyalty is not a tax. A royalty is paid subject to an agreement. When \noil companies drill on lands that belong to ``we, the people,'' they \nhave to pay something for it. It is a privilege, and they have to pay \nsomething for it. The ``something'' that they pay for is the subject of \nthis debate.\n  The Department of the Interior says--and these whistleblowers say--\nthat 5 percent of the oil companies are cheating and 95 percent are \ndoing the right thing. They are paying the fair market value--their \nroyalty is based on a fair market value--but 5 percent of the companies \nthat are cheating us are not. We know that to be the case.\n  So let's look at the agreement that the oil companies signed. They \nsigned an agreement that says the value of production for purposes of \ncomputing royalty on production shall never be less than the fair \nmarket value of the production. It further says gas of all kinds, \nexcept helium, is subject to royalties and that, for purposes of \ncomputing, the royalty from this lease shall never be less than the \nfair market value of production.\n  That is the subject of this debate. Five percent of the oil companies \nare not paying the fair market value.\n  Let's look at some of the companies and the posted prices.\n  Whistleblowers have told us that these oil company executives sit \naround and plan to defraud the people. It is all in this lawsuit, and \nit is reflected in this chart. If you track the market price of oil--\nright here we have done that-- from July 1997 to June 1998, just to \ngive you an example, this blue line is the market price.\n  How do we know the market price? It is listed in oil publications \nevery day. We know what it is. It is really definable. If you track \nthat market price compared with this red line, which is the ARCO posted \nprice--in other words, that is the price ARCO decided to pay royalties \non--what do you see? You see a differential of about $4 per barrel. \nSometimes it is less--$2. But it can go up to $4 or $5 in difference. \nWhat does that mean? It means that the taxpayers are being defrauded by \nthis amount in the middle, in between the two.\n  Do we have another oil company? It just doesn't happen in ARCO. I \ndon't want to say it just happens in ARCO.\n  Here we have another oil company. We track the market prices and the \nposted prices. Isn't it amazing? Why is it this way? Because these \ncompanies are cheating the Government. They are not paying the \nroyalties based on the blue line, which is the market price, which they \nhave to, according to the agreement they signed. This isn't about \ntaxes, my friends. This is a royalty agreement. They are paying the \nroyalty based on the red line, and the taxpayers are getting ripped \noff.\n  You may say, well, what is $4 a barrel with $2 to $4 on a regular \nbasis? It is a lot. Let me tell you what it is. We are not talking \nabout peanuts; we are talking about real dollars. Let's talk about \nthat.\n  This amendment that is before us today, on which the Senator from \nTexas, Mrs. Hutchison, got 60 votes--just the amount she needed, and \nnot 1 vote to spare to bring this amendment to the floor--is about real \ndollars, $66 million. What can you do with $66 million?\n  By the way, that is only 1 year. If this continues, we are looking at \n$1/2 billion pretty soon, and $1 billion after that.\n\n  Let's take 1 year for this particular amendment, $66 million. We \ncould have hired 1,000 teachers with that. We know we need more \nteachers in the classroom. These royalty payments, when they go to the \nStates, are used in the classroom. Anyone who talks about how we need \nmore money for education, we could hire 1,000 teachers with the $66 \nmillion.\n  Maybe you don't want to hire teachers. Maybe you want to improve the \nschools. We can put 44,000 new computers in the classroom with $66 \nmillion. That is just this year. Or we can buy textbooks for 1.2 \nmillion students.\n  Have you ever looked at some of the textbooks in our public schools? \nWhen I was a kid and I got a textbook--it was a long time ago; I plead \nguilty to that--when we opened up a textbook in those happy days, it \nsmelled clean and fresh. It was clean and fresh. It was ours. Today, \nsome of the textbooks have writing; they are old; they are falling \napart. What kind of message is that?\n  I could be challenged: Why is the Senator from California talking \nabout schools, textbooks, and teachers? Easy. The money we would get if \nwe defeat the Hutchison amendment could buy 1.2 million students new \ntextbooks.\n  If you want to do something for the safety net with that $66 million, \nwe could provide 53 million hot lunches for schoolchildren, lunches \nthat have more than ketchup, I might say; lunches with nourishment, \nnutrition. We know a lot of our kids need that.\n  When these oil companies sit around and plot to defraud the \ngovernment--and we have it here, under penalty of perjury, that that is \nwhat they do with seven schemes. We have the schemes outlined. Later in \nthe debate I will get into exactly what are the seven schemes. \nEssentially, all seven are schemes to lower the value of the oil that \nis pumped from Federal lands. They have intricate ways of doing that. \nIt is spelled out right here. I will read a little more from this \ncomplaint.\n  These whistleblowers, who were former executives high up in the chain \nof big oil, say:\n\n       . . .they have knowledge of the unlawful conduct, including \n     the schemes and the practices alleged herein, which include \n     the oil company's misrepresentation and underpayment of oil \n     royalty payments to the United States.\n\n  They go through the schemes. Does anyone want to challenge the \nauthenticity of these charges from these whistleblowers, former oil \nexecutives, who say they have ``direct knowledge that this is going \non.'' They call it ``conspiratorial activities'' to cheat the United \nStates out of its royalty income by deflating the base price of oil \nupon which royalties are to be paid.\n  This is thievery. People say: Why are you taking the time of the \nSenate, Senator Boxer? It is because I love this place too much to see \nus put our imprimatur on this scheme.\n  Let's read directly from the Platt's Oil article that shows exactly \nwhat one of these executives said under penalty of perjury. This is an \narticle that appeared over the summer of this year in an oil company \nreport. This isn't from\n\n[[Page S11294]]\n\nthe New York Times. We have gotten a good article from the New York \nTimes. We have gotten good articles from USA Today and the Los Angeles \nTimes. We have gotten good articles in South Dakota; we have gotten \ngood articles in Michigan. All of those editorials are saying Senator \nBoxer is right.\n  This is from an oil company newspaper, so it should have total \ncredibility with all who take the oil company's side. I will read this \narticle entitled ``Retired ARCO Employee Says Company Underpaid Oil \nRoyalties.''\n\n       A retired Atlantic Richfield employee has admitted in court \n     that while he was the secretary of ARCO's crude pricing \n     committee, the major's posted prices were far below the fair \n     market value.\n\n  Let me repeat that. An oil company executive who worked in this area \nsaid that the ``posted prices''--that is, the price that the oil \ncompany paid the royalty on--was ``far below the fair market value.''\n  Let's look at the chart again. He is saying the amount they paid \ntheir royalties on--remember, the royalty is a percentage, about 12 \npercent if it is onshore, 12 percent of the fair market value. They did \n12 percent of their made-up posted price.\n  He is not anonymous. This man has a name. He has put his good name \nout there. He has said under penalty of perjury in court that what he \nsays is true. Harry Anderson is his name. He testified this month in an \nongoing suit, and he said he was a witness to the inner workings of \nARCO. According to court documents, Anderson testified that the primary \npurpose of the crude pricing committee was to set the posted prices for \nthe mid-continent, Alaskan and California crudes. In other words, it \nwas his job to decide what was the posted price. On that posted price, \nthey would pay their royalties. Whatever Mr. Anderson and his friends \ndecided was that fair market value called the posted price, that is on \nwhat they would pay the royalties.\n  This chart shows consistently these prices were below the market \nprice listed in the paper. Could this be an accident? No, because he \nsaid ARCO's postings were within 15 to 30 cents per barrel of the \nothers, and at least $4 to $5 below what was accepted as fair market \nvalue for crude.\n  What he said was all of the majors were doing this. This 5 percent \nthat we say are doing the wrong thing were within a few cents of each \nother, and all of them, according to him, were $4 to $5 below the fair \nmarket price. That is even more than we said, $2 to $4. He says in a \ncertain period of time they were $4 to $5 below market price.\n  Under penalty of perjury, a man with the inside knowledge of what was \ngoing on, said that ARCO and the other ``posters''--meaning the posted \nprice people--never raised the posted price to the market value. We see \nthat is true. We plotted the market price during that period and here \nis the posted price. He says all of our calculations, all the public \ninformation on refined values relating to California crudes say the \nfair market value was well in excess of the posting.\n  That is another way of putting it: The fair market value was well in \nexcess; it was more than the posted prices that they put down.\n  He said, and this is really interesting, he was:\n\n       . . . not being truthful 5 years ago when he testified in a \n     deposition that ARCO's posted prices represented fair market \n     value.\n\n  So the man admits that he wasn't truthful before in court. He is \ncleansing his soul and he is now telling the truth. He goes on to say, \nand this is chilling, in explanation for why he lied about the fair \nmarket value:\n\n       I was an ARCO employee. Some of the issues being discussed \n     were still being litigated.\n\n  Listen to this. He says:\n\n       My plan was to get to retirement. We had seen numerous \n     occasions where the nail that stood up got beaten down.\n\n  What does that mean? Someone who had the courage to stand up in the \nface of the higher-ups and tell the truth that they were cheating \ntaxpayers got beaten down. Harry Anderson said that. It is pretty \nchilling. He goes on. He said:\n\n       The senior executives of ARCO had the judgment that they \n     would take the money, accrue for the day of judgment, and \n     that's what we did.\n\n  What does he mean by that, ``take the money'' and wait ``for the day \nof judgment?''\n  What he means is they would lie about the value of the oil, not give \nthe true market value, pay less of a royalty, pocket the money, and \nwait for the judgment day.\n  Maybe the judgment day is here, I say to my friends. Maybe if this \nSenate has some courage, we can stop this fraud today. We will not be \nstopping it if we approve the Hutchison amendment, I will say that. Mr. \nAnderson said he was afraid he would lose his retirement if he didn't \ngo along with the game. Mr. Anderson said the other executives said: \nWhat the heck, we'll just lie about this and we'll wait for the \njudgment day. That is a translation of what he said. He goes on to say \neven more chilling things. He goes on to say:\n\n       I would not have been there in any capacity had I continued \n     to exercise the right they had given me to dissent to the \n     process during the discussion stage.\n\n  Let me repeat that:\n\n       I would not have been there in any capacity had I continued \n     to exercise the right they had given me to dissent to the \n     process during the discussion stage.\n\n  In other words, Mr. Anderson is saying if I blew the whistle, I would \nbe gone. If I did not go along with this scheme--and we now know seven \nschemes--that he would be gone. He says further:\n\n       Once we made our decisions, the ranks closed.\n\n  So they sat around, decided to wait for the judgment day, and people \nlike Harry Anderson who were afraid for their retirement went along \nwith the scheme. Then he says: Once we made our decision we closed \nranks. That was the deal.\n  He says further:\n\n       I did not get to be a manager and remain a manager being \n     oblivious and blind to signals.\n\n  What an ethic. What an ethic. Where is the corporate responsibility, \nwhen they have someone who is honest in their ranks and he is afraid to \ntalk because he will get fired, he won't get his retirement? When he \ntalks up about how the company underpaid oil royalties, he is finished. \nSo he doesn't talk up. And he is feeling guilty and he is carrying this \non his back. He comes clean in a lawsuit where he just says: I was \nafraid of losing my job if I told the truth.\n\n  We are going to protect that kind of behavior by the oil companies by \nvoting for this amendment? I pray not. I pray not. I really hope some \nof the folks who voted for cloture to bring this debate to a close will \njoin me on the substance of this thing. I have never in all my years in \npolitics--and I have been in politics so long I am embarrassed to tell \nyou that I was elected the first time in 1976. I have seen a lot of \nthings. I have seen issues that were cloudy. I have seen issues where \nthe line between right and wrong was fudged. They say every issue has \ntwo sides. This one does. The oil companies versus the people. That is \nthe two sides.\n  The Interior Department wants to make sure the oil companies pay \ntheir fair share so the people get their fair share. We will show you \nthe money again; the money, what is at stake here. If we do not vote \ndown the Hutchison amendment, the people of America will have lost $154 \nmillion.\n  Let's suppose you do not even like to spend it on national parks; you \ndon't want to spend it in classrooms. How about paying down the debt? I \nwill bet a lot of folks think that is a good idea. But, no, if we vote \nfor the Hutchison amendment, we lose a cumulative $154 million.\n  I want to read into the Record a letter I just received from the \nConsumer Federation of America. First, I want to say a word about the \ngroups that have really worked hard to defeat this Hutchison amendment. \nI just told you before there are two sides on this amendment: the oil \ncompanies versus the people of the United States of America. I believe \nthat in my heart. We have over 50 groups that are helping us defeat \nthis amendment. Every one of them is worthy of mention, but I do not \nhave time at this point to mention them all, so I will mention some of \nthem:\n  The American Association of Educational Service Agencies--they know \nthey are being robbed of education funds by this amendment. They oppose \nit. The American Association of School Administrators, the American \nFederation of Government Employees, the\n\n[[Page S11295]]\n\nAmerican Federation of Teachers--they have to be in the classrooms with \nthe books that don't measure up, without computers. They want to fight \nfor this. They are against the Hutchison amendment.\n  American Rivers, Americans for Clean Energy, the Arkansas State Lands \nCommission, the California State Superintendent of Public Instruction, \nthe Clean Fuels Foundation, Common Cause. Common Cause understands what \nis at stake here. They agree with Senator Feingold when he stood up--\nand they tried to gag him when he said there is a tie-in between this \namendment and the campaign finances where big special interests like \nthe tobacco companies, the oil companies, you name it, have an \nincredible amount of influence. Again, even if everyone was pure of \nheart it looks terrible to see the special interests win on these.\n  The Better Government Association is with us, the Colorado State \nBoard of Land Commissioners, the Consumer Project on Technology--they \nknow they need technology in schools--Defenders of Wildlife. It is an \nincredible list. The Friends of the Earth, the Gray Panthers--they are \nthe elderly. They understand we need to support our parks and our kids \nand our schools; the Montana Department of Natural Resources and \nConservation.\n  I am just on the M's, and this goes all the way to the W's.\n  I want to comment on one of the organizations that has worked so hard \nwith me and others on this, U.S. Public Interest Research Group, U.S. \nPIRG. They have worked very diligently talking with colleagues, and we \nhave kept this fight alive because of these people. We have kept this \nfight on the front pages of some of the newspapers because of these \npeople. Hopefully, tonight we will see it on TV.\n  The Washington State Lands Commissioner; the Wilderness Society; the \nWisconsin Secretary of State and Chair, Board of Commissioners of \nPublic Lands--this is an incredible list. I left out the N's and the \nP's, and I will have to get back to them later.\n  Today, I have a new letter from the Consumer Federation of America. \nLet me read it. This is one of the foremost consumer groups in the \ncountry. I have to say it is now headed by a beloved colleague, Howard \nMetzenbaum, who served here as the voice of the consumers for so long, \nthe voice for the people who do not have a voice, the voice for the \npeople who have to get up in the morning and go to work, the people who \ncannot afford to send their lobbyists here and the people who cannot \nafford campaign contributions.\n\n  What does he say in this letter?\n\n       The Consumer Federation of America joins you in opposing \n     the Hutchison-Domenici rider to [this bill]. [The \n     organization] is concerned about the decline in \n     accountability of many corporations to the needs and concerns \n     of consumers, communities, and national interests. This rider \n     is a case study in this lack of accountability, not to \n     mention an unjustified subsidy by the taxpayers to the [big] \n     oil companies.\n       According to the Department of Interior, eighteen oil \n     companies have consistently undervalued the cost of oil \n     drilled on federal land to avoid paying [their royalty \n     payments] of about $66 million a year.\n\n  He goes on to say we have already lost $88 million and that this \namendment of Senator Hutchison will, in fact, delay the Department of \nthe Interior--even a better word--``prohibit the Department of Interior \nfrom finalizing their regulations'' to require the oil companies to pay \ntheir royalties based on the fair market price of the oil, not on a \nlower price established by the oil companies themselves.\n  Howard Metzenbaum said it as straight as one can. They are paying \nroyalties on their made-up price rather than on the market price.\n  He goes on to say that the Consumer Federation of America opposes \nthis rider for two reasons.\n  One:\n\n       The undervaluation of oil drilled on Federal land amounts \n     to nothing more than corporate welfare. The practice \n     represents an unjustified subsidy, especially to the larger \n     oil companies that are in a position to reap huge returns \n     from oil drilled on Federal land.\n\n  Second:\n\n       Taxpayers must pick up the tab for this subsidy, to the \n     tune of tens of millions of dollars a year.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       The Consumer Federation of America applauds you for your \n     efforts to insure that taxpayers receive a fair return from \n     federal oil sales.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in \nthe Record, along with a list of groups that are, in fact, opposing the \nHutchison amendment.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                               Consumer Federation of America,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 23, 1999.\n\n     Re Urgent! CFA opposes Hutchison-Domenici oil royalty rider.\n\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: The Consumer Federation of America \n     (CFA) joins you in opposing the Hutchison-Domenici rider to \n     the FY 2000 Department of Interior Appropriations bill. CFA \n     is concerned about the decline in accountability of many \n     corporations to the needs and concerns of consumers, \n     communities, and national interests. This rider is a case \n     study in this lack of accountability, not to mention an \n     unjustified subsidy by the taxpayers to large oil companies.\n       According to the Department of Interior, eighteen oil \n     companies have consistently undervalued the cost of oil \n     drilled on federal land and avoided paying fees of about $66 \n     million a year. Since this rider first took effect last year, \n     an estimated $88 million in royalties have not been \n     collected. This rider would prohibit the Department of \n     Interior from finalizing regulations that would require oil \n     companies to pay royalties based on the market price of oil \n     drilled on federal land, and not on a lower price established \n     by the oil companies themselves.\n       CFA opposes this ride for two primary reasons:\n       The undervaluation of oil drilled on Federal land amounts \n     to nothing more than corporate welfare. The practice \n     represents an unjustified subsidy, especially to the larger \n     oil companies that are in a position to reap huge returns \n     from oil drilled on Federal land.\n       Taxpayers must pick up the tab for this subsidy, to the \n     tune of tens of millions of dollars a year.\n       CFA applauds you for your efforts to insure that taxpayers \n     receive a fair return from federal oil sales.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Howard H.

Mr. President, we are in quite a situation here, and I am \ngoing to go through some of the charts I have not gone through up to \nthis time.\n  When we talk about the money we will lose because of the Hutchison \namendment--and I find it ironic we are doing an appropriations bill to \nappropriate money for the various functions therein, including national \nparks, including very important functions, such as preserving historic \nmonuments--we realize we are losing $66 million, and I told you that \nmoney can go pretty far. It will affect many States.\n  My staff has been extraordinary in terms of all the research and all \nthe work they have put into this issue. I thank Jodi Linker, Matthew \nBaumgart, and the rest of my staff, and Liz Tankersley and Dave \nSandretti who helped us. When you are hit with an issue such as this \nand you know you have an uphill battle, it takes a good staff to keep \non keeping on, to keep on keeping up with the issues, and they do. I am \nso grateful to them.\n  Today I have a new chart. It shows the 11 most endangered historic \nsites in America. What is very interesting about this is that these \nbuildings qualify for Federal funds to preserve them. As we go into the \nnext millennium, we start thinking about our heritage, our great \nNation. One of the things we have to do is restore these incredible \nmonuments to our history. There are 11 of them. They desperately are \nseeking, not Susan, but funding. They must have funding because they \nare old and they will otherwise fall apart.\n  I was at one such monument. It is not 1 of the 11 great ones. It is a \nsmall one. But it is in a little town north of my home, Sonoma County. \nIt is a round barn. I never really knew what a round barn was, but it \nis famous. In the 1800s, they used to take the horses and run them \naround in this barn. We only have a couple left in California. This one \nis falling apart. It needs a few dollars. So when people say $66 \nmillion, let's look at these 11.\n  The Senator from Illinois is here, and I point out to him that one of \nthese endangered landmarks, as I remember, is in Illinois. I wonder if \nhe realizes--and I know he does--that some of this funding that would \notherwise go to the Interior Department and we are not going to see if \nthe Hutchison amendment is adopted could go to help one of the \nmonuments in his State, which is the Pullman Administration Building \nand factory complex, in Pullman, IL, which dates back to 1890.\n  All of these are very endangered. We see one in Rochester, NY, the \nMonroe Theater. We see one in Louisville, KY, a beautiful place called \nRobinswood. We see one in Cleveland, MT, Lancaster, PA, barn shadow, \n``Lost Barn.'' We see the Allen Auditorium in Alaska and, in my own \nState, the incredible Angel Island Immigration Station through which \nmany of our ancestors came. In New York State, there are four national \nhistoric landmark hospitals. There is one in Hudson Valley. It is a \nbeautiful one. One is in Baltimore, west side of downtown Baltimore, \nChinatown. It is endangered.\n  I say to my colleagues, when we are fighting against this amendment, \nwe are, in fact, saying it is not fair for 5 percent of the oil \ncompanies to do the wrong thing, to defraud the people of the United \nStates of America of their money; it is wrong to do that.\n  There are other uses for this money. We believe even if all those \nuses did not have support, paying down the debt would be better than \nallowing this big ripoff to continue.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and retain my time.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 hour.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California, again, for \nengaging in this debate. There are those who stay glued to their \nscreens watching the Senate debate from early morning to late at night.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator from Illinois will pardon the \nChair, I misstated. The Senator has 22 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Those who stay glued to the screens watching C-SPAN and the Senate \ndebate know what this is all about. Those who come to the gallery or \ntune in may not understand why we are on the floor today with a few \nMembers very deeply involved in debate.\n  This is a debate over the use of America's public lands, lands owned \nby all of us as citizens of the United States. We have a lot of them, \nliterally millions of acres. Some of them are beautiful, pristine \nparks, and some are national forests.\n  Many of these lands are used for a variety of purposes. Some are used \nfor recreational and tourism purposes, our beautiful National Park \nSystem which was instituted by a famous Republican President, Theodore \nRoosevelt, who opened Yosemite National Park and started the park \nsystem, and many other aspects such as the National Forest System, of \nwhich we have in Illinois the Shawnee National Forest, one of the more \nbeautiful parts of our State. We are very proud of it.\n  Then as you go out West, you find a variety of public lands. I am the \nsponsor of a bill, on which perhaps a dozen of my colleagues have \njoined me, for the so-called Utah Wilderness, an area much different \nfrom my national forest in southern Illinois, but as a desert, in its \nown way, it has a special beauty. It is a wilderness area owned by the \nFederal Government.\n  We say that many areas of public land are going to be protected, that \nliterally no one can use them, or, if you do, it is in a very careful \nmanner. But we say as well that there are some lands which can be used, \npublic lands, by private individuals and companies for a fee. So we \ninvite onto some lands, like national forests, logging companies that \ncome in and chop down trees. They make a profit off the lumber. They \ngive money to the Federal Government to use that land to chop those \ntrees down.\n\n  We also allow mining companies to come in on public land to mine for \nminerals which they turn around and sell. We say to western ranchers: \nYou can let your cattle graze on public lands here, chew the grass, get \nfat to bring to market to make you a profit. You will pay us a fee to \ndo it, but you are welcome to use the land.\n  This debate is about the use of public lands where oil companies come \nin and drill for oil. Keep it in perspective. The oil companies do not \nown the land. We do. The taxpayers do. The oil companies--private \ncompanies--come in and bid for the right to drill for oil. If they are \nfortunate and find oil they can then sell for a profit, they give us \nback a rental fee called a royalty. That is what this debate is all \nabout. It is about 5 percent of the oil companies in America, the \nlargest oil companies, and whether they will pay to us, as taxpayers, \nto the Federal Government, a fair rental payment, a royalty payment for \nextracting oil from our land and selling it for a profit.\n  Sounds like a pretty simple undertaking. We put a formula into law. \nThe formula said: We are going to base the royalty that you pay the \ntaxpayers for drilling oil on public lands based on what the price of \nthe oil is. It sounds eminently sensible, reasonable, and easy. It is \nnot. We found, over the last several years, that the oil companies have \nfound ways to avoid coming up\n\n[[Page S11297]]\n\nwith the real price of the oil. They have six or seven different \nschemes they use to basically pay less to the taxpayers than they are \nsupposed to pay.\n  How can I say that? I can say it because a lot of States and the \nFederal Government have taken the oil companies to court and have said \nthey did not pay the royalty required by law. The oil companies, over \nseveral years, have paid back $5 billion that was underpaid in \nroyalties. We caught them with their hands in the cookie jar. They had \nnot paid the taxpayers--State and Federal taxpayers--what they were \nrequired to pay under the law.\n  The amendment before us by the Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, \nsays, the Department of the Interior cannot recalculate this royalty \nfee based on the new prices of oil. It would be the fourth time in \nseveral years that we stopped the Interior Department from \nrecalculating the royalty. In other words, we are saying we do not care \nif the oil companies owe us more money, we are not going to collect it.\n  How much is it worth to us, to the taxpayers? It is $5.6 million per \nmonth. Some watching this will say: For goodness' sake, don't they lose \nthat on the floor of the Treasury when they are mopping up at night? \nAnd $5.6 million a month, that isn't much by Federal standards where \nyou talk about trillions and billions.\n  They have a point. But for the average person, the average family, \nthe average business, $66 million a year is real money, real money that \nthe oil companies should pay us and are not paying us and will not pay \nus if the Hutchison amendment passes because the Hutchison amendment \ninsulates the oil companies from this recalculation of the royalty that \nthey pay. Why? Why in the world would we take the oil companies and do \nthis?\n  If this were the Little Sisters of the Poor about to have their \nmortgage foreclosed on their convent, for goodness' sake, count me in. \nI will be ready to consider an amendment. We are talking about the \nlargest oil companies in the world. They are being protected by this \namendment. I think it is a bit unseemly, if you will, for these oil \ncompanies to come on our land--not their land--drill oil, an \nirreplaceable resource, sell it for a profit, and refuse to pay the \ntaxpayers what they owe them for being on this land. That is what this \namendment does.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senate yield on that point?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I appreciate the Senator's outrage on this.\n  It is incredible. Some of our colleagues have come up and said things \nprivately such as: I can't believe you're attacking these oil \ncompanies.\n  I want to make a point and make sure my friend saw this. I read from \na complaint that was filed by two whistleblowers from big oil--ARCO, as \nit happens. In their words--these are not words from the Senator from \nIllinois or words from the Senator from California, who has been told \nshe doesn't know what she is talking about. If I don't, I believe \npeople who have worked in the oil companies for many years. I want to \nmake sure my friend has heard this. I am going to read to him a little \npiece of the introduction to this complaint and ask him if he has read \nit before, and even though he might not have, if he could comment on \nit.\n  This is an introduction to a lawsuit being filed by two \nwhistleblowers. These are two people who worked for ARCO, big \nexecutives in ARCO, who had in their heart, I think--these are my \nwords, not theirs--the need to tell the truth about what went on inside \nthose corporate walls. This is what they say. They say:\n\n       [There was] a nationwide conspiracy by some of the world's \n     largest oil companies to shortchange the United States of \n     America of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenues--known \n     as royalties--derived from the production of crude oil . . .\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       [There was] a pattern and practice of carefully developed \n     and coordinated schemes--\n\n  They outline seven schemes--\n\n     targeted to defraud the United States of its lawful share of \n     oil royalties . . .\n\n  They go on to say: ``This is an ongoing conspiracy.''\n  So I ask my friend this direct question: about his outrage he \nexhibits on this floor. Isn't there a reason for anyone with a set of \neyes and a brain to match to be outraged when not just one \nwhistleblower but two and three and four and more people who got high-\npaid salaries admit that they sat around and defrauded the taxpayers, \nand that this amendment would allow that outrage to continue--does that \nnot reflect my friend's views?\n  Mr. DURBIN. It does. I say further that it is a matter of whether or \nnot we are going to be Uncle Sam or ``Uncle Sucker.'' Think about these \noil companies. We are talking about $66 million a year.\n  Let me tell you, it is a bit unseemly for these oil companies to be \nfighting over $66 million a year, owed to the taxpayers, to come in and \nto support an amendment which insulates them from paying $66 million to \nthe taxpayers.\n  Let me give you an idea why I think it is unseemly. And I agree with \nthe Senator from California. Let's take a look at the oil companies \ninvolved. As I have said, you are not going to find the Little Sisters \nof the Poor Petroleum Company here.\n  No. 1, Shell Oil Company. The total revenues of Shell Oil Company in \n1996 were $29 billion. Exxon Corporation, $134 billion; Chevron, $43 \nbillion; Texaco, $45 billion; Marathon, $16 billion; Mobil, $81 \nbillion; Conoco, $20 billion. The list goes on and on.\n  The reason I read those--and there are many more--you would recognize \nevery name on the list. You know these companies. You have seen their \ngas stations. You have seen their stock printed in the paper. They have \nhuge worldwide sales. And these multi-multibillion-dollar huge \ncompanies refuse to pay us, the taxpayers, Uncle Sam, America, a fair \nroyalty, a fair rental payment for drilling oil on our land and selling \nit for their profit.\n  Can we conclude that these companies are in such perilous financial \ncondition that $66 million would break the bank? Let me tell you, the \nroyalty which they are refusing to pay, the royalty which this \namendment insulates them from paying, represents, in every instance, \nless than one-tenth of 1 percent of the revenue of each of the \ncompanies--less than one-tenth of 1 percent, sometimes even smaller \namounts.\n  Why in the world are we fighting this battle? Profitable companies, \nmultibillion-dollar companies, coming on our land, drilling oil for \ntheir profit, have to come to the Senate to put on an amendment to \ninsulate them from paying their fair rental, their fair royalty for \ndrilling oil? There are those who say: For goodness sakes, Senators, \naren't there some other things you could debate? Yes, I suppose. When \nit gets down to it, the money, in the scheme of a $1.7 trillion \nnational budget, may get lost, $66 million a year, $5.6 million a \nmonth. But there is something that won't get lost. That is the simple \njustice of this debate, a question of fairness, a question of common \nsense.\n\n  As much as those on the other side would like to obfuscate this issue \nand tell us it is certainly so complicated, beyond the ken and mind of \nany Member of the Senate, they are just plain wrong. We have received \ncorrespondence from the Secretary of the Interior. We have seen \neditorial support in USA Today, the Los Angeles Times, articles in the \nWall Street Journal, learned, expert people who have said this is \npretty simple. This is a rip-off for American taxpayers.\n  I have to say to the Senator from California, I am glad she is waging \nthis battle, as uncomfortable as it may be to my colleagues in the \nSenate, to try, once and for all, to say that if we are going to hold \nindividual Americans, families, and businesses responsible for their \ntax liability on April 15, then, for goodness sakes, these \nmultibillion-dollar oil companies should pay their fair share under the \nlaw for drilling oil on our land. They have been tested in court time \nand again and found guilty. Whistleblowers have come forward. Yet this \namendment, the Hutchison amendment, will perpetuate this rip-off.\n  I know some will argue that there are other issues of importance. I \nhope that in the boardrooms of these oil companies they would please \nreflect on this battle. Is this really worth it? Is this really worth \nit to the big oil companies. Sixty-six million in a multibillion-dollar \ncompany wouldn't make a\n\n[[Page S11298]]\n\nripple on their balance sheet. But for them to be in a position, as \nthey are today, of trying to defend the indefensible, a position where \nthey have lost time and again in court, trying to say they can use up \nour Federal resources without paying for them, is just \nincomprehensible.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my friend yield for a final question and perhaps \nretain the remainder--I would like him to speak again --I wanted to \nmake a point. There is a chart up there on the Long Beach jury verdict \nwhere Harry Anderson, one of the most important whistleblowers, was \nquoted. That isn't even a case about Federal royalties. This debate, I \nwant to point it out, is about Federal royalties. The one case they \never won was based on State royalties. You don't have to pay your State \nroyalties based on fair market value.\n  I thank my friend.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak this \nafternoon. This money going to the Land and Water Conservation Fund has \nbeen so important to the State of Nevada. Lake Tahoe, which we share \nwith the State of California, has received, from the work that I have \nbeen able to do since I have been fortunate enough to be in the Senate, \ntens of millions of dollars from the Land and Water Conservation Fund \nto purchase environmentally sensitive land, land that would have been \nsubdivided, land that would have been overrun with problems. Now this \nland is in beautiful, pristine wilderness.\n  The Land and Water Conservation Fund has been extremely important to \nthe State of Nevada. This gives me an opportunity, because of how \nimportant the Land and Water Conservation Fund has been to the State of \nNevada, to talk about the State of Nevada. People do not understand the \nState of Nevada.\n  Coincidentally, there was an article in today's Reno Gazette Journal. \nThat is a Gannett newspaper in Reno, NV. This is a major story, \ncoincidentally, in today's newspaper. There is a picture of a beautiful \narea. Below it are the words, in large print: Many don't associate \nNevada with beauty. But if they do some exploring, one of the many \nsites that will take their breath away is the Arc Dome Wilderness.\n  As is said in this article: One of the many sites that will take \ntheir breath away is the Arc Dome Wilderness.\n  The State of Nevada is seen by many as a place to dump nuclear waste, \na place to set off nuclear weapons, nuclear devices. The State of \nNevada is the most mountainous State in the Union except for Alaska. We \nhave, in the State of Nevada, 314 separate, distinct mountain ranges. \nIn the State of Nevada, we have 32 mountains over 11,000 feet high. \nJust outside Las Vegas--if you could walk it, it would be about 10 \nmiles--you would come to a mountain that is almost 11,000 feet high. \nNevada is a unique State. It is a very large State. It is a State that \nhas magnificent views.\n  What people also don't understand is, we are fortunate. When I first \ncame here, Nevada was the only State that had not done its Forest \nService wilderness designation, the only State. I introduced \nlegislation. It took a number of years, but we, in the State of Nevada, \nhave created a beautiful Forest Service wilderness.\n  That means we have preserved areas in the State of Nevada in their \npristine state. These are areas that my children, my children's \nchildren can go to, and these areas are the same as they were 100 years \nago. In the process of doing the legislation for the wilderness in the \nState of Nevada, I, of course, toured the State of Nevada and looked at \nevery wilderness site. After the legislation was introduced, I sent \nstaff to talk to local people because, of course, with rare exception--\nalthough there are two wilderness areas, one right outside Las Vegas \nand one right outside Reno--with rare exception, these wilderness areas \nare located in remote areas of the State of Nevada, rural areas in the \nState of Nevada. I sent staff out to visit with these people in rural \nNevada to talk to them about wilderness.\n  I got a call from one of my staff members. She said: It is \ninteresting; I am in Ely, and they believe you should back off your \nwilderness--and I had heard that story lots of times. She said: They \nthink you should create a national park. I said: A national park? She \nsaid: Yes, that is what they think should be done.\n  I didn't realize at the time that there had been for almost 60 years \nan effort to create a national park in the State of Nevada. A long-time \nNevada Senator by the name of Key Pittman, who became the chairman of \nthe Foreign Affairs Committee in the Senate--and was, at the outbreak \nof World War I, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee--sent a man, \na forest ranger, to take a look at where would be a good place in \nNevada to have a national park. This man traveled to Nevada. His name \nwas Mott. He found a place. He reported to Key Pittman.\n  Key Pittman went to the President. To make a long story somewhat \nshort, there were efforts made over the decades to create a national \npark in Nevada. It failed every time. Mining interests, ranching \ninterests, they couldn't work it out. Well, I took the advice of my \nstaff person, and the people in White Pine County, and created a \nnational park legislatively. I offered legislation to take it out of \nthe wilderness designation and create a national park. We created a \nnational park. It is now a law that has passed the U.S. Congress, \nsigned by the President, and it is a beautiful park--Great Basin \nNational Park.\n  It is in a very remote area. It is over the border of the State of \nUtah. It is about 720 miles from Ely, NV. It is a place that everybody \nshould go. What is there? The oldest living thing in the world is \nlocated there. The bristle cone pine tree is over 5,000 years old. \nThese pine trees in this national park were growing when Caesar was \naround. These pine trees were old when Christ was on the earth. You can \ngo to the Great Basin National Park and see them and feel them. They \nare there. They are still growing. On this national park is Nevada's \nonly glacier. We have a glacier in Nevada at our Great Basin National \nPark. Every different thing that is found in the Great Basin is found \nin this national park. It is a wonder of nature, from the towering \nWheeler Peak to the base of it, which is high desert. It is a wonderful \nplace. It is a place where people can walk.\n\n  We certainly need to do more things in all of our national parks to \nmake them better places for visitors, although Great Basin is very \nnice. I would love to have a great new visitor center there, and we \nneed an interpretive site.\n  The Senator from California has gone, but I say, with land and water \nconservation moneys we are going to build in various areas in our \nnational parks beautiful visitor centers. That is important, and we \nshould be able to do that.\n  A bit of the ice age exists in the form of this glacier. As I \nindicated, it is the only one of its kind, not only in Nevada but in \nthe Great Basin. It is a mere token of what the ice age was, but in \nNevada it still exists in the Great Basin National Park. It calls to \nmind the powerful glaciers capped at Snake Range only a few thousand \nyears ago. Glacial activity is easy to find. Piles of glacial debris \nform mounds and ridges and lakes.\n  I failed to mention, in these parks are wonderful little lakes; they \nare turquoise blue. I have been there, and I have seen them. They are \nice cold. We call them Theresa and Stella Lakes. They occupy hollows \nthat were gouged out during the ice age. This national park is just \nunbelievably nice. I talk about Nevada having 32 mountain peaks over \n11,000 feet high. Wheeler Peak is 13,000 feet high. I think that is \nreally important, that we have Wheeler Peak, which is over 13,000 feet \nhigh, the second highest peak in the State. It is just really quite \nunbelievable that we have Wheeler Peak where it is.\n  The bristle cone pines we talked about being there at the time of \nCaesar and at the time of Christ. When they were building the pyramids, \nthese trees were growing.\n  This is interesting. We had a cowboy out riding his horse one day, \nand he was looking up, and he suddenly dropped through ground into this \nhuge cavern, and now these caverns are part of the Great Basin National \nPark, called Lehman Caves. It has a separate entrance, a wonderful \nplace. You can look at stalactites and stalagmites,\n\n[[Page S11299]]\n\nand it is as dark as anything could be. We have that there.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator will yield for a question.\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I have listened with some interest not only to the \nSenator from Nevada but to other of my colleagues who are speaking \nabout the issue before the Senate. I know the Senator from Nevada is \ntalking about the budget problems we have. The fact is, we don't have \nenough money for education, health care, and a range of things. That is \nwhy we have not had the appropriations bills brought to the floor for \nthose areas. The Senator from Nevada is talking about those issues.\n  The issue that has been raised by the Senator from California is the \nissue of royalties paid with respect to the extraction of oil. My \nunderstanding of this issue--and I know there has been a discussion of \nit at some length here--is that in integrated oil companies, where you \nhave oil companies raising oil and then selling it to themselves, the \nvalue of the oil they are pulling from the ground is an issue they \nlargely decide and report to the Government and say: By the way, that \noil didn't have much value; therefore, I am not going to pay you much \nin royalties.\n  So when the folks get out there and look at these sweetheart \ntransactions from companies which own each other, one to another, they \ndiscover that this oil has been radically undervalued, and the \ninterests that have been denied the rightful opportunities here are the \nAmerican public; the American people haven't gotten their royalties. \nThey have not received the fair amount of royalties. When the oilers go \nlook at this, they say, you can't do that, you can't undervalue this, \nand therefore cheat the public out of what is theirs.\n  I guess the dispute here is a circumstance where someday we want that \nto continue to exist: Let them continue to sell oil to themselves, and \nprice the way they want to, and avoid paying royalties.\n  The Senator from Nevada makes the point that when we do that, we end \nup not getting the money we should get for the American public, and \nthese royalties belong to the public. Second, we don't have the \nresources we need, then, to make the investments in children, health \ncare, and other things. That is the point, I think, the Senator from \nNevada makes.\n  I find it interesting. I was a State tax administrator in the State \nof North Dakota before I came to this body, and I will give you another \nexample that is almost exactly like this. We had to value railroads. We \nhad to establish a value on railroads for tax purposes. The railroads \nsaid to the State of North Dakota, well, the value of the railroads is \ncomputed by describing all of the stock and all of the debt, assuming \nyou bought all the stock and assumed the debt. That is what the \nrailroads told the State. The railroads said: By the way, the value of \nour stock is par value, which is printed on the certificate. Of course, \nthat is not the value of the stock. But for many years the State of \nNorth Dakota accepted par value on the stock as representative of the \nvalue of the railroad. They radically underpaid their taxes because of \nit.\n  When I became tax administrator, having taken a look at that, I \ndecided that was not going to stand. Of course, the railroads didn't \nlike it at all when we changed the method. That is exactly what is at \nstake here with respect to the oil companies. They sell oil to \nthemselves and underprice it so they can avoid paying royalties to the \nAmerican people, who are owed these royalties, and they don't want this \ninterrupted. They say: We don't want to change the way we are doing \nthis; we like it. Of course they like it, because they are not paying \nthe royalties they owe to the American people.\n  The Senator from Nevada makes the point that it is not fair.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, let me reclaim my time and say to my friend \nfrom North Dakota, as I indicated earlier, the reason I was so \nimpressed with what the Senator from California has done is that a \nportion of these royalties currently goes to the Land and Water \nConservation Fund for Federal land acquisition. That is what I have \ntalked about here. I think it is so important.\n  I see my friend from Iowa and my friend from North Dakota. I know \nthey have both been to Lake Tahoe, which the Senators from Nevada and \nCalifornia share. Now, that is a beautiful place. It has remained as \nbeautiful as it is because we have been able to take money in years \ngone by from the Land and Water Conservation Fund to buy land around \nthere. As a result of that, we are making progress and saving that \npristine land. It is not pristine now, but we are saving that beautiful \nlake, and we want to stop degradation from taking place. That is why, \nfrom my standpoint, these royalties are so important, because they go \ninto land and water conservation moneys which for us in the State of \nNevada are so important.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I have a statement and then a question. I thank the \nSenator for what he said about the land and water conservation funds \nbecause we use those in Iowa, too. Every dollar taken out, by losing it \nto the oil companies, is something we don't get to use to save some of \nour hunting grounds and fishing grounds.\n  Mr. REID. I want to say one other thing to my friend. I know he has \nanother question or two he wants to ask. When we don't have money in \nthat Land and Water Conservation Fund, that makes for difficulty in \nother areas. I mentioned briefly that we only have one national park in \nNevada, and in Iowa I doubt if you have one.\n  Mr. HARKIN. We don't even have one.\n  Mr. REID. You know, the national parks all over America--and I know \nthe Senator has traveled to them and has seen them--need restoration; \nthey need to be refurbished. We need to rebuild. Every year that goes \nby and more people visit them, there is more wear and tear on them. \nThat is why the land and water conservation money is an offset. It is a \ntremendous help to us.\n\n  Does the Senator have another question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator. I especially want to thank the \nSenator from California for her great leadership, and the Senator from \nIllinois who was making statements earlier. The Senator from Nevada has \nagain put a finger on why we need to close this loophole and why what \nis happening right now is grossly unfair. It has come to my attention. \nI am not an expert on oil and all that kind of stuff. At least it is my \nunderstanding.\n  Mr. REID. We have more oil in Nevada than in Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am sure.\n  Mr. REID. We don't have much.\n  Mr. HARKIN. But we have a different form. It is called ethanol. I \nwill get to that in a second.\n  Let me ask the Senator, I understand this loophole that allows a \nhandful of oil companies to keep from paying their fair share of taxes \nfor what is owed the Government--it is only just a few, and most of the \noil companies pay their fair share. Is that right?\n  Mr. REID. I have listened to the debate. I heard the Senator from \nIllinois and the Senator from California enter into an exchange saying \nthat it is only about 5 percent of the companies that do not pay the \nright amount of money.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Doesn't it strike us as odd that 95 percent of the oil \ncompanies are good citizens? They pay their honest taxes. There are \nhonest royalties. Yet we get 5 percent of the largest who are skirting \nthe law, who are doing this, and keeping us from collecting the \nroyalties that help us with our Land and Water Conservation Fund. So we \nare talking about 5 percent, a handful of the largest of all the oil \ncompanies.\n  I ask my friend from Nevada, what sense does this make? Why would we \nexcuse 5 percent of the largest when we stick it to the smaller oil \ncompanies and make them pay their royalties? If we are going to do \nthis, why not do it for all of them?\n  Second, we heard the Senator from North Dakota talking about how the \nrailroads were putting up their value as par value, and he changed that \nwhen he became tax commissioner. I was thinking about that. I wonder if \nanyone has ever offered to buy a railroad at par value and whether they \nwould sell it. I want to ask the Senator from Nevada, as to these oil \ncompanies, does the Senator think I could as a private individual--if I \nwanted to get an oil jobber and go buy oil--buy oil from those \ncompanies at the value they placed on this, at which they paid \nroyalties?\n\n[[Page S11300]]\n\n  Mr. REID. I think not.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I don't think so. If I am wrong, someone please correct \nme because I would like to go out and buy some of that oil. I think I \ncould turn it into a pretty handsome profit. I believe in the profit \nincentive. But you know darned well that you can't bill that oil at \nthat price. They sell it to themselves at that price, and that is how \nthey are getting out of paying the Government their fair share of \nroyalties.\n  I also have to ask the Senator from Nevada, I understand what the \nSenator from California is attempting to do is not to impose any kind \nof new tax--this is not a new tax, as I understand it--on the oil \ncompanies.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is absolutely right.\n  Mr. HARKIN. It is not a new tax. It is a matter of having a handful \nof these companies pay what they owe. Is that correct?\n  Mr. REID. That is absolutely true.\n  Mr. HARKIN. It is not a new tax. It is something they have known that \nthey have had to pay all along and that they are supposed to pay.\n  All, I guess, the Interior bill does is clarify the rules so they \nwill pay their fair share, as I understand it. The amendment of the \nSenator from Texas stops this from happening. It lets the oil companies \ncontinue to underpay their royalties. Is that right?\n  Mr. REID. That is right.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I saw this figure. I can't attest to this. I thought this \nwas pretty interesting--``Big Oil's Big Rip-off.'' The Hutchison \namendment has already cost us $66 million in lost royalties, according \nto the Interior Department. Is that right? Already, to date, according \nto the Interior Department, taxpayers have lost $88 million. When you \nadd the Hutchison amendment on that, it will cost us $154 million, \naccording to the Interior Department. Is that correct?\n  Mr. REID. The reason I came, I say to my friend, and the reason I am \nso interested in this is that we are desperate for money in the West. I \nam sure it is accordingly so in other places. We have so much in the \nway of public land. We are desperate for money to make sure some of our \nnice places remain that way.\n  In all due respect to my friend from Iowa, his State was settled long \nbefore Nevada. The reason he does not have national parks and \nwilderness areas is because it is all private land. I don't in any way \ndenigrate what has happened to the State of Iowa. But we in the West \nstill have public lands that we want to try to add to and protect. We \nare having difficulty doing that because we don't have the money as the \nFederal Government, which is the caretaker. We don't have the money to \nnot only add to it a little bit but take care of what we have.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Where do these royalties go? They don't go into the \ngeneral coffers.\n  Mr. REID. They go to a number of places. But the track of money I \nhave followed goes to the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which the \nPresident, thank goodness, is fighting to put some money into.\n  We have not had enough money for the Federal Government to stop \ndevelopment in Montana. There was an agreement made to buy a large mine \nthere because they thought it would be detrimental to the national park \nthat is right there. Yellowstone, they thought, didn't need that there. \nAs a result of that, the Federal Government didn't have any money to \nbuy it, even though they made the deal to buy it. This $154 million \nwould allow them to do that. A lot could be done with that.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to the Senator that we in Iowa are trying now to \nreclaim some of the Loess Hills. It is a wonderful natural phenomenon. \nIt takes place in only two areas on Earth--here and in China. We are \ntrying to reclaim these and make them a preserved area.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator explain what has happened in China and \nIowa?\n  Mr. HARKIN. This is over centuries, thousands of years ago, tens of \nthousands of years ago, the winds blew and they blew up these huge \nmounds of fine dirt. There are only two places to this extent. One is \nhere and one is in China. These are a natural phenomenon. They are \nbeautiful, very scenic, and we are trying to reclaim them and preserve \nthem for future generations. This money could help do that.\n\n  I guess that is why I wanted to ask the Senator the question because \nhe caught my attention when we talked about parks. We don't have \nnational parks in Iowa. But we do have things such as the Loess Hills, \nEffigy Mounds, and some fishing and hunting areas that get money from \nthe Water and Conservation Fund--and historic preservation.\n  I am constrained on this. I am a big supporter of ethanol because \nethanol is clean. We grow it. It is renewable. We don't have to import \nit from other countries. I have always thought that ethanol could \ncompete fairly with oil. There is a provision in the law that gives a \ncertain tax credit for the use of ethanol in gasoline.\n  One of the Senators from Texas has always gone after it saying \nethanol should not get any tax breaks; it should stand on its own two \nfeet and compete against oil. I took the floor one time, I say to my \nfriend from Nevada, and I said: Fine. Let's go back and recapture all \nof the tax breaks that all of the oil companies have gotten for the \nlast 50 or 60 years. And how about the tax breaks they get now? How \nabout this? If this doesn't amount to a tax break for big oil, I don't \nknow what does. They want to keep that but they want to take away the \nsmall amount of tax credit that we have for ethanol.\n  I want to get that off my chest because I hear these oil State \nSenators coming in here all the time telling me that we can't provide \nany kind of tax incentive for the use of ethanol because we don't for \noil. Nonsense. This proves it right here.\n  Mr. REID. Let me say to my friend, as someone from the State of \nNevada, we don't grow a great deal. We grow alfalfa. We are the largest \nproducer of white onions in the United States. But other than that, we \ndon't produce a lot in the way of agricultural products--certainly a \nlot less than we used to because of the growth in the Las Vegas area. \nSo it was a hard sell to me to accept ethanol being something that was \ngood for our country because it was hard for me to accept that we could \ngrow something and stick it in a car and burn it.\n  But what persuaded me--I am now an advocate for ethanol--is that it \nis renewable. We have this ability in the United States to grow crops. \nWe don't grow crops in Nevada as they grow them in the Midwest, in \nIowa. But if we burn up a tank of ethanol this year, then next year \nthere is some more ethanol and we can burn up some more. It is not the \nsame as fossil fuel. That is a selling point to me.\n  I say to my friend from Iowa that another reason I was willing to \ncome here on the Boxer postcloture activities is that we don't get \nenough opportunity around here to talk about things.\n  I am happy to hear the Senator from Iowa talk about some areas in the \nState of Iowa that are environmentally important. The Senator has \ntalked about them. I would love to visit Iowa. I came to the floor \ntoday to talk about the beauty in the State of Nevada. I invite the \nSenator from Iowa to spend a few days with me in Nevada. We will go on \na pack trip; we will go into some of the beautiful wilderness areas.\n  People fly over the State of Nevada. It looks like one big desert. It \nis not. We have wilderness areas. In the Reno newspaper, they talk \nabout one wilderness area called Arc Dome. We have heard about mountain \nsheep, but in Nevada we have mountain goats. We have beaver. We have \neagles floating through the valleys, antelope, elk.\n  People don't realize Nevada is more than the bright lights of Las \nVegas and Reno. We need more time to talk about our various States. We \ntend to come to the floor and get involved in things that do not allow \nMembers the opportunity to educate each other about their States.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Today, I learned a lot about the beauty of Nevada. I will \ntake the Senator up on his offer to visit.\n  Mr. REID. The invitation is open, and I hope my friend will invite me \nto Iowa to look at the natural phenomenon in his State.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Secretary Babbitt came to Iowa and visited the Loess \nHills area. He never knew they were there. No one ever talked about it. \nWe are trying to preserve them.\n  Let me, again, ask the Senator from Nevada, there was an editorial in \nUSA Today.\n  Mr. REID. I have the time. Please proceed. I yield for a question.\n\n[[Page S11301]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. There is an editorial in the USA Today, August 26 of last \nyear, entitled, ``Time to clean up Big Oil's slick deal with \nCongress.'' They are talking about this very item, ripping off the \ntaxpayers. ``According to the watchdog project on government oversight, \nthere is more than $2 billion in uncollected Federal royalties at open \nmarket prices, and the total grows by more than $1 million every \nweek.''\n  This editorial, along with an editorial that appeared in the Los \nAngeles Times of July 20 of this year, gave an indication of how much \nmoney was given by the oil companies in campaign contributions. Big oil \ncontributed more than $35 million to national political committees and \ncongressional candidates in this time over the last 12 years.\n  I question no one's motives on this floor. I never question anyone's \nmotives. I say this is another indication of why we need campaign \nfinance reform.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I raise a point of order it is not germane to what we are \ntalking about. It is not germane to what this discussion is about.\n  Mr. REID. I have the floor and I am happy to respond to that.\n  We have at great length here today talked about the Land and Water \nConservation Fund, how it is tied into the question of royalties. \nCertainly that is about as germane as it could be.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Campaign finance reform----\n  Mr. REID. I have an hour's time, and I have spoken in germane terms \nto the matter now before the Senate. If the question is asked and goes \non to some other subject matter, we can't be----\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I raise a point of order. Could I have a \ndetermination?\n  Mr. HARKIN. May I be heard on the point of order, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada does have the floor, \nbut I think he has a responsibility to make sure the questions that are \nbeing raised in this colloquy are relevant to the issues before the \nSenate today.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate the statement.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield, I say it is absolutely \nrelevant to the issue of oil companies, royalties, and how much they \nare paying, to say that Senators ought to have the right to defend \ntheir interests and to defend companies in their States.\n  I don't question Senator Hutchison or anybody else is doing this in \ngood conscience. They have their case to argue. That is fair. What I am \nsaying, when we get editorials such as this that point out how much \nmoney has come from oil companies to the campaign coffers of the people \nmaking this debate, it demeans the whole debate. That is my point. I \nthink the Senator would agree with me on that.\n  My question is, this is tied into this debate. We could have a much \nbetter debate if we had that.\n  Mr. REID. If I can respond to the question, the subject matter of \nthat editorial is the amendment that is now before this body. It is not \non another subject. That is the subject matter of this editorial, on \nthe matter now before this body.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent this editorial be printed in the \nRecord.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent that an article appearing in the \nLos Angeles Times dated July 20--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada has the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an editorial, \ndated Wednesday, August 26, entitled, ``Time to clean up Big Oil's \nslick deal with Congress,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From USA Today, August 26, 1998]\n\n          Time to Clean Up Big Oil's Slick Deal With Congress\n\n       Imagine being able to compute your own rent payments and \n     grocery bills, giving your-self a 3% to 10% discount off the \n     market price. Over time, that would add up to really big \n     bucks. And imagine having the political clout to make sure \n     nothing threatened to change that cozy arrangement.\n       According to government and private studies, that's the \n     sweet deal the oil industry is fighting to protect the right \n     to extract crude oil from public land and pay the government \n     no the open market price but a lower ``posted price''--based \n     on private deals the oil companies can manipulate for their \n     own benefit.\n       States, Native American tribes and landowners are suing for \n     the full open-market-price fees, and a few oil companies have \n     begun to cut settlement deals from Alabama to New Mexico \n     rather than face trial. Accordingly to the watchdog Project \n     on Government Oversight, there's more than $2 billion in \n     uncollected federal royalties at open market prices. And the \n     total grows by more than $1 million every week.\n       No wonder the industry is pouring money into the campaign \n     coffers of senators and congressmen willing to help protect \n     the status quo. Oil-patch lawmakers have been playing tag \n     team with amendments that bar the Interior Department from \n     implementing new rules to require payment at the open market \n     price.\n       Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, for one, is so valued \n     by the industry that even though she's only been in \n     Washington five years, she's already the No. 2 recipient of \n     oil-producer cash over the past 12 years.\n       Big Oil has contributed more than $35 million to national \n     political committees and congressional candidates in the \n     time--a modest investment in protecting the royalty-pricing \n     arrangement that's enabled the industry to pocket an extra $2 \n     billion.\n       That's millions missing in action from the battle to reduce \n     the federal deficit and from accounts for land and water \n     conservation, historic preservation and several Native \n     American tribes. In addition, public schools in 24 states \n     have been shortchanged: States use their share of federal \n     royalties for education funding.\n       Meanwhile, the industry seeks to change the subject, \n     lobbying to force Uncle Sam to take royalties in oil instead \n     of dollars. That would put the government in the oil \n     business, where it doesn't belong, but not change the \n     slippery method of figuring companies' bills.\n       Having profited so long by being able to fiddle with the \n     price, now the companies and their congressional pets \n     complain that paying what they really owe would be unfair.\n       But the taxpayers have been getting the unfair end of this \n     deal for far too long. One major producer, Atlantic \n     Richfield, has already adopted market pricing for calculating \n     its royalty payments. Congress, instead of protecting \n     industry recalcitrants and campaign contributors, should \n     protect the public interest.\n\n\n                          Big Oil's influence\n\n       Top congressional recipients of oil-producer political \n     action committee contributions between January 1987 and March \n     1998:\n       Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas: $198,337.\n       Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas: $175,199.\n       Sen. John Breaux, D-La. $174,800.\n       Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla: $171,999.\n       Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska: $171,025.\n\n  Mr. REID. I do want to say we are very proud of the wilderness areas \nwe have in Nevada. Let me name them: Alta Toquima Wilderness, 38,000 \nacres; Arc Dome Wilderness, which is the largest, it covers 150,000 \nacres; Mount Charleston Wilderness, right outside the city of Las \nVegas, covers the Spring Mountain Range and is almost 11,000 feet high; \nMount Rose Wilderness, likewise, located just outside Reno. You can see \nit from Reno when you go there. Table Mountain Wilderness, and I have \ntraveled almost every bit of that, is a wonderfully unique place. \nCurrant Mountain Wildness is near the Great Basin National Park. The \nEast Humboldts Wilderness is 37,000 acres. Here we have a herd of \nshaggy mountain goats which you can see there, with a small cirque lake \nand the 11,000 foot peak. Grant Range Wilderness, not far from Las \nVegas, is a 50,000 acre area; Jarbidge Wilderness, a beautiful, \nwonderful area, you can still go there and pick up flint stones. You \ncan pick up arrowheads. I went there for the first time in August, and \nthe snow had not melted yet. It was beautiful.\n  Mount Moriah Wilderness is located near the Utah border; Quinn Canyon \nWilderness is located in eastern Nevada, 27,000 acres. Ruby Mountain \nWilderness has skiing. Land at the top in a helicopter, ski down the \nmountain, and come out where there is no wilderness. Santa Rosa \nMountain Wilderness, also very remote; and finally, Boundary Peak \nWilderness on the California-Nevada border is a mountain more than \n13,000 feet high, which is the highest mountain in the State of Nevada.\n  My friend from Massachusetts has a question, I understand.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will be kind enough to yield for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. President, as I understand, half of the royalty is returned to \nthe States. Is the Senator familiar with the fact that the amounts that \nare actually returned to the States go directly for the cause of \neducation, the education funds of these States?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, who is the ranking member of the \nHealth,\n\n[[Page S11302]]\n\nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee and who has spent so much time \nworking on education issues, trying to find money, as I know the \nranking member has done--trying to find money to fund education \nprograms all over America--yes, $66 million. As the Senator from Iowa \nindicated, it could go up to $154 million. Think what we could do with \nthat share of education moneys, with the programs he has authorized in \nhis committee but we have no ability to fund.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I want to just raise this issue since, by and large, the \nmajority of the States use the resources that come from this royalty \nfor education. If the amendment of the Senator is carried, then they \nare going to be denied funding in a number of these States, some 24 \ndifferent States. I think it is important to recognize--\n  Mr. THOMAS. I raise a point of order. Would the Senator please \nexplain the question exchange? I am sorry, I don't understand this.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would like to be heard on this.\n  Mr. REID. Would the Senator complete his question to the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The point is, if the royalty money is not available to \nthe States, does the Senator understand that money is going to have to \nbe made up in some other way and otherwise we are going to have \ncutbacks in education in the States?\n\n  Mr. REID. I have been waiting for the Senator from Massachusetts to \ncome because I was hoping he would ask this question.\n  We in Nevada know more than anyplace in America how difficult it is \nto fund education. I say to my friend, does he realize in Nevada we \nhold the record? In Clark County, we dedicated and built 18 schools in \n1 year. No school district in America has ever come close to that. We \nneed schools. I say to my friend from Massachusetts, in Las Vegas we \nhave to build one school every month to keep up with the growth. We are \nthe eighth largest school district in America. We have well over \n200,000 kids in our school districts.\n  So I say, absolutely, the money that would come from this would help \nthe people in Nevada and the rest of the people in the country. I don't \nknow how I could be more direct in my answer to the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I again want to ask the Senator: As I understand it, for \nexample, the total share of the royalty funds that goes to the State of \nCalifornia, 100 percent, goes to public education of children in \nCalifornia. Does the Senator understand in Colorado it is some 60 \npercent, 100 percent in Louisiana? Those would be funds, if this \namendment were carried, that would be directly denied to the public \nschool system in those States and would have to be made up, or \notherwise there would be cuts in those particular States. Does the \nSenator understand the relationship between what we are talking about \nhere and the issue on education? It is very significant.\n  Maybe $60 million does not make a lot of difference to some Senators. \nBut it could make a lot of difference if we were talking about the \nReading Excellence Act which has just been cut over in House \nAppropriations. It makes a difference to 330,000 children--whether they \nare going to learn how to read.\n  We have those examples across the board: Colorado, 60 percent; North \nDakota, 57 percent. Has there been any discussion on the floor of the \nSenate by those Senators on how they are going to make up the money? It \nseems to me we ought to have at least that kind of information. If you \nare going to cut out that funding for public education in the schools--\nand that is what this amendment does--we ought to understand where the \nother money is going to come from because you are taking it right out \nof public school education.\n  I do not know what the Senator's conclusions are, but when we realize \nwe are dealing with the appropriations bill that is the last bill on \nthe agenda, it maybe doesn't have a very high priority. Maybe that is \none of the reason it has not been talked about very much by the \nRepublicans, those on the other side. But this is money that comes \nright out of public education. It comes right out of support for public \neducation in a number of these States.\n  Mr. REID. I say, in answer----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I was just asking the Senator how these States are going \nto make up for it. Can the Senator help us?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator has asked a couple questions.\n  First of all, no, there has not been a single word on this Senate \nfloor about where the makeup would be for this money. The fact is, as \nwith most education issues that have come up since the majority has \nbeen controlling this place, they just ignore it. They don't worry \nabout it.\n\n  I say, in answer to my friend from Massachusetts, yes, we have a lot \nof children--more children who are not going to be able to read, the \nmore we cut back on these moneys. But I say to my friend, we have 3,000 \nchildren dropping out of high school every day in America. Couldn't we \nuse a few of these dollars to come up with some programs to keep these \nkids in school?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator from Nevada yield to me for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Because I think it dovetails with the Senator's question \nabout the States.\n  I say to my friends from Massachusetts and Nevada, maybe some \nSenators on this floor do not care about this, but the States do care \nabout this. The States have sued the oil companies because of this \ncontinuous undervaluation of these oil royalty payments. I say to my \nfriend, it is outrageous that we do not fix this problem today. The \nStates have sued to the tune of $5 billion because they need this \nmoney.\n  What we will do, if this amendment is agreed to, I say to both of my \nfriends, is continue this undervaluation, continue these lawsuits where \nthe States have to sue, rather than allow Secretary Babbitt and the \nInterior Department to fix this problem.\n  I am so glad the Senator has yielded to my friend from Massachusetts. \nI wanted to know if he was aware of these valuations and if he would \nask unanimous consent to have these facts printed in the Record.\n  Mr. REID. I would have to say to my friend from California, I knew of \ndollars but I did not know of the tremendous amounts: The State of \nCalifornia, $345 million, unbelievable; Texas, $30 million; New Mexico, \na small State, think of what could happen in the State of New Mexico \nwith $6 million; Alabama, $15 million; Louisiana $400 million.\n  As I understand, these moneys come from lawsuits where the oil \ncompanies settled. There was not a trial where a verdict was rendered \nor a judgment rendered. They paid up when they found that they were \ndoing wrong. And all this money, based upon what the Senator from \nCalifornia has so aptly described earlier in her statements on the \nSenate floor, and what the Senator from Massachusetts said--every \ndollar of this money goes to public education. States break it up \ndifferently, the Senator said--California, 100 percent; North Dakota, \n56 percent--but that is a lot of money for those States.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I was interested in the Senator's viewpoint. At the very \ntime we are meeting here, this very time this afternoon, the House \nappropriators are marking up the education bill. They have just cut $60 \nmillion out of the reading programs, the Reading Excellence Act, which \nwould affect 330,000 children. This is what we are talking about.\n  Does the Senator agree with me that we have a limited role in public \neducation? We provide 7 cents out of every dollar in education, but we \nprovide it in targeted areas to try to begin to make some difference in \nlocal communities and in States so these efforts can be carried on and \nexpanded if they are worthwhile. We have the Reading Excellence Act, \nwhich is just beginning to take hold, just beginning to make a \ndifference. Mr. President, $60 million is a big hunk of change, and \nthat is what this amounts to in total revenues--$66 million.\n  I just want to inquire of the Senator so the membership understands. \nWhen we refuse to defeat the Hutchison amendment, we are going to be \ndisadvantaging States in the public education system.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend in response to the question, he made a \nvery good point. The Federal Government, in my opinion, does not do \nenough to help public education. It does not do enough. Seven percent \nis not enough. But at least we do something. Every dollar we send to \nthe school districts is badly needed.\n\n[[Page S11303]]\n\n  But in answer to the question of the Senator, this money goes to the \nschool districts. They can spend it in any way they want. Isn't that \nright?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is my understanding.\n  Mr. REID. The Federal Government is not saying you must spend it in a \ncertain way. The State of California, by law and regulations of the \nState of California, is required to spend this money in any way they \nwant on public education?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is absolutely correct. If the Hutchison amendment \nis accepted here, these will be the results. Effectively, we are going \nto be seeing an important source of funding for public education, for \nthe schools in these several States, being denied.\n  Does the Senator agree with me that most of the responsibilities we \nhave are on priorities, on making choices?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Does the Senator understand the choice to be on the \nissue of education? If we accept the amendment of the Senator from \nTexas, we are going to have, as a corresponding result, important \nreductions in support of public education in a number of States; is \nthat the Senator's understanding?\n  Mr. REID. And it will not be made up anyplace else.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Does the Senator think we are going to make it up at the \nFederal level in terms of appropriations? Has there been any \nsuggestion?\n  Mr. REID. We see what is happening in the House as we speak. We have \nseen what has happened in the last several years: Education is being \nratcheted down. There are some, I say to my friend, who want to destroy \npublic education, and this is a step in that direction.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator. It is important the Membership have \na full understanding of the impact of the Hutchison amendment on \neducation.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate the questions from my friend from \nMassachusetts. One reason, before the Senator leaves the floor, that I \nthink this is so important is this money does not go to any one place. \nI talked about the importance of the money and doing something about \nthe natural beauty in our States. The Senator asked a series of \nquestions that indicated a large chunk of this money will go to public \neducation, and as far as this Senator is concerned, I do not think \nthere is anything more important than public education and protecting \nour natural resources. That is, in effect, what the Senator from \nCalifornia is attempting to do: Focus attention on these moneys that \nwould go to these very important issues, such as the national park we \nhave in Nevada, such as the 14 wilderness areas we have in Nevada, and \nthe many educational programs.\n\n  I ask the Chair how much of the Senator's hour is remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, while we are talking about education, I say \nto my colleagues that I have worked with the Senator from New Mexico, \nMr. Bingaman, on some very important legislation. The Senator from \nMassachusetts and I just touched upon it. It deals with dropouts.\n  As the Presiding Officer has heard me say, every day in America 3,000 \nchildren drop out of high school, half a million a year. Every one of \nthose children who drop out of school are less than they can be. They \nare going to be less productive to themselves and to their families. \nThey are going to add to the cost of Government in education, in \nwelfare, and our criminal justice system.\n  Mr. President, 84 percent of the men and women in the prisons around \nAmerica have not graduated from high school. So are high school \ndropouts a priority? Yes, they are.\n  The Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman, and I have introduced \nlegislation to create, within the Department of Education, a dropout \nczar who would work on programs around the country to keep kids in \nschool and not force any of these programs on local school districts, \nbut have them available with challenge grants and other opportunities \nfor schools to step in and see if they can help keep some of their kids \nin schools. It will cost a few dollars to do this. We need to do it. \nThis will allow us to have moneys to do that.\n  I say keeping children in school is important. We have programs \naround the country that work. Let's try to pattern what we do after the \nprograms that work and keep some of these kids in school. I cannot \nthink of anything more important, as it relates to education, than \nkeeping these kids in school. We are not going to keep all 3,000 \nchildren from dropping out every day, but let's say every day instead \nof 3,000 children on average dropping out, 2,800 drop out. We will keep \n200 children in high school every day. Think how many that will add up \nto in a school year: Kids who have a better opportunity to do what they \nare capable of doing and not adding to the criminal justice system, not \nbeing part of the statistics. Eighty-four percent of the people in \nprison did not graduate from high school. We need to do better in that \nregard.\n  Also, we need to do better with our natural resources. We need to do \nsomething about the multibillion-dollar backlog in our national parks. \nWe are closing parts of our national parks because we cannot \nrehabilitate them the way they need to be rehabilitated. Some of these \nareas are becoming dangerous for people to walk in.\n  What we do with our personnel in our U.S. park system is something we \nshould not brag about. Employees of the National Park System are living \nin Quonset huts from the Second World War. We have to provide housing \nfor these people. A lot of these parks, just like Great Basin, are very \nremote. The nearest town from the Great Basin is 70 miles away. These \npeople are living in conditions I do not think you want your children \nliving in. These jobs are coveted. They go to school to become a park \nranger. They love their work. We should provide adequate housing for \nthem because a lot of times it does not exist.\n\n  I appreciate the opportunity to speak today. I appreciate the \nquestions from the Senators from North Dakota, Massachusetts, \nCalifornia, and Iowa. I hope this debate has been educational to other \nMembers of the Senate.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, what is the situation with regard to time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has an hour.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Chair. I want to make a few comments to see \nif we can move this discussion back to the issue. We have been totally \noff the issue for the last 2 hours.\n  The issue really has to do with MMS. It has to do with the \ndevelopment and enforcement of regulations. Nearly everyone who has \ngotten up so far has said: I do not know much about this; our State \ndoes not do this. And they have gone on to talk at length about it.\n  I have been involved with this. I have been at the meetings with MMS. \nOur State is the largest State involved in terms of oil royalties.\n  We ought to focus on the real issue for a while. I want to do that.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator from Wyoming yield for a question?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Certainly.\n  Mr. CRAIG. As we refocus this debate on the issue of royalties, \nobviously the Senators from Nevada and Massachusetts and California \nwere focusing the issue of royalties on public land resources on \neducation. There was a critical vote in the Senate last week which they \nstrongly opposed--and some of them spoke against it--that directly \nassociated resources with education. That was the issue of timber, \ntimber cuts, stumpage fees flowing back to local schools.\n  Will the Senator respond to that? We are talking out of both sides of \nour mouths if we are saying that royalties are all for education, and \nyet just this last week, they voted against education in timber-\ndependent communities across this country that have had their budgets \ncut 50 and 60 percent. The Senator from California voted that way, and \nthe Senator from Nevada voted that way. Will the Senator from Wyoming \nrespond to that?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Will the Senator make it a little clearer as to exactly \nhow this impacts?\n  Mr. CRAIG. The point I am making is, every time the Forest Service is \nallowed to cut a tree off public lands, 25 percent of that stumpage fee \ngoes back to the local school district to be spent for schools.\n\n[[Page S11304]]\n\n  For good reasons, we have reduced the timber program by 70 percent in \nthe last 7 years. I have a school district in my State that is not \nfeeding its kids today and asking them to bring brown bags because the \nvote of the Senator from California, along with the Senators from \nNevada and Massachusetts, denied them the right to cut trees on the \nclear water forests in my State.\n  Can I get exercised about this? The Senator from Oregon supported me \nbecause he has a school district that is only allowing its kids to go 4 \ndays a week instead of 5. So if we are going to use oil royalties for \nthat argument, quit speaking out of both sides of your mouth because \njust last week you voted that way.\n\n  We have always balanced our natural resources for the good of the \nenvironment and for the good of the public that is associated with \nthem. The Senator from Wyoming knows that. We graze on Wyoming public \nlands and we take oil and coal from under Wyoming public lands--State \nand Federal lands. Some of that money goes back to the local \ncommunities. Yet this administration wants to decouple that.\n  I am glad the Senator from California is concerned about public land \nresources and local education, but you cannot be selective in this \nbusiness. You have to share and associate. What I hear is a \ntremendously narrow and selective argument.\n  I thank the Senator from Wyoming for yielding because that is a bogus \nargument that is being placed by the Senator from California, unless \nshe wants to stand up with the Senator from Idaho and say: I recognize \nthe need to balance timber sales in northern California because the \nmoney goes to the schools in northern California, as they do in Idaho. \nThat is called balance. That is called sharing.\n  I thank the Senator from Wyoming for yielding because you just cannot \nhave it both ways in this business without someone such as me standing \nup and saying, foul ball, foul ball, bogus argument, unless you are \nwilling to say: Wait a minute, I recognize your problem; we have it in \nthe timberlands of Northern California.\n  Oil is an issue. It is an important issue. We want a fair return on \nthat. The Senator from the State of Texas is trying to build that kind \nof fairness into this debate.\n  I thank my colleague from Wyoming for yielding. I yield the floor to \nhim.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Will the Senator from Wyoming yield for a question on \na similar subject?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Certainly.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Talking about education, along the lines of what the \nSenator from Idaho was just saying, we have another double standard, \nand that is, the Senator from California led the effort not to allow \ndrilling offshore in California that is estimated to have cost the \nschoolchildren in the school districts of California over $1 million a \nyear. That is a California decision.\n  But the fact is, you cannot talk about losing money for \nschoolchildren by raising the taxes on oil companies on the one hand \nand then on the other hand say: But we are not going to allow drilling \noffshore that would put $1 million into the coffers for the \nschoolchildren of California.\n  Don't you think there is a relationship here and perhaps there are \nthe same issues but just people taking different sides?\n  Mr. THOMAS. It certainly seems that way. I think there is a real \nparadox here. On the one hand we are talking about more money for \neducation and at the same time voting to reduce that amount for \neducation. So I think that is difficult.\n  Let me go back to the topic that we are really here to discuss and \nthat is MMS's proposed oil valuation rule. I rise in strong support of \nthe Hutchison amendment. I have been working on this issue for a long \ntime. I have been involved in numerous meetings. I have worked with the \noil companies. I have worked with the school districts. I have worked \nwith the State of Wyoming.\n  We are working toward find a workable solutions for everyone, which \nseems to be ignored by the folks on the other side. We are trying to \nfind a way, with these regulations, for Minerals Management to make \nthem work better. We have met with them. The oil companies want to make \nit work better. We want to give the Congress an opportunity to \nparticipate in this matter of making regulations.\n  So that is where we really are.\n  The domestic companies, of course, already pay significant amounts of \nmoney. Someone was saying here that 95 percent pay but the others do \nnot. That is simply not true but if it were, that is an enforcement \nissue. We have regulations now. The problem is, the regulations and the \nproposed regulation are not workable.\n  Talking about having a price that is posted, that fits everywhere, \nthat is not the way the oil business works. It is quite different in \nWyoming than in Oklahoma. The idea of, where do you take the value? do \nyou take it at the wellhead? that is what the contract says. But if you \nhave to carry it, as an oil producer, out 10 miles to where it can be \nsold, it is quite a different cost that goes into it. These are the \nkinds of issues that are involved.\n  These folks who have been talking this afternoon would make you think \npeople were trying to do away with this. That is not the case at all. \nIt is terribly unfair. It is not the issue. The issue is to work \ntogether with MMS and get these regulations enforced. It is relatively \nsimple, frankly.\n  I have to tell you, we talked some about the impact it has on Iowa, \nwhich is nothing; talked about the impact it has on Nevada, which is \nalmost nothing because there is no production there.\n  Let me tell you a little about our counties. We have 23 counties in \nWyoming. Here is one, Park County: 82 percent Federal land. We have \nanother one that is 80 percent Federal land: Big Horn County. These are \nplaces where jobs, where the tax base, where schools are financed \nlargely by mineral production.\n  We have mineral production now. Do we want to change the method of \ntaxing? Fine. But we want to do it along with the Congress. We want to \ndo it along with the producers. We want to make it work and not just be \nsomething that is to be done by MMS without consultation with industry \nand other involved. That is really quite simple.\n  With regard to the editorial that was put in the Record, I have a \nrebuttal that also appeared in the LA Times, that I think would be fair \nto have in the Record, written by the vice president of the American \nPetroleum Institute, Chuck Sandler. I ask unanimous consent that it be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      [From the Los Angeles Times]\n\n (By Charles E. Sandler, Vice President, American Petroleum Institute)\n\n       Among the hallmarks of America's great opinion-shaping \n     industry has been its insistence on the swaying of hearts and \n     minds through the use of reasoned and finely crafted argument \n     based on sound information, not inflammatory rhetoric and \n     baseless accusations.\n       Perhaps it is because I've always placed The Los Angeles \n     Times among the ranks of this country's great newspapers that \n     I find myself perplexed over what could possibly have led to \n     the publication of a shrill editorial about a complex subject \n     that cries out for dispassionate discussion--the Interior \n     Department's proposed new rules governing the payment of \n     royalties by oil companies for oil they produce on federal \n     lands. What could have been a piece that shed light on the \n     issue's complexities instead came across as nothing more than \n     illogic-capped mountains of scurrilous accusations and \n     misinformation.\n       We cannot expect the entire world to agree with us on all \n     issues that are important to us. But we do not see it as \n     unreasonable to expect a fair shake and a fair hearing from \n     those who write about us in respectable forums.\n       These are the facts:\n       First, oil companies are not promoting the use of posted \n     prices to compute future royalties, and in fact have not done \n     so for at least two years.\n       Secondly, the editorial implies that only large producers \n     are concerned about the proposed rule when the truth is that \n     all oil producers, from the largest to the smallest mom-and-\n     pop outfits, are united in opposing the rule.\n       The oil and gas industry and the MMS are in agreement that \n     current oil valuation rules must be replaced. In fact, like \n     the MMS, the industry is seeking improved rules that are \n     fair, workable and free of the uncertainties and ambiguities \n     that make the current regulations a costly bureaucratic \n     nightmare, both for the oil companies and the federal \n     government. However, we oppose replacing the current system \n     with an even more flawed, more complex and more burdensome \n     set of regulations that fail to accurately\n\n[[Page S11305]]\n\n     take into consideration a number of crucial and relevant \n     expenses--transportation and other post-production costs, for \n     instance--in computing royalties.\n       We have repeatedly urged the Interior Department's Minerals \n     Management Service (MMS) to establish a system that avoids \n     the complications of valuation altogether through the use of \n     a royalty-in-kind (RIK) program under which the government \n     takes its payement in oil, not dollars (an alternative \n     permitted but not required under current law).\n       Under such a system, producers tender the government its \n     royalty share of production and it would in turn contract \n     with marketing companies to sell the oil at the fair-market \n     price, as other producers do. It would simplify the system, \n     eliminate the need for armies of accountants and lawyers (and \n     their fees), and it would provide an opportunity for the \n     federal and state governments to increase revenues. A similar \n     system has been used in Alberta, Canada, and resulted in \n     increased oil production and royalty payments, fewer \n     disagreements between the government and oil producers, and a \n     smaller bureaucracy. The government, unfortunately, has yet \n     to adopt such a proposal although a pilot RIK project is \n     being planned for this fall in the Gulf of Mexico.\n       The Times editorial's unfair comparison of the current \n     situation to the Teapot Dome scandal--which involved fraud--\n     ignores the significant fact that Democratic and Republican \n     members of Congress who have joined to prevent Interior from \n     unilaterally imposing its will on the industry have very \n     legitimate concerns. To suggest that a lawmaker from a state \n     that is a leader in oil and gas production is unduly \n     influenced by the oil and gas industry because she has taken \n     campaign contributions from that industry is ludicrous. It's \n     like saying that no Silicon Valley lawmaker who's received \n     campaign contributions from the high-tech industry should \n     ever lift a finger to help that sector of California's \n     economy.\n       Contrary to the editorial's allegation, producers are \n     playing by the existing rules, as established by the \n     government. The fact that new rules have not been made final \n     as a result of Congress's decision to exercise its lawful \n     right to review policy does not alter that fact.\n       Finally, if Interior were truly concerned about increasing \n     revenue from the land the federal government leases to oil \n     companies, it should give serious consideration to the tried \n     and tested royalty-in-kind proposal.\n       Much work remains to be done before this matter is \n     resolved. Legitimate differences of opinion exist. In the \n     end, the issue will be settled by reasonable minds employing \n     reasoned arguments, both to promote their views and to secure \n     an agreement. The Times, unfortunately, missed a great \n     opportunity to be a part of that sober discussion.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. There is a great deal of involvement here. We have to \ntalk a little bit about this industry. We have now, what, approximately \n55 percent of foreign oil that comes into this country. Our oil people \nare stressed to keep it going. The oil business has been in something \nof a depression. We had oil down in the $6-, $7-, $8-a-barrel range in \nWyoming. That is not to say there ought not to be regulations, that \nthere ought not to be the kind of royalty rules that can be lived by. \nThat is what we are working for.\n  If you came in from Mars and listened to what has been talked about \nover the last hour, you would think we did not have anything except a \nbunch of robber barons. That is not true--absolutely not true.\n  So I hope we can go forward with this, we can go ahead and work in \nthe next year to put these royalty rules together, as it should be, to \nput it together in a way that is fair.\n  We have proposed regulations. We now have some changes in personnel \nin MMS that I think might make it work quite a bit better. We have some \nchanges now coming forth at the Assistant Secretary's level.\n  We really need to get down to some facts and get away from all this \nhyperbole about what people are not paying, and people are cheating, \nand all these things. If that is true, that is an enforcement issue \nthat ought to be dealt with by the Federal Government.\n  The West does have a unique relationship with the Federal Government. \nAs I mentioned, all of us have a great deal of our land that is there, \na great deal of our resources. We are dependent largely on mineral \nresources, along with agriculture and tourism, for our economy. So we \nneed to have an economy that has jobs, that creates a tax base, that \ndoes the kinds of things that this industry does.\n  So I am really interested in us moving forward beyond these types of \narguments brought up by the other side of the aisle and get something \naccomplished. We have talked about this now, and we have had several \nvotes on this, as a matter of fact. We had 60 votes to move forward. We \nare ready to go forward with the Interior bill and do some things that \nhave to be done in the next week and a half. We owe it to the American \npeople.\n  I am really distressed by the idea of standing around wasting time on \nan issue that has pretty well been summed up and should be completed. \nWe have already finished it, but we continue to go on and on here on \nthe floor, I guess for political reasons. I cannot think of any other \nreason we continue to go on as long as we have.\n  One of the things, of course, that is most difficult from time to \ntime in dealing with the Federal Government is the Federal regulations \nthat are onerous and difficult. They make it very hard for businesses.\n  By the way, many of the businesses in Wyoming--and the oil business--\nare small businesses, independent producers. Many of them are stripper \nwells and down to 15 barrels or so per day. These are not all the \nmammoth companies, and so on, they talk about. This is an industry that \nis tremendously important to our State.\n  By the way, our students do receive a great deal of support from this \nsource, which is our principal source, of course, for funding schools \nand doing the other things we do in our State.\n  Efforts will go forward to continue to complete the regulations and \nthe rules. That is really what we are aiming toward. That is really \nwhat we ought to do. MMS needs to work with industry and come up with \nsome workable regulations. Talking about schools not having the money--\nthe money is there now. As the Senator from Idaho indicated, there have \nbeen diversions from that pot of money by the very people who are \ncontinuing to talk about needing more. It seems to be something of an \nirony to do it that way.\n\n  I guess I have been particularly concerned about shifting the focus \nof our discussion today on an MMS proposed rule over to campaign \nfinance, which we heard talked about for 30 minutes this morning. It is \nnot relevant at all to what we are doing. And the implication that \neveryone who is for a workable rule is somehow a product of the \ncontributions, I am offended by this. I am. I think it is a very \nunproductive kind of an argument.\n  I hope we can move forward, get this behind us, that we can get this \njob done. We can do it, and it can be done. By working with MMS, we and \nindustry can come up with a workable rule. We are on our way to doing \nthat now.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I do not yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I think this is our hour, if I understand \nit correctly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming had the floor. Did he \nyield the floor?\n  Mr. THOMAS. I yielded the floor to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator cannot yield the floor to another \nSenator.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I believe I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota was recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will Senator Wellstone yield, without losing his right?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to yield for a question, without losing \nmy right.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How long will it be in terms of the remarks the Senator \nwill make before he yields the floor?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague, probably about an hour.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Wyoming, I \nunderstand the point he is making about the connections to money at an \nindividual level. I am not here to make that argument. I think there is \na different argument that could be made about the need for reform.\n  What I want to do is go back to what I think is the issue. To me, the \nissue is that the Hutchison amendment is an outrageous provision. The \nreason we are out here on the floor is, we want people in the country \nto know about it. We all have to be accountable.\n  It was offered to the Interior appropriations bill. Now, because of \nthis successful effort to get cloture, this\n\n[[Page S11306]]\n\namendment, if it goes into law, which it will, will restrict the \nInterior Department from doing its job, which is to make sure that the \noil companies pay their full royalties. I thank the Senator from \nCalifornia for having the courage to come out and take on this effort \nand for having the courage to make this an issue, a very public issue \nin the country.\n  The reason we are out here is that behind this amendment lies an \nunbelievable story. The Interior Department's Mineral Management \nService, MMS, simply wanted to collect the money that these oil \ncompanies owe the public. Many of the industry's largest companies have \nbeen consistently underpaying their royalties. They are not paying \ntheir taxes. Ordinary people, which I mean in a positive way, in \nIllinois or Minnesota, they pay their taxes. These companies have not \nbeen paying their taxes, not the fair share.\n  Last year, Mobil Oil agreed to a $56.5 million settlement of Federal \nand State lawsuits alleging underpayment of royalties. They agreed to \nthe settlement. Also, according to the Wall Street Journal, not exactly \na bastion of liberalism, Chevron Corporation has agreed in principle to \npay approximately $95 million to resolve a civil lawsuit charging that \nChevron shortchanged the American public. That is what has been going \non.\n\n  There have been a flurry of other settlements--$2.5 billion in \nAlaska, $350 million in California, $17.5 million in Texas, $10 million \nin Louisiana, and $8 million in New Mexico. Remember, this oil belongs \nto the public. What we have been saying to these companies is: Go \nahead, take the oil, but all we ask, as the public, is for you to pay \nthe market value. I don't think that is too much to ask, nor do the \npeople of this country think it is too much to ask. Apparently, the big \noil companies do. If there was a poll in the country, 99 percent of the \npeople would be with my colleague from California.\n  Let me be clear about one thing: We are not talking about all of the \noil companies. We are not talking about the mom and pop independents. \nWe are talking about large integrated companies that sell to affiliates \nat undervalued prices. They make up only 5 percent of the oil companies \ndrilling on the Federal land, but they account for 68 percent of the \nFederal production.\n  The Interior Department, up to the time of this Hutchison amendment, \nwas developing regulations to stop this highway robbery. People get \nangry. People work hard. They pay their taxes. Then they see these big \noil companies that say: We don't have to pay our taxes.\n  This is not new authority. Interior always had the statutory \nauthority to collect royalties on the fair market value. But what the \nHutchison amendment would do would essentially negate what the Interior \nDepartment was trying to do. What was the Interior Department trying to \ndo? These new regulations would keep the oil companies from \nmanipulating ``fair market value'' to underpay their royalties.\n  That is what they have been doing. They have been cheating. This is \nthe question I ask my colleagues: Do these companies, these large \nintegrated oil companies, deserve our sympathy? I don't think so. They \nhave been caught. Let me repeat that. They have been caught. They have \nbeen caught underpaying their royalties. They have been cheating the \npublic. That is what they have been doing.\n  My colleague from Texas and some other Senators come to the floor and \nthey want to do a special favor for the big oil companies. The reason \nwe are out on the floor is, even if we lost on the cloture vote, I say \nto my colleague from California and other Senators, we don't lose this \nvote, not really. We don't lose this fight, not really, because I think \npeople in the country are absolutely outraged.\n  We are talking about $66 million a year that could be going to the \nenvironment, to schools, to our children. We are talking about big oil \ncompanies that basically seem to think--my colleague from Wisconsin was \nout here on the floor, and I guess other Senators didn't appreciate \nwhat he was doing. But with all due respect, this is a reform issue. \nHow is it that we have so much sympathy, how is it we care so deeply, \nhow is it we feel the pain of these oil companies, how is it we are so \nmuch at their service, and yet, when it comes to families that can't \nafford child care, we don't have the same sympathy? When it comes to \nmaking sure we make the investment in education for our children, we \napparently don't have the same sympathy.\n  I was at a press conference with my colleague from Vermont, Senator \nJeffords, a Republican. We were talking about the current course, which \nis going to be about a 12- to 14-percent cut in low-income energy \nassistance in a cold weather State. We are talking about grants of \nmaybe $285, but it makes a huge difference. Do my colleagues know that \nfor around 85-, 90,000 households in Minnesota, a third of them are \nelderly; 70 percent of them are working poor?\n  This means there is a grant so that during the cold winter months in \nMinnesota--we have a few of those months--we make sure those families, \nin trying to pay their heat, are still also able to afford food, or \nelderly people don't give up on prescription drugs.\n  What do we have here? We have a Senate, by virtue of the vote on the \nfloor of the Senate, which basically does the bidding for these big oil \ncompanies. All of our sympathies are for these companies. My colleague \nfrom California has had the courage to confront this, to take this on. \nThe reason we are taking our time this afternoon, I say to the Senator \nfrom California, is that we want as many people in the country as \npossible to know about this. That is right; absolutely, that is right.\n  I said, when the Senator was out, I have no doubt--and I thank her \nfor her effort; I know she must be getting tired--I have no doubt that \n99 percent of the people in this country are on your side. I say that \nto the Senator from California. People are outraged by this. This is \nanother example of too few people, with too much power, having too much \nsay over how the Senate operates, and the vast majority of the people \nare left out.\n  It is interesting; my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, \njust gave me a summary of what happened today on the House side in the \nSubcommittee on Education of Appropriations. Unbelievable. They cut \n$1.2 billion in money that would have gone to reduce class size. My \ndaughter is a Spanish teacher. I asked her the other day, ``What size \nclasses do you have this year?'' She said, ``36 and 38.'' Those are two \nof her classes. Those classes need to be smaller.\n  Then I was talking to my son, who has two small children in \nelementary school. In the third grade class, there are 28 students. We \nknow if we reduce class size, teachers would have more time to spend \nwith these kids, and they can do better. Today, on the House side, our \nRepublican colleagues cut this--title I funding, $264 million below the \nPresident's request.\n  I have to talk about this for a little while. This is unbelievable. \nAlbeit, I was literally on this one, in a minority, but we had all this \ndiscussion about Ed-Flex and all that we were going to do with title I. \nAt the same time, our title I funding for low-income children in our \ncountry is about a third of the level of what it should be if we were \nto reach all the kids. This is money that is used for teaching \nassistants, more teachers, more parent outreach, higher standards, and \nmaking sure that kids who fall behind can meet those standards. Today, \nwe are essentially cutting title I. How could the $66 million be used? \nWe can hire a thousand teachers; we can put 44,000 new computers in the \nclassrooms; we can buy textbooks for 1.2 million students; we can \nprovide 53 million hot lunches for schoolchildren.\n  So I can't understand when some of my colleagues come out on the \nfloor and say this is not the issue. This is the issue. These oil \ncompanies have been cheating. They haven't been paying their fair share \nof taxes. They were able to get some Senators to come out here as a \nfavor to them and make sure they are able to continue to basically not \npay their fair share of taxes. We give up $66 million, and the choice \nbecomes not the mom-and-pop operations, but huge, big, integrated oil \ncompanies.\n  Do I have sympathy on the side of big oil companies, or am I on the \nside of children? That is an easy question for me and the vast majority \nof people in this country to answer. It is interesting; when we talk \nabout the whole issue of cheating the public, I want to point this out \non the floor of the Senate. Now we are talking about cheating\n\n[[Page S11307]]\n\nthe public. Now we are talking about the Interior Department wanting to \nbasically put into effect the regulation that makes sure the big oil \ncompanies could not cheat the public. Now we are talking about an \neffort that basically is an effort to undo this regulation, undo the \nwork of the Interior Department.\n  The Interior Department is essentially saying to people: You know \nwhat. We, as a Government agency, are going to make sure the oil \ncompanies pay their fair share, which is what people believe in. People \nget angry because they think we are well-connected, and if you make \nhuge contributions--which is what my colleague from Wisconsin was \ntalking about--and you are a heavy hitter and you have lobbyists, you \ncan get special deals. People hate that. They get furious about it. I \ndon't blame them.\n\n  I heard a lot about cheating and all the rest when we had the welfare \ndebate. It is interesting. We have all this sympathy for the ``poor,'' \nlarge oil companies. They come in here and, apparently, for some of my \ncolleagues, we can't do enough for them, even when they are not paying \ntheir fair share. But you know, it is interesting; we never have any of \nthe same sympathy for poor mothers and children.\n  I have been out on the floor of the Senate trying to get at least \nsome honest policy evaluation of how this welfare bill is working. I \nget something passed on the Senate floor, and it is taken out in \nconference committee. As I was saying, how about some sympathy for \nothers? Maybe if they are not as well connected, or maybe if they don't \nhave all of the income, we still ought to care about them.\n  So if we hear from Families USA that since that welfare bill passed, \nthere are 670,000 fewer children who have medical coverage, we ought to \nbe concerned. If we hear from the U.S. Department of Agriculture that \nthere has been a dramatic rise in the number of hungry and food-\ninsecure families in the country, maybe we ought to be concerned. And \nif we know there has been about a 25-percent drop in food stamp \nparticipation, maybe we ought to be concerned.\n  If we hear that most of these mothers are getting jobs that are \nbarely above minimum wage, and then they lose health care coverage and \nthey don't find good child care for their children, maybe we should be \nconcerned. If it is the case, as it is the case in Minnesota--and I \nwill bet in a lot of other States as well--that we can't even make the \nrent subsidy program work any longer because there is no affordable \nlow-income housing, so the fair market value is above what would make \nanybody eligible, and that people can't even find housing and they \ncan't cash-flow--they would have to make $12 or $13 to be able to cash-\nflow to afford any affordable housing for themselves and their \nchildren, and if the most dramatic rise in the homeless population is \nwomen and children, maybe we should have the same concern. But we \ndon't.\n  We are concerned for these oil companies that have been caught \ncheating, but we are not concerned for low-income women and children. \nWe are concerned for these oil companies that have been caught \ncheating. There is not enough we can do for them, but we are not \nconcerned about funding title I. We are not concerned about making sure \nwe fund low-income energy assistance. We are not concerned about making \nthe investment to reduce class size. We are not concerned about \naffordable child care. We are not concerned about making sure that we \nfully fund and make the investment we ought to make in veterans' health \ncare.\n  But we can't do enough for these oil companies that have been caught \ncheating.\n  I think this debate we have been having, this sort of fight on the \nfloor of the Senate speaks volumes on what is at stake. Let me simply, \none more time, repeat what I said earlier. This amendment is an \noutrageous provision offered to the Interior appropriations bill. What \nit does is it basically restricts the Interior Department from doing \nits job. What the Interior Department was trying to do was make sure \nthe oil companies pay the full royalties for the oil they are drilling \non Federal or Indian land. Therefore, we lose, roughly speaking, $66 \nmillion a year. Therefore, the choice becomes: Do you hire a thousand \nteachers? Do you put 44,000 new computers into the classrooms? Do you \nbuy textbooks for 1.2 million students? Do you provide 53 million hot \nlunches for schoolchildren? Or do you basically come down on the side \nof the big oil companies?\n  Well, I am proud to say on the floor of the Senate that I am not the \nSenator for the big oil companies or the big insurance companies or the \npharmaceutical companies. They already have great representation in \nWashington, DC. It is the rest of the people who need it. That is what \nSenator Boxer has been trying to do--represent the rest of the people \nin this country. That is what I am proud to do out on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  It is interesting. October is going to be Domestic Violence Awareness \nMonth. It is so important that in October we focus on the violence in \nfamilies. About every 13 seconds a woman is beaten and battered in her \nhome. A home is supposed to be a safe place. About every 13 seconds, \nthat is a conservative figure. All too many children witness this \nviolence, as well.\n  As it turns out, we also at this time are recognizing the 25th \nanniversary of Women's Advocates, which was the Nation's first battered \nwomen's shelter located in St. Paul, MN. I have a lot of pride when I \ntalk about the staff and when I talk about the volunteers and the \nsupporters of Women's Advocates.\n  In 1974, the doors of this shelter first opened for women and their \nchildren who were seeking some respite from violence. It took a lot of \ncourage and for women to stand up to this.\n  To date, this wonderful, special place has provided advocacy shelter \nand advocacy and support services to over 25,000 women and children. \nThey spend countless hours teaching our schoolchildren and community \nmembers about the impact. Women's Advocates stands as a pillar of grace \nand triumph. I hail executive director, Elizabeth Wolf, and all the \ncourageous women.\n  But what is interesting to me--I raise this question because, again, \nI come out on the floor of the Senate and I say: Can't we do more to \ntry to stop this violence? Can't we have more safe visitation centers \nto protect children and women? Can't we make sure we do more by way of \nsupporting children who witness this violence in their homes--some 3 to \n5 million children? Can't we do more to make sure these women who have \nbeen battered and who have experienced this violence can afford housing \nwhen they leave these shelters? Do you know what the answer is from my \ncolleagues? No. We can't make that investment. We don't have the money. \nBut when the oil companies that have been cheating and have been caught \ncheating come here and they say, please give us a special break, please \ngive us a special favor, we find it easy to give them our sympathy and \nto give them what they want.\n  How interesting it is. This is an issue of representation. How \ninteresting it is that when we are talking about children in our \nschools, when we are talking about working families that can't afford \nchild care for their children, when we are talking about men and women \nwho work in our child care centers and have to leave because they can't \nmake a living wage, therefore, there is all this turnover--the \nWashington Post had an excellent piece about this not too long ago--and \nwhen we are talking about whether or not people who work almost 52 \nweeks a year, 40 hours a week, shouldn't be able to have a living wage \nand we should raise the minimum wage, or when we are talking about \nwhether or not can't we do more by way of affordable houses, or when we \nare talking about how we can't expand the Pell grant program to make \nsure higher education is more affordable, we don't have any sympathy; \nwe don't have any resources; there is nothing we can do.\n  But when it comes to these big oil companies, when they come here and \nthey say, please give us a special favor, we have been cheating and now \nthe Interior Department is going to say we can't cheat any longer and \nwe have to pay our fair share of taxes, we ask you to fix that. That is \nexactly what the crux of the amendment is. That is exactly why we are \nspeaking on the floor with a tremendous amount of indignation.\n  The question becomes one of representation. I think this actually is \nwhat my colleague from Wisconsin was\n\n[[Page S11308]]\n\ntrying to speak to. Why do the wage earners, these working families, \nthese children and women who are experiencing violence, children who \nwitness that violence, why don't their concerns seem to carry any \nweight and yet the concerns of the poor large oil companies that have \nbeen caught cheating seem to matter? What is going on here?\n\n  I think this is a huge problem. I think this has everything in the \nworld to do with the need for reform. This has to do with a mix of \nmoney and politics. This has to do with: Who are the players? Who are \nthe contributors? Who are the heavy hitters? Who are the well \nconnected? Who can get Senators to do their bidding?\n  I tell you, it is outrageous. That is why I am on the floor to say it \nis outrageous. It is absolutely outrageous.\n  I have another question. I have a different question. This one is \nvery near and dear to my heart.\n  Why do we have all of this concern for these poor big oil companies \nthat have been caught cheating and don't want to pay their fair share \nbut we don't have the same concern for family farmers who right now are \ngoing under? We are going to lose another 6.57 percent of our family \nfarmers in Minnesota. These producers are going to go under. We want to \ncome out here and we want to say raise the loan rate.\n  I say to my colleague from Michigan, I would be pleased to finish up \na little bit earlier. I will finish up in a few minutes. I have other \ncolleagues wanting to speak. I will make one final point.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my colleague from \nMichigan be allowed to follow me. I still have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I object.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will take my time.\n  Let me simply raise another question, which is if we have all of this \nconcern for these big oil companies, and we want to prevent the \nInterior Department from making sure they can pay full royalties, then \nwhy don't we have the same concern for family farmers in the State of \nMinnesota? Why don't we have the same concern for the producers in my \nState? Many of us from the farm States want to come out here and we \nwant to talk about raising the loan rate. I have a proposal that I want \nan up-or-down vote on to put a moratorium on these acquisitions and \nthese mergers.\n  We want to talk about antitrust action. We want to talk about fair \ntrade policy. We want to know why the conference committee can't even \nget the emergency assistance to our farmers who are going under.\n  But it seems as if when it comes to family farmers in Minnesota, or, \nfor that matter, Illinois, or in our country, or when it comes to \neducation for children, or when it comes to veterans' health care, or \nwhen it comes to low-income energy assistance, or when it comes to \naffordable housing, or when it comes to what we can do about reducing \nviolence in homes, the brunt of the violence directed at women and \nchildren, we don't have very much sympathy. But we have all of the \nsympathy in the world for these poor oil companies that have been \ncaught cheating because, after all, they are the ones that are the well \nconnected. They are the ones that have the resources. They are the ones \nthat seem to make a difference.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Minnesota will \nyield for a unanimous consent.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to yield for a question. I would like to \nkeep the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to keep the floor and yield for a \nunanimous consent request.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent--if the Senator \nfrom Minnesota would be able to do this--that the Senator from \nMinnesota yield within the next few minutes to the Senator from Texas \nfor 10 minutes, and then to the Senator from Michigan for 10 minutes, \nand then, if the Senator from Minnesota is still on the floor after \ngiving us the time, the floor go back to the Senator from Minnesota \nuntil 4:15, at which point the floor would be yielded to the Senator \nfrom Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, or her designee.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, there is so much more I want to say \nright now, but I am pleased to yield to that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, at 4:15 Senator Domenici or I will be \nrecognized and we will use approximately 45 minutes of our time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. And I have how much time after?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Let me state the unanimous consent request.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Fifteen minutes, from 4 to 4:15, is what the Senator \nwould have.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Let me state the unanimous consent request. I ask \nunanimous consent that Senator Gramm have 10 minutes at this time, then \nI have 10 minutes, the floor go back to Senator Wellstone until 4:15, \nthen it go to Senator Hutchison or her designee at 4:15, and any time \nremaining to Senator Wellstone on his hour at 4:15 that he retain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Could I take 30 seconds to summarize?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I add that Senator Wellstone take whatever number of \nminutes he wishes to summarize. That comes off my 10 minutes.\n  I thank the Senator from Minnesota. I know how difficult it is. He is \ninto some very important material, and it is an intrusion, but it \naccommodates a number of Senators.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask the question, How does it come to \nbe that these large oil companies have generated so much of our \nsympathy, have enlisted so much of our sympathy? They have been caught. \nLet me repeat that: They have been caught underpaying their royalties. \nThey have been cheating. And we have all of the sympathy for these big \noil companies.\n  But when it comes to children, when it comes to family farmers, when \nit comes to doing something about reducing violence in homes, when it \ncomes to raising the minimum wage, when it comes to affordable child \ncare, when it comes to affordable health care, when it comes to so many \nof the issues so important to families in our country, we don't seem to \nhave the same sympathy.\n  This debate goes to the heart of what is at stake in the Senate. What \nis at stake is, Whom do we represent? Are we Senators for the big oil \ncompanies or are we Senators for the vast majority of citizens in our \ncountry who are asking Senators to get serious with good public policy \nthat will make a difference for them, make a difference for their \nchildren, make a big difference for our communities?\n  That is what this is about. Do we have representative democracy where \nthe vast majority of people are heard or do we have a system where we \nhave democracy for the few, where the big oil companies come here and \nwork out their special deals? That is what they have done, America. \nThat is so outrageous. That is what is so unconscionable. That is why \nwe are taking the time this afternoon to make sure every single citizen \nin this country understands what has happened here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Gramm of Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, what a pity it is that America today is \nfocused on the fact that the President has vetoed the tax bill and is \nnot paying a bit of attention to this debate. So much passion, it is a \nshame it is wasted, but it is.\n  The President has vetoed the tax bill. It means the average working \ncouple in America will bear $1,400 a year of marriage penalty because \nthe President doesn't believe they ought to get relief. It means all \nover America people who inherit family farms and small businesses from \ntheir parents, who worked a lifetime to build the farms and businesses \nup, will have to sell them to give the Government 55 cents out of every \ndollar of value for which their parents worked a lifetime.\n  Because the President has vetoed the tax bill, it means we are not \ngoing to have a small across-the-board tax cut for every working \nAmerican who pays income taxes. Because the President vetoed the tax \nbill, we are not going to make health insurance deductible for Joe and \nSarah Brown, the same as it is deductible for General Motors or General \nElectric.\n\n[[Page S11309]]\n\n  We know, based on the makeup of the House and Senate and based on the \nvotes of our Democrat colleagues who have been steadfastly opposed to \ncutting taxes for working families, that we can't override the \nPresident's veto. So the tax debate is over.\n  Thank goodness we will have a new President in 15 months. The \nAmerican people are going to get to vote in part on whether or not \nGovernment ought to spend a surplus or give part of it back. When they \nvote, we will vote again.\n  I say this to the President: I hope the President will not send down \nto Congress more spending bills, because they will pass over my cold, \ndead political body. I hope the President is not going to propose \nraising taxes and spending money because they are going to pass over my \ncold, dead political body. We can't make Bill Clinton cut taxes, but we \ncan stop him from spending the Social Security surplus. That is exactly \nwhat we are going to do.\n  We are going to hear all kinds of whining from the White House about \nhow the President has ``got to, got to, got to'' have more money, even \nthough we are spending more than ever in American history. He has to \nhave more, and we have to steal it from Social Security or raise taxes \nto pay for it. It is not going to happen. End of that debate.\n  Now, I want to say I have never, since I have been in the Senate, \nseen a debate so out of kilter with the real issue that is before the \nSenate. Quite frankly, I have seen few debates that are as mean-\nspirited as this debate.\n  Here is the issue in a nutshell: For 4 years, the Congress has \ndecided, when we wrote a law setting out royalties on oil production \nthat would be paid to the Federal Government and establishing a system \nto collect them, we meant what we said; that when the Government \nentered into contracts with people, that those contracts were binding; \nand that if people wanted to raise those royalties, that ought to be \nvoted on in Congress. After all, we went to the inconvenience to run \nfor public office, and the Constitution says Congress shall have the \npower to raise taxes and to spend money.\n  It must be wonderful to have all these things my colleagues hate--big \noil, big medicine, big pharmaceuticals--but we are talking about $22 \nmillion a year worth of royalties. This is not about money, this is \nabout principle. It is about whether or not Congress ought to set the \nlaw and whether Congress has the power to tax, or whether the Federal \nbureaucracy, through its own power and by its own agenda, with no \nsupport from Congress, can override Congress' will and make law.\n\n  I am proud of my dear, wonderful colleague from Texas. I love my \ncolleague from Texas because she is tough. I have never seen an issue \nso demagogued as this issue. I have to say to her, she has not backed \nup an inch and she has won. I think it is a great testament to her \ncourage and to her toughness. I congratulate her on both.\n  The issue is not big oil versus schoolchildren. If the Federal \nGovernment raises royalties and therefore raises the deliverable price \nat the filling station, or when you buy home heating oil, who pays for \nit? Who pays for it is working men and women. That is food, clothing, \nshelter, and education they take away from their children.\n  This is not an issue about oil companies versus children; this is an \nissue of whether we want to take an action through regulation on which \nCongress constitutionally should be voting.\n  Second, do we want to raise those prices? I do not. In terms of all \nof this stuff, big oil and political power, they do not have anything \nto do with this debate. This debate is about whether or not the Mineral \nManagement Service should have unilateral powers to change royalty \nrates, or whether Congress, which set the rates to begin with, \nestablished the process, should have the power to make those changes if \nthey choose.\n  Our Democrat colleagues use terms such as ``fairness'' and ``big \noil'' and ``excess profits.'' It all reminds me of when their policy \nwas in effect under President Carter, and we all waited in line to buy \ngasoline; when their policy was in force under President Carter and we \nhad double-digit inflation. Maybe they want to go back to that. I do \nnot. But to turn this into some kind of political shouting match when \nwe are talking about a debate that involves $22 million a year, which \nis a small amount but a fundamental principle of American government \nwhich is beyond setting a price on, and that is who makes the law in \nthis country? Does the bureaucracy make law or does the Congress make \nlaw?\n  Our colleague from Texas has, for 4 years in a row, set out in law \nthe principle that Congress made the law to begin with, and when we are \nready to change it, we will change it. We do not need the Clinton \nadministration acting as executive branch, legislative branch, and \nregulator all combined.\n  So I say to my colleague, I am proud of what she has done. I am proud \nthat she has won, and all the whining and all the moaning and all the \ngroaning does not change the fact that the Senator from Texas stands on \nthe firmest ground that you could stand on, on the floor of the Senate. \nThe Constitution, in article I, gives Congress the power to impose \ntaxes. It does not give the Mineral Management Service the power to \nimpose taxes. Nor will we ever give them that power. That is what this \nissue is about. I think we demean the legislative process and demean \ndebate by trying to turn this into something that it is not.\n\n  I know someone from the Mineral Management Service has said --and our \ncolleague from Texas is going to give the exact quote --that we need \nthis issue to demagog. Maybe they need this issue to demagog. But this \nis the greatest deliberative body in the history of the world. Here we \nare supposed to be debating real issues.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Is the Senator referring to the quote from Michael \nGaudlin of the Department of the Interior, Communications Director, \nquoted in Inside Energy magazine, November 2, 1998, in which he said, \n``We're sticking to the position we've taken.'' ``It gives us an issue \nto demagog for another year.''\n  Is that what he is referring to?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will my colleague read what the quote said again? I want \nto be sure that is what I was referring to.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Michael Gaudlin of Department of the Interior, \nCommunications Director, quoted in Inside Energy magazine, November 2, \n1998, in which he said, ``We're sticking to the position we've taken.'' \n``It gives us an issue to demagog for another year.''\n  Mr. GRAMM. That is the quote I am talking about. I thank our \ncolleague for using it.\n  Let me say this. He can demagog all he wants to. But if he wants to \nraise taxes, let me suggest to him he quit his job, go back wherever he \nis from, and that he convince millions of people to elect him to the \nSenate. Then he can come up here and vote to raise taxes. But as long \nas he is there and not here, I do not care what he thinks about taxes. \nIt is not his duty to raise them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 10 minutes of the Senator have expired. \nThe Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is very interesting that we have had \nsuch a focus on Congress having the power rather than the bureaucracy \nhaving the power. Many of us worked very hard in this body, including, \nI believe, the Senator from Texas, to make sure Congress would have the \npower to review regulation and to review rules. We have a Congressional \nAccountability Act. It is pretty new. We do not use it very often, but \nit is there. For 60 days after the Interior Department adopts a rule, \nif we will let them adopt the rule, we have the power to override that \nrule by expedited procedure.\n  So if my good friend from Texas really wants Congress to be in the \nposition that we can override the rule if we ever permit the rule to be \nadopted, we have that power. We worked hard to get that power in law. \nIt took us many years to get that power in law. It is called \ncongressional accountability, congressional review, and the rulemaking \nprocess that the Interior Department is following is a rulemaking \nprocess that we told them to follow. We are not going to let them \nfinish it, apparently. The argument we now hear is we are not going to \nlet them finish it because we have the power. We should have the power, \nnot the bureaucracy.\n\n[[Page S11310]]\n\n  The problem with that argument is it ignores the fact that if we did \nlet them finish, which we should, their rulemaking process, we would \nhave the power to override a rule of the Department of the Interior. \nFor 60 days we have expedited procedures that will permit us to \noverride their rule. So that argument does not wash.\n  The part of this that really intrigues me the most is what so-called \nintegrated oil companies have been able to get away with by basically \nsetting their own prices instead of using market price. I was really \nintrigued by this. I was not into this issue until a few months ago, \nreally. I started reading some editorials. I started reading the \ncongressional speeches here in the Senate of Senator Boxer and others.\n\n  I asked the Interior Department. I said: Can you give me some \nexamples where you have an integrated oil company and an independent \noil company that are drilling the same oil from public lands and paying \nus different royalties; where the price they are setting in an \nintegrated company on the one hand, and an independent company on the \nother hand, are different for the same oil from adjacent lands, both \nbeing public lands, of course? Because then, if you have different \nprices being set for the same oil, you have overwhelming evidence that \nwe are being cheated. Either that or the independents are paying more \nthan they should, which is a pretty unlikely thing because they are \ngoing by the market price. They are going by what they get for the oil \nin an arm's length transaction.\n  So on the one hand, you have independents with an arm's length \ntransaction, which is what the law is. Then we have the integrateds \ncoming along, saying the prices are going to be a lot different based \non what they are charging themselves.\n  So I asked the Department of the Interior to take a look at areas on \npublic lands where you have independents and integrated oil companies \nright next to each other drilling for the same oil. Is there a price \ndifferential?\n  Here are the numbers they give me. It is to me powerful evidence that \nwe are being cheated because from the same lease, the same oil field, \nthe same oil, in 6 months in 1999, we get different prices, and in \nevery case the price that is being set by the integrated company is \nless than the market price which was established by the independent in \nits arm's length transaction.\n  How do we justify this? How does an integrated company justify that? \nIn January 1999, three different fields: Colorado, New Mexico, and the \nGulf of Mexico. Sales price, dollars per barrel, the independent: \n$12.43. That was the market price. That was the price they were paid on \nthe market for that oil. The same lease, same oil field, same oil the \nintegrated company is basing their royalty to us on: $11.83.\n  February, the independent, arm's length transaction, getting $11.97 \nand paying a royalty based on that. What does the integrated company \nbase its royalty on? When it sells it to itself: $11.36.\n  March of 1999, Colorado, same lease, same field, same oil in terms of \nquality, you have the same oil. The independent, he is basing the \nroyalty to us on $14.60. The integrated company is basing its royalty \nto us on $14.08.\n  April, same story; May, same story; June, same story. That's \nColorado, the first 6 months of 1999.\n\n  I asked them to give me some examples. I told them not to pick and \nchoose; give me examples which are typical examples where you have oil \nsales, same lease, same field, same quality oil next to each other. \nThat is in what I am interested.\n  This is the New Mexico field. It has the same kind of price \nstructure. The independent sells it for $11.74. The integrated company \nis paying us on $9.83.\n  In February, New Mexico, the independent company paid, arm's length \ntransaction, $11.53. The integrated company is basing a royalty to us \non $10.16.\n  Something is fundamentally wrong here. The Senator from California \nand others, it seems to me, have demonstrated in a very clear, dramatic \nfashion that something is wrong, but when you break it down and ask the \nInterior Department to give us some more evidence, give us evidence of \nthe differences in the amount on which royalties are based, where the \nfield is the same field, where the lease is the same field--these are \npublic lands. This oil does not belong to the oil companies; it belongs \nto the people of the United States. They are on our land. This is not a \ntax; it is a royalty for our property. We own it. It is ours and we let \nthe oil companies drill on it.\n  What did they come up with? Gulf of Mexico, same field, same lease, \nthe independent company, arm's length transaction gets $11.19. The \nintegrated company, selling to itself, is basing its royalty on $10.49. \nThere is a lot of evidence of these miscalculations by these integrated \ncompanies so they pay less royalties.\n  What could be more compelling evidence when you have oil being drawn \nfrom the same field, the same lease right next to each other on a \npublic land? How much more compelling evidence do we need before we \nfinally say to the Interior Department: Go ahead, do your rule.\n  In closing, I remind our colleagues of one other thing and it is \nwhere I started. What we hear from the Senator from Texas is we should \ndo this, not the bureaucracy. We have the power to override the \nbureaucracy under this new process which so many of us worked so hard \nto put in place so we are accountable, not the bureaucracy. It used to \nbe called legislative review. Before that, we thought we had a \nlegislative veto, but that was overridden by the Supreme Court. Now it \nis called the Congressional Accountability Act. For 60 days, if we will \nlet the Interior Department follow the process, we then have the power, \nunder expedited procedures, to override any final rule they may adopt.\n  This effort is to truncate that, to cut it off so they cannot follow \nthe rulemaking process. That is what this effort is all about.\n  What it will stop is the elimination of this absurdity. It is absurd \nfor the same oil, for the same field to be charged at different \namounts. It is obvious what is going on. The independent companies, \nbecause they are selling on the market, have a very clear objective, \noutside way of determining market value.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. It is my understanding that Senator Wellstone was going \nto be here at 4. He has yielded the extra time until 4:15 to the \nSenator from Michigan. I want to engage him in a couple questions, if \nthere is no objection, and then at 4:15, we will go to Senator Domenici \nor Senator Hutchison's person of choice.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from California, \nI certainly will not object, but I have one other Senator who has also \nasked for time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Go right ahead and make a UC request.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask unanimous consent that at 5 o'clock I have 5 \nminutes for Senator Brownback and 5 minutes for Senator Enzi, and then \nperhaps Senator Graham can come after that.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I agree, if we can say after the Senators have spoken \nthen we go to my designee for a period of up to 30 minutes. Is that all \nright, since the Senator is going to have the next hour?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask unanimous consent that I have the hour from \n4:15 to 5:15, and then the Senator from California will have the next \n30 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is fine.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I propose that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. We are winding down.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this \nchart be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           AN INDEFENSIBLE GAP\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                               Gulf of\n                                     Colorado    New Mexico     Mexico\n     Sales month and company       sales price  sales price     (sales\n                                    ($/barrel)   ($/barrel)   price ($/\n                                                               barrel)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJanuary 1999\n  Independent....................        12.43        11.74        11.19\n  Integrated.....................        11.83         9.83        10.49\nFebruary 1999\n  Independent....................        11.97        11.53        10.93\n  Integrated.....................        11.36        10.16        10.35\nMarch 1999\n  Independent....................        14.60        14.09        13.01\n  Integrated.....................        14.08        11.13        12.77\nApril 1999\n  Independent....................        17.28        16.43        15.44\n  Integrated.....................        16.61        14.00        15.34\nMay 1999\n  Independent....................        17.80        17.20        16.65\n  Integrated.....................        17.11        15.83        15.94\n\n[[Page S11311]]\n\n \nJune 1999\n  Independent....................        18.16        (\\1\\)        16.21\n  Integrated.....................        17.31        16.62        16.04\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Not reported.\n \nOil Sales are from the same lease, same field, and same oil for six\n  months in 1999, for Colorado, New Mexico, and the Gulf of Mexico,\n  respectively.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, understanding the Senator from Michigan \nnow has about 9 minutes remaining, I want to ask him a couple of \nquestions.\n  First, I thank him very much for his contributions to this debate. I \nknow my friend from Michigan is very meticulous. He was interested in \nfinding a specific case to point to where oil was drilled on very \nsimilar lands very close to each other where the oil companies listed \ndifferent market prices. He asked the Interior Department for that. It \nwas a struggle to get it, and he got it.\n  I say to my friend, if he can hold up the ARCO chart, I want to try \nto translate what he has taught us in the specifics to the more \ngeneral, which is this: Does my friend from Michigan not conclude, \nafter his presentation, there is convincing evidence that a small \npercentage of the oil companies--namely, those that are integrated and \nwind up having the first point of sale essentially with themselves--\nhave been consistently undervaluing the price of the oil on which they \npay their royalties, and that, in fact, what happens then is that the \ntaxpayers who, as my friend has pointed out, own this land, it belongs \nto the people of the United States of America, thereby get cheated by \nthat differential? And that is explained on the chart. In other words, \nthe market price is continuously higher than the oil company's posted \nprice, the price on which these 5 percent of the companies pay the \nroyalties. Is that not a fair summary of what is happening?\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is what is happening. What the Interior Department \nhas done for me at my request is to take a look at situations, as the \nSenator from California said, where we have oil being drilled under the \nsame lease, the same field so we know it is the same quality oil, next \nto each other by two different companies, one of which is the 5 \npercent, the integrated company which is setting its own price, and the \nother by one of the independents, and to compare the market prices \nwhich are set on which the royalty is based.\n  I told them to give me typical examples. Do not pick and choose. Give \nme typical examples. The typical examples are on the chart. They show a \nrange of differences in sale prices from 10 cents minimum to $2.99 per \nbarrel. When you put that over the entire country for one company, you \ncome up with this kind of a situation where you have a market price the \nindependents are paying and then you have a posted price by an \nintegrated company, which is below that consistently.\n  It is wrong, and we have to end it. The Senator from California is \nleading an effort to end that. We ought to permit the Interior \nDepartment to complete its rulemaking process, and then, if a majority \nof this Congress thinks they have not done this properly, we have a way \nto override it. We are the final determinants, not the bureaucracy, and \nwe have that power.\n  We, obviously, do not want to see what this will result in because \nsome of us very clearly want this situation to continue. It is an \nunfair situation to the taxpayers. It is discriminatory against \ncompanies that pay royalties, by the way, based on arm's length market \nprice setting. It is not even fair to them. It is not fair to the \nStates that also get part of these resources.\n  We are not talking about a tax. This is not a business or an \nindividual being taxed. This is oil that is owned by the public.\n  The business is owned by an individual. It is a private business. The \noil being drilled is publicly owned oil. So there is a major difference \nbetween this and a tax.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I know my friend needs to run off. I ask unanimous \nconsent that I can finish up this portion of my time, and at 4:15 go to \nSenator Hutchison, if there is no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend, again, as he runs off to a very \nimportant meeting, and say he is so right. A royalty is not a tax; it \nis an agreement. It is a payment made by oil companies that have the \nprivilege of drilling on the property which belongs to the United \nStates of America. Those funds go to the Federal Treasury. Part of them \ngo to the State treasury, and they are used for environmental purposes \nand for purposes of education.\n  I would like to complete my time that remains at this point--\nreserving the remainder that I have. I have a long time left. I do not \nintend to use all of that time. I hope soon we will have a chance to \nmake an agreement when this would come to an end, this whole debate. We \nare not there yet. We are finding out how many colleagues want to come \nover.\n  But there was a comment made on the floor about the Senator from \nCalifornia by a few of my colleagues. I do not mind them saying \nwhatever they wish. I do not have any desire to stop them because I can \ntake care of myself. But I want to respond to the statements that were \nmade.\n  The point we have been making consistently on our side is that when \nthe oil companies do not pay their fair share of royalties, the \nTreasury is robbed of funds that are necessary for the environment and \nfor education. My colleagues said--particularly Senator Craig said; and \nhe did not give me the chance to respond, so I want to respond now--\nthat Senator Boxer here is complaining that the oil companies aren't \npaying their fair share of royalties, and yet she leads the fight \nagainst offshore oil drilling in her State--which, by the way, I am \nextremely proud he mentioned--and she does not want to cut down our \ntrees--which I am very happy to mention because I think that is our \nheritage.\n  The point is, that is not what this is about because this Senator \nfrom California wants a strong California economy. What that means is, \nyou preserve the forest, you preserve the beautiful redwood trees, you \npreserve the beautiful environment. Because if you allow indiscriminate \nand additional offshore oil drilling--we have plenty going on right \nnow. How many leases? Forty leases are being drilled. If we allow more, \nit destroys our economy.\n  Tourism is our No. 1 important economic resource, so if we destroy \nthat, we are done for. So by my fighting to limit offshore oil \ndrilling, by my fighting not to allow indiscriminate cutting down of \nbeautiful old-growth trees, I am, in fact, preserving the economy and \nincreasing the revenues that go to my State.\n  What are we left with? We are left with what the oil companies have \nto pay for the offshore oil tracts that they are drilling and the \nonshore oil tracts that they are drilling currently. This isn't an \nargument about new drilling. This isn't an argument about new cutting \ndown of trees. This is an argument about the status quo. We have many \nleases in California that are being drilled.\n  We expect the oil companies to be good public citizens. We expect the \noil companies to pay their fair share. The good news is that 95 percent \nof them are paying their fair share. Good for them. They are good \ncorporate citizens. They are doing the right thing. There are about 777 \noil companies that are doing the right thing, that are paying the fair \nmarket value. Unfortunately, there are about 44 companies that are not.\n  The Hutchison amendment, which is supported by the Senator from New \nMexico, and many others, allows those 44 companies to continue to \nunderpay this royalty payment. It is time to put a stop to this, my \nfriends. I hope we will do that. I am not very hopeful, in essence, \nthat this will happen, but maybe some people listening to this debate \nwill have a change of heart, and maybe in the vote we will get into the \n40s today. Maybe that will send a signal that this is a tough call.\n  I see my friend from New Mexico has come to the floor, and under the \nunanimous consent agreement, my friend from Texas now has full right to \ngive her time to anyone she wants at 4:15. So I yield the floor and get \nit back at 5:15.\n  I thank my colleagues for their patience.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Texas.\n\n[[Page S11312]]\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I yield up to 15 minutes to my colleague from New \nMexico, who is the cosponsor of this amendment and who is doing a super \njob of not only explaining this but also working on the balanced budget \nthat is so important for our country. In fact, the reason he has not \nbeen on the floor with me today is because he is working so hard to \nmake sure we do keep the balanced budget, that we do try to make sure \nwe are responsible stewards of the taxpayer dollars.\n  I commend him for all he does for our country and yield him up to 15 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I first thank Senator Hutchison for her \nkind remarks. I tell her, as cosponsor, what a pleasure it is to work \nwith her. We have been sponsor or cosponsor--depending on the year--of \nthis measure for the last 3 years. Hang in there, I say to the Senator. \nWe have not lost yet. We will not lose this time either because we are \nright.\n  I want to give a quick summary of the issues, as I see them. When you \nget right down to it, it isn't all that complicated.\n  First, we need to have new MMS regulations, but the regulations they \nsteadfastly insist on putting forth are fatally flawed. During the \nmoratorium that the Congress has imposed, several of us--Senators \nLandrieu, Nickles, Thomas, Hutchison, Enzi, Breaux, Murkowski, and \nothers--have tried to get the agency to fix the regulations, and they \nstubbornly refuse. In fact, at the request of the administration, we \nhave all sat around the table on at least two occasions, if not more, \nwith the MMS people and the oil people, sitting around talking about \nthe flaws in it, as the industry sees it. But they refuse to take care \nof the real problems and stubbornly insist they are right.\n  Procedurally, the regulation writing process has been tainted. Let me \nmake sure everybody understands that. People involved in writing the \nregulations were taking $350,000 payments from the Project on \nGovernment Oversight, POGO. When the procedure is contaminated, the \nbest way to proceed is to discard the tainted work product and start \nover. That is why we have a country with laws. Process is important. \nPeople writing regulations are not supposed to be paid by someone who \nhas an interest in the outcome.\n\n  Can you imagine if the Senate were debating an issue and the shoe was \non the other foot what we would be hearing here on the floor? If \nsomebody had taken money, in this case, from the oil or gas companies, \nthink where we would be. The whole process would be thrown out. We need \nto get to the bottom of the $350,000 payments from the Project on \nGovernment Oversight, which is known as POGO.\n  Senators Murkowski, Hutchison, Nickles, and I have written several \nletters to Secretary Babbitt on this issue. Because of the procedural \nirregularities alone, the moratorium should remain in place until \nsatisfactory answers are provided regarding the wrongdoing. It has been \nmonths, and we really have no satisfactory explanation.\n  That is absurd. No other description is accurate. These MMS \nregulations are unworkable, arbitrary, complicated, and beyond what \nthey ought to be. One producer with one well with one kind of oil would \nhave to value his oil in 10 different ways. There is no justification \nfor such complexity. It can only be labeled an abuse of power.\n  In addition, the MMS could even second guess, audit, and sue that \nproducer on seven different theories. This is a scheme that is \nunnecessarily complicated and plainly unworkable. We ought to be able \nto do better. Regardless of which industry is on the other side of \nthis, we ought to be able to do it better and make it workable. My \nconclusion is that these regulations are borderline absurd.\n  The proposed rules exceed the MMS authority. These regulations raise \nroyalty rates by imposing a nonexistent and recently quasi-judicially \nrejected duty to market. The proposed rules are premised on a rejected \nlegal theory called duty to market.\n  The relationship between the producer and the MMS is spelled out in \nthe lease. It is a concise document defining the responsibility and \nduties of the producer and the MMS. Oil is valued at the lease, period. \nThat is what the lease says. The lease is based upon statutory language \nin the law.\n  The Mineral Lands Act, 30 USC 226(b), which governs leases for \nonshore Federal lands, specifically states:\n\n       A lease shall be conditioned upon the payment of a royalty \n     rate of not less than 12.5 percent of amount or value of the \n     production removed or sold from the lease; [that is] at the \n     time the oil is removed from the well.\n\n  That is the definition.\n  The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, 43 USC 1331, et seq., governs \nFederal leases for drilling offshore. The act requires offshore leases \nto pay:\n\n       A royalty to the lessor on oil and gas . . . saved, removed \n     or sold from the lease.\n\n  By regulation, MMS wants to unilaterally rewrite the leases and the \nlaw and create a duty to market out of thin air. Duty to market is \nGovernment mooching because it wants to increase the royalty amount \nowed but will not allow a deduction for the costs incurred in getting \nthe higher price.\n  In other words, they would like the higher of the prices at the \nwellhead or at some other point. And if the higher one happens to be \ndownstream with a lot of costs involved in getting it there, they don't \neven want to permit you to deduct the cost of getting it from the \nwellhead to the downstream or upstream source. They want to get the \nhighest royalty and, thus, make the business swallow, without \ndeductibility, the cost of getting it there.\n\n  We don't do that anywhere in American capitalism. We don't do it in \nour IRS. We don't do it in simple, good CPA accounting procedures.\n  By analogy, under today's law, the MMS bases its royalty valuation on \nessentially the wholesale price for the oil. Under the proposed rule, \nthey are basing the royalty on the retail price, which is not \nauthorized by Federal law. The rule does not allow certain \ntransportation and other costs necessary to get the higher price to be \ndeducted from the royalty payment.\n  When I went to law school, I was taught that one party couldn't \nunilaterally change a contract. When I went to law school, regulations \nwere to implement, not rewrite, the law. Regulations were to be \nconsistent with the law. I was taught that agencies did not have the \nauthority to rewrite contracts through regulations. MMS lawyers must \nhave missed that week of law school because that is exactly what they \nare trying to do now. If MMS can change contracts through regulation, \nin direct violation of the law of the land, why can't other agencies do \nthe same?\n  For example, why can't Medicare unilaterally, without congressional \napproval, change its contract with Medicare recipients and say: You \nhave a duty to stay well; Medicare won't pay your Medicare bills \nbecause you breached your duty to stay well? That would be absurd, just \nas this new way of charging royalties is absurd.\n  If we allow MMS to change the royalty rate, there is nothing to keep \nthe IRS from saying: We want to get more money from American families. \nSo they will issue some complicated regulations and raise their taxes. \nThat would be a usurpation of the exclusive role of Congress. What MMS \nis trying to do is a usurpation of the exclusive jurisdiction of the \nCongress.\n  There is no duty to market in the lease. There is no court-ordered \nduty to market in the law of the land. It is a figment of the ``tax-\nraising imagination'' of MMS. They want to raise royalty rates, and \nthat is it. Creating a duty to market when none exists usurps the \nprerogatives of the Congress and ignores the precedents set by the \nDepartment's own review board.\n  In May, the Interior Board of Land Appeals, known as the IBLA, ruled \nthat there was no duty to market in a case known as Seagull Energy \nCorporation, Case No. 148 IBLA 3100 (1999). The IBLA has the expertise \nin these royalty cases. This was a 1999 case before the IBLA.\n  Secretary Babbitt reversed that in a case involving Texaco, Case No. \nMMS-92-0306-0 The Secretary unilaterally, and in direct \ncontravention of the moratorium imposed by this committee, overruled \nits own Board of Land Appeals.\n  I want to commend Senator Nickles for developing legislation to \nclarify the authority MMS has regarding oil royalty valuation. Simply \nstated--and I believe he is right--it stands for the proposition that \nthere has never been,\n\n[[Page S11313]]\n\nis not, nor ever shall be a duty to market. If you read a Federal oil \nand gas lease, there is no mention of a duty to market. It has been the \nMineral Management Service position that the duty to market is an \nimplied covenant in the lease. This legislation says the MMS is wrong. \nThat is what the legislation Senator Nickles has introduced, working \nits way through Congress, says.\n\n  Let me back up and explain the issue and why this legislation is \nneeded. Oil and gas producers doing business on Federal leases pay \nroyalties to the Federal Government based on fair market value. Under \nthis administration, this is easier said than done.\n  One of the longstanding disputes between Congress and the MMS has \nbeen the development of workable royalty valuation regulations that can \narticulate just exactly what fair market value is.\n  Cynthia Quarterman, former director of MMS, set out the Interior \nDepartment's position that fair market value includes a duty to market \nthe lease production for the mutual benefit of the lessee and the \nlessor but without the Federal Government paying its share of the \ncosts. Many of these costs are transportation costs, and they are \nsignificant. MMS calls it a duty to market. I believe it is the Federal \nGovernment mooching, trying to get paid without bearing its share of \nthe cost.\n  The bill states congressional intent: No duty to market; no Federal \nGovernment mooching.\n  Let me be clear: Where there is a duty to market, it is a matter \nexclusively within the jurisdiction of the Congress. It is not the job \nof lawyers at MMS to raise the congressionally set royalty rate through \nthe back door. The so-called duty to market is a backdoor royalty \nincrease, and there can be no doubt about it. The MMS has been unable \nto develop workable royalty valuation rules, and Congress has had to \nimpose a moratorium on these regulations. The core issue has been the \nduty to market, and I believe I have explained why this is a serious \nproblem.\n  Nobody is attempting to do anyone a favor. Nobody is attempting to be \nprejudicial toward the MMS and the Federal Government's tax take. What \nwe are talking about is simple, plain fairness. I won't say equity, \nbecause as a matter of fact it is law, not equity, that sets this. It \nis probably equitable also.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico \nbecause we have talked earlier about taxing expenses. That is exactly \nwhat he is talking about. The idea that we would introduce into tax \npolicy in this country the taxation of expenses is, A, outrageous, and, \nB, if it is going to be done, let us do it straight up; let us let \nCongress pass a law saying we are going to tax expenses. It won't just \nbe oil companies; it will be other companies as well.\n  Of course, I think that is a bad policy because I can't imagine we \nwould do something that would hurt our economy anymore. Nevertheless, \nif we are going to do it, it certainly shouldn't be done by a Federal \nagency that isn't accountable to anyone. I don't think Congress would \nbe doing its responsibility if we allowed that to happen without our \nimprimatur.\n  I thank the Senator from New Mexico for clarifying the duty to \nmarket.\n  It is a very important technical point that is just one more showing \nof why this is so unfair and why we must do something to correct it.\n  I want to make a quick announcement, and then I am going to yield up \nto 10 minutes to the senior Senator from Louisiana.\n  For the information of all Senators, the Senator from California and \nI have talked about how much longer this debate would go. It appears \nthat we have an agreement that we would be looking at two stacked votes \nbetween 6 and 6:15 tonight, one on the Hutchison amendment, and one on \nfinal passage of the Interior appropriations bill, which has been so \nably led by the occupant of the chair.\n  With that, I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from Louisiana, \nwho has been a great ally in this fight. There is nobody who \nunderstands the importance of oil jobs to our country and the stability \nof energy in our country than the senior Senator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for \nyielding. I appreciate it very much. I really wasn't going to say \nanything again. I thought I said enough on this issue. I think the \nSenate probably has debated far too long on this issue.\n  What is surprising to me is what the arguments have been about. I \ndon't think they are directly related to the issue at hand. I think it \nis important for us to try to understand what the issue is. Is it that \nwe don't like oil companies, or is the issue that we like the \nenvironment, or is the issue that we don't like education, or that we \ndo like education? No.\n  The issue is very simple and not complex at all. The law that was \npassed by the Congress--I was on the committee in the House that wrote \nthe bill in 1976. We wrote the OCS Lands Act of 1976. We determined at \nthat time that offshore oil companies that produce oil on Federal lands \nand the OCS would pay the General Treasury one-sixth of the value of \nthe oil. That is the law; it is one-sixth of the value of the oil.\n  We established that back in 1976. It was one-eighth before that. \nCompanies, every year, pay one-sixth of the fair market value of the \noil. That doesn't go to the Land and Water Conservation Fund. It goes \nto the General Treasury. Congress then appropriates that money to the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund, appropriates it for defense purposes, \nappropriates it for health purposes, and everything else Congress does.\n  That is what the companies have been paying every year--one-sixth of \nthe fair market value of the oil. Last year, they paid about $4.7 \nbillion, I think, in royalties for the right to produce that oil on \nFederal lands in our country.\n  Now, the issue is a very narrow issue. How do you determine what the \nfair market value of the oil is? It is even more narrow than that. It \nis what a company is entitled to deduct in determining that fair market \nvalue.\n\n  I listened intently to my good friend, the Senator from Michigan, \nwith his chart showing why independents paid one price and integrated \nmajor companies paid a different price for producing oil on the same \nadjacent leases. There is a very simple explanation of why that is the \nway it is. The Senator from Michigan would never argue with the fact \nthat if a Michigan automobile company built a car in Detroit and then \nsold that car in Louisiana, that Michigan automobile manufacturer would \nnot be able to add the cost of transporting that car to New Orleans to \nthe price he got for the vehicle. Of course, the big company would be \nable to do that. That would be part of the cost of doing business. He \nwould build the car in Michigan, transport it to New Orleans, sell it, \nand add the transportation cost to the price of the car. No one would \nthink that would be unusual.\n  The same principle affects oil companies, as well. In determining the \nfair market value, you find out where they sell it. A legitimate \ndeduction is transporting it to the place of the sale. The difference \nbetween the independent companies and the major companies in the same \narea is they sell it at different places. The independent will sell it \nwhen it comes out of the ground. He will sell it at the wellhead. An \nintegrated company would not sell it at the wellhead but would put the \noil in a transportation pipeline and send it to a point where it is \nsold down the line.\n  Would anybody argue that the cost of transporting the oil from the \ntime it is brought out of the ground to the time it is eventually sold \nis not a legitimate cost of producing and selling that product? Of \ncourse, not. Just as the cost of transporting that car from Michigan to \nNew Orleans is a legitimate cost of producing and selling it the first \ntime you have a sale; it is a legitimate add-on to the price of the \nproduct. So, too, is the cost of transporting the oil from the well to \nthe place of the first sale. It is a legitimate deduction for the cost \nof producing that product.\n  That is really what we are arguing about. The Department of the \nInterior and Minerals Management say they don't agree that a cost of \ntransporting it should be a legitimate deduction, or maybe some of it \nshould but not all of it. The companies say they think it all\n\n[[Page S11314]]\n\nshould be deductible. The MMS says just part of it. That is the fight.\n  This fight is not about education or welfare or defense. It is a very \nnarrow issue. The Senator from Texas is merely saying: Please, let's \nmake them talk a little bit more about trying to resolve this very \nnarrow issue. Oh, we can let the rule go through, and it is going to be \nlitigated from here to who knows where. That is going to cost the \nGovernment and the taxpayers and the companies a lot of money, and it \nis not going to resolve anything--certainly not in 12 months. We will \nbe in litigation in courts all over the country litigating what they \nthink is a legitimate deduction versus what the company thinks.\n  The Senator from Texas has suggested we pause for 12 months and say \nnegotiate out what is a legitimate deduction for transporting the oil \nfrom the time it is brought out of the ground to the time it reaches \nits first sale. There is nothing mysterious about that. We always argue \nwith companies about what is and is not legitimate. My State has sued \noil companies right and left, disagreeing on the interpretation of \na legitimate deduction. The issue is whether you are going to allow \ntransportation costs to be deducted or not. It is not whether or not \nyou like oil companies. Hate them; I don't care.\n\n  The question is simply fairness about what a legitimate deduction \nshould be with regard to determining the fair market value of the oil. \nOil companies have said: Let's put an end to this. We will give you the \noil and you sell it and determine the fair market value. The Government \nsays: No, we don't want to do that; we want you to market it and get a \nfair market value for it.\n  It is not a question about anybody lying, cheating, stealing, or \ntrying to rip off the Government, or anything else. Companies have an \nobligation to represent their stockholders and the millions of \nemployees they have. The Government has an obligation to be fair. The \nonly thing the amendment of the Senator from Texas says is, let's avoid \nlitigation and quit fighting.\n  It is unfortunate that we got into a debate about whether we like oil \ncompanies or not. That is not the issue. Oil companies have paid ever \nsince they have had production on Federal lands. Like I said, $4.7 \nbillion was paid just last year to the General Treasury, and rightfully \nso, as the cost of being able to produce energy on Federal lands. In my \nState and on other Federal lands around the coastal areas of this \ncountry, it will continue to be paid. It is a very narrow issue. This \nis not a monumental deal that we should be talking about. We should not \nbe involved in cloture votes and arguing about something that is \nrelatively so small.\n  Some of the Senators say $88 million is being lost. It is not being \nlost. It is a dispute as to whether it is a legitimate deduction or \nnot.\n  I think we eventually will pass the amendment and, hopefully, the oil \ncompanies will sit down in the offices of the Interior Department and \nnegotiate instead of meeting in courthouses and having to litigate. I \njust hope we can move on--adopt this measure and get on with the many \nother things that are more pressing than whether we should deduct \ntransportation costs or not.\n  That is the only issue that is on the table. You can talk about \nanything else, but the issue is only what are legitimate transportation \ncosts from the time the oil comes out of the ground to the time it is \nsold at the first sale. I suggest that this is not something that you \ntie up the Senate for as long as it has been. It should be negotiated \nout by technicians, lawyers, but it should be negotiated, not \nlitigated.\n  I thank the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Louisiana. I \nthink he has shown exactly what the problem is, why what is being \nproposed is so unfair, and why we on a bipartisan basis have said to \nthe MMS: We want you to go back to the drawing board, and we want you \nto do something that is fair, simple and understandable, and then we \nwill be supportive.\n  I thank him for his leadership in this area.\n  Mr. President, I yield up to 10 minutes for the distinguished Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, the assistant majority leader, Mr. Nickles.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first, I compliment my colleague from \nTexas, Senator Hutchison, for outstanding work on this issue, and also \nseveral other people who have spoken on the issue, including Senator \nDomenici and Senator Gramm from Texas.\n  I have been a little disappointed in the tenor of the debate by \npeople on the other side of this issue. In the Senate, we certainly \nhave the right to have disagreements on issues, but in some cases \nsometimes debate is not a credit to the Senate. Everyone is entitled to \ntheir own opinion. But certainly some of the insinuations that have \nbeen made on the floor today--that people are doing this because they \nowe big oil or they received contributions--is very offensive to this \nSenator. I think Senators need to be very cognizant of the rules of the \nSenate not to impugn the integrity or the intentions of Senators.\n  In 1996, this Congress passed legislation called the Royalty Fairness \nand Simplification Act by an overwhelming margin with bipartisan \nsupport in the Senate. I sponsored the bill and it was supported by \nDemocrats and signed by President Clinton. The purpose of that \nlegislation was to simplify the royalty process.\n  The MMS rule proposal flies in the face of that action. The President \nsigned the bill in 1996. The proposal now put out by the MMS is the \nopposite, it is not a simplification.\n  If you look at this chart, you can see that this rule is not \nworkable. To insinuate that people who oppose this rule are beholding \nto big oil, or they are against schoolkids is wrong.\n  The MMS proposal on royalties simply will not work and to state on \nthe floor that it is going to waste millions of dollars, and we are \ndepriving kids is not factual.\n  If this rule goes into effect, it will be an invitation for \nlitigation. Instead of the States getting more money, or cities getting \nmore money, they will get more litigation. The attorneys handling the \ncases might make more money.\n  Then they imply that maybe they have evidence from whistleblowers \nshowing intent to deceive. We know there are whistleblowers. In the \nrecent case where one ``whistleblower'' testified, I hate to tell you \nthat before a jury trial in Long Beach it was decided against the \nplaintiffs, against the city of Long Beach against the supposed \nwhistleblower. That was a 14-year case. There have been three \ndecisions, all of which big oil won. I doubt that the jury was trying \nto decide the case in favor of big oil. It so happens the jury decided \nthat the claimants in this case were wrong.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question \non that very point?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am happy to yield.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, we have heard so much rhetoric on the \nSenate floor about a former ARCO employee who testified that the oil \ncompanies were trying to cheat the State of California and the Federal \nGovernment. In fact, that ARCO employee was the very same person who \nwas involved in the Long Beach lawsuit about which the Senator is \nspeaking. I ask the Senator if it isn't true that the jurors rejected \nhis testimony?\n  Mr. NICKLES. The Senator is exactly right. I appreciate the \nclarification. That is the point I am making. When you hear the \nopponents of this amendment basing almost everything on this \ndisgruntled employee, it just doesn't make sense. I didn't sit in on \nthe case. I wasn't a juror. I was not involved in this case of 14 \nyears. But I know the Exxon company won. Big oil won. The jurors \ndecided that this disgruntled employee wasn't telling the truth, or \ndidn't have a case.\n  When you look at the MMS proposed royalty scheme, you can say \nmistakes have been made. I will promise you that if we pass this MMS \nproposal as it now stands before us, you will have more litigation, \nmore mistakes. It is an invitation for litigation. Sure, there will be \nsome settlements and some wins and some losses. But this is not a \nworkable situation.\n\n  I will mention that the present law is not as good as it should be \nand we certainly shouldn't make it worse. You shouldn't be changing the \nrules of the game and changing contracts. Every law of the land says \nroyalty is based on\n\n[[Page S11315]]\n\nthe value of oil at the lease. Now you have the MMS saying: Let's \ninclude ``duty to market.'' What does that mean? We have had 50 years \nor more of experience--ever since we have been producing oil. We have \nthe experience of collecting royalties based on the value of the oil at \nthe lease. We don't know what ``duty to market'' means.\n  This is something new from the Clinton administration that I will \nassure you, if it becomes law will create more problems. If it does go \ninto effect, two things will be wrong: One, MMS is not supposed to make \nlaw. We are the legislators. We are supposed to be the ones who make \nthe law and not some unelected bureaucrat at MMS. It shouldn't become \nlaw, period. If this rule becomes final and is implemented, it wouldn't \nraise more money. It would create more litigation.\n  What I want on royalties is for them to be fair and simple and for \nthe companies to pay exactly what they owe--no more, no less. The \nroyalty rate is 12\\1/2\\ percent. If we want to raise it to 13 or 14 \npercent, that is a decision this Congress can make.\n  But to say we are going to keep the same percentage, yet we are going \nto have a new obligation called ``duty to market,'' which includes \nmarketing the oil away from the lease and other new obligations--which \nare kind of hard to define--but, we will try to work that out. There is \nsome ambiguity. It is an invitation to litigation. All that will happen \nis that the lawyers will make more money.\n  Speaking of lawyers, I want to raise one other thing. It is very \ntroublesome to me to think that you have two Federal employees--one now \na former Federal employee--actually getting paid $350,000 for their \ninvolvement in this issue. They were somewhat involved in implementing \nthis rule.\n  Think of this. Here you have individuals involved in writing the \nrule. These same people help groups that sue these companies, or sue on \nbehalf of the Government, and get paid a bunch of money--Federal \nemployees. Are we going to allow IRS agents to get a percentage of the \ntake if they go after some big company? If they get a big settlement, \nare two or three employees supposed to get a percentage of that? That \nsounds like corruption to me. We have had two people that received \n$350,000 and we have an administration that wouldn't even say it was \nwrong.\n  This is the most corrupt administration in U.S. history. Yesterday we \nhad the FBI testify that this administration completely thwarted their \nefforts to investigate campaign finance abuses. We had an FBI agent who \nserved for 25 years who said never in his history did he have an \ninvestigation in which he was not thwarted, time and time again, by the \nJustice Department during this administration.\n  In addition to that we have an administration that grants clemency to \n16 terrorists, while the FBI and others said: Don't do it. These are \nterrorists. They are a threat to the United States.\n  Did the administration listen to the FBI? No. Did they even consult \nwith the FBI? The FBI said no.\n  That was a mistake. This administration's corruption, including two \nemployees who were involved in this rulemaking and ended up getting \npaid $350,000, is deplorable. It is despicable. It shouldn't be \napplauded. It shouldn't be rewarded.\n  But most importantly, article I of the Constitution says that \nCongress shall pass the laws and says Congress shall raise the taxes. \nIt doesn't say unelected bureaucrats at MMS can rewrite the rules, \nraise royalty rates, or raise taxes. They do not have that right. That \nbelongs to elected officials. Then if we do a bad job, people can kick \nus out. They can vote us down. They can say: We don't like the laws you \npassed. What recourse do they have against unelected bureaucrats? None.\n  There is a reason our forefathers gave us this system of government. \nThey gave us a good system of government, and we should never allow \nsome bureaucracy the opportunity to set rules and regulations that \ngives them the force and the power to raise taxes.\n  Should we have royalties that are fair? Yes. Should we have royalties \nthat are accurate and a royalty system that people can understand? You \nbet. Should people pay exactly what they owe? Certainly.\n  Members might wonder where I am getting my information. I am chairman \nof the subcommittee, and we held a hearing regarding this issue. We had \na lot of experts in the field saying this is not workable. It is not \nthe money. It is not the money in any way, shape, or form.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma. I \nam very pleased he covered some of those issues.\n  We have heard a lot about the lawsuit and especially the employees of \nthe Federal Government directly involved with this rulemaking taking \n$350,000 each from an organization called POGO. That does not pass the \nsmell test. I am very pleased the Senator from Oklahoma pointed that \nout. That is another reason this rule needs to go back to the drawing \nboard. That is not the American way.\n  I am happy to yield up to 15 minutes to the Senator from Montana, \nSenator Burns, who has been very active in this debate and who \nunderstands from a small businessman's point of view how important it \nis we have fairness in taxation in our country.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Texas. I also want \nto say it might not pass the smell test; it doesn't even pass the \ngiggle test.\n  I want to drop back a little bit, away from the rhetoric we have \nheard, and look at it from a practical point of view. We have heard a \nlot about big oil ripoff. What are folks in California paying for \ngasoline today? Do you think the oil companies are going to pay that? \nNo, they are not going to pay it. The consumer is going to pay it. The \npeople who buy the gasoline and the petroleum products are going to pay \nit. Big oil, little oil, or whatever is not going to pay that. Do you \nthink they will eat this and swallow it? Get a life.\n  One of these days, we are going to be hit by a big bolt of common \nsense around here and we will not be able to handle it.\n  Let's step back and think. I know the Senator from California is \nconcerned about schools and children. I want her to come to \nMusselshell, MT. The first oil was discovered in Montana in that \ncounty--very active. A lot of it is on public lands. Then we kept \ngetting tougher and tougher, and pretty soon the oil industry left the \ncounty. We are closing schools because there are no kids to attend. \nNobody is making a paycheck.\n  Let's take a look and see what happens. Yes, the Government holds \nthose lands in trust. They are public lands. Does the Government invest \none penny in the drilling or the exploration of that resource? It does \nnot. Does it buy any of the licenses? Does it offer any of the \nequipment? Does it pay any of the people to drill and to take the \nchance there may be oil here and there may not be? If there isn't, does \nthe Government pay for the loss? Not a penny.\n  A deal was struck. If we find oil there, the companies say: We will \ngive the Government one-eighth ownership in that well. That means one \nout of every eight buckets that comes out of the ground in crude \nbelongs to the Government, and it sells it wherever it wants to sell. \nIf they don't like the price they are getting from the refinery, I \nsuggest they can take a truck out there next to the well, and every \neighth bucket that comes up, put that eighth bucket in their truck, and \nthey can take it anywhere and sell it anywhere they want, and they will \nget market for it. There are a lot of buyers for it.\n  That was the deal. That is getting your product or your royalty at \nthe wellhead, as called for by law.\n  Now we have some folks who say: That is not good enough; we want the \nretail price. In other words, we don't want to pay any of the \ntransportation, we don't want to pay any of the refining, we don't want \nto pay all of the costs, but we want the end result.\n  That is not the deal. This other is put together by law. That law is \nbeing changed by an unelected representative who wouldn't be known to \nmy constituency if he or she walked out today.\n  Who gets hurt by this change? It is not big oil. They don't get hurt \nbecause they will pass the cost on to the consumer.\n\n[[Page S11316]]\n\n  Again, I want to know what they are paying per gallon of gasoline in \nCalifornia. It is pretty high out in my State, too.\n  Do you know who gets hurt? It is the little guy. It slows down their \nability for capital formation, for exploration, and then when they find \nit, they are taxed more for it. They want to rewrite the law.\n  An independent producer will have to pay a higher tax. I want that in \nall capital letters--T-A-X. That is what royalty essentially is. Then \nthey will still have to compete with the low price of foreign oil.\n  America, if you think you are secure tonight, 55 percent of our oil \ncomes now from offshore. More and more public lands are being cut off \nfrom exploration due to some whacky laws and some people who do not \nunderstand the business. They do it in the name of the environment. Use \ncommon sense. Those folks who want to shut off the oil supply in this \ncountry don't know what lines are and don't know what an economy can't \ndo if we have no oil.\n  A while ago they talked about ethanol. I support the ethanol \nsituation. It is renewable. It is clean. We still have some problems \nwhen temperatures get extremely low, as they do in Montana, but \nnonetheless it is an alternative. I support the tax credits for \nethanol.\n  A tax is essentially what a royalty is. The end result is that the \nlittle man can't do it; he simply cannot make a living. When times are \nlooking better for domestic oil, the Federal Government comes rushing \nin and raises the cost of production.\n  I can remember when Billings, MT, was pretty active with independent \noil people, from land leasers to exploration to drillers. Those folks \nare just about all gone, because they have driven all of the little \npeople away. They have closed off the lands that might have, and do \nhave, great prospects for oil and gas reserves.\n  Oil prices are not that strong. Have they stabilized? No, I don't \nthink so. In fact, I will tell you now, no commodity is making money in \nthis country. I don't care if you are talking about oil or products \nthat come from mining or timber or farms; it does not make any \ndifference. The spread between what we get at the production level and \nwhat is happening at the retail level is unbelievable.\n  I will give you an example. If you want to go buy some Wheaties in \nyour grocery store, it will cost you $3.75 to $4 a pound for Wheaties. \nThink about it. We cannot get $2.25 for a 60-pound bushel of wheat. \nSomething is wrong.\n  The same thing happens here because everybody has to have a little \nbigger piece in the process from where you take it from Mother Earth, \nwho gives us all new wealth. The only place new wealth is produced is \nfrom Mother Earth. That is true to the time it gets to the consumer. \nEverybody has to have a bigger piece. Now the Federal Government comes \nalong and says: I think we need a little more, too, because we need to \ncollect some more taxes. We need to build a bigger bureaucracy. That is \nnot the way we do business.\n  Let's look at the royalty increase and put it in perspective of the \nentire industry. Oil prices still are not strong. Domestic oil \nproduction is still down. The industry is still hurting. Jobs are still \nbeing threatened. But our paycheck does not come from the oil patch, so \nwe do not get excited. Our check comes every 2 weeks, just like \nclockwork. We risk not much--a little time. That is about all. Then all \nat once we are insensitive to those people who really power our \neconomy--tax them again.\n  I want to bring back to our attention what Senator Hutchison pointed \nout earlier. This cost will be passed on to the American consumers. You \nare kidding yourself if you do not believe it. Montanans rely on their \nprivate vehicles to get around. It is 148,000 square miles from Alzada, \nMT, to Eureka, MT. It is further than from here to Chicago, IL. We know \nwhat spaces are and we also know what it costs to drive them.\n  We also have reserves in oil and gas, and if you keep raising these \ncosts, the opportunity to get those reserves becomes more diminished \nevery day. So while the Senator from California contends she is saving \nall this royalty money for the taxpayer, the person who actually knows \nthe system tells us they will get less revenues during the period of \nchaos that will ensue as they try to sort out the flawed MMS proposal. \nOur income to the Treasury will go down; it will not be more.\n  I have a letter from the Office of the Governor of Montana. I ask \nunanimous consent to have that letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                           Office of the Governor,\n\n\n                                             State of Montana,\n\n                                   Helena, MT, September 13, 1999.\n     Hon. Conrad Burns,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Bldg.,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Burns: I am writing to express this \n     administration's support for the Hutchinson amendment to the \n     Department of Interior Appropriation Bill which would extend \n     the moratorium on Minerals Management Service (MMS) rule \n     making.\n       The complexity and uncertainty inherent in the proposed MMS \n     rules may be a disincentive for industry, especially \n     Montana's independent producers, to lease and produce oil and \n     gas from federal lands. Such a disincentive will negatively \n     impact the production of oil and gas, within Montana, \n     resulting in less royalty revenue for the state.\n       The moratorium will provide additional time for all \n     interested parties to develop a fair, workable and efficient \n     plan to collect federal royalties. During this additional one \n     year moratorium, all parties must work in earnest toward the \n     successful conclusion of this issue.\n       Thank you for your support and understanding.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Mick Robinson,\n                                               Director of Policy.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Reading a portion:\n\n       The complexity and uncertainty inherent in the proposed MMS \n     rules may be a disincentive for the industry . . .\n       The moratorium will provide additional time for all \n     interested parties to develop a fair, workable and efficient \n     plan to collect federal royalties.\n\n  In the meantime, royalties are lost. So let's get struck by a bolt of \ncommon sense. Let's quit being moon-eyed horses and jumping at shadows \nand the paper bag that blows out from the fence row. This is bad policy \nand we should not allow this to happen. I do not think the Senate \nshould. I congratulate my friend from Texas for being the champion on \nthis.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Montana \nbecause he has made a very important point from the independent \nproducers' standpoint. We have seen independent producers go out of \nbusiness at a greater rate than ever in the history of our country in \nthe last year because oil prices were so low they could not keep their \nemployees and they had to go out of business. They could not afford to \ndrill because their costs were higher than the price they could get.\n  The Senator from Montana so ably represents that small businessman, \nthat small businesswoman who is out there in the field, working so hard \nto make ends meet, trying not to let his or her employees go in a bad \ntime.\n  Now we have a situation where we could be putting the last nail in \nthe coffin of those who are left. So I am very pleased he talked about \nthe independents and small producers. I am going to talk a little bit \nmore about that because it has been said in this debate that we are \nonly talking about 5 percent, the big oil companies. But that is not \nthe case.\n  In fact, the small oil companies, the independent producers, have \nwritten letters to us, to me, saying: Please do not let this happen. \nThis is going to affect our ability to say the price we are actually \ngetting at the wellhead will not actually be what we are taxed on. That \nis what the new rule would do. It would say to the independent producer \nthat it doesn't matter what you actually are getting at the wellhead, \nif someone pulls up and takes their oil right out of the ground. You \nhave to pay a tax on what we say is the market price. We are going to \ngo to the New York Mercantile Exchange to determine the price. We do \nnot care if it is Odessa, TX. If we say the price is $22 and you are \ngetting $21, you are going to pay a tax on $22. Is this America? My \nheavens.\n\n  These are the companies affected by this new MMS rule, and it is 100 \npercent of every company drilling, every company, small and large, that \nis going to have second-guessing of the prices, that is going to have \nindexing to the New York Mercantile Exchange, regardless of where they \nare, in Arkansas or West Virginia or Texas or Arizona.\n\n[[Page S11317]]\n\n They will not be held to the determinations they make. So a small, \nindependent producer who doesn't have a staff of lawyers isn't going to \nbe able to say: OK, we have sold for $21 at the wellhead in Odessa, TX, \nand therefore, anyone else selling at the wellhead in Odessa, TX, take \nyour chances. We may or may not say it is the same price. So every \nindependent is affected.\n  I appreciate the Senator from Montana pointing that out. Now I yield \nup to 5 minutes to the Senator from Kansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Hutchison \namendment to continue the moratorium on the Minerals Management Service \nrule. I thank her for the courageous work she has been doing on this \nissue. I want to speak to this from the standpoint of a State that has \na number of small, independent oil producers. That is what we have in \nKansas.\n  I want to address a couple issues: No. 1, the perspective of the \nsmall, independent oil producers. I guess the dominant debate has been \nabout big oil. I want to talk about small, independent oil producers \nsuch as we have.\n  The second issue is we not become more dependent on foreign oil. We \nget 60 percent, actually more than 60 percent, from foreign sources, \nand we do not want to drive more of that production overseas.\n  A third issue is a matter of priority to this body, and that is that \nwe not let our duty to legislate be overtaken by a nonlegislative body. \nI appreciate the Senator from Texas bringing these issues to the \nforefront so we could debate them and talk about them on the Senate \nfloor and, hopefully, get some sanity in this system.\n  Our oil producers are just recovering from some of the lowest prices \nin 30 years. That has cost the oil and gas industry more than 67,000 \nAmerican jobs, a number of those in Kansas, and saw the closure of more \nthan 200,000 oil and gas wells. That is the recent situation.\n  A hike in the royalty rates will make a bad situation worse and could \ncause more domestic oil production to go overseas. At a time when we \nalready are getting so much of it from overseas, to increase our \ndependency even more is a really ridiculous idea.\n  It is up to Congress and not Federal agencies to establish public \npolicies is my second point. The MMS clearly exceeded its authority by \nproposing to raise royalty rates without congressional authorization. \nNo congressional committee or affected industry groups were notified \nbefore the final version of the rule was announced. The MMS has also \ntried to get around the congressional moratorium by changing Federal \nlease forms and taking other measures that are similar to the \nprohibited rule. These reckless actions have led me to believe that \nthis agency is out of control, and it has led a number of our small, \nindependent producers in Kansas not to trust this agency, or the sort \nof template they are setting up in the industry that is going to cost \nthem more and cost more jobs and cost more oil production in this \ncountry and in Kansas.\n  I do believe the current royalty rate valuations are fundamentally \nflawed and should be changed.\n  The regulations proposed by the MMS will increase the amount of the \nroyalties to be paid by assessing royalties on downstream values \nparticularly, without full consideration of the costs on that small \nindependent producer in Kansas who is just now digging out of some of \nthe lowest prices in 30 years, all the jobs they have lost, and all the \nwells that have been plugged. And we are saying at this point in time: \nWe really do not care for you; we want to just shove these additional \ncosts on you and hurt you more, even though you are just now starting \nto climb out of the worst situation in 30 years.\n  Goodness, we ought to think a little bit down the road ourselves and \nsay: Is it wise that we do this on the small independent producer \nstruggling to make a living, who wants to help support the United \nStates and our energy needs of this country, and we do this now? I do \nnot think that is wise at all.\n  Finally, my point is, it is the responsibility of Congress to make \npolicy decisions, not the MMS. Royalty rates are our responsibility. \nWe, the Senate, have been elected by our constituents to make these \ndifficult decisions, and we should not have our authority preempted by \nFederal bureaucrats. Some people may not like that conclusion, but that \nis the way it is. We are the policymakers. We are the people who should \nset these rates, not a Federal bureaucracy that is not elected, that is \na nonlegislative body. That is what is taking place.\n  In the short time I have, I thank my colleague from Texas for the \ngreat work she is doing on defending freedom, defending small \nindependent oil and gas producers, defending us from becoming more \ndependent on foreign oil, and also defending the Senate's right to \nestablish public policy, and not a nonlegislative body.\n  I hope as well that people who are debating and tying notions of \nother considerations into this issue will step back and think for a \nsecond. Everybody I know in this body acts with integrity and honor, \nand that should not be attacked on some sort of unsubstantiated basis. \nPeople here do act with honor and with integrity.\n  There are differences of opinion on this issue. Mine, from the \nperspective of Kansas, is that we need to be setting this, and not the \nMMS.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I believe under the agreement I have the \ntime now for 30 minutes; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct, at 5:15. There are 3 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am prepared to let the Senator start \nher time now. For Senators who are looking at our timetable, we have \npretty much agreed we are looking at perhaps a 6 o'clock vote; 6 to \n6:15, but we are pushing closer to 6.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I think we can get this done. Let me start.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have seen so many tears on behalf of the \nmom-and-pop oil companies that will be impacted if the Department of \nthe Interior can do their job and collect the fair royalties. I looked \nat my chart again to make sure I was not misunderstanding. I will talk \nabout the top seven companies that will be impacted by this rule:\n  Shell: Their total revenues are $29 billion. I cannot remember when \nthey were mom and pop. Maybe someday way back they were.\n  Exxon: The real mom and pop, $134 billion in revenues.\n  Chevron: $43 billion in revenues.\n  Texaco: $45 billion in revenues.\n  Marathon: $16 billion in revenues.\n  Mobil Exploration and Production, U.S.: $81 billion.\n  Conoco: $20 billion.\n  And it goes on.\n  The good news is that the small oil companies my friend from Kansas \ntalked about are doing the right thing. Ninety-five percent of the oil \ncompanies are doing the right thing and paying their fair share of \nroyalties. It is 5 percent of the companies, the largest companies, the \nvertically integrated companies, that are failing to pay their fair \nshare.\n  When we see these tears for the oil companies, I assure my friends, \nthe small companies are doing the right thing; they are paying their \nfair share. It is the big ones that are not. We know they are involved \nin a deliberate scheme. We have that in testimony. All we are trying to \ndo is stop them from continuing to rip off the taxpayers.\n  The Hutchison amendment so far has lost taxpayers $88 million. This \none will lose them $66 million. That is $154 million, and there is no \nend in sight. If you think this one will not be back next year--I don't \nknow. We know the Senator originally had a much longer period of time \non her amendment. She cut it back to about a year, but this thing has \nno end. This is the fourth time it has come up. There is no effort to \nresolve this situation.\n  I want to talk about some of the comments made by some of my \ncolleagues, and I ask that the Record show Democrats lodged no \nobjection when the Senator from Oklahoma started to talk about the \nPresidential pardon of a few weeks ago. What does that have to do with \nthis? We did not object. He made his point. It was fine. We know when \nyou start talking about\n\n[[Page S11318]]\n\nsomething off the topic, it is because you really are using the debate \ntime. We are happy. You can talk about what you want.\n  But five times the Senator from Wisconsin was interrupted when he \ntried to tie this amendment to oil company contributions. He did not do \nthat; the New York Times did it. USA Today, which I would like to show, \ndid it. The Los Angeles Times tied oil contributions to this amendment. \nAnd then, oh, they were shocked and Republican colleagues tried to stop \nSenator Feingold from talking about it.\n  I will read what USA Today says. They say:\n\n       Big oil has contributed more than $35 million to national \n     political committees and congressional candidates . . . a \n     modest investment in protecting the royalty-pricing \n     arrangement that's enabled the industry to pocket an extra $2 \n     billion.\n\n  Senator Feingold was simply talking about what USA Today talked about \nand what the New York Times on September 20 talked about. I will read \nwhat they say. New York Times:\n\n         Battle Waged in the Senate Over Royalties by Oil Firms\n\n       Oil companies drilling on Federal land have been accused of \n     habitually underpaying royalties they owe the Government. \n     Challenged in court, they have settled lawsuits, agreeing to \n     pay $5 billion.\n       The Interior Department wants to rectify the situation by \n     making the companies pay royalties based on the market price \n     of the oil, instead of on a lower price set by the oil \n     companies themselves.\n\n  They say:\n\n       A simple issue? Not in the United States Senate.\n\n  And they track oil company contributions.\n  All I can say is, it is a legitimate thing to talk about, but five \ntimes the Senator from Wisconsin was interrupted making the point.\n  I also want to respond to the fact that royalties are not a tax. If \nthey were a tax, they would be in the Finance Committee. Royalties are \nan agreement the oil companies sign voluntarily for the privilege of \ndrilling on land that belongs to the people of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  And for that privilege, they pay a small portion over to us, the \ntaxpayers, to be used for parks and recreation, historical \npreservation, and in the States for education. Royalties are not a tax. \nIf they were a tax, it would be in the Finance Committee.\n  Let me also thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for \nbringing up the States. They argue for States rights day in and day \nout. You know what. I agree with them on this one. Let's hear what the \nStates are saying.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter I just \nreceived--or that just came to my attention--from the Western States \nLand Commissioners Association.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                The Western States\n\n\n                               Land Commissioners Association,\n\n                                                    July 29, 1999.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Lott and Daschle: We, the undersigned members \n     of the Western States Land Commissioners Association, urge \n     you to assure that the Interior Appropriations Bill, S. 2466, \n     will allow the Department of Interior to Implement new \n     federal royalty crude oil pricing regulations. The \n     Department's proposed regulations would ensure that oil \n     companies would pay no more and no less than fair market \n     value for federal royalty oil. S. 2466 includes a provision \n     that would continue the ban on implementing the proposed \n     regulations until after June 30, 2001. This delay is costing \n     taxpayers $5 million per month.\n       Most of the state agencies that are members of the Western \n     States Land Commissioners Association have a strong interest \n     in ensuring that oil companies pay the market value of \n     federal royalty oil. The member states of the Association use \n     their share in the revenues to support schools and other \n     beneficiaries. The failure of the oil companies to pay market \n     value for federal royalty crude reduces the revenues obtained \n     by the federal government and the states.\n       The Department's Mineral Management Service (MMS) has been \n     eminently fair in proposing its new regulations. MMS has held \n     numerous public and private meetings for over two and a half \n     years to allow the industry to comment and the industry has \n     filed over two thousand pages of comments. Based on industry \n     concerns, MMS has revised its proposed regulations a number \n     of times to take into account industry's suggestions and \n     criticisms. For example, MMS has revised its proposed \n     regulations to recognize regional differences, particularly \n     for the Rocky Mountain Area.\n       The proposed MMS regulations are very reasonable. If oil \n     companies sell royalty crude on arm's-length transactions, \n     they pay on the basis of prices they receive. If they do not \n     sell the oil on arm's-length transactions, they pay on the \n     basis of prices at market centers, adjusted for location and \n     quality differences, which are universally recognized to \n     result from competition among innumerable buyers and sellers.\n       Oil companies presently use their posted prices to value \n     royalty oil. Posted prices are unilaterally set by individual \n     oil companies less than the market value of those crudes. In \n     contrast, the market prices proposed by MMS to value royalty \n     crude not sold by arm's-length transactions are set by \n     innumerable buyers and sellers and are publicly reported on a \n     daily basis.\n       MMS' proposed switch from posted prices to market prices is \n     not a radically new concept:\n       1. The State of Alaska uses the spot price of Alaska North \n     Slope crude oil quoted for delivery in the Los Angeles Basin \n     as the basis for royalties;\n       2. ARCO, since the early 1990s, uses spot prices as the \n     basis of payments of royalties throughout the country; and\n       3. The State of Texas/Chevron and State of Texas/Mobil \n     settlements rely on the use of spot prices for royalty \n     valuation purposes. Mobil settled for $45 million--a case \n     brought by the United States Department of Justice that Mobil \n     had underpaid federal royalties throughout the United States.\n       The Department's comprehensive proposal is the logical \n     alternative to posted prices.\n           Sincerely,\n         Paul Thayer, Executive Officer, California State Lands \n           Commission; Ray Powell, M.S., D.V.M., Commissioner of \n           Public Lands, New Mexico State Land Office; M. Jeff \n           Hagener, Trust Land Administrator, Montana Department \n           of Natural Resources and Conservation; Curt Johnson, \n           Commissioner, South Dakota Office of School and Public \n           Lands; Charlie Daniels, Commissioner, Arkansas \n           Commissioner of State Lands; Robert J. Olheiser, North \n           Dakota Commissioner of University and School Lands; \n           Jennifer M. Belcher, Commissioner, Washington State \n           Department of Natural Resources; Douglas LaFollette, \n           Board Chair and Secretary of State, Wisconsin Board of \n           Commissioners of Public Lands; Mark W. Davis, Minerals \n           Director, Colorado State Board of Land Commissioners.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. This letter is signed by the State Lands Commissioners \nfrom these States: California, South Dakota, New Mexico, Arkansas, \nMontana, Washington State, Colorado, and Wisconsin. That is a sample. \nThat is just this letter.\n  What do they want? They want the Interior Department to be able to \ncorrect this problem. They oppose the Hutchison amendment, these people \nfrom these States.\n  We also have comments by the Commissioner of the Alaska Department of \nNatural Resources, who says:\n\n       The approach taken by MMS [Department of Interior's \n     Minerals Management Service] . . . will better protect \n     Alaska's interests.\n\n  They oppose the Hutchison amendment.\n  We heard from the Arkansas Commissioner of State Lands in a letter to \nSenators Lott and Daschle:\n\n       The Department's comprehensive proposal is the logical \n     alternative to posted prices.\n\n  They oppose the Hutchison amendment.\n  California, the city of Long Beach:\n\n       I urge you . . . to support [MMS] regulations . . .\n\n  They oppose the Hutchison amendment.\n  Colorado, Mark Davis, Minerals Director:\n\n       This delay is costing taxpayers $5 million per month.\n\n  He opposes the Hutchison amendment.\n  Louisiana:\n\n       To sum up, [the department in Louisiana] is supportive of \n     MMS' attempt to value . . . production in a more certain, \n     timely, and accurate manner . . . .\n\n  Montana, a letter from the Supervisor of the Federal Royalty Program:\n\n       . . . Montana believes that the rule is ready and should be \n     finalized.\n\n  That was in 1998.\n  New Mexico:\n\n       It is our fervent hope that Congress will act so as not to \n     extend the current moratorium prohibiting the Department of \n     Interior from issuing a final rulemaking.\n\n  North Dakota: This is from Robert Olheiser, North Dakota Commissioner \nof University and School Lands, in a letter to Senators Lott and \nDaschle:\n\n       The Department's Minerals Management Service has been \n     eminently fair in proposing [these] regulations.\n\n\n[[Page S11319]]\n\n\n  It goes on.\n  We have a letter from Texas. We have a letter from South Dakota, \nWashington, Wisconsin.\n  I see that my friend from Florida is on the floor. I will stop when \nhe is prepared to begin his remarks.\n  Let me just say at this time--and then I will make concluding \narguments when the Senator from Florida has completed in the remainder \nof the time--that we have a problem on our hands with 5 percent of the \noil companies.\n  We have to do justice. We have to do what is right. We have to listen \nto the whistleblowers who are risking themselves to come out and tell \nus there are schemes going on to deprive taxpayers of these royalty \npayments. We have to do the right thing. We have to listen to the \nStates, the Consumer Federation of America--and how many groups? more \nthan 50 groups--that stand in the public interest and say no to the \nHutchison amendment.\n  Now I yield the remainder of the time until a quarter of to the good \nSenator from Florida, Mr. Bob Graham.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Senator.\n  I appreciate this opportunity to make a few remarks on the issues \nbefore us today, which I think has three component parts.\n  The first relates to just what is involved in the change that has \nbeen recommended by the Department of the Interior, the change the \namendment offered today would frustrate.\n  I see we have the principal author of the amendment on the floor, and \nso I might ask a short series of questions, and hopefully, before we \nconclude this debate, we can have some further information.\n  Based on the statement that was made earlier today, this increase \nthat would be the result of the Department of the Interior's new \nregulatory change was characterized as a tax.\n  It has been my understanding that what we are talking about is a \ncontractual royalty payment; that is, a payment that is made by the \nuser of this Federal resource--petroleum--as the economic condition of \ngaining access to that Federal resource.\n  This is not a tax in terms of an imposed burden upon a commercial \ntransaction. This is in the nature of a payment for a product which \nbelongs to the people of the United States which is now going to be \nused by a specific private firm. I would like some discussion as to why \nthe word ``tax'' is being used to apply to this transaction.\n  A second concern I have from the earlier discussion of this amendment \nis the issue of effect on consumers. It was inferred that the effect of \nthis would be to directly increase the price of the petroleum that was \nused by the American consumer.\n  It had been my understanding that the way in which the price of \npetroleum was controlled was in a world marketplace of petroleum and \nthat individual companies did not have the power to pass on their cost \nto the ultimate consumer. If they do, then that infers a level of \nmonopolistic control of the petroleum economy which raises its own set \nof concerns.\n  So I would like to know by what economic relationship this particular \ngroup of oil companies would be able to pass on to their consumers \nwhatever was ultimately considered to be the appropriate royalty level \nfor their access to the resource that belongs to the American people.\n  There has been a chart displayed which shows at the bottom the cost \nof the petroleum product itself, and then at the top the taxes which \nare levied.\n  I would assume we are now talking about the bottom part of that chart \nbecause we are not talking about taxes, we are talking about royalties \nthat are being paid.\n  I would like to have some discussion as to just how much of that \nbottom portion of the chart is the issue that is at debate today.\n  Clearly, no one says there should be no royalty paid to the taxpayers \nof America for the use of their resource. How much, therefore, of that \ntotal cost is what is at controversy.\n  Finally, there is the issue of regulatory complexity. I have seen the \nchart that shows a rabbit warren of boxes and arrows and relationships. \nI would be interested in seeing a similar chart as to what the status \nquo is.\n  Is the process by which we are arriving at the pricing mechanism for \npetroleum under the new Department of the Interior regulations \nsignificantly more complex than those which are being used to arrive at \nthe method of pricing petroleum under the current standards? If so, \nwhere are the particular areas of increased or altered or even reduced \ncomplexity?\n  So those would be three questions. I hope the proponents of this \namendment will use some of their time to illuminate. So that is the \nfirst question.\n  The second question is the effect of this debate on the Congress \nitself.\n  I am a member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, the \ncommittee that has basic jurisdiction over this issue. There has been \nan inference that the Department of the Interior has gone beyond its \nrulemaking authority in adopting this provision. It has even been \nimplied that maybe the Department of the Interior has been tainted by \nsome of the activities of its individual personnel and the way in which \nthis new rule was developed. Those are serious charges.\n  As a member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee--and I will \nbe prepared, if the chairman or others will point out where I am in \nerror--I do not believe we have held any hearings on this issue. Yet we \nhave allowed this matter to now come to the Senate floor as a \nnongermane amendment to an appropriations bill, a position which is \nbasically in conflict with our recently adopted rule that says we \ncannot offer matters of general legislation on appropriations bills. \nBut by some relatively clever drafting--and I extend congratulations to \nthose smart people--we have been able to evade the clear intent of the \nrule that says no legislation on an appropriation.\n  In fact, this issue, the way in which it is being handled, makes the \ncase as to why our rule is wise, that we ought to be dealing with \nlegislation through committees that have responsibility for \nlegislation, such as the Energy and Natural Resources Committee; we \nshould not be doing it on an appropriations bill.\n  It does raise the question of why we are doing this. There is a \ncertain unseemliness to bringing up this issue in this manner. It \nraises the question our colleague from Wisconsin discussed earlier \ntoday; that is, Is this going to be the poster child for the mixture of \ndecisions made by Congress and the economic influence, through campaign \nfinance, of those industries that will be the clear beneficiary of \nthose decisions?\n  I personally have resisted those kinds of linkages because that puts \neverything we do under a cloud of suspicion. But the way in which this \nis being handled will give ammunition to those who wish to attack the \nbasic integrity of this institution.\n  It is unnecessary for us to lay ourselves open to that attack. What \nwe ought to do is have a hearing in the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, invite in all the people who are knowledgeable, have a \nserious public airing of this question, and then see if legislation \nshould be passed to rein in excessive or inappropriate behavior by the \nDepartment of the Interior. We should not be doing this, passing \nlegislation on an appropriations bill.\n  The third issue is, What is at stake? The resources that will not \nbecome available as a result of the passage of this amendment, how \nwould they otherwise have been deployed? The royalties that come from \nthe Federal Government's leasing for oil and gas production are a key \npart of our public land trust. Currently, a portion of these royalties \ngoes to the Land and Water Conservation Fund which provides the means \nby which a variety of Federal, State, and local activities have \ntraditionally been funded.\n  The Energy Committee is currently considering legislation that would \nexpand and make permanent the use of other portions of this royalty \nprogram for a variety of uses. The Senator from Louisiana has \nintroduced legislation that would have it used to offset some of the \nadverse impacts along the coastal areas of those States which are the \nprincipal offshore oil and gas production areas. Others would have the \nfunds used for public acquisition of lands that would be significant \nfor a variety of public purposes, including environmental and \nrecreational. Others would have them used for coastal protection \npurposes.\n\n  I will talk today about legislation that has been introduced by \nSenator\n\n[[Page S11320]]\n\nReid of Nevada and my colleague, Senator Mack, which would have a \nportion of these royalty funds used for the protection of our National \nPark System. There has been an increasing recognition that our national \nparks are in serious trouble. I will offer to be entered into the \nRecord, immediately after my remarks, an article from the New York \nTimes of July 25, 1999, entitled ``National Parks, Strained By Record \nCrowds, Face A Crisis.'' I ask unanimous consent that this article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. What is at stake is, will we have adequate resources, \nproperly directed, to deal with these national issues, including the \ncrisis that is in our national park system.\n  The question we must ask ourselves as we vote on this amendment and \nas we vote on the underlying legislation to which it is being offered \nis, Can we live up to the legacy of our forefathers and mothers and \nprotect our Federal land trust?\n  We are about to begin the fourth century of our Nation's history. We \nwere formed at the end of the 18th century, had our maturation in the \n19th century, and now, in the 20th century, have grown to the great \npower and source of influence for values that we consider to be \nfundamental--human rights, democracy--in the 20th century.\n  The first two of our centuries that were full centuries, the 19th and \nnow the 20th, were highlighted by activism on public lands issues. The \n19th century began with the Presidency of Thomas Jefferson. Thomas \nJefferson's most renowned action as President was the purchase of \nLouisiana from France. That single act added almost 530 million acres \nto the United States. That action changed America from an eastern \ncoastal nation to a continental power.\n  This century, the 20th century, was marked by the addition to the \npublic land trust led by President Theodore Roosevelt. While in the \nWhite House, between 1901 and 1909, President Theodore Roosevelt \ndesignated 150 national forests, the first 51 Federal bird \nreservations, 5 national parks, the first 18 national monuments, the \nfirst 4 national game preserves, the first 21 reclamation projects. He \nalso established the National Wildlife Refuge System, beginning with \nthe designation of Pelican Island in my State of Florida as a national \nwildlife refuge in 1903.\n\n  Together, these projects equated to Federal protection of almost 230 \nmillion acres, a land area equivalent to that of all the east coast \nStates from Maine to Florida and just under half of the Louisiana \nPurchase. That is what the first President in the 19th century, Thomas \nJefferson, and the first President in the 20th century, Theodore \nRoosevelt, did for America. That was their legacy.\n  Clearly, the question we are going to have to answer to our children \nand grandchildren is, Did you live up to the standards of Thomas \nJefferson and Theodore Roosevelt? Roosevelt said: We must ask ourselves \nif we are leaving for future generations an environment that is as good \nas or better than what we found. Can we meet that test?\n  As we enter the 21st century, the fourth century of our Nation's \nhistory, we must again ask ourselves this question. We must be prepared \nto take action to meet the challenge. I argue that the underlying bill \nto which this amendment is attached and to which this amendment would \nfurther delete resources to meet that challenge of Theodore Roosevelt, \nwhile it takes some steps towards meeting his challenge, fails to fully \ncommit to the protection of our Federal land trust.\n  In 1916, Congress created the National Park Service. In doing so, it \nstated that the purposes of the National Park Service were:\n\n       To conserve the scenery and the natural and historic \n     objects and the wildlife therein and to provide for the \n     enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as \n     will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future \n     generations. ``. . . will leave them unimpaired for the \n     enjoyment of future generations.''\n  That is what our predecessor said in 1916 was the purpose of the \nNational Park System.\n  Today the unimpaired status of our national parks is severely at \nrisk. On April 22 of this year, the National Parks and Conservation \nAssociation identified the 1999 list of the 10 most endangered national \nparks. In his opening remarks, Mr. Tom Kiernan, the President of the \nNational Parks and Conservation Association, stated:\n\n       These parks were chosen not because they were the only \n     parks with endangered resources, but because they demonstrate \n     the resource damages that are occurring in all of our parks.\n\n  These parks demonstrate the breadth of the threats faced by our \nNational Park System. For example, Chaco Culture National Historical \nPark in Chaco Canyon, NM, contains the remains of 13 major structures \nthat represent the highest point of pueblo pre-Columbian civilization. \nIn the words of the National Park and Conservation Association:\n\n       It is falling victim to time and neglect. Weather damage, \n     inadequate preservation, neglected maintenance, tourism \n     impacts, and potential resource development on adjacent lands \n     threaten the long-term life of these pre-Columbian \n     structures.\n\n  All of the parks in the Florida Everglades region were included on \nthe list of the most endangered. In this area, decades of manipulation \nof the water system has led to loss of significant quantities of \nFlorida's water supply to tide every day; it has led to a 90-percent \ndecline in the wading bird population; it has led to an invasion of \nnon-native plants and animals and to a shrinking wildlife habitat. The \nNational Parks and Conservation Association calls Yellowstone National \nPark the ``poster child for the neglect that has marred our national \nparks.''\n\n  We have all heard Senator Thomas and others speak about the \ndegradation of the sewage handling and treatment system at Yellowstone \nNational Park, a situation that caused spills into Yellowstone Lake and \nnearby meadows, sending more than 225,000 gallons of sewage into \nYellowstone's waterways, threatening the water quality of this \nresource.\n  It is not just these beautiful natural areas that are threatened. One \nof the areas on the 10 most-endangered list, not far from where we \nstand this late afternoon, is Gettysburg National Park, the site of one \nof our greatest historic moments. There, because of inadequate \nmaintenance and attention, we are losing some of the most precious \nhistorical artifacts of our Nation.\n  These are illustrative of what is occurring across our National Park \nSystem. Estimates of the maintenance backlog of the National Park \nService range from a low of $1.2 billion to $3.54 billion. The National \nPark Service developed a 5-year plan to meet this deferred maintenance \nobligation. It was based on its ability to execute funds and its \npriorities within the National Park System. In this year's \nappropriation process, the House and Senate have modified the national \nparks' request of $194 million. The House, for instance, reduced the \nrequest by almost $25 million. If we are to ever make a dent in our \nenormous backlog, we must support the national park plan to \nsystematically reduce this accumulation of deferred maintenance.\n  In addition, if we are to prevent the backlog from growing, we must \nsupport periodic maintenance on the existing facilities in the park \nsystem. The Senate reduced both cyclic maintenance and repair and \nrehabilitation in the operation and the maintenance account of the Park \nService by $3 million and $2.5 million, respectively. While you may say \nthese are small dollar amounts in the large budget of the National Park \nSystem, failure to meet these basic annual maintenance requirements \nwill cause our backlog to grow in the long run and will cause the \nseverity of the threat to our national parks to increase.\n  Neither the operation and maintenance account nor the construction \naccount is designed specifically to meet the natural resources needs of \nthe park system.\n  This year, the National Park Service is seeking to change this with \nthe Natural Resource Challenge, announced earlier this year by National \nPark Service Director Bob Stanton.\n  This plan will change decisionmaking in the Park Service as manager's \nmake resource preservation and conservation an integral consideration \nin all management actions.\n  To support this program, the National Park Service requested $16 \nmillion in the fiscal year 2000 Interior appropriations bill.\n  During this fiscal year, these funds will be focused on the \ncompletion of\n\n[[Page S11321]]\n\nnatural resource inventories to be used by park managers in \ndecisionmaking.\n  These funds will support large-scale preservation projects and target \nrestoration of threatened areas damaged by human disturbance.\n  After considering the National Park Service's Natural Resource \nChallenge appropriations request, the House fully funded the base \nprogram with $16.235 million.\n  The Senate significantly reduced the funds for this program, \nproviding a total of only $6 million.\n  This shortfall will extend the time period for completion of baseline \ninventories for all 260 park units from 7 to 14 years, delaying the \ntime period when the Park Service will be able to identify a ``natural \nresource backlog'' similar to the construction backlog it currently \nuses.\n  The actions taken by the Senate and the House do not meet the \nchallenge posed by Theodore Roosevelt to leave our environment in a \nbetter state than we found it.\n  I sympathize with the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, and I \nrespect the actions they have been able to take over the last several \nyears to support the needs of the National Park System.\n  However, there is a limit to what the Appropriations Subcommittee can \ndo given the tools they have.\n  They are working to fund 20th century needs for construction and \nnatural resource preservation using a 19th century funding mechanism.\n  The National Park Service needs a sustained, reliable funding source \nthat will allow it to develop intelligent plans based on prioritization \nof need, not availability of funds.\n  Last year, Senator Thomas led the way with his landmark legislation \non the National Park Service, Vision 2020.\n  This legislation adopted, for the first time, both concessions reform \nand science-based decisionmaking on resource needs within the park \nservice.\n  We took a big step forward last year with the extension of the fee \ndemonstration program.\n  This allows individual parks to charge entrance fees and use a \nportion of the proceeds for maintenance backlog and natural resource \nprojects.\n  This action generates about $100 million annually throughout the park \nsystem. It is time for the next step.\n  Earlier this year, I introduced legislation with Senators Reid and \nMack, S. 819, the National Park Preservation Act, that would provide \ndedicated funding to the National Park Service to restore and conserve \nthe natural resources within our park system.\n  This legislation seeks to address the long-term efforts required to \ntruly restore and protect our natural, cultural, and historic resources \nin our park system.\n  The legislation would reallocate funds derived from the use of a \nnonrenewable resource--offshore drilling in the outer continental \nshelf--to a renewable resource--restoration and preservation of \nnatural, cultural, and historic resources in our national park system.\n  These funds provided by our bill would ensure that each year the \nNational Park Service will have the resources it needs to restore and \nprevent damages to the natural, cultural, and historic resources in our \npark system.\n  I am working with the members of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee to include a version of this legislation in the final package \nof the ``Outer Continental Shelf Revenue'' legislation under \nconsideration by that Committee.\n  Last week, I circulated a dear colleague requesting that each of you \njoin me in this effort.\n  As we move to final passage on the Interior appropriations bill and \nfinal negotiations on the OCS revenue legislation, I urge you to \nremember this quote from Theodore Roosevelt quote,\n\n       Nothing short of defending this country during wartime \n     compares in importance with the great central task of leaving \n     this land even a better land for our descendants than it is \n     for us.\n\n  We have serious needs in many areas of our national land trust. If we \nare to meet the standard set by Theodore Roosevelt almost a century \nago, we must not be depleting our capacity to do this by underfunding \nand by reducing the funds that are available to meet these national \npark and other national land demands. We must be looking, creatively, \nfor ways to provide sustained, adequate funding sources. That is what \nis at issue in this debate.\n  Are we going to succumb to the request of a floor amendment to an \nappropriations bill to reduce the funds available to meet our national \nland trust responsibilities or are we going to both defeat this \namendment and then step forward in the underlying bill to provide the \nresources necessary to meet the crisis that exists in our national \nparks and in many of our other national land trusts?\n  I hope we will hear the call from a century in the past of Theodore \nRoosevelt, that we be prepared to be judged by whether we have left to \nour children and our grandchildren a better America than our parents \nand grandparents gave to us.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 25, 1999]\n\n        National Parks, Strained by Record Crowds, Face a Crisis\n\n                         (By Michael Janofsky)\n\n       Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., July 22--In growing \n     numbers that now exceed 3.1 million a year, visitors travel \n     here to America's oldest national park to marvel at wildlife, \n     towering mountains, pristine rivers and geological \n     curiosities like geysers, hot springs and volcanic mudpots.\n       Yet many things tourists may not see on a typical trip \n     through Yellowstone's 2.2 million acres spread across parts \n     of Idaho, Montana and Wyoming could have a greater impact on \n     the park's future than the growl of a grizzly or spew of Old \n     Faithful.\n       For all its beauty, Yellowstone is broken. Hordes of summer \n     tourists and the increasing numbers now visiting in the \n     spring, fall and winter are overwhelming the park's ability \n     to accommodate them properly.\n       In recent years, the park's popularity has created such \n     enormous demands on water lines, roads and personnel that \n     park management has been forced to spend most of \n     Yellowstone's annual operating budget, about $30 million, on \n     immediate problems rather than investing in long-term \n     solutions that would eliminate the troublesome areas.\n       Yellowstone is not the only national park suffering. With \n     the nation's 378 national park areas expected to attract \n     almost 300 million visitors this year, after a record 286 \n     million in 1998, many parks are deferring urgently needed \n     capital improvements.\n       For instance, damaged sewage pipes at Yellowstone have let \n     so much ground water from spring thaws into the system that \n     crews have had to siphon off millions of gallons of treated \n     water into meadows each of the last four years.\n       And with budget restraints forcing personnel cutbacks in \n     every department, even the number of park rangers with law-\n     enforcement authority has dropped, contributing to a steady \n     increase in crime throughout Yellowstone.\n       ``It's so frustrating,'' Michael V. Finley, Yellowstone's \n     superintendent, said. ``As the park continues to deteriorate, \n     the service level continues to decline. You see how many \n     Americans enjoy this park. They deserve better.''\n       Over the last decade the annual budget of the National Park \n     Service, an agency of the Interior Department, has nearly \n     doubled, to $1.9 billion for the fiscal year 1999 from $1.13 \n     billion in 1990, an increase that narrowly outpaced \n     inflation.\n       But in an assessment made last year, the park service \n     estimated that it would cost $3.54 billion to repair \n     maintenance problems at national parks, monuments and \n     wilderness areas that have been put off--for decades, in some \n     cases--because of a lack of money.\n       The cost of needed repairs at Yellowstone was put at $46 \n     million, the most of any park area in the system. But the \n     park service report shows that budget limits have forced \n     virtually all national parks to set aside big maintenance \n     projects, delays that many park officials say compromise \n     visitor enjoyment and occasionally threaten their health and \n     safety.\n       Senator Craig Thomas, a Wyoming Republican who is chairman \n     of the Subcommittee on National Parks, and Bob Stanton, \n     director of the park service, negotiated a deal this week to \n     spend $12 million over the next three years for Yellowstone \n     repairs.\n       Other parks may have to wait longer. The Grand Canyon \n     National Park depends on a water treatment system that has \n     not been upgraded in 30 years, a $20 million problem, park \n     officials say. Parts of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal \n     National Historical Park along the Potomac River are \n     crumbling, another $10 million expense. The Everglades \n     National Park in South Florida needs a $15 million water \n     treatment plant.\n       Even with a heightened awareness of need among Federal \n     lawmakers and Clinton Administration officials, money to \n     repair those problems may be hard to find at a time when \n     Congress is wrestling over the true size of a projected \n     budget surplus and how much of it will pay for tax cuts. If \n     billions were to become available for new spending, the park \n     service would still have to slug it out with every other \n     Federal agency, and few predict that parks would emerge a big \n     winner.\n       It is a disturbing prospect to conservationists, parks \n     officials and those lawmakers\n\n[[Page S11322]]\n\n     who support increased spending to help the parks address \n     their backlog of maintenance problems.\n       ``It's kind of like a decayed tooth,'' said Dave Simon, the \n     Southwest regional director for the National Parks and \n     Conservation Association, a citizens' group that is working \n     with Yellowstone to solve some of the long-term needs. ``If \n     you don't take care of it, one day you'll wake up with a \n     mouthful of cavities.''\n       The parks' supporters like Representative Ralph S. Regula, \n     an Ohio Republican who is chairman of Appropriations \n     Subcommittee on the Interior, concede that budgetary \n     increases as well as revenue from new programs that allow \n     parks to keep a greater share of entrance fees and concession \n     sales have been offset by inflation, rising costs and daily \n     operational demands that now accommodate 8.9 percent more \n     people than those who visited national parks a decade ago.\n       With few dollars available for maintenance programs, the \n     parks suffered ``bengin neglect,'' Mr. Regula said, adding: \n     ``It's not very sexy to fix a sewer system or maintain a \n     trail. You don't get headlines for that. It would be nice to \n     get them more money, but we're constrained.''\n       Denis P. Galvin, the deputy director of the National Park \n     Service, noted that only twice this century, in the 1930's \n     and in 1966, has the Federal Government authorized money for \n     systemwide capital improvements, and he said he was not \n     expecting another windfall soon.\n       ``Generally,'' Mr. Galvin said, ``domestic programs come at \n     the back of the line when they're formulating the Federal \n     budget, and I just don't think parks are a priority.''\n       Perhaps no park in America reflects the array of hidden \n     problems more than Yellowstone, which opened in 1872, years \n     before Idaho, Montana and Wyoming became states.\n       Park officials here say that the longer problems go \n     unattended, the more expensive and threatening they become.\n       The budget restraints have meant reducing the number of \n     rangers who carry guns and have the authority to make \n     arrests.\n       Rick Obernesser, Yellowstone's chief ranger, said the \n     roster had dwindled to 112 from 144 over the last 10 years, \n     which often means leaving the park without any of these \n     rangers from 2 A.M. to 6 A.M.\n       Next year, Mr. Obernesser said, the park will have only 93 \n     of these rangers, about 1 for every 23,000 acres, compared \n     with 1 for every 15,000 acres when his staff was at peak \n     strength.\n       That has not only led to slower response times to \n     emergencies, like auto accidents and heart attacks, he said, \n     but also to an increase in crime. Since the peak staffing \n     year of 1989, he said, the park has experienced significant \n     increases in the killing of wildlife, thefts, weapons charges \n     against visitors and violations by snowmobile drivers.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak for up to 5 minutes, following which Senator Boxer \nfrom California would be recognized for up to 10 minutes, after which \nSenator Murkowski would be recognized to speak for up to 5 minutes, and \nthen I will close for up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot, I thank my colleague. It has been a long day, and we are about to \nend this. Will that take us to 6:10 or 6:15?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Yes, it will.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to take 5 minutes at this time \nto answer what questions were asked by Senator Graham from Florida. \nFirst of all, he asked: Why are we calling this a tax? This is really a \nlease payment, a condition for a lease.\n  What I am concerned about is that he is willing to say we will change \nthe terms of the lease during the term. If that is not an increase in a \ntax, I don't know what it is. It is a tax increase during the term of a \nlease. It changes the conditions of the lease, and it will raise the \ncosts to oil companies. Who is going to pay the increased costs? Who \nalways pays the increased costs on business? I am always amazed that \npeople talk about taxing business and making business pay their fair \nshare. When the business is going to sell the product, the business has \nto have a certain margin in order to stay in business and keep the jobs \nthat it is creating. Of course, they have to raise the price of the \nproduct. That is exactly what is going to happen.\n\n  This is the chart about which the Senator from Florida spoke. There \nis no question that the taxes at the top of the chart are 56 cents for \na gallon of gasoline, and the oil is 64 cents. If you add more to the \ntaxes, you are going to add more to the price of gasoline.\n  This is a tax increase on the people who are going to pay for \ngasoline at the pump.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I have 5 minutes under a unanimous consent. I didn't \ninterrupt the Senator from Florida, and I would like to finish my 5 \nminutes, if I can.\n  The Senator from Florida talked about the ``rabbit warren'' of \nregulation.\n  I want to put that chart up because it is a valid question.\n  Is this the same as, or any worse than, the regulations that we have \ntoday? In fact, this whole segment of this chart isn't there today \nbecause today, if oil is sold at the wellhead, the Federal Government \nrecognizes that is the price. Under the new regulation, we have this \ntheory of procedures that would be required for a person who is selling \nat the wellhead to prove that was really the price because the Mineral \nManagement Service reserves the right to second-guess the price that is \nactually paid.\n  I say that there is a good case to be made that this is actually more \ncomplicated than it is today. I hope that we will not allow that to go \nforward.\n  The third area that was mentioned by the Senator from Florida is, why \nis this coming up in this bill? He said: Why don't we have hearings? \nWhy is this coming up in this bill?\n  It is coming up in this bill because the Federal regulators are \nspending taxpayer dollars to perpetrate a tax increase on the hard-\nworking people of this country who buy gasoline at the pump, and they \nare doing it with the appropriations that we are passing tonight.\n  Of course, if we are going to have any say, if we are going to have \nthe ability to exercise the responsibility of Congress to set tax \npolicy in our country and determine that we are going to raise gasoline \nprices at the pump, we must act on the bill that gives them the money, \nand direct them as a Congress to not raise taxes on the people of \nAmerica who buy gasoline for their cars every day.\n  Last but not least, the Senator from Florida raised the question: Are \nwe living up to the legacy of Theodore Roosevelt? I think it is \nimportant that we look at the money that we are spending to preserve \nour wildlife and preserve our natural habitat. I think that is a valid \nquestion. My answer is yes. That is not an issue in anything we are \ntalking about tonight because if these companies don't agree to take \ncare of the environment and clean up anything that might be built, then \nthey will not get the lease.\n  That is part of the least arrangement. So protecting the environment \nis not an issue, and, of course, we want to protect the legacy that we \nhave been given by our forefathers and mothers of this wonderful \ncountry.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized for \n10 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Hutchison, \nfor working so well with me so we can, in an orderly way, get this \nvote.\n  I want to say to my friend from Florida before he leaves the floor \nthat I know he has more to say on this, and that he has raised issues \nthat are so important to this debate.\n  First, he raised the issue of process. He raises the point that this \namendment doesn't belong here. It certainly does not.\n  As a matter of fact, originally it was stripped from the bill, and it \ncame back in a rather clever way.\n  I give my colleague credit for passing the test. But it is making \nappropriations on a bill. My colleague makes that point.\n  Second, he makes a very important point on the substance. This issue \nabout whether a royalty is a tax, he knows. He is on the Finance \nCommittee. If this was a tax, he would be dealing with it.\n  He himself raises a crucial issue that was given short shrift by my \nfriend from Texas, and that is, why are we here? Who do we fight for? \nAnd shouldn't it be for our children, our grandchildren, and their \nchildren? I\n\n[[Page S11323]]\n\nthink he says it in very sweeping terms.\n  He also points out very clearly the specific problems that we face in \nthe shortfall of our national parks, and the fact that these funds, \nwhen collected from the oil companies, go into the Land and Water \nConservation Fund.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  I also want to thank Senators Durbin, Feingold, Reid, Wellstone, \nDorgan, Levin, Harkin, Kennedy, Daschle, Byrd, Akaka, Cleland, and \nConrad for yielding me time. This has meant a lot to me personally.\n  But it also is telling that Senators would take their time and come \nto the floor to speak from their heart. And they did.\n  I believe at the end of the day we have shown that the facts are on \nour side. I believe we have the arguments on our side that have been \nmade by the consumer groups. I think the people who care about the \nenvironment are on our side. The legal precedents and settlements are \non our side. Most of the States that are affected by this are on our \nside. I have read them into the Record. So if it is about States \nrights, we have the Record. The former oil executives under penalty of \nperjury and putting themselves on the line testified that we are right, \nand that there has been not one scheme but seven schemes to defraud the \npeople of their money from royalties.\n  I think we have proven that we have the arguments on our side.\n  I am happy that we had this debate. To me, this is what the Senate \nshould be about, and one of our colleagues from Oklahoma denigrated \nthis debate. He said it didn't fit the Senate. He said that, in a way. \nI think this debate is important for the Senate.\n  But I want to wind up by picking up on a statement made by the \nSenator from Montana. He is a good debater. And he ``gets with you.'' I \nlike to hear him. What he said in the debate was basically, to me and \nthe people on my side, ``Get a life.'' He said, ``Get a life.''\n  I want to talk about my life for a minute. I want to talk about what \nmy professional life is about. I want to assure the Senator from \nMontana that I have a life. As a Senator, what I try to do with my life \nis to find purpose in it by fighting for the people of my State and the \npeople of this country by taking their side against the special \ninterests when I believe the special interests are wrong.\n\n  If I believe the special interests are right, I will fight for them, \nif they are on the side of the people. I said earlier, and I will \nrepeat now, there are two sides to this debate on this amendment. There \nare. The oil company has one side and the people have the other. I \nstand on the side of the people.\n  So I have a life. I try to make my life about justice.\n  My colleagues could have a different view of justice. I respect them \ntremendously if they do. But, to me, this is a matter of justice.\n  Why do I say it? I say it because we know something bad is going on \nwhen two former oil executives filed a lawsuit and described very \nclearly the seven schemes by the oil companies to defraud the \ntaxpayers.\n  Quoting from them, they say:\n\n       There is a nationwide conspiracy by some of the world's \n     largest oil companies to short change the United States of \n     America of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue.\n\n  That is not the Senator from California. It is not the Senator from \nMassachusetts. It is not the Senator from Florida. It is two former oil \nexecutives who spell out the seven schemes of the oil companies.\n  We know that there have been settlements all over the country--$5 \nbillion worth of settlements by seven States.\n  Why would these oil companies be settling all over this country? In \nAlaska, for $3.7 billion; in California, for $345 million. It goes on--\nin Texas, for $30 million. The State of Texas brought suit. The State \nof Texas sued the oil companies. And guess what happened. The oil \ncompany didn't want to go to court. They settled for $30 million; New \nMexico, for $6 million. It goes on.\n  Now these oil companies are settling because they know they don't \nhave a leg to stand on in court because they signed an agreement to pay \nroyalties at fair market value. The Mineral Management Service at the \nDepartment of the Interior caught them. They want to fix the problem.\n  This is the fourth time this Senate is interfering in that. I love \nthis Senate too much to see that happen. It is the oil companies versus \nthe people. I want to be on the side of the people.\n  I think this has been a very good debate. We have covered all the \nissues very well. I want to thank the media for getting involved. We \nhave seen some very strong stories in the last few days on this. I \nthink the original editorial written by USA Today is still the best. \nUSA Today said: ``Time to clean up Big Oil's slick deal with \nCongress.'' Those are tough words. Those are ugly words. I am sad to \nsay, I agree. We can clean it up today. We can vote against this \namendment and clean it up and have a good editorial. Wouldn't Members \nlove to see an editorial tomorrow, ``Congress cleans up its act, tells \nthe oil companies to pay their fair share of royalties.'' I would be \nexcited to see that headline. I don't think we will see it.\n  This issue will not go away as long as my colleagues and I are here. \nI think it is clear. The editorial says the taxpayers have been getting \nthe unfair end of this deal for far too long. Congress should protect \nthe public interest.\n  That is what this is about. We have heard every argument in the book: \nThe Interior Department is terrible, Mineral Management is terrible, \npeople in the Interior Department are terrible. Everybody is terrible. \nEverybody is terrible.\n  The people who are causing the trouble, the 5 percent of the oil \ncompanies that are not paying their fair share, are robbing this \nFederal Treasury of almost $6 million per month. That is a lot of \nmoney. Ask any constituent what they would do with $6 million a month, \nand they would have a pretty good list.\n  Sad to say, this money that is not going into the Treasury because of \nthis amendment could have gone to the classrooms of the States, could \nhave gone into the Land and Water Conservation Fund, and been spent on \nthe kinds of things Senator Graham, Senator Durbin, and many of our \ncolleagues have pointed out need attention.\n  We are coming to the end of this debate. I urge my colleagues, in the \nname of fairness and justice, to vote against the Hutchison amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support for the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Texas, Senator Hutchison, and the Senator \nfrom New Mexico, Senator Domenici, on oil royalties. It is essential \nthat we adopt this amendment to prohibit yet another attempt by this \nadministration to ``tax'' the American people without their effective \nrepresentation--without a bill being introduced in Congress, without \nits passage by both Houses of Congress, and without the President's \nsignature.\n  There has been a lot of talk about whether or not the current \nprocedures for valuing crude oil for Federal royalty purposes are \nworking properly. I have been fascinated by this debate. The issue we \nare discussing is really more basic than whether the current procedures \nneed to be modified. The question is at heart a constitutional one--if \nwe are to change the way the Federal Government has forced oil \ncompanies to calculate Federal royalties for the last 79 years, should \nthis change come from Congress, or should it come in the form of a tax \nscheme dreamed up by a Federal bureaucracy?\n  Not only do these rules amount to a usurpation of the legislative \nfunction by the administration, but in substance they would allow \ntremendous complexity for people in the oil industry. These rules would \nrequire producers to report and pay royalties under three different \nsets of rules. Now I've been a small businessman, and I've been on the \nreceiving end of Federal and State regulations for a good part of my \nlife. I can tell you, we better have a very good explanation if we are \ngoing to expect small oil companies in Wyoming to dill out a bunch more \npaper work just to comply with their lawful obligation to pay Federal \nroyalties on the oil they drill on Federal lands.\n  If we are going to change the point at which we determine the value \nof the crude oil--from the wellhead to some point downstream or by \nreference to a national exchange, we owe it to the small producers in \nWyoming, and throughout the country, to give their suggestions to \nCongress on any alternative plan. We need to hear how much\n\n[[Page S11324]]\n\nmore time and effort this is going to be for folks who are still \nhurting from last year's devastatingly low crude oil prices.\n  I think we owe that opportunity to our Nation's oil producers, so I \nam proud to join the Senator from Texas and the Senator from New \nMexico, and others in standing up for the right of Congress to pass \nlaws that affect the tax burden on our domestic oil industry.\n  I ask unanimous consent a letter from Wyoming Governor Geringer to \nSenator Hutchison be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                 State of Wyoming,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                                September 8, 1999.\n     Hon. Kay Bailey Hutchison,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hutchison: I ask for your strong support of \n     the amendment to the Department of Interior Appropriation \n     Bill which would extend the moratorium on Minerals Management \n     Service (MMS) rule making. Wyoming, as the largest \n     stakeholder of federal oil royalty receipts (35%) supports a \n     fair and workable oil valuation rule. However, the current \n     proposed rules contain more uncertainty and will diminish \n     incentives for industry to lease, explore and produce on the \n     immense amount of federal acreage in Wyoming. Such \n     uncertainty will lead to additional administrative, audit and \n     legal activities, which will lead to higher costs for Wyoming \n     producers, causing their products to be less competitive. \n     Higher costs to the MMS are then passed on to Wyoming and \n     other states in the sharing of net receipts. Last year \n     Wyoming's net receipt share along of MMS activity was $7 \n     million.\n       Wyoming is currently involved in a pilot project with the \n     MMS to take its crude oil royalties in-kind (RIK) rather than \n     in cash. This RIK pilot program has been designed to allow \n     the state and the MMS to reduce administrative costs, \n     eliminate legal disputes and test the various methods of \n     achieving fair market value for our oil. Therefore, the \n     moratorium extension for two more years would allow such \n     valuable experience to be tested. Allowing a sufficient \n     amount of time to finish the pilot will assist in the \n     development of new rules. Let us keep working cooperatively \n     with MMS, free of this rule making distraction.\n       While we continue to object to the implementation of \n     Interior's rules, Wyoming has participated in every phase of \n     the rulemaking process. We also have observed the attempts to \n     craft distracting legislation, which would attempt to address \n     far too many unrelated aspects of the relationship between \n     MMS, stakeholder states and industry. We do not support such \n     efforts. Following our experience with RIK, we believe that a \n     simple approach establishing a voluntary RIK program for the \n     states, embodied in no more than two pages of legislation, \n     will be all that is necessary. Let us go to work on a simple, \n     but effective bill.\n       I urge you to support the rulemaking moratorium and \n     encourage the MMS and royalty receiving states to engage in a \n     genuine partnership role which will insure a fair, workable \n     and beneficial plan to collect royalties. Adoption of the \n     proposed rules would obstruct any opportunity to improve our \n     royalty collection process.\n       Thank you for your support and understanding!\n           Best regards,\n                                                     Jim Geringer,\n                                                         Governor.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from Alaska is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I have listened to \nthe debate with a little frustration, as I am sure my colleagues have, \nregarding the emotional arguments prevailing on an issue that fails to \ngive disclosure to the public on what this issue is all about.\n  The Hutchison moratorium amendment keeps the MMS from spending money \nfor 1 year to implement a new rule that amounts to another tax, a \nvalue-added tax, on oil produced in the United States on Federal \nleases. What they don't say in the debate is who pays this additional \ntax. It is the American consumer, the taxpayer, the public.\n  Bureaucrats don't have the right to unilaterally establish a tax. \nThat is just what this proposal does. That is a right that is reserved \nin the Constitution, by the Constitution to this Congress. Existing law \nsays royalties should be collected at the lease, not after value has \nbeen added downstream as the rule proposed by Department of Interior \nwould do. This MMS rule, for the first time in history, embraces a \nvalue-added tax concept to oil valuation.\n  There is little mention about the energy security interests of this \ncountry. We are now dependent upon imported oil. Imported oil is the \nNo. 1 contributor to our trade deficit. The domestic oil industry is in \ntough shape. In 1973, during the oil embargo, we imported 36 percent of \nour oil. Today, we import 56 percent. The Department of Energy says \nthat figure will go up to the 63- to 64-percent area by the years 2005, \n2006, and 2007, and over 55,000 American jobs have been lost in the \nlast 2 years in the oil industry, five times the number in the steel \nindustry. The MMS rule drives U.S. jobs overseas, increases our trade \ndeficit, and makes America more dependent on one area of the world that \nis very volatile, the Mideast.\n  This moratorium by the Senator from Texas has been in place for 2 \nyears. The press has reported two Government employees have been paid \n$350,000 each from a group associated with the trial lawyers as an \naward for pushing for the new rule which benefits--benefits whom? It \ndoesn't benefit the taxpayer or the consumer; it benefits the lawyers. \nThe Department of the Interior inspector general and Justice Department \nare investigating. Something is rotten around here. It is not in \nDenmark. It has something to do with the process.\n  This has the effect of turning our Government regulation over to the \nhighest bidder. No rule tainted by payoffs to the rulemakers should be \ntolerated. It is interesting to note, as the Senator from Texas has, \nthey say they want to simplify a process. The chart today reminds me of \nthe chart Senator Specter presented to this body describing the \nsimplified health care that had been proposed by the First Lady and the \nadministration. Again, look at this chart. If that is a simplified \nchart on the workable manner in which MMS proposes a value-added method \nfor determining the appropriate royalty for oil, you and I both know \nthat won't hold water.\n\n  This is a cancer within Government. We talk about whistleblowers and \nthose who are supporting the proposed MMS gasoline and heating oil tax \nwhich Senator Hutchison's amendment postpones for 1 year. When they \nthink about a whistleblower, most people think of something someone \nsees is wrong, who blows a whistle to draw attention. The Federal \nGovernment has laws on the books to protect whistleblowers who come \nforward to report fraud and abuse.\n  Let's look at this case. This case is a little different. Two Federal \nemployees, one working for the Department of the Interior and the other \nworking for the Department of Energy--the two Departments of \njurisdiction; these are supposed to be objective people--worked behind \nthe scenes and pushed for the MMS rule change. They were paid $350,000 \neach on September 13, 1999 as rewards for their work. There is a copy \nof the check.\n  The point of this is, they were paid by a self-described public \ninterest group which has about 200 members. This group, the Project On \nGovernment Oversight, or POGO, has rather curious ties to law firms \nwhich have made millions of dollars from suing oil companies over oil \nroyalties. Make no mistake about who pays: The public.\n  As an example, POGO's board of directors has included lawyers who \nhave worked directly on these cases for years. The City of Long Beach, \nCA, lost the most recent case. An attorney for the city said they spent \nabout $100 million on the case. That is $100 million that could have \nbeen spent on education and was spent on lawyers instead.\n  The Department of the Interior is investigating, but it is illegal \nfor Federal employees to be paid for pursuing changes to Federal \nregulations by those who benefit from such changes. Our Secretary of \nthe Interior, what has he done? He has done nothing. The Interior \nDepartment had nothing to do with it.\n  The Hutchison amendment should be adopted to give time to work on a \nfair and simple regulation to States, Federal lessees, and taxpayers.\n  That chart is not a simplification. I commend my colleague for her \neffort to expose the truth behind the fiction we have heard so much \nabout today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska, the\n\n[[Page S11325]]\n\nchairman of the Energy Committee, who understands this issue and \nunderstands the importance of a stable oil and gas supply in our \ncountry.\n  It has been said that the States that have the most at stake are \nagainst my amendment. I submit for the Record a letter from the \nGovernor of Wyoming, who says:\n\n       Wyoming, as the largest stakeholder of federal oil royalty \n     receipts (35 percent), supports a fair and workable oil \n     valuation rule. However the current proposed rules contain \n     more uncertainty and will diminish incentives for industry to \n     lease, explore and produce on the immense amount of federal \n     acreage in Wyoming.\n\n  The Governor of the State of North Dakota wrote:\n\n       As a major recipient of income from Federal royalties, the \n     State of North Dakota supports reasonable rules for the \n     valuation of federal oil royalties. Unfortunately, the \n     current version of the rules proposed by MMS does not fit \n     that description.\n\n  The Governor of Montana:\n\n       The complexity and uncertainty inherent in the proposed MMS \n     rules may be a disincentive for industry, especially \n     Montana's independent producers, to lease and produce oil and \n     gas from federal lands. Such a disincentive will negatively \n     impact the production of oil and gas within Montana, \n     resulting in less royalty revenue for the state.\n\n  I think that is a very important point because we have been talking \nabout losing $60 million from the coffers of the Federal Government. \nBut in fact, if oil companies cannot drill because they cannot make a \nprofit because their costs will be higher than the price they can \ncharge, then they are not going to drill and there will be no money in \nthe Federal coffers--not $66 million; there will be a diminishing of \nthe amount of money that will come into the Federal Government.\n  I will submit these letters along with letters from the Secretary of \nEnergy of Oklahoma, Commissioner David Dewhurst from the Texas General \nLand Office, and the California Independent Petroleum Association. They \nwrite:\n\n       Please, Senator Hutchison, pass your amendment.\n\n  We have a list of the independents who say the MMS rule will be \nharmful to them. These are the small producers, those with 5 or 10 or \n15 employees, the families of which depend on this income. This is an \nindependent producer issue.\n  It comes down to this. Through the last 10 years, the price of \ngasoline at the pump has increased from $1.21 to $1.29 per gallon. But \nlet's look at where that increase has come from. The increase in taxes \nhas gone from 26 cents a gallon to 40 cents a gallon. The price of the \ncrude oil has actually gone down from 94 cents to 88 cents.\n  So the price has gone up. Why? Because taxes have increased. If we do \nnot pass the Hutchison amendment, taxes are going to increase again, \nand who is going to pay? It is going to be the hard-working American \nwho fills up his or her gas tank and has to pay a higher price because \nthere are higher taxes put on them in the name of increased royalty \nrates.\n  If we are going to have a tax increase for whatever purpose --for \nmore education spending, for the environment, for any purpose \nwhatsoever--let's call it a tax increase and let's vote on it up or \ndown. Let Congress take a stand because Congress is the one that will \nbe accountable to the people. Let's not let a Federal agency raise the \nprice of gasoline at the pump by raising taxes on oil in the name of \nnew oil royalty rates. Congress will not stand by and let an unelected \nFederal agency raise taxes on hard-working people in this country and \nthe price of gasoline at the pump.\n  The Senator from California said she would like to see editorials \ntomorrow in the paper saying: Congress cleans up its act. I would like \nto see editorials. I would like to see editorials that say: Congress \nrejected the rhetoric; it did not listen to arguments about lawsuits on \npresent regulations as if it would affect the future regulations; \nCongress stood up for its right to make tax policy in this country and \nnot to let tax increases affect the hard-working people of this \ncountry. That is the editorial I hope to see tomorrow.\n  I ask unanimous consent the letters I referred to and others be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 State of Wyoming,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                                September 8, 1999.\n     Hon.

Earl Pomeroy,\n     U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative Pomeroy: As a major recipient of income \n     from federal royalties, the State of North Dakota supports \n     reasonable rules for the valuation of federal oil royalties. \n     Unfortunately, the current version of the rules proposed by \n     the Minerals Management Service (MMS) does not fit that \n     description.\n       The rules currently proposed are vague, complex, and do not \n     solve the problem of properly determining oil value. If \n     adopted as currently proposed, the rules will increase MMS \n     administrative costs and oil valuation uncertainty.\n       Uncertainty in oil valuation works as a disincentive to \n     industry in its future efforts to produce oil and gas from \n     federal lands, resulting in a loss of income for North \n     Dakota.\n       Increased MMS administrative costs also harm North Dakota \n     through increased \n     billings under the federal government's net receipts sharing \n     laws.\n       Because of these considerations, I urge you to support an \n     extension of the congressionally mandated moratorium \n     preventing MMS from issuing final rules in the current form.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Edward T.

Conrad Burns,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Burns: I am writing to express this \n     administration's support for the Hutchison amendment to the \n     Department of Interior Appropriation Bill which would extend \n     the moratorium on Minerals Management Services (MMS) rule \n     making.\n       The complexity and uncertainty inherent in the proposed MMS \n     rules may be a disincentive for industry, especially \n     Montana's independent producers, to lease and produce oil and \n     gas from federal lands. Such a disincentive will negatively \n     impact the production of oil and gas within Montana, \n     resulting in less royalty for the state.\n       The moratorium will provide additional time for all \n     interested parties to develop a fair, workable and efficient \n     plan to collect federal royalties. During this additional one \n     year moratorium, all parties must work in earnest toward the \n     successful conclusion of this issue.\n\n[[Page S11326]]\n\n       Thank you for your support and understanding.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Mick Robinson,\n     Director of Policy\n                                  ____\n\n                                                State of Oklahoma,\n\n\n                            Office of the Secretary of Energy,\n\n                                               September 11, 1999.\n     Hon. Don Nickles,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nickles: I ask for your strong support of the \n     amendment to the Department of Interior appropriation bill \n     which would extend the moratorium on Minerals Management \n     Service oil valuation rulemaking. Oklahoma and the other oil-\n     producing states have worked hard to help create a simpler, \n     fairer method of valuing oil. The proposed MMS rules are \n     complicated and burdensome, particularly for independent \n     producers. I believe they will act as a disincentive to lease \n     and produce oil and gas from federal lands. Additionally, I \n     believe their complexity and uncertainty will mean increased \n     costs for the federal government and states.\n       Therefore, I strongly support extension of the current \n     moratorium until a valuation methodology can be derived which \n     satisfies the objective of capturing market value at the \n     lease in a simple, certain and efficient manner.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Carl Michael Smith,\n     Secretary of Energy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                Statement of Commissioner David Dewhurst\n\n                       Texas General Land Office\n\n       As an independent oilman who explored on and produced oil \n     and gas from MMS leases, I know firsthand the business risks \n     that are required in offshore exploration and production.

Therefore, I support \n     the position advocated by Senator Hutchison. The proposed MMS \n     rules are complicated and burdensome and would be a \n     disincentive for industry, particularly independent \n     producers, to lease and produce oil and gas from federal \n     lands. I am concerned that the net effect of these rules will \n     be less oil and gas is produced, and consequently less \n     royalty revenue for our school kids.\n                                  ____\n\n\nStatement from Texas Railroad Commission Chairman Tony Garza regarding \n     Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison's (R-Texas) effort to extend the \n  moratorium on the Mineral Management Service (MMS) proposed royalty \n                            valuation rule.\n\n       ``With oil imports continuing a dramatic rise, Senator \n     Hutchison's effort will help guard against the serious \n     security and economic risks associated with an American \n     marketplace dominated by foreign crude.

Kay Bailey Hutchison,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hutchison: The California Independent \n     Petroleum Association (CIPA) represents 450 independent oil \n     and gas producers, royalty owners and service companies \n     operating in California. CIPA wants to set the record \n     straight. The MMS oil royalty rulemaking affects all \n     California producers on federal land. It is false to claim \n     that this rulemaking only affects the top 5% of all \n     producers.\n       How are California independents affected? The proposed \n     rulemaking allows the government to second guess a wellhead \n     sale. If rejected, a California producer is subjected to an \n     ANS index that adjusts to the wellhead set by the government. \n     Using a government formula instead of actual proceeds results \n     in a new tax being imposed on all producers of federal oil.\n       It doesn't end, if a California producer chooses to move \n     its oil downstream of the well, the rulemaking will reject \n     many of the costs associated with these activities. Again, to \n     reject costs results in a new tax being levied on the \n     producer.\n       Senator Hutchison, California producers support your \n     amendment to extend the oil royalty rulemaking an additional \n     year. We offer our support not on behalf of the largest \n     producers in the world, but instead on behalf of independent \n     producers in the state of California. Your amendment will \n     provide the needed impetus to craft a rule that truly does \n     affect the small producer and creates a new rulemaking \n     framework that is fair and equitable for all parties.\n       Again, thank you for offering this amendment. We cannot \n     allow the government to unilaterally assess an additional tax \n     on independent producers. After record low oil prices, \n     California producers are barely beginning to travel down a \n     lengthy road to recovery. To assess a new tax at this time \n     could have a devastating effect on federal production and the \n     amount of royalties paid to the government.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Daniel P.

Kay Bailey Hutchison,\n     Senator, State of Texas,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hutchison: The National Black Chamber of \n     Commerce has been quite proud of the leadership you have \n     shown on the issue of oil royalties and the attempt of the \n     Minerals Management Service's, Department of Interior, to \n     levy eventual increases on the oil industry.\n       The efforts of MMS are, indeed, ludicrous. Collectively, \n     the national economy is booming and the chief subject matter \n     is ``tax reduction'' not ``royalty increase'', which is a \n     cute term for tax increase. What adds ``salt to the wound'' \n     is the fact that despite a booming economy from a national \n     perspective, the oil industry has not been so fortunate and \n     is on hard times. We need to come up with vehicles that will \n     stimulate this vital part of our economic bloodstream, not \n     further the damages.\n       We support your plan to re-offer a one-year extension of \n     the moratorium on the new rule proposed by MMS. We will also \n     support any efforts you may have to prohibit the new rule. \n     Good luck in giving it ``the good fight''.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Harry C.

Kay Bailey Hutchison,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Re: Supporting the Hutchison-Domenici Amendment (a \n     Moratorium on the Proposed Oil Valuation Rule which Prevents \n     Unauthorized Taxation and Lawmaking by the Department of \n     Interior).\n       Dear Senator Hutchison: We are writing to express our \n     support for the Hutchison-Domenici amendment to the FY 2000 \n     Appropriations bill. The Hutchison-Domenici amendment \n     prevents the Department of the Interior from rewriting laws \n     and assessing additional taxes without the consent of the \n     Congress. This role properly rests with the legislative \n     branch, not with unelected bureaucrats.\n       In a misleading letter dated July 21, 1999, detractors of \n     the Hutchison-Domenici amendment allege it will cost \n     ``taxpayers, schoolchildren, Native Americans, and the \n     environment.'' That is not so! It's time to set the record \n     straight--this amendment does not alter the status quo at \n     all. This amendment says to Secretary Babbitt: Spend no money \n     to finalize a crude oil valuation rule until the Congress \n     agrees with your proposed methodology for defining value for \n     royalty purposes.\n       We contend that a mineral lease is a contract, whether \n     issued by the United States or any other lessor, and as such, \n     its terms may not be unilaterally changed just because a \n     government bureaucracy thinks more money can be squeezed from \n     the lessee by redefining the manner in which the value of \n     production is established. What royalty amount is due is \n     determined by the contracts and statues, and nothing else. \n     For seventy-nine years the federal government has lived \n     according to a law that establishes that the government \n     receives value at the well--not downstream after incremental \n     value is added. The bureaucrats at the Interior Department \n     are in effect imposing a value added tax through the \n     backdoor.\n       This is nothing short of a backdoor tax via an unlawful, \n     inequitable rulemaking which Secretary Babbitt says is \n     necessary because of ``changing oil market.'' But, we think \n     his real result, and that of his supporters such as Senator \n     Boxer, is to cripple the domestic petroleum industry, and \n     drive them to foreign shores and advance their goal of \n     reducing fossil fuel consumption. This is why they falsely \n     claim that green eyeshade accounts somehow are impacting the \n     environment.\n       The outcry on behalf of schoolchildren is particularly \n     hypocritical. Senator Boxer and Rep. George Miller are \n     responsible for a mineral leasing law amendment in the 1993 \n     Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act which reduces education \n     revenues to the State of California by over $1 million per \n     year--far more than the Department's oil valuation rule would \n     add to California's treasury (approximately $150,000 per year \n     as scored by the Congressional Budget Office). So really, who \n     is harming schoolchildren's education budgets? The oil \n     industry provides millions and millions of royalty dollars \n     each year for the U.S. Treasury and for States' coffers.\n       The ``cheating'' which Sen. Boxer and others allege is \n     unproven. Reference to settlements by oil companies as proof \n     of fraud is improper. When President Clinton settled the \n     Paula Jones lawsuit his attorney admonished Senator Boxer and \n     her fellow jurors to take no legal inference from that \n     payment. We agree. As such, oil company settlements cannot be \n     given precedential value. Who can fight the government \n     forever when the royalty dollars they have paid in are used \n     to fund enormous litigation budgets?\n       Lastly, two employees of the federal government who were \n     integral to the ``futures market pricing'' philosophy \n     espoused in the Department's rulemaking have been caught \n     accepting $350,000 checks from a private group with a stake \n     in the outcome of False Claims Act litigation against oil \n     companies. Ironically, the money to pay-off these two\n\n[[Page S11327]]\n\n     individuals for their ``heroic'' actions while working as \n     federal employees came from a settlement by one oil company. \n     The Project on Government Oversight (POGO) last fall received \n     well over one million dollars as a plaintiff in the suit. \n     Shortly thereafter POGO quietly ``thanked'' these public \n     servants for making this bounty possible. The Public \n     Integrity Section of the Department of Justice has an ongoing \n     investigation. We find it unconscionable the Administration \n     seeks to put the valuation rule into place without getting to \n     the bottom of this bribe first. The L.A. Times recently drew \n     a parallel with the Teapot Dome scandal of the 1920's, but \n     who is Albert Fall in this modern day scandal?\n       The Department's rule amounts to unfair taxation without \n     the representation which Members of Congress bring by passing \n     laws. If Congress chooses to change the mineral leasing laws \n     to prospectively modify the terms of a lease, so be it. It \n     should do so in the proper authorizing process with \n     opportunity for the public to be heard. A federal judge has \n     recently ruled the EPA has unconstitutionally encroached upon \n     the legislature's lawmaking authority when promulgating air \n     quality rules. We are convinced the Secretary of the \n     Interior, in a similar manner, is far exceeding his authority \n     unilaterally by assessing a value added tax.\n       Let Congress define the law on mineral royalties. We \n     elected Members to do this job, we didn't elect Bruce Babbit \n     and a band of self-serving bureaucrats.

It is already a burden on a struggling \n     domestic oil and gas industry, and the Minerals Management \n     Service proposal simply adds insult to injury. Royalty \n     calculation is not, as Interior Communications Director \n     Michael Gauldin remarked, ``an issue to demagogue for another \n     year.'' With 52,000 jobs lost in just the last year?\n       Worse, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has suggested that \n     domestic oilfield workers look to opportunity overseas. \n     Senator, an Administration that talks about kicking American \n     resource producers out of the country has a badly skwed set \n     of priorities.\n       We appreciate what you are doing to straighten them out, \n     and will back you up at the grass roots any way we can.\n       Again, on behalf of thousands of hard-working American \n     resource producers, Thank you. If you have any specific \n     suggestions as to how we can assist you, feel free to contact \n     me any time.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                Jeffrey P.

The Minerals Management Service's (MMS) new oil \n     valuation proposal is, however, deeply flawed and would have \n     the ultimate effect of raising taxes on consumers.\n       The 1999 Omnibus Appropriations Act included moratorium \n     language concerning a final crude oil valuation rule with the \n     expectation that the Department of the Interior (DOI) and \n     industry would enter into meaningful negotiations in order to \n     resolve their differences. Unfortunately, more time is still \n     needed for government and industry is required to reach a \n     mutually beneficial compromise.\n       CSE recognizes this need and opposes any attempt to halt \n     the moratorium, or curtail efforts to bring about a simpler, \n     more workable rule.\n       Thank you for your attention and efforts, and for your \n     continuing leadership in this important matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Paul Beckner,\n                                                        President.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to state for the record \nthat, had I been able to, I would have voted against the Hutchison \namendment to the Interior appropriations bill, which proposed to \ncontinue a moratorium on revising Interior regulations governing how \nmuch oil companies pay for oil drilled on public lands and resources. I \nregret that previous commitments prevented my availability to be in the \nSenate for this critical vote.\n  This issue seems fairly straightforward. Oil companies are required \nto pay royalties for on- and off-shore oil drilling. Fees are based on \ncurrent law which clearly states that ``the value of production for \npurposes of computing royalty on production. . . shall never be less \nthan the fair market value of the production.'' Revenues generated from \nthese royalties are returned to the federal treasury. However, for many \nyears, oil companies have been allowed to set their own rates.\n  In the past, I have supported similar amendments which extended a \nmoratorium on rulemaking while affected parties were involved in \nnegotiations to update the regulations. However, this process has been \nstalled for years, with little possibility of reaching resolution \nbecause these legislative riders imposing a moratorium on regulation \nchanges have created a disincentive for oil companies to agree to any \nfee increases, resulting in taxpayers losing as much as $66 million a \nyear.\n  Who loses from this stalemate? The taxpayers--because royalties \nreturned to the federal treasury benefit states, Indian tribes, federal \nprograms such as the Historic Preservation Fund and the Land and Water \nConservation Fund, and national parks.\n  I supported cloture twice to end debate on this amendment because I \nbelieve we should vote on the underlying amendment to allow a fair and \nequitable solution of royalty valuation of oil on federal lands. On the \nfinal vote,\n\n[[Page S11328]]\n\nhowever, I would have opposed the Hutchison amendment to continue this \nmoratorium because I believe we should halt the process by which oil \ncompanies can set their own rules and determine how much they pay the \ntaypayers for the use of public assets. I do not support a structure \nwhich only serves to benefit big oil companies and allows them to \ncontinue to be subsidized by the taxpayers.\n  We should seek fairness for each and every industry doing business on \npublic lands using public assets, and we should insist that same \ntreatment be applied to oil companies. Fees that are assessed from \ndrilling oil on public lands are directed back to the federal treasury \nand these fees should reflect the true value of the benefit oil \ncompanies receive.\n  We have a responsibility, both as legislators and as public servants, \nto ensure responsible management of our public lands and a fair return \nto taxpayers. That responsibility includes determining a fair fee \nstructure for oil drilling on public lands. Despite passage of this \namendment which continues this moratorium for yet another year, I hope \nthat we can reach a reasonable agreement to ensure proper payment by \noil companies for utilizing public resources.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I had intended to offer to the fiscal year \n2000 Interior appropriations measure an amendment that would have \nrepealed a provision that the Congress tucked into last year's massive \nomnibus appropriations bill.\n  That provision established a one-year moratorium on any new or \nexpanded Indian Self-Determination Act contract, grant, or compact \nbetween the Bureau of Indian Affairs, or the Indian Health Service, and \nIndian tribes.\n  The establishment of this moratorium was a result of the growing \nshortfall between allowable contract support costs and the amounts \nappropriated for such costs.\n  The rationale when we imposed the moratorium was that shortfalls in \ncontract support costs would continue to increase as long as Indian \ntribes entered into new contracts with the BIA or IHS.\n  Therefore, it was argued that the best way to prevent these \nincreasing shortfalls simply would be to prevent the tribes from even \nentering into new contracts.\n  Logical as it may sound, the moratorium has had the practical effect \nof preventing many Indian tribes from providing their members with the \nmost basic of services, whether it involves health services, social \nservices, law enforcement or road maintenance.\n  Mr. President, while I have withdrawn my amendment at this time, I \nwould like to emphasize the importance of addressing this issue.\n  I would note that as we go to conference, the House version of this \nlegislation does not contain the provision which extends the moratorium \non self-determination contracts.\n  Mr. President, I ask my friend from New Mexico whether he is familiar \nwith Section 324 of H.R. 2466, the FY 2000 Interior appropriations \nmeasure, which is currently pending before the Senate.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I am familiar with this provision. Section 324 extends \nthe one-year moratorium established last year prohibiting Indian tribes \nfrom entering into or expanding existing Self-Determination Act \ncontracts, grants or compacts with the Bureau of Indian Affairs or the \nIndian Health Service.\n  Mr. REID. I would also ask the Senator to explain the effect of the \nmoratorium contained within Section 324 of this legislation.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Certainly. While this moratorium was established to \naddress the growing shortfall between allowable contract support costs \nand the amounts appropriated for such costs, the practical effect of \nthe prohibition has been to prevent many Indian tribes from providing \ntheir members with the most basic of services, whether it involves \nhealth services, social services, law enforcement or road maintenance.\n  Mr. REID. I concur with the Senator.\n  A prime example of this effect involves the Washoe Tribe of Nevada \nand California, which was prevented from entering into a contract for \nthe most basic service, even though they were willing to proceed \ndespite the realization that their contract support costs would not be \nfully covered.\n  In the Alpine Country of the Washoe tribal lands, huge amounts of \nsnowfall are not uncommon. The BIA has a snowplow, and until recently, \nalso had a snowplow operator who would help clear snow after the lands \nwere hit by storms. The BIA operator recently retired, however, so the \ntribe made plans to contract with the BIA, under the Indian Self-\nDetermination Act, to take possession of the plow in order to allow a \nfully-trained tribe member to operate the truck and clear the snow.\n  You can imagine their surprise, therefore, when the local BIA office \ninformed them that they were prohibited by statute from entering into \nthat contract for such a simple, yet important, task of clearing snow.\n  The inability to clear snow in a timely fashion created a logistical \nnightmare and a safety hazard, not to mention further strains on an \nalready-strained tribal economy.\n  For the Washoe Tribe, contract support funds weren't the primary \nconcern; the safety and well-being of the tribe's members superseded \nthat concern.\n  I ask the Senator from New Mexico if he is familiar with these types \nof consequences.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I say to the senior Senator from Nevada that I am very \nfamiliar with this reality. In my home State of New Mexico, I have seen \nseveral instances where Indian tribes have been unable to provide their \nmembers with the most basic of services because the moratorium \nprohibits them from contracting with BIA or IHS.\n  Mr. REID. Isn't it also true that the House of Representatives, \nduring its consideration of the fiscal year 2000 Interior \nappropriations measure, removed the moratorium from its version of the \nlegislation.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. The Senator is correct. During the debate of H.R. 2466 \nin the House, Representative Dale Kildee of Michigan raised a point of \norder against the provision containing the moratorium on the grounds \nthat the language violated a rule against legislating on appropriations \nbills.\n  Mr. REID. And, isn't it also true that the Chair upheld that point of \norder, thereby striking the moratorium provision from the House \nmeasure.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. The Senator from Nevada is correct. The House version \nof the fiscal year 2000 Interior appropriations does not contain a \nmoratorium prohibiting Indian tribes from entering into or expanding \nexisting Self-Determination Act contracts, grants or compacts with the \nBureau of Indian Affairs or the Indian Health Service.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Senator from New Mexico and urge my colleagues \nto reevaluate this issue as we head to conference with the House.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I call upon my colleagues to support the \nfiscal year 2000 Interior appropriations bill which will help preserve \nour natural wonders. The bill contains an amendment that I offered \nwhich would direct the forest service to conduct a study of the \nseverity of Mountain Pine Beetle in the Rocky Mountain Region and \nreport back to Congress within six months after enactment on how to \naddress this problem. As adopted the amendment would not have any \nbudget ramifications.\n  My amendment is in the interest of our national forests. According to \nthe Forest Service this outbreak of the Pine Beetle infestation is \nsimilar to the one that occurred in the 1970's. During that period \nthere were peak annual losses of over 1 million trees as a result of \nthe beetle. Right now we are seeing the beginning of another epidemic, \nwhich is continuing to grow.\n  There are a number of factors which contribute to the current \nMountain Pine Beetle problem--the general lack of forest management, \nwhich includes proper timber harvesting, and increased susceptibility \nresulting from the suppression of forest fires.\n  The current infestation is in the northern two-thirds of the front \nrange of Colorado where the largest number of people live in my home \nstate. Surveys by the Forest Service and Colorado State Forest Service \nsurvey shows 12,891 dead trees detected in 1996; 32,445 in 1997; and \n74,288 in 1998. All indications are that we will see a staggering \n150,000 trees infested in 1999. It is clear that if this trend \ncontinues we will see an outbreak worse than the 1970's. I am also \nconcerned about the high possibility that dead timber from the pine \nbeetle will catch on fire and wreak havoc on Colorado's front range.\n\n[[Page S11329]]\n\n  It is important for Congress to address this problem now before it \ngets out of control and the people of Colorado find themselves with \nthousands of dead trees. I urge my colleagues to support passage of the \nbill.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask for third reading of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment of the \namendments and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read a third time.\n  Mr. GORTON. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read for the third time, \nthe question is, Shall the bill pass? On this question, the yeas and \nnays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

The Secretary may accept gifts \n     and donations pursuant to the Act of October 10, 1978 (7 \n     U.S.C. 2269) including gifts and donations from a donor that \n     conducts business with any agency of the Department of \n     Agriculture or is regulated by the Secretary of Agriculture.\n       (c) The Secretary is hereby and hereafter authorized to \n     operate and utilize the assets of the Wood Education and \n     Resource Center (previously named the Robert C. Byrd Hardwood \n     Technology Center in West Virginia) as part of a newly formed \n     ``Institute of Hardwood Technology Transfer and Applied \n     Research'' (hereinafter the ``Institute''). The Institute, in \n     addition to the Wood Education and Resource Center, will \n     consist of a Director, technology transfer specialists from \n     State and Private Forestry, the Forestry Sciences Laboratory \n     in Princeton, West Virginia, and any other organizational \n     unit of the Department of Agriculture as the Secretary deems \n     appropriate. The overall management of the Institute will be \n     the responsibility of the USDA Forest Service, State and \n     Private Forestry.\n       (d) The Secretary is hereby and hereafter authorized to \n     generate revenue using the authorities provided herein. Any \n     revenue received as part of the operation of the Institute \n     shall be deposited into a special fund in the Treasury of the \n     United States, known as the ``Hardwood Technology Transfer \n     and Applied Research Fund'', which shall be available to the \n     Secretary until expended, without further appropriation, in \n     furtherance of the purposes of this section, including \n     upkeep, management, and operation of the Institute and the \n     payment of salaries and expenses.\n       (e) There are hereby and hereafter authorized to be \n     appropriated such sums as necessary to carry out the \n     provisions of this section.\n       Sec. 327. No timber in Region 10 of the Forest Service \n     shall be advertised for sale which, when using domestic \n     Alaska western red cedar selling values and manufacturing \n     costs, fails to provide at least 60 percent of normal profit \n     and risk of\n\n[[Page S11344]]\n\n     the appraised timber, except at the written request by a \n     prospective bidder. Program accomplishments shall be based on \n     volume sold. Should Region 10 sell, in fiscal year 2000, the \n     annual average portion of the decadal allowable sale quantity \n     called for in the current Tongass Land Management Plan which \n     provides greater than 60 percent of normal profit and risk at \n     the time of the sale advertisement, all of the western red \n     cedar timber from those sales which is surplus to the needs \n     of domestic processors in Alaska, shall be made available to \n     domestic processors in the contiguous 48 United States based \n     on values in the Pacific Northwest as determined by the \n     Forest Service and stated in the timber sale contract. Should \n     Region 10 sell, in fiscal year 2000, less than the annual \n     average portion of the decadal allowable sale quantity called \n     for in the current Tongass Land Management Plan meeting the \n     60 percent of normal profit and risk standard at the time of \n     sale advertisement, the volume of western red cedar timber \n     available to domestic processors at rates specified in the \n     timber sale contract in the contiguous 48 states shall be \n     that volume: (i) which is surplus to the needs of domestic \n     processors in Alaska; and (ii) is that percent of the surplus \n     western red cedar volume determined by calculating the ratio \n     of the total timber volume which has been sold on the Tongass \n     to the annual average portion of the decadal allowable sale \n     quantity called for in the current Tongass Land Management \n     Plan. The percentage shall be calculated by Region 10 on a \n     rolling basis as each sale is sold. (For purposes of this \n     amendment, a ``rolling basis'' shall mean that the \n     determination of how much western red cedar is eligible for \n     sale to various markets shall be made at the time each sale \n     is awarded.) Western red cedar shall be deemed ``surplus to \n     the needs of domestic processors in Alaska'' when the timber \n     sale holder has presented to the Forest Service documentation \n     of the inability to sell western red cedar logs from a given \n     sale to domestic Alaska processors at a price equal to or \n     greater than the log selling value stated in the contract. \n     All additional western red cedar volume not sold to Alaska or \n     contiguous 48 United States domestic processors may be \n     exported to foreign markets at the election of the timber \n     sale holder. All Alaska yellow cedar may be sold at \n     prevailing export prices at the election of the timber sale \n     holder.\n       Sec. 328.

In return, the \n     Forest Service shall agree to abide by the bargaining and \n     arbitration process set out in this section.\n       (b) Opt Out.--After the Forest Service and landowner have \n     entered into the purchase option agreement, the landowner may \n     at any time prior to federal acquisition voluntarily opt out \n     of the purchase option agreement.\n       (c) Selection of Appraisers.--Once the landowner and Forest \n     Service both have executed the required purchase option, the \n     landowner and Forest Service each shall select an appraiser \n     to appraise the land or interest in land described in the \n     purchase option. The landowner and Forest Service both shall \n     instruct their appraiser to estimate the fair market value of \n     the land or interest in land to be acquired. The landowner \n     and Forest Service both\n\n[[Page S11345]]\n\n     shall instruct their appraiser to comply with the Uniform \n     Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions \n     (Interagency Land Acquisition Conference 1992) and Public Law \n     91-646 as amended. Both appraisers shall possess \n     qualifications consistent with state regulatory requirements \n     that meet the intent of Title XI, Financial Institutions \n     Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989.\n       (d) Period to Complete Appraisals.--The landowner and \n     Forest Service each shall be allowed a period of 180 days to \n     provide to the other an appraisal of the land or interest in \n     land described in the purchase option. This 180-day period \n     shall commence upon execution of a purchase option by the \n     landowner and the Forest Service.\n       (e) Bargaining Period.--Once the landowner and Forest \n     Service each have provided to the other a completed \n     appraisal, a 45-day period of good faith bargaining and \n     negotiation shall commence. If the landowner and Forest \n     Service cannot agree within this period on the proper \n     purchase price to be paid by the United States for the land \n     or interest in land described in the purchase option, the \n     landowner may request arbitration under subsection (f) of \n     this section.\n       (f) Arbitration Process.--If a landowner and the Forest \n     Service are unable to reach a negotiated settlement on value \n     within the 45-day period of good faith bargaining and \n     negotiation, during the 10 days following this period of good \n     faith bargaining and negotiation the landowner may request \n     arbitration. The process for arbitration shall commence with \n     each party submitting its appraisal and a copy of this \n     legislation, and only its appraisal and a copy of this \n     legislation, to the arbitration panel within 10 days \n     following the receipt by the Forest Service of the request \n     for arbitration. The arbitration panel shall render a written \n     advisory decision on value within 45 days of receipt of both \n     appraisals. This advisory decision shall be forwarded to the \n     Secretary of Agriculture by the arbitration panel with a \n     recommendation to the Secretary that if the land or interest \n     in land at issue is to be purchased that the United States \n     pay a sum certain for the land or interest in land. This sum \n     certain shall fall within the value range established by the \n     two appraisals. Costs of employing the arbitration panel \n     shall be divided equally between the Forest Service and the \n     landowner, unless the arbitration panel recommends either the \n     landowner or the Forest Service bear the entire cost of \n     employing the arbitration panel. The arbitration panel shall \n     not make such a recommendation unless the panel finds that \n     one of the appraisals submitted fails to conform to the \n     Uniform Appraisal Standard for Federal Land Acquisition \n     (Interagency Land Acquisition Conference 1992). In no event, \n     shall the cost of employing the arbitration panel exceed \n     $10,000.\n       (g) Arbitration Panel.--The arbitration panel shall consist \n     of one appraiser and two lawyers who have substantial \n     experience working with the purchase of land and interests in \n     land by the United States. The Secretary is directed to ask \n     the Federal Center for Dispute Resolution at the American \n     Arbitration Association to develop lists of no less than ten \n     appraisers and twenty lawyers who possess substantial \n     experience working with federal land purchases to serve as \n     third-party neutrals in the event arbitration is requested by \n     a landowner. Selection of the arbitration panel shall be made \n     by mutual agreement of the Forest Service and landowner. If \n     mutual agreement cannot be reached on one or more panel \n     members, selection of the remaining panel members shall be by \n     blind draw once each party has been allowed the opportunity \n     to strike up to 25 percent of the third-party neutrals named \n     on either list. Of the funds available to the Forest Service, \n     up to $15,000 shall be available to the Federal Center for \n     Dispute Resolution to cover the initial cost of establishing \n     this program. Once established, costs of administering the \n     program shall be borne by the Forest Service, but shall not \n     exceed $5,000 a year.\n       (h) Qualifications of Third-Party Neutrals.--Each appraiser \n     selected by the Federal Dispute Resolution Center, in \n     addition to possessing substantial experience working with \n     federal land purchases, shall possess qualifications \n     consistent with state regulatory requirements that meet the \n     intent of Title XI, Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery & \n     Enforcement Act of 1989. Each lawyer selected by the Federal \n     Dispute Resolution Center, in addition to possessing \n     substantial experience working with federal land purchases, \n     shall be an active member in good standing of the bar of one \n     of the 50 states or the District of Columbia.\n       (i) Decision Required by the Secretary of Agriculture.--\n     Upon receipt of a recommendation by an arbitration panel \n     appointed under subsection (g), the Secretary of Agriculture \n     shall notify the landowner and the CRGNSA of the day the \n     recommendation was received. The Secretary shall make a \n     determination to adopt or reject the arbitration panel's \n     advisory decision and notify the landowner and the CRGNSA of \n     this determination within 45 days of receipt of the advisory \n     decision.\n       (j) Admissability.--Neither the fact that arbitration \n     pursuant to this act has occurred nor the recommendation of \n     the arbitration panel shall be admissible in any court or \n     administrative proceeding.\n       (k) Expiration Date.--This act shall expire on October 1, \n     2002.\n       Sec. 338. A project undertaken by the Forest Service under \n     the Recreation Fee Demonstration Program as authorized by \n     Section 315 of the Department of the Interior and Related \n     Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1996, as amended, \n     shall not result in--\n       (1) displacement of the holder of an authorization to \n     provide commercial recreation services on Federal lands. \n     Prior to initiating any project, the Secretary shall consult \n     with potentially affected holders to determine what impacts \n     the project may have on the holders. Any modifications to the \n     authorization shall be made within the terms and conditions \n     of the authorization and authorities of the impacted agency.\n       (2) the return of a commercial recreation service to the \n     Secretary for operation when such services have been provided \n     in the past by a private sector provider, except when--\n       (A) the private sector provider fails to bid on such \n     opportunities,\n       (B) the private sector provider terminates its relationship \n     with the agency, or,\n       (C) the agency revokes the permit for non-compliance with \n     the terms and conditions of the authorization.\n\n     In such cases, the agency may use the Recreation Fee \n     Demonstration Program to provide for operations until a \n     subsequent operator can be found through the offering of a \n     new prospectus.\n       Sec. 339.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \ninsist on its amendment and request a conference with the House on the \ndisagreeing votes of the two Houses, and that the Chair be authorized \nto appoint conferees on behalf of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Presiding Officer (Mr. Sessions) appointed Mr. Gorton, Mr. \nStevens, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Burns, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Gregg, \nMr. Campbell, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Reid, Mr. Dorgan, \nMr. Kohl, and Mrs. Feinstein conferees on the part of the Senate.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the talents of my Staff Director, Bruce \nEvans, are exceeded only by his patience.\n  This bill has been on and off the floor for the better part of two \nmonths at this point and has now been passed by a fairly near unanimous \nvote as against the situation a year ago when we were barely able to \nbegin debate on it.\n  Mr. Evans has led the staff of both parties with great skill and \ndedication and has kept me out of many troubles I might otherwise have \nhad. Perhaps the best tribute to that is the fact that no changes were \nmade in this bill in this 2-month period as a result of contested votes \non the floor of the Senate. Many were made as a result of reasonable \nrequests on the part of many of our Members.\n  I thank my ranking minority member, the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom West Virginia, whose help and cooperation from the beginning of my \nchairmanship of this subcommittee has been unfailing and of immense \neffect.\n  Mr. President, I would once again like to thank both my staff and \nSenator Byrd's staff for all the hard work they have done on this bill. \nThe Minority Clerk, Kurt Dodd, has been a pleasure to work with in his \nfirst full year with the Committee. He has proven to be a valuable \nresource for my staff through both his knowledge of the programs in \nthis bill and his advocacy on behalf of members on the other side of \nthe aisle. Kurt has been ably assisted by Carole Geagley of the \nminority staff, and by Liz Gelfer, whom we have enjoyed having on \ndetail from the Department of Energy.\n  My own subcommittee staff has also had benefit of an agency detailee \nthis year. Sean Marsan has been with us courtesy of the U.S. Fish and \nWildlife Service, and has done a wonderful job on a number of special \nprojects. He has also performed well the laborious task of logging the \nthousands of member requests that the Subcommittee receives from \nmembers of this body. For those of my colleagues who have particular \nprograms or projects funded in this bill--and I think I can safely say \nthat includes each one of you--you owe Sean a debt of gratitude for \nkeeping your ample requests in some sort of manageable order.\n  I also want to thank the subcommittee professional staff for all of \ntheir good work. Ginny James continues to do a great job with the many \ncultural agencies funded in this bill, as well as with the Indian \nHealth Service and U.S. Geological Survey accounts. I am pleased that \nwe were able this year to provide modest increases for both the NEA and \nNEH, and hope that the two endowments appreciate the role\n\n[[Page S11347]]\n\nGinny has played in making this possible. It is not an easy thing to \nshepherd and provide counsel to the enthusiastic, but sometimes over-\neager, arts community.\n  Anne McInerney of the subcommittee staff has been responsible for the \nFish and Wildlife Service and Bureau of Indian Affairs accounts, and \nthis year took on the added responsibility of managing the land \nacquisition accounts for the four land management agencies. Members of \nthis body continue to put individual land acquisition projects toward \nthe top of their priority lists, making it quite a challenge to balance \nthose priorities against the core operating needs of the agencies \nfunded in this bill. Anne has done a marvelous job in this regard, as \nwell as in helping me address the many management challenges faced by \nthe Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Office of the Special Trustee.\n  Leif Fonnesbeck is in his first full year with the Committee staff. \nHe has in effect been thrown in the deep end by being assigned the \nForest Service and Bureau of Land Management accounts, where he \nprobably will spend as much time on policy issues as on more \ntraditional appropriations matters. Of the half dozen or so amendments \nthat have been debated and voted upon during consideration of this \nbill, I think all but one have been related to Leif's area of \nresponsibility. He has acquitted himself very well, and has proven to \nbe a quick study. We are glad to have him with us.\n  Joe Norrell is also new to our subcommittee this year. Joe performs \nduties for both the Interior subcommittee and the VA/HUD subcommittee \nchaired by Senator Bond, and as such is frequently pulled in two \ndifferent directions by two different masters. He has handled this \ndifficult challenge with commitment and good humor, and has been a \ngreat help to both subcommittees.\n  Finally, I would also like to thank Kari Vander Stoep of my personal \nstaff for her work on the issues in this bill that are of particular \nimportance to the people of Washington state. Kari has done a wonderful \njob in this regard since her predecessor, Chuck Berwick, departed for \nbusiness school.\n  Each of these individuals has already spent many late nights working \non this bill, and will likely spend many more such nights over the \ncoming weeks as we move to conference with the House. I want to express \nmy own gratitude for their good work, and also convey the appreciation \nof the Ranking Member, Senator Byrd, and that of the Senate as a whole.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/23/senate-section/article/S11347-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11347]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.R. 2684\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

I further ask consent \nno amendment be in order to the Wellstone amendment prior to the vote, \nand I ask consent that the vote occur at 9:30 a.m. on Friday, with 2 \nminutes for debate for closing remarks prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. As a result of this agreement, there will be no further \nvotes this evening. The first vote tomorrow will be at approximately \n9:35 a.m. It is anticipated further votes will occur tomorrow in an \neffort to conclude HUD-VA. I talked with Senator Daschle.

One final thing, and then the managers can go forward. It \nis my understanding some of the debate today was not germane to the \nissue on oil royalties, the issue on which 60 Members voted to invoke \ncloture earlier today.\n  Rule XXII clearly states all debate must be germane. Senators Thomas \nand Senator Hutchison of Texas raised a point of order to guide the \ndebate back to the pending oil royalties subject. The Chair on first \nblush ruled the debate does not have to be germane.\n  To better clarify the position of the chairman, I now make a \nparliamentary inquiry. Is there a requirement under rule XXII that all \ndebate postcloture must be germane to the issue on which cloture was \ninvoked?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. All debate postcloture \nmust be germane to the issue on which cloture was invoked.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if a Senator speaks on a subject that is \nnongermane to the pending issue, is it in order for any Member to raise \na point of order against the debate in question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is in order for any Member to raise a point \nof order relative to the debate. When such a point of order is raised, \nthe Chair will decide if the debate in question is germane or \nnongermane. If the debate is determined to be germane, the debate in \nquestion will resume. If the debate is determined to be nongermane, the \nSenator will be warned to keep his remarks germane to the pending \nquestion. If the Senator continues to speak on a nongermane basis and \nany Senator raises a point of order against the debate content, the \nChair would restate the rule on which the violation is occurring and \nthe Senator in question would immediately lose the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Chair for that clarification. I therefore \nwithdraw a pending appeal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The appeal is withdrawn.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I just want to make one clarification \nconcerning the colloquy between the majority leader and the Chair. I \nhave no disagreement with the statements of the Chair concerning the \nSenate rule on germaneness during the post-cloture debate. However, the \nmajority leader prefaced his inquiry with the statement that it was his \nunderstanding that some debate on the oil royalties amendment was not \ngermane. I want to make clear that there was never a ruling that any \nparticular statement made during the debate by any Senator was not \ngermane. I am confident that my remarks during this debate were germane \nto the issue at hand and I do not interpret the Chair's statement in \nthis colloquy to have suggested or ruled otherwise.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/23/senate-section/article/S11347-3", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11347-S11354]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nDEPARTMENTS OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND \n         INDEPENDENT AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2000--Resumed\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 17, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n       Sec. 108. (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) One of the most outrageous examples of the failure of \n     the Federal Government to honor its obligations to veterans \n     involves the so-called ``atomic veterans'', patriotic \n     Americans who were exposed to radiation at Hiroshima and \n     Nagasaki and at nuclear test sites.\n       (2) For more than 50 years, many atomic veterans have been \n     denied veterans compensation for diseases, known as \n     radiogenic diseases, that the Department of Veterans Affairs \n     recognizes as being linked to exposure to radiation. Many of \n     these diseases are lethal forms of cancer.\n       (3) The Department of Veterans Affairs almost invariably \n     denies the claims for compensation of atomic veterans on the \n     grounds that the radiation doses received by such veterans \n     were too low to result in radiogenic disease, even though \n     many scientists and former Under Secretary for Health Kenneth \n     Kizer agree that the dose reconstruction analyses conducted \n     by the Department of Defense are unreliable.\n       (4) Although the Department of Veterans Affairs already has \n     a list of radiogenic diseases that are presumed to be \n     service-connected, the Department omits three diseases--lung \n     cancer, colon cancer, and central nervous system cancer--from \n     that list, notwithstanding the agreement of scientists that \n     the evidence of a link between the three diseases and low-\n     level exposure to radiation is very convincing and, in many \n     cases, is stronger than the evidence of a link between such \n     exposure and other radiogenic diseases currently on that \n     list.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     lung cancer, colon cancer, and brain and central nervous \n     system cancer should be added to the list of radiogenic \n     diseases that are presumed by the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs to be service-connected disabilities.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a sense-of-the-\nSenate amendment that speaks to the frustrating and infuriating \nobstacles that have too often kept veterans who were exposed to \nradiation during military service from getting the disability \ncompensation they deserve. This amendment would put the senate on \nrecord as being in favor of adding three radiogenic conditions to the \nlist of presumptively service-connected diseases for which atomic \nveterans may receive VA compensation, specifically: lung cancer, colon \ncancer; and tumors of the brain and central nervous system. It is based \non a bill I introduced during the last Congress S. 1385, the Justice \nfor Atomic Veterans Act.\n  But before I speak on the merits of this amendment, I'd like to talk \nabout the frustrating and infuriating obstacles that have beset this \namendment in the Senate. I offered an amendment to make the needed \nchange in the law on S. 4, the Soldiers', Sailors;', Airmen's, and \nMarines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999. It was accepted and adopted by the \nSenate by voice vote. When it became clear that S. 4 was dead on \narrival in the house, I offered this amendment to the Defense \nDepartment authorization bill. Again, the amendment was accepted, but \nit was stripped out in conference. I mention the history of this \namendment to my colleagues in the belief that what was acceptable to \nthe Senate three months ago will be acceptable today. But to put my \ncolleagues on notice that this time I am going to insist on a roll call \nvote and to make it clear that I will be back to offer the actual \namendment as many times as I have to so that justice can be done by the \natomic veteran.\n  I believe that the way we treat our veterans does send an important \nmessage to young people considering service in the military. When \nveterans of the Persian Gulf war don't get the kind of treatment they \ndeserve, when the VA health care budget loses out year after year to \nother budget priorities, when veterans benefits claims take years and \nyears to resolve, what is the message we are sending to future \nrecruits?\n  How can we attract and retain young people in the service when our \ngovernment fails to honor its obligation to provide just compensation \nand health care for those injured during service?\n  One of the most outrageous examples of our government's failure to \nhonor its obligations to veterans involves ``atomic veterans,'' \npatriotic Americans who were exposed to radiation at Hiroshima and \nNagasaki and at atmospheric nuclear tests.\n  For more than 50 years, many of them have been denied compensation \nfor diseases that the VA recognizes as being linked to their exposure \nto radiation--diseases known as radiogenic diseases. Many of these \ndiseases are lethal forms of cancers. I'm sure many of my colleagues \nhave seen the recent headlines about the exposure of workers at the \nnuclear plant in Paducah, Kentucky. The story of the atomic veteran is \nvery much the same.\n  I received my first introduction to the plight of atomic veterans \nfrom some first-rate mentors, the members of the Forgotten 216th. The \nForgotten 216th was the 216th Chemical Service Company of the U.S. \nArmy, which participated in Operation Tumbler Snapper. Operation \nTumbler Snapper was a series of eight atmospheric nuclear weapons tests \nin the Nevada desert in 1952.\n  About half of the members of the 216th were Minnesotans. What I've \nlearned from them, from other atomic veterans, and from their survivors \nhas shaped my views on this issue.\n  Five years ago, the Forgotten 216th contacted me after then-Secretary \nof Energy O'Leary announced that the U.S. Government had conducted \nradiation experiments on its own citizens. For the first time in \npublic, they revealed what went on during the Nevada tests and the \ntragedies and trauma that they, their families, and their former \nbuddies had experienced since then.\n  Because their experiences and problems typify those of atomic \nveterans nationwide, I'd like to tell my colleagues a little more about \nthe Forgotten 216th. When you hear their story, I think you have to \nagree that the Forgotten 216th and other veterans like them must never \nbe forgotten again.\n  Members of the 216th were sent to measure fallout at or near ground \nzero immediately after a nuclear blast. They were exposed to so much \nradiation that their Geiger counters went off the scale while they \ninhaled and ingested radioactive particles. They were given minimal or \nno protection. They frequently had no film badges to measure radiation \nexposure. They were given no information on the perils they faced.\n  Then they were sworn to secrecy about their participation in nuclear \ntests. They were often denied access to their own service medical \nrecords. And they were provided no medical follow-up.\n  For decades, atomic veterans have been America's most neglected \nveterans. They have been deceived and treated shabbily by the \ngovernment they served so selflessly and unquestioningly.\n  If the U.S. Government can't be counted on to honor its obligation to \nthese deserving veterans, how can young people interested in the \nmilitary service have any confidence that their government will do any \nbetter by them?\n  Mr. President, I believe the neglect of atomic veterans should stop \nhere and now. Our government has a long overdue debt to these patriotic \nAmericans, a debt that we in the Senate must help to repay. I urge my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to help repay this debt by \nsupporting this amendment.\n  My legislation and this amendment have enjoyed the strong support \nof veterans service organizations. Recently, the Independent Budget for \nFY 2000, which is a budget recommendation issued by AMVETS, Disabled \nAmerican Veterans (DAV), Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA), and the \nVeterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), endorsed adding these radiogenic \ndiseases to VA's presumptive service-connected list.\n\n[[Page S11349]]\n\n  Let me briefly describe the problem that my amendment is intended to \naddress. When atomic veterans try to claim VA compensation for their \nillnesses, VA almost invariably denies their claims. VA tells these \nveterans that their radiation doses were too low--below 5 rems.\n  But the fact is, we don't really know that and, even if we did, \nthat's no excuse for denying these claims. The result of this \nunrealistic standard is that it is almost impossible for these atomic \nveterans to prove their case. The only solution is to add these \nconditions to the VA presumptive service-connected list, and that's \nwhat my amendment does.\n  First of all, trying to go back and determine the precise dosage each \nof these veterans was exposed to is a futile undertaking. Scientists \nagree that the dose reconstruction performed for the VA is notoriously \nunreliable.\n  GAO itself has noted the inherent uncertainties of dose \nreconstruction. Even VA scientific personnel have conceded its \nunreliability. In a memo to VA Secretary Togo West, Under Secretary for \nHealth Kenneth Kizer has recommended that the VA reconsider its \nopposition to S. 1385 based, in part, on the unreliability of dose \nreconstruction.\n  In addition, none of the scientific experts who testified at a Senate \nVeterans' Affairs Committee hearing on S. 1385 on April 21, 1998, \nsupported the use of dose reconstruction to determine eligibility for \nVA benefits.\n  Let me explain why dose reconstruction is so difficult. Dr. Marty \nGensler on my staff has researched this issue for over five years, and \nthis is what he has found.\n  Many atomic veterans were sent to ground zero immediately after a \nnuclear test with no protection, no information on the known dangers \nthey faced, no badges or other monitoring equipment, and no medical \nfollow up.\n  As early as 1946, ranking military and civilian personnel responsible \nfor nuclear testing anticipated claims for service-connected disability \nand sought to ensure that ``no successful suits could be brought on \naccount of radiological hazards.'' That quotation comes from documents \ndeclassified by the President's Advisory Committee on Human Radiation \nExperiments.\n  The VA, during this period, maintained classified records \n``essential'' to evaluating atomic veterans' claims, but these records \nwere unavailable to veterans themselves.\n  Atomic veterans were sworn to secrecy and were denied access to their \nown service and medical records for many years, effectively barring \npursuit of compensation claims.\n  It's partly as a result of these missing or incomplete records that \nso many people have doubts about the validity of dose reconstructions \nfor atomic veterans, some of which are performed more than fifty years \nafter exposure.\n  Even if these veterans' exposure was less than 5 rems, which is the \nstandard use by VA, this standard is not based on uncontested science. \nIn 1994, for example, GAO stated: ``A low level dose has been estimated \nto be somewhere below 10 rems [but] it is not known for certain whether \ndoses below this level are detrimental to public health.''\n  Despite persistent doubts about VA's and DoD's dose reconstruction, \nand despite doubts about the science on which VA's 5 rem standard is \nbased, these dose reconstructions are used to bar veterans from \ncompensation for disabling radiogenic conditions.\n  The effects of this standard have been devastating. A little over two \nyears ago the VA estimated that less than 50 claims for non-presumptive \ndiseases had been approved out of over 18,000 radiation claims filed.\n  Atomic veterans might as well not even bother. Their chances of \nobtaining compensation are negligible.\n  It is impossible for many atomic veterans and their survivors to be \ngiven ``the benefit of the doubt'' by the VA while their claims hinge \non the dubious accuracy and reliability of dose reconstruction and the \nhealth effects of exposure to low-level ionizing radiation remain \nuncertain.\n  This problem can be fixed. The reason atomic veterans have to go \nthrough this reconstruction at all is that the diseases listed in my \namendment are not presumed to be service-connected. That's the real \nproblem.\n  VA already has a list of service-connected diseases that are presumed \nservice-connected, but these are not on it.\n  This makes no sense. Scientists agree that there is at least as \nstrong a link between radiation exposure and these diseases as there is \nto the other diseases on that VA list.\n  Mr. President, you might ask why I've included these three diseases \nin particular--lung cancer; colon cancer; and tumors of the brain and \ncentral nervous system--in my amendment. The reason is very simple. The \nbest, most current, scientific evidence available justifies their \ninclusion. A paper entitled ``Risk Estimates for Radiation Exposure'' \nby John D. Boice, Jr., of the National Cancer Institute, published in \n1996 as part of a larger work called Health Effects of Exposure to Low-\nLevel Ionizing Radiation, includes a table which rates human cancers by \nthe strength of the evidence linking them to exposure to low levels of \nionizing radiation. According to this study, the evidence of a link for \nlung cancer is ``very strong''--the highest level of confidence--and \nthe evidence of a link for colon and brain and central nervous system \ncancers is ``convincing''--the next highest level of confidence. So I \nbelieve I can say with a great deal of certainty, Mr. President, that \nscience is on the side of this amendment.\n\n  Last year, the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee reported out a \nversion of S. 1385, the Justice for Atomic Veterans Act, which included \nthree diseases to be added to the VAs presumptive list. Two of those \ndiseases, lung cancer and brain and central nervous system cancer, I \nhave included in my amendment. The third disease included in the \nreported bill was ovarian cancer. Mr. President, I'd like to explain \nwhy I substituted colon cancer for ovarian cancer. It is true that the \n1996 study I just cited states that the evidence of a linkage for \novarian cancer to low level ionizing radiation is ``convincing,'' just \nas it is for colon cancer. But Mr. President, there are no female \natomic veterans. The effect of creating a presumption of service \nconnection for ovarian cancer is basically no effect--because no one \ncould take advantage of it. However, the impact of adding colon cancer \nas a presumption for atomic veterans is significant; atomic veterans \nwill be able to take advantage of that presumption.\n  The President's Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments \nagreed in 1995 that VA's current list should be expanded. The Committee \ncited concerns that ``the listing of diseases for which relief is \nautomatically provided--the presumptive diseases provided for by the \n1988 law--is incomplete and inadequate'' and that ``the standard of \nproof for those without presumptive disease is impossible to meet and, \ngiven the questionable condition of the exposure records retained by \nthe government, inappropriate.'' The President's Advisory Committee \nurged Congress to address the concerns of atomic veterans and their \nfamilies ``promptly.''\n  The unfair treatment of atomic veterans becomes especially clear when \ncompared to both agent orange and Persian Gulf veterans. In \nrecommending that the administration support S. 1385, Under Secretary \nfor Health Kenneth Kizer cited the indefensibility of denying \npresumptive service connection for atomic veterans in light of the \npresumption for Persian Gulf war veterans and agent orange veterans.\n  In 1993, the VA decided to make lung cancer presumptively service-\nconnected for agent orange veterans. That decision was based on a \nNational Academy of Sciences study that had found a link only where \nagent orange exposures were ``high and prolonged,'' but pointed out \nthere was only a ``limited'' capability to determine individual \nexposures.\n  For atomic veterans, however, lung cancer continues to be non-\npresumptive. In short, the issue of exposure levels poses an almost \ninsurmountable obstacle to approval of claims by atomic veterans, while \nthe same problem is ignored for agent orange veterans.\n  Persian Gulf war veterans can receive compensation for symptoms or \nillnesses that may be linked to their service in the Persian Gulf, at \nleast until scientists reach definitive conclusions about the etiology \nof their health problems. Unfortunately, atomic veterans aren't given \nthe same consideration or benefit of the doubt.\n\n[[Page S11350]]\n\n  Mr. President, I believe this state of affairs is outrageous and \nunjust. The struggle of atomic veterans for justice has been long, \nhard, and frustrating. But these patriotic, dedicated and deserving \nveterans have persevered. My amendment would finally provide them the \njustice that they so much deserve.\n  Let me say this in closing, Mr. President: As I have worked with \nveterans and military personnel during my time in the Senate, I have \nseen a troubling erosion of the federal government's credibility with \ncurrent and former service members. No salary is high enough, no \npension big enough to compensate our troops for the dangers they endure \nwhile defending our country. Such heroism stems from love for America's \nsacred ideals of freedom and democracy and the belief that the nation's \ngratitude is not limited by fiscal convenience but reflects a debt of \nhonor.\n  Mr. President, this is one of those issues which test our faith in \nour government. But the Senate can take an important step in righting \nthis injustice. I urge my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to \njoin me in helping atomic veterans win their struggle by supporting by \nsupporting my amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from Minnesota \nfor his persistence and consistent advocacy for a group that is now \ncalled the atomic vets. He is absolutely right when he says that every \nyear he offers the amendment and then, because of the pressures of \nconference, it evaporates. First of all, the atomic vets have no finer \nchampion than the Senator from Minnesota, Mr. Wellstone.\n  From my perspective I support him. Tomorrow, when the call of the \nroll is made, I will be voting aye.\n  Mr. President, I thank our colleague from Minnesota for his eloquent \ncomments within the timeframe that enabled Senators to move on to other \nresponsibilities. I really appreciate his courtesy.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator from Maryland for her support. I \nam honored to have her support. I know the atomic veterans thank her.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we know how strongly the Senator from \nMinnesota feels about this. He has been a very forceful and persuasive \nadvocate. We do recognize that because of the rule under which the \nSenator is proceeding, this is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment. We have \nturned back to the authorizing committees the job of authorizing. It \nseems rather traditional to do it that way. I know the Senator wants to \nmake this point. We thank him very much for putting it in the form of a \nsense-of-the-Senate amendment.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, the state of the Union is strong. Our \ncountry's overall economy is at an all time high, unemployment is at \nthe lowest it has been in years, education is rising, and American \nhomeownership is increasing. Despite all of these factors, our nation--\nand rural America in particular--is in the midst of an affordable \nhousing shortage crisis. According to reports, 5.3 million Americans \npay more than 50 percent in their annual income to rent or living in \nsubstandard conditions. This is unacceptable for a society as wealthy \nas ours, and we must make real progress now to improve housing \nconditions for all Americans. I would like to take this opportunity to \ndiscuss two critically important housing assistance programs that are \ncut by the short-sighted funding levels in the fiscal year 2000 \n(FY2000) VA-HUD Appropriations bill.\n  The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provides \nSection 8 rental assistance to nearly three million families through \nHousing Certificate Funds, including vouchers, certificates, and \nproject-based assistance. The VA-HUD Appropriations bill that we are \ndiscussing today provides $11 billion for the Housing Certificate \nFund--which is $724 million more than the FY1999 level. While I am \npleased that the VA-HUD bill ensures funding for all expiring Section 8 \ncontracts for FY2000, I am deeply disappointed that the bill does not \nattempt to meet the future need for housing assistance by including \nfunding for an additional 100,000 vouchers.\n  In my state of South Dakota, families in need of housing assistance \nspend an average of 9 months on a waiting list for current Section 8 \nvouchers. Sadly, this is actually a better situation than most \nAmericans face. More than 1 million Americans wait an average of 28 \nmonths, or over two full years, for Section 8 assistance.\n  The strong economy in South Dakota has contributed to a shortage of \naffordable housing in our larger cities. In many of our smaller towns, \nadequate housing is also at a premium. An additional 100,000 Section 8 \nvouchers would mean that an additional 321 South Dakota families would \nreceive Section 8 assistance. I urge my colleagues to adequately fund \nthe proposal for 100,000 new Section 8 vouchers because the Section 8 \nprogram, simply put, helps families find housing they can afford.\n  Another housing program that has been extremely valuable for South \nDakota and the nation is the Community Builder program. Community \nBuilders have enabled HUD to take a much-needed customer-friendly \napproach to serving low-income Americans. In South Dakota, Community \nBuilders are working with local governments and housing authorities to \nprovide needed rental assistance statewide.\n  Community Builders have also worked with the Northeastern Council of \nGovernments in South Dakota to spread information to several \nnortheastern counties on the services that HUD provides, and how to \naccess these services. Community Builders have facilitated FHA loans \nfor the construction of affordable homes in Rapid City, while also \nhelping the Sioux Empire Housing Partnership become a HUD- approved \nhousing counseling agency. The Community Builder program has begun to \naddress the housing needs in historically underserved communities, many \nof which have never utilized HUD services in the past. One of my former \nstaffers, Stephanie Helfrich, was a Community Builder Specialist for \nthe Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, and her work has enabled tribal \nleaders to better utilize HUD's programs to the benefit of one of the \nmost poor populations in the nation.\n  In conclusion, I understand the strict budget constraints the \ncommittee faces in drafting this bill. While I support every effort to \nkeep government spending low, I believe it is a wise investment in our \ncountry's future when we ensure that our working families have adequate \nhousing. I will continue to work with my colleagues to find ways to \nhelp South Dakota families and families across the nation address their \nhousing needs.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, America is experiencing one of its most \nprosperous times, yet despite a booming national economy some 5.3 \nmillion families are spending more than half of their income on housing \nor are living in severely substandard housing. In Hartford, Connecticut \nalone, there are 19,000 families suffering in worst case housing.\n  Most distressing, more than one million elderly and over two million \nfamilies with children face an affordable housing crisis.\n  Recent data indicate that this trend is worsening as housing costs \nrise faster than the incomes of low-income working families, and the \nnumber of affordable public housing units drops. In fact, more than 2 \nmillion public housing units were lost between 1973 and 1995, and the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development indicates that as many as \n1,000 more units are being lost each month.\n  As a result, more than one million Americans languish on waiting \nlists for public housing or Section 8 vouchers. In Connecticut, the \naverage time for waiting lists for public housing is 14 months and \nSection 8 vouchers is 41 months.\n  Last year, Congress passed a significant measure to streamline many \npublic housing programs and focus more resources on families most in \nneed of assistance. This included almost 100,000 new Section 8 \nvouchers. Tragically, the bill before us today provides no funding for \nthese vouchers. In light of the tremendous need, and the gap that has \ngrown in housing assistance over the past few years, providing fund for \nthese new rental assistance vouchers is a modest, but crucial step.\n\n[[Page S11351]]\n\n  These vouchers are not a free ride--families still must pay at least \n30 percent of their incomes for rent. Without the vouchers, however, \nmillions of working families and elderly citizens will be unable to \nsecure affordable housing.\n  Mr. President, I'd like to take a few additional moments to address \nanother program of great importance. Under the leadership of Secretary \nCuomo, the Department of Housing and Urban Development has made great \nstrides to create a new, innovative approach to government through the \nCommunity Builders Program.\n  Unfortunately, this appropriations bill would kill this initiative by \nterminating the 400 Community Builder fellows hired to serve in field \noffices around the country. This program is the first agency-run \nprogram in the Federal Government for experienced local professionals \nto perform short-term, public service in their communities. It \nrepresents a new way of thinking about government service and creates \nan opportunity to tap well-qualified talent in the community.\n  Under the program, HUD recruits, hires and trains professional \nindividuals--who have extensive backgrounds in community and economic \ndevelopment, and housing--to serve 2-4 years as community change agents \nin field offices. To date, 400 people have been hired.\n  In Hartford, Connecticut, Community Builders have formed a \npartnership with state officials and national housing financial \ninstitutions to cross-train staff on the wide variety of housing \nfinance programs and financing mechanisms available for the development \nof affordable housing. In addition, they have partnered with the \nConnecticut Department of Economic and Community Development, the \nConnecticut Housing Finance Agency, the National Equity Fund, the Local \nInitiatives Support Corporation, and the Federal Home Loan Bank of \nBoston to improve coordination and ``layering'' of programs and \ndelivery of services.\n  These professionals bring a fresh perspective, the ability to think \n``outside the box,'' and creative outlook on housing and community \ndevelopment programs. Community Builders in Connecticut illustrate the \ndiversified experience and knowledge brought to HUD operations with \nprofessional backgrounds in the areas of architect, municipal \ngovernment, law and business management.\n  Community Builders are truly change agents in our community. They are \nknowledgeable about HUD programs, make customer service more efficient, \nare professionally competent, and are bringing their expertise to make \ngovernment work better.\n  I hope that the Senate will reconsider the significance of this \nprogram and provide continued support to ensure that our government \nmaintains innovative, customer service oriented programs such as the \nCommunity Builders Program.\n  I thank Senator Kerry and Secretary Cuomo taking action to ensure \nthat working poor families have access to affordable housing and \npromoting new, innovative approaches to government management. I am \nproud to stand in support of their efforts.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I call the Senate's \nattention to a program that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \nhas initiated that I believe is ill-conceived, wasteful and lacking of \npublic input. The EPA, at the direction of Vice President Gore, has \nlaunched a ``voluntary'' initiative with the chemical industry to test \nsome 2,800 high production volume (HPV) chemicals and substances. The \nchemicals included in this list are currently manufactured or imported \nin volumes in excess of one million pounds, many of which have already \ngone through substantial testing and known to be either hazardous or \nsafe. As chairman of the subcommittee with jurisdiction over the \ntesting and handling of toxic chemicals, I am particularly concerned \nabout how this program will be administered and funded.\n  This major initiative was launched in October 1998 during a press \nconference by EPA, the Chemical Manufacturers Association and the \nEnvironmental Defense Fund. This initiative calls on industry to \nvoluntarily provide test plans for these 2,800 HPV chemicals by \nDecember 1999, after which EPA will mandate tests of the remaining \nchemicals. Although the first phase of this initiative is voluntary, \nI'm concerned that there was not adequate public and congressional \ninvolvement in the development of this massive undertaking. Only after \nmuch urging by concerned Members of Congress, including myself, and \nother affected interest groups, EPA decided to hold a number of \n``stakeholder'' meetings to share views and information about the HPV \nprogram.\n  The lack of public and congressional input is just one concern that I \nhave with this initiative. There are several other important issues of \nwhich the Senate should be aware. A major concern deals with the large \namount of unnecessary animal testing that could occur as a result of \nthis program. While obtaining better data on hazardous chemicals is \ncertainly a worthy goal, I am concerned about the extent to which \nanimal testing would be used in lieu of alternative testing methods. I \nunderstand that there have been many advances in toxicology, risk \nassessment and alternative testing strategies that minimize the use of \nanimals, that could be applied.\n  As I stated earlier, the HPV program calls for testing of many \nsubstances that clearly need no further testing. These include \nchemicals well documented and regulated as dangerous, as well as \nsubstances recognized as safe by the Food and Drug Administration. \nChemicals with existing data should be purged from the list by EPA. \nThere have been numerous assertions by Administration officials that \nthey have no intention of ordering duplicative testing and remain \ninterested in pursuing alternative testing methods where appropriate. I \nhope this is true. However, I still have serious concerns about the \nexpedited schedule of the program and how EPA is directing its \nresources. Therefore, as the subcommittee chairman with oversight \nresponsibility over toxic substances and testing, I plan to closely \nmonitor EPA's implementation of this program.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I certainly agree with my colleague from New Hampshire \nthat if this toxicity data is out there and available, then every \neffort should be made to collect it, verify its relevance to this \nprogram, and use it. There is no reason to order duplicative and \nwasteful testing. But I do hope this can be done in an efficient \nmanner. The collection of this information should not slow down the \nprogress of this program seeking basic toxicity data on the 2,800 \nchemicals most widely used in the United States. The claim has been \nmade that 90 percent of these chemicals lack full toxicity data and 40 \npercent have no toxicity data. However, if this data already exists, \nthen let's get it. We need to fill in these data gaps. Finally, even \nthough the EPA has begun to show some willingness to respond to \nsuggestions from stakeholders, I believe that the HPV program would \nbenefit from a hearing in Senator Smith's subcommittee.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the two Senators for their insight and comments on \nEPA's HPV chemical testing program. We are in agreement that EPA should \nseek to uncover all existing data in preparation for determining what \ndata gaps exist and test plans need to be developed. EPA should also \npursue the validation and incorporation of non-animal testing as soon \nas practicable. In the meantime, I hope negotiations between the \nvarious stakeholder groups bring about some consensus on how best to \nproceed with this program.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I thank the Senator from Missouri for his \ncomments and hope we can continue to work together on the monitoring of \nthis and other EPA programs.\n\n\n                      epa risk management program\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his work on the \nrecently passed legislation, S. 880, dealing with EPA's Risk Management \nPlan program. I understand that there might be some problems with EPA's \nimplementation of the law with respect to the funding of the program.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senior Senator from Missouri for his \nrecognition, and he is correct that there might be some problems with \nthe implementation of the law. A provision of the law directs companies \nto conduct a public meeting for local residents regarding the risks of \nchemical accidents. The facilities are then supposed to send a \ncertification of the FBI stating that they conducted the meeting. It is \nmy understanding that the EPA and FBI have\n\n[[Page S11352]]\n\ndecided that the EPA should collect the certifications and manage them \nthrough an EPA contractor. Not only did Congress not appropriate funds \nfor this activity by the EPA but we specifically directed the FBI to \ncollect this information.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I hope the Appropriations Committee will take a close \nlook at how the EPA is implementing this program. As the chairman of \nthe authorizing subcommittee and the author of the legislation, I will \nbe paying particularly close attention to its implementation.\n  Mr. BOND. I appreciate the diligence of the Senator from Oklahoma in \nhis oversight. As the chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee, I \nwill also pay close attention to the implementation of this law.\n\n\n                  reducing space transportation costs\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, reducing space transportation costs to \nenable more scientific research has been a priority of NASA and this \ncommittee. I am aware of several innovative programs developed by NASA \nand other agencies that attempt to dramatically reduce the cost of \nspace access for missions through transporting individual science \ninstruments within commercial spacecraft. However, I understand NASA is \nhaving some difficulty in implementing such ``secondary payload \nprograms'' because of a lack of a definition of ``government payload'' \nin the National Space Transportation Policy. Therefore, I would like \nthe committee to clarify that individual scientific instruments with \nfull or partial government funding riding inside a commercial satellite \nare not ``government payloads'' for purposes of the Space \nTransportation Policy. Would the chairman agree with me that this is \nsomething we should address in the conference report?\n  Mr. BOND. I appreciate the Senator's interest in these new ``shared \nride'' programs which a number of agencies are trying to implement. I \nunderstand NASA is trying to get this definition clarified, but that \nprocess is taking some time. I think we should support NASA's efforts \nby addressing this issue in conference report language, and I look \nforward to working with the Senator to address this issue in \nconference.\n\n\n                    the national science foundation\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, will the chairman of the Veterans Affairs \nand Housing and Urban Development and Independent Agencies Subcommittee \nyield for a question?\n  Mr. BOND. I yield for a question from the senior Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  As the chairman knows, the Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban \nDevelopment and Independent Agencies Subcommittee has a strong history \nof support for the behavioral and social science research programs of \nthe National Science Foundation, NSF, dating back to the beginning of \nthis decade. Basic behavioral and social science research, which ranges \nfrom research on the brain and behavior to studies of economic decision \nmaking, has the potential to address many of our Nation's most serious \nconcerns, including productivity, literacy, violence, and substance \nabuse, as well as other diverse issues such as information systems, \nartificial intelligence, and international relations.\n  Under his leadership and that of our colleague, Senator Barbara \nMikulski, the subcommittee strongly, encouraged the establishment of a \nseparate directorate for these sciences at NSF and was instrumental in \nencouraging that directorate to pursue a basic behavioral science \nresearch agenda known as the Human Capital Initiative. Most recently, \nthis subcommittee expressed strong support for the planned \nreorganization of the Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences \ndirectorate's single research division into two separate divisions, a \nBehavioral and Cognitive Sciences Division, and a Social and Economic \nSciences Division. This reorganization was necessary to accommodate the \nexplosive pace of discovery in the behavioral and social sciences and \nto promote partnerships with other disciplines.\n  Basic research in these sciences has contributed to the Nation's \neconomic prosperity and national security. Given the critical \nimportance of these fields to the national interest, and recognizing \nthe enormous strides being made in these sciences, I seek your \nclarification because the report language included in your committee \nreport may be interpreted to question the value of NSF's programs in \nthese areas. I am also concerned that the language undermines a \nvaluable scientific enterprise. Is it the chairman's understanding that \nthe committee report's intent is to express the committee's belief that \nNSF's core mission includes support for behavioral and social science \nresearch?\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Senator from Hawaii for the question. NSF's \ncore mission indeed includes basic research in the behavioral and \nsocial sciences, and, let me make it clear, it is my expectation that \nNSF will continue its strong investment in these areas. Any efforts to \nnarrow NSF's mission to exclude these sciences or to target them for \nreduced support would jeopardize the development of the \nmultidisciplinary perspectives that are necessary to solve many of the \nproblems facing the Nation.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I thank the chairman.\n\n\n                        nox SIP call\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise at this time to engage in a \ncolloquy with the subcommittee chairman, the Senator from Missouri.\n  I am concerned about what I feel is an apparent inconsistency and \ninequity created by two separate and conflicting actions that occurred \nlast May. One was EPA issuing a final rule implementing a consent \ndecree under section 126 of the Clean Air Act that is triggered in \nessence by EPA not approving the NOX SIP call revisions of \n22 states and the District of Columbia by November 30, 1999. The other \nwas by the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in \nissuing an order staying the requirement imposed in EPA's 1998 \nNOX SIP Call for these jurisdictions to submit the SIP \nrevisions just mentioned for EPA approval.\n  Caught in the middle of these two events are electric utilities and \nindustrial sources who fear that now the trigger will be sprung next \nNovember 30, even though the States are no longer required to make \nthose SIP revisions because of the stay, and even though EPA will have \nnothing before it to approve or disapprove.\n  Prior to this, EPA maintained a close link between the NOX \nSIP Call and the section 126 rule, as evidenced by the consent decree. \nI believe a parallel stay would be appropriate in the circumstance. EPA \nshould not be moving forward with its NOX regulations until \nthe litigation is complete and those affected are given more certainty \nand clarity as to what is required under the law.\n  A stay is very much needed, especially in light of EPA's more recent \ncomments suggesting that is may reverse its earlier interpretation of \nthe Clean Air Act regarding State discretion in dealing with interstate \nozone transport problems. The effect of such a reversal would be to \nforce businesses to comply with EPA's Federal emission controls under \nSection 126 without regard to NOX SIP Call rule and State \ninput.\n  The proposed reversal is creating tremendous confusion for the \nbusinesses and the States. Under EPA's proposed new position, \nbusinesses could incur substantial costs in meeting the EPA-imposed \nsection 126 emission controls before allowing the States to use their \ndiscretion in the SIP process to address air quality problems, less \nstringent controls or through controls on other facilities altogether.\n  Indeed, the fact that these businesses almost certainly will have \nsunk significant costs into compliance with the EPA-imposed controls \nbefore States are required to submit their emission control plans in \nresponse to the NOX SIP Call rule would result in \nimpermissible pressure on their States to forfeit their discretion and \ninstead simply conform their SIPs to EPA section 126 controls.\n  The bottom line is that not only do the States and business community \nnot know what EPA is doing, EPA doesn't know what it is doing. This is \nhardly a desirable regulatory posture for what clearly is promising to \nbe a very costly and burdensome regulation.\n  Let's be clear what the law is and what it requires, before rather \nthan after the EPA writes and enforces its rules. I think that is a \nreasonable expectation and a reasonable requirement that the EPA should \nbe able to meet.\n\n[[Page S11353]]\n\n  Does the chairman agree with me that the EPA should find a reasonable \nway to avoid triggering the 126 process while the courts deliberate and \nwe have a better understanding of what the law requires States and \nbusinesses to do to be in compliance?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the Senator bringing \nthis to the Senate's attention. I agree that this matter should be \nresolved swiftly. I would encourage and expect the EPA to, over the \nnext several months, find a way that is fair to all sides. In addition, \nI would expect that any remedy would ensure that the States maintain \ncontrol and input in addressing air pollution problems through the SIP \nprocess. I would be happy to work with the Senator from Alabama to \nensure that EPA is fully responsive to these legitimate problems.\n\n\n                         veterans' health care\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I commend the chairman of the VA, HUD and \nIndependent Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee for successfully \nmanaging such a complex appropriations bill as S. 1596. In particular, \nI want to thank him for recognizing the need for additional funding for \nveterans health care and increasing that appropriations an additional \n$1.7 billion over the President's request. Doing this was very \ndifficult in light of budgetary constraints, but it was the right thing \nto do and I commend him for his foresight and courage.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the senior Senator from Pennsylvania for his kind \nremarks and for his leadership in urging an additional $1.7 billion for \nveterans health care. I also commend my friend for his leadership as \nchairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs in urging \nmedicare subvention for veterans and for gaining Senate approval of \nincreased funding for the GI education bill.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, there is an additional matter in which I \nwould like to have an exchange with him involving two amendments I have \noffered. The first involves the need for funding of a unique \nconstruction project at the Lebanon VA Medical Center for the growing \nproblem of the long term care needs of veterans. The second involves \nfunding for a needed national veterans cemetery in the southwestern \nportion of Pennsylvania. In the interest of time and space, I will not \nelaborate on these projects both of which have been authorized by the \nSenate Committee on Veterans Affairs in S. 1076 and S. 695 respectively \nand are outlined in the accompanying reports. You and I discussed them \nyesterday and I believe we had a meeting of the minds in which I \nunderstood that you will seek at least limited funding for both \nprojects during conference. Is this the understanding of Senator Bond \nas well?\n  Mr. BOND. The Senator from Pennsylvania is correct. I know how \nimportant these projects are to you and veterans in Pennsylvania. While \nI cannot guarantee an outcome, I will do my best to secure design funds \nfor these projects when we meet with the House in conference on the \nbill.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to have joined my colleague \nMr. Wellstone from Minnesota in offering an amendment to the Fiscal \nYear 2000 VA-HUD Appropriations bill to increase funding for veterans \nhealth care by an additional $1.3 billion. This would create a $3 \nbillion increase in VA health care funding --the level called for by \nthe Independent Budget produced by a coalition of veterans \norganizations.\n  Before I begin, I would like to take a minute and make a few comments \non the amendment that the Senate already has accepted. First, I want to \nthank Senators Bond and Mikulski for offering the amendment to add an \nadditional $600 million for veterans' health care. By accepting this \namendment, the total increase for veterans' health care in this piece \nof legislation is now $1.7 billion. I am pleased that my colleagues \nrecognize the dire situation facing the Veterans Administration and our \nnation's veterans because of past negligence in meeting the needs of \nveterans health care.\n  I supported the amendment, and I have asked to be added as a \ncosponsor. However, as I understand it, this $1.7 billion will provide \nonly momentary relief to a VA system which has been drastically \nunderfunded for the past three years. That is why Senator Wellstone and \nI offered an amendment to give even more to veterans, who in service of \ntheir country gave everything they had to protect this democracy.\n  Mr. President, let me begin by saying that this is the fourth \nconsecutive year, that the Clinton Administration has proposed a flat-\nline appropriation for veterans' health care in its FY 2000 budget \nrequest. The VA's budget included a $17.3 billion appropriation request \nfor the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Although, the Clinton \nAdministration's request included allowing the VA to collect \napproximately $749 million from third-party insurers--$124 million more \nthan in FY 1999, this cap on medical spending places a greater strain \non the quality of patient care currently provided in our nation's VA \nfacility, especially when meeting the needs and high health costs of \nour rapidly aging World War II population.\n  Our nation's veterans groups have worked extensively on crafting a \nsensible budget that will allow the VA to provide the necessary care to \nall veterans. They have offered an Independent Budget that calls for an \nimmediate $3 billion increase for VA health care to rectify two current \ndeficiencies in the VA budget. First, the VA has had to reduce \nexpenditures by $1.3 billion due to their flatlined budget at $17.3 \nbillion. These were mandatory reductions in outpatient and inpatient \ncare and VA staff levels that the VA had to make due to their flatlined \nbudget.\n  The remaining $1.7 billion is needed to keep up with medical \ninflation, COLAs for VA employees, new medical initiatives that the VA \nwants to begin (Hepatitis C screenings, emergency care services), long \nterm health care costs, funding for homeless veterans, and treating \n54,000 new patients in 89 outpatient clinics.\n  Although we have increased veterans' health care by a total of $1.7 \nbillion, and which certainly will help relieve some of the VA's \nbudgetary constraints, I believe that more needs to be done. The \nveterans community has requested that VA health care needs to be \naugmented by $3 billion to ensure the provision of accessible and high \nquality services to veterans.\n  That is why Senator Wellstone and I offered an amendment, and which I \nremind my colleagues the Senate unanimously accepted 99-0, during \nconsideration of the budget resolution that raised VA health care to a \ntotal of $3 billion. The nation's top veterans groups (AMVETS, Blinded \nVeterans Association, Disabled American Veterans, Paralyzed Veterans of \nAmerica, Veterans of Foreign Wars and Vietnam Veterans of America) \nvoiced their strong support for our amendment, however, the final \nbudget resolution contained an increase of only $1.7 billion.\n  I agree with the coalition of veterans organizations that have put \ntogether a sensible and responsible alternative VA budget'' that an \ninfusion of approximately $3 billion into the VA health budget is \nneeded this year in order to avoid an unconscionable destruction of our \nnation's commitment to its veterans. Without such a funding boost, \nframed within a balanced federal budget, we will soon be witnessing \nenormous VA staffing reductions, degradation of VA health care quality, \nthe termination of needed programs, and the closure of VA hospitals. \nOur hopes of establishing VA outreach clinics in such communities as \nAberdeen, South Dakota will be impossible without an increase in \nfunding.\n  That is why Senator Wellstone and I are offering this amendment. The \nveterans community has done all the research and is acutely aware of \nthe glaring health care needs that the VA must contend with in order to \ncare for our nation's veterans. Our amendment would take $1.3 billion \nfrom the non-Social Security surplus and designate it as emergency \nspending for veterans' health care. The funding required for this \namendment represents a minute fraction of the total federal budget that \nwe are debating here today. However, the funding we set aside to \nimprove accessibility and quality of care within our veterans health \ncare system will provide a tremendous boost for an already stretched \nand fractured VA medical system.\n  Mr. President, since I began my service in Congress over twelve years \nago,\n\n[[Page S11354]]\n\nI have held countless meetings, marched in small town Memorial Day \nparades, and participated in Veterans Day tributes with South Dakota's \nveterans. As the years go on their concerns remain the same. To ensure \nthat Congress provides the VA with adequate funding to meet the health \ncare needs for all veterans. Without additional funding South Dakota VA \nfacilities will continue to face staff reductions, cutbacks in \nprograms, and possible closing of facilities.\n  Too often, I have received letters from veterans who must wait up to \nthree months to see a doctor. For many veterans who do not have any \nother form of health insurance, the VA is the only place they can go to \nreceive medical attention. They were promised medical care when they \ncompleted their service and now many veterans are having to jump \nthrough hoops just to see a doctor.\n  It is time for Congress to end this neglect and fiscal \nirresponsibility when it comes to providing decent health care for \nveterans. I think Senator Wellstone would agree with me that no one in \nthis body would accept three years of flat-lined budgets if we were \ntalking about the Department of Defense or national security funding. \nBut that is exactly what we've done to our veterans. Every year we \nlabor through the appropriations process and every year veterans \nfunding is treated as an afterthought and not one of our first \npriorities.\n  As Congress makes spending decisions for fiscal year 2000, we also \nwill have to decide what to do with the non-Social Security surplus for \nnext year. Shouldn't we be able to use some of that surplus to address \nthe immediate problems of veterans health care? I think our veterans \ndeserve nothing less, and we should make a committed effort to give the \nVA all the resources it needs to operate effectively.\n  I want to thank my friend, Mr. Wellstone, for working with me on this \nendeavor to do what we feel is our obligation to our veterans. The \nveterans community is fortunate to have such a vigilant advocate in \nSenator Wellstone who has displayed tremendous passion and leadership \nwhen it comes to ensuring that our nation's commitment to our veterans \nis not forgotten.\n  As we enter the twilight of the Twentieth Century, we can look back \nat the immense multitude of achievements that led to the ascension of \nthe United States of America as the preeminent nation in modern \nhistory. We owe this title as world's greatest superpower in large part \nto the twenty-five million men and women who served in our armed \nservices and who defended the principles and ideals of our nation.\n  From the battlefields of Lexington and Concord, to the beaches of \nNormandy, and to the deserts of the Persian Gulf, our nation's history \nis replete with men and women who, during the savagery of battle, were \nwilling to forego their own survival not only to protect the lives of \ntheir comrades, but because they believed that peace and freedom was \ntoo invaluable a right to be vanquished. Americans should never forget \nour veterans who served our nation with such dedication and patriotism.\n  Again, Mr. President, I applaud Chairman Bond and Senator Mikulski \nfor recognizing the shortcomings in this VA-HUD Appropriations bill by \nincreasing veterans' health care by an additional $1.7 billion. Senator \nWellstone and I believe that we can go even further, and we ask for the \nSenate's support. We have an obligation to provide decent, affordable, \nhealth care for America's veterans. We should live up to our obligation \nto our nation's veterans and ensure that they are treated with the \nrespect and honor that they so richly deserve.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Missouri, we \nare now working through some colloquies. Some are a little bit more \nchatty and we have not had a chance to review them all.

Mr. President, two years ago today, on September 23, \n1997, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was read for the first \ntime and referred to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \nUnfortunately, instead of coming to the Senate floor to commend the \nSenate for ratifying the CTBT or for taking steps toward that end, I \nmust come to point out the Senate has done absolutely nothing on CTBT. \nNot a hearing, not a vote. And I must confess up front, I do this with \na sense of confusion, disappointment, and profound regret over the \nRepublican majority's inaction on this important treaty since its \nsubmission to the Senate.\n  The Republican majority's unwillingness to permit the Senate to take \neven a single step forward on a treaty to ban all nuclear testing has \nme and many observers confused for a variety of reasons. First, the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty has been enthusiastically and \nunequivocally endorsed by our senior military leaders, both current and \nformer. In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, \nGeneral Hugh Shelton, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, stated \n``the Joint Chiefs of Staff support ratification of this treaty.'' The \ncurrent chairman and fellow service chiefs are not alone in their \nsupport for CTBT. In fact, the four previous occupants of the \nchairman's seat have endorsed this treaty. Former Chairmen General John \nShalikashvili, General Colin Powell, Admiral William Crowe, and General \nDavid Jones issued a statement on the treaty and the additional \nsafeguards proposed by the President. Their statement concluded ``with \nthese safeguards, we support Senate approval of the CTB treaty.''\n  Second, several Presidents, both Republican and Democratic, have \nsupported a comprehensive ban on nuclear testing. In fact, Presidents \nas far back as President Eisenhower have worked to make this \nprohibition a reality. On May 29, 1961, President Eisenhower said the \nfailure to achieve a test ban ``would have to be classed as the \ngreatest disappointment of any administration, of any decade, of any \nparty.'' Similar statements have been made by Presidents in every \nsubsequent decade. And if this Congress fails to act, Presidents in the \nnext millennium unfortunately will be uttering comparable remarks.\n  Third, the overwhelming majority of the American people, \napproximately 82 percent, have indicated they endorse immediate Senate \napproval of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Although opponents of \nthe treaty argue support is limited to just Democrats or liberals, \nopinion polls point to a different conclusion. CTBT support spans the \nentire political spectrum. For example, among those who identify \nthemselves as Republicans, 80 percent support the treaty and 79 percent \nof those who characterize themselves as ``conservative Republicans'' \nbelieve the Senate should ratify the CTBT. As far as geographic \nlimitations, the polls show CTBT support knows no boundaries. From \ncoast to coast and all points in between, the vast majority of \nAmericans support this treaty. Let me provide the Senate with a few \nexamples that back up this statement. In Tennessee, 78 percent support \nthe treaty. In Kansas, 79 percent. In Washington, 82 percent. In \nOregon, 83 percent. The story is similar in every other state in the \nUnion.\n  With these facts as a backdrop, I think it is easy to understand why \nI and many others are confused that, in the two years since the \nPresident submitted the CTBT treaty, the Republicans have chosen to do \nnothing. CTBT is vigorously endorsed by our most senior military \nleaders, past and present. Senate Republicans are unmoved. Republican \nand Democratic Presidents since Eisenhower have strongly backed the \nCTBT. Yet, Senate Republicans choose to do nothing. Finally, over 80 \npercent of our constituents, from all parts of the political spectrum \nand all regions of the country, have asked us to ratify the CTBT.\n\n[[Page S11355]]\n\nAnd the response of Senate Republicans? Not a hearing, not a vote. \nNothing but silence and inaction.\n  I mentioned at the outset that I am also disappointed by the course \nSenate Republicans have pursued. The reason for my disappointment is \nthat Senate Republicans have permitted a small number of members from \nwithin their ranks to manipulate Senate rules and procedures to prevent \nthe Senate from acting on the CTBT. I recognize these few members are \nwell within their rights as Senators to use the rules in this manner. \nUnder Senate rules, a small group can thwart or delay action on even \nthe most vital pieces of legislation. This has been proven time and \nagain since the Senate's founding. In more recent times, we have seen \nthe same handful of Senators on the far right of the political spectrum \nrepeatedly resort to these tactics to prevent the Senate from acting \nexpeditiously on arms control treaties.\n  However, in many of these previous instances, a number of Republicans \neventually decided to call an end to the political gamesmanship of \ntheir more conservative colleagues. They decided that this nation's \nnational interests superseded the political interests of a few Senators \nat the far end of the political spectrum. They decided that the full \nSenate should be allowed to work its will on matters of national \nsecurity. In short, they decided that politics stopped at the water's \nedge. I am disappointed that in this particular instance, two years \nhave elapsed and I see no such movement within the Republican caucus. \nTwo years is too long. I would hope we would soon see some leadership \non the Republican side of the aisle to break the current impasse and \nallow the full Senate to act on the CTBT.\n  Finally, I also indicated I deeply regret the Senate's failure to \nact. While waiting for the United States Senate to ratify the CTBT, we \nhave seen nearly 40 other nations do so. We have witnessed two \nadditional countries test nuclear weapons while the intelligence \ncommunity tells us several others continue developing such weapons. And \nin a few short weeks, we will observe the nations that have ratified \nthe treaty convene a conference to discuss how to facilitate the \ntreaty's entry into force --a conference that limits participation only \nto those nations that have ratified the treaty. If the United States is \nto play a leadership role on nuclear testing, convince others to forgo \nnuclear testing, and actively participate in efforts to implement the \ntreaty, the United States Senate must exercise some leadership itself \nand give the CTBT a fair hearing and a vote. That effort must begin \ntoday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/23/senate-section/article/S11355-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11355-S11356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RISK MANAGEMENT FOR THE 21ST CENTURY ACT\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we have all spent considerable time during \nthe past few years analyzing the problems in agriculture and making \npredictions about the future. Some of these problems can be traced back \nto various sources such as an intrusive Federal Government, drought and \ninstability in foreign markets. As markets closed due to the financial \ninstability, the Asian economic crisis spread, supply increased and \nfarmers had no place to sell overseas. As a result, commodity prices \nacross the board have been well under costs of production. We have all \nheard from producers in our states, and the message we hear is that our \nfarmers are needing help.\n  Before the August recess, the Senate passed a $7.2 billion emergency \nspending package designed to help offset some of the losses in recent \nyears. Those in the Senate who represent Ag states realize we cannot \npass emergency spending bills every time the Ag economy takes a nose \ndive. This is not fiscally responsible and is not sound public policy. \nOur farmers deserve better and the representatives in the Congress must \nlook for ways to ensure the people in rural America reap the benefits \nof the economic prosperity we are experiencing.\n  Over the August recess, I held many town hall meetings across the \nstate of Oklahoma. In one meeting in the small farming community of \nBoise City, I had an audience of six farmers. For over an hour, I was \nable to talk to the folks who had seen the face of agriculture go \nthrough substantial changes over the past 10 years. I was able to hear \nthese farmers voice their concerns about what was working, what wasn't \nand what could be improved.\n  What really impressed me Mr. President, was the fact that these \nproducers believed Freedom to Farm was the right thing to do for \nagriculture. They liked having the freedom to plant what they wanted, \nthe freedom to experiment and try something new without government \ninterference. One of the farmers, Mr. Ron Overstreet, decided to try a \ncouple of new things. In an area we would not normally think of as \ndairy country or an area for growing grapes, Ron and some of his \npartners have opened a dairy operation, as well as starting a vineyard. \nAs I heard during the meeting, ``If I am not willing to experiment and \ntry something new, I am in the wrong business.'' I was pleased these \nfarmers did not want to turn their backs on Freedom to Farm but rather \nwork to improve and refine some of the provisions of the program.\n  At the end of August, Congressman Frank Lucas, who represents all of \nWestern Oklahoma, and I held an Agriculture Summit in which we invited \nindividuals representing different commodity groups, Ag lending \ncompanies, farm & ranch organizations, as well as Ag economists to \ndiscuss solutions to the sustained downturn in the agriculture economy. \nMany saw several positive changes which could be made to Freedom to \nFarm, with very few advocating getting rid of the existing farm \nprogram. As several of the representatives at the Ag summit suggested, \nthe Federal Government must be more aggressive in opening and competing \nin foreign markets. We must make opening and penetrating foreign \nmarkets a top priority of our Nation's Ag policy. Nearly \\1/3\\ of all \nU.S. crops are grown for the export market. In 1996, farm exports \nreached nearly $61 billion, with nearly 46% of that total going to \nAsian markets. Due to the economic turmoil, exports to Asia are now \nless than 39%. While economies in Asia are recovering, relief for our \nfarmers cannot come soon enough. This Administration has been lax in \nit's fundamental duty to aggressively pursue foreign markets for \nAmerican farmers. To do this, we must change attitudes. When the U.S. \nuses food as a diplomatic weapon with presidential embargoes, it \ndeprives farmers of the freedom to sell their products. These \nunilateral sanctions hurt only a small percentage of America's \npopulations. Unfortunately, that group is our farmers. But a simple \nreform introduced by Senator Ashcroft, myself and others would work to \nchange this.\n  As part of the Agricultural appropriations for FY 2000, the Senate \nadopted the Food and Medicine for the World Act. Under this amendment, \nall current food and medicine embargoes would be re-evaluated by the \nAdministration and Congress and future embargoes could be imposed only \nif Congress agrees in advance. It would also lift restrictions on \nfarmers using U.S. Department of Agriculture credit guarantees to get \ntheir goods to foreign buyers, as well as requiring the President to \nobtain Congressional approval before the U.S. implements any trade \nsanctions on food and medicine. I think this is a positive step towards \nreforming our policies on sanctions.\n  With all that said Mr. President, I would like to address the reason \nI came down here today, which is to announce my support for and \noriginal cosponsorship of Senator Roberts' bill, The Risk Management \nfor the 21st Century Act.\n\n  At the Ag Summit I held, one item many people thought could be \nimproved was crop insurance. Witness after witness testified the \ncurrent crop insurance program is inadequate and suffers from lack of \naffordability, inadequacy in multiple years of disaster, inequality in \nrating structure, and lack of sufficient specialty crop policies. I \nbelieve Joe Mayer, Vice-President of the Oklahoma Farm Bureau, stated \nit best when he noted, ``. . . the cost of insurance balanced against \nthe guaranteed revenues do not make the purchase of crop insurance a \nsound business practice in many parts of the country.'' In the Ag \nsummit, producers also had several suggestions of how to improve the \ncurrent system. These reforms are very simple. First and foremost, \nthere must be greater levels of coverage at affordable prices to all \nproducers. Second, there must be expanded availability of revenue-based \ninsurance products. Third, the program must address the needs of \nproducers suffering\n\n[[Page S11356]]\n\nmultiple crop failures. Given the present state of agriculture, many \nwithin the Ag community believe reforming the crop insurance program is \nthe best ways to provide immediate relief for farmers across the \ncountry.\n  Since the introduction of this bill, I have heard from producers and \ninsurance agents across the state of Oklahoma who have been extremely \npleased with the provisions of Senator Roberts' bill. I believe first \nand foremost one of the best provisions of this bill is the premium \nwrite-downs. Under this legislation, the current subsidy structure is \ninverted. By doing this we encourage participation at higher levels of \ncoverage. By encouraging participation in the crop insurance program, \nwe strengthen the safety net for America's farmers. While this is a \nvery simple provision, I think this is one of the best provisions in \nthe bill and one of the easiest ways to improve the current state of \nagriculture.\n  The Risk management for the 21st Century Act contains provisions \nwhich establishes an Average Production history credit program. This \naddresses the needs of those farmers who lack production histories \nbecause they are just beginning or have recently added land. A related \nprovision which helps many of the farmers in Oklahoma is the multi-year \ndisaster Average Production History adjustment for producers who have \nsuffered a disaster during at least three of the preceding five years. \nThis is especially important to our producers in the Southwest who have \nsuffered through several years of drought conditions.\n  I am also pleased by the Noninsured Assistance program. Under this \nprogram, producers are allowed to plant different varieties of a crop \nand still be considered a single crop. As I heard from the farmers in \nBoise City, as well as the Ag summit, this is what they wanted--greater \nfreedom and the opportunity to try new things. I am also pleased by the \nprovisions dealing with restructuring the Board of Directors for the \nFederal Crop Insurance Commission. It is my hope we can fill this Board \nwith producers who are farming on a daily basis and know the crop \ninsurance system.\n  Mr. President, Danny Geis, President of the Oklahoma Wheat Growers \nAssociation, noted at the Ag summit, ``Policy set forth from now to the \nend of the current farm bill must culminate in the development of a \nprogram that will provide a realistically solid financial floor that \nwill insure stability, and will encourage the opportunistic free \nenterprise system that makes U.S. agriculture strong.'' I am proud to \nbe a cosponsor of the Risk Management for the 21st Century Act as I \nbelieve it helps achieve this important goal. It helps producers obtain \nbetter coverage at a lower cost, creates a flexible policy that better \nmeets their needs, and it encourages development of policies that \nensure against market losses. This plan strengthens the farm safety net \nby improving farm and risk management by providing a good step for \nlong-term policy improvements for producers. By making the permanent \nimprovements to crop insurance, we will ensure that farmers and \nranchers will have powerful management tools for years to come. Once \nagain, Senator Roberts is providing a tremendous voice for farmers \nacross the country and I look forward to working with him to ensure \npassage of this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/23/senate-section/article/S11356-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11356-S11357]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE CLOSURE OF NSWC-ANNAPOLIS\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I want to speak about the end of \nan era for the David Taylor Research Center, and the beginning of a \npromising future for this facility and many of its workers. On \nSeptember 25, 1999, the Navy will formally close the Naval Surface \nWarfare Center, Carderock Division's Annapolis Site, more commonly \nknown as the David Taylor Research Center (DTRC). While the Navy marks \nthe occasion of its departure from this successful and accomplished \nlab, we must not dwell solely on its past. On this occasion we should \nalso recognize the help and cooperation of Anne Arundel County, the \nNavy, and relevant businesses in developing a reuse strategy that will \nenable the lab to continue conducting important maritime research into \nthe 21st century.\n  The Navy has a right to be very proud of the legacy of this lab. I \nwant to touch on a few of its most important contributions throughout \nour maritime history. From its inception in 1903 by Rear Admiral George \nMelville, it has served a crucial role in the development of our modern \nNavy.\n  First established as the US Naval Engineering Experiment Station \n(EES), it served to fill the need for the testing of Naval equipment \nand the development of Fleet standards for Naval machinery. During WWI, \nthe EES assisted the Navy with the procurement of naval machinery, \ncrafting guidelines for optimum fuel usage, developing metal corrosion \ndeterrents, and pioneering the first use of sonar. Before its expansion \nduring WWII, the lab's research on sound led to the development of the \nfirst sonic depth and range finders.\n  In 1941, Dr. Robert Goddard established a Bureau of Aeronautics at \nthe facility which led to the expansion of five additional Naval \nLaboratories on the site during WWII. The newly expanded Annapolis lab \nserved to make many critical contributions to WWII Naval Fleet \ndevelopment, ranging from high capacity water stills for submarine use \nto improvements in Marine Corps landing craft.\n  By 1963, the facility had evolved into one of the Navy's premiere \nresearch and development centers, and was renamed the U.S. Marine \nEngineering Laboratory. During the Vietnam war, the lab provided \nsupport to our forces from 1966 until the end of the war. During that \ntime, its projects included boat quieting systems, engine cooling, \nbunker busting, aluminum boat corrosion abatement, and the development \nof ferro-cement boats.\n  During the late 1970s, the work of the Annapolis lab was concentrated \ninto two technical departments, Propulsion and Auxiliary Systems, and \nMaterials Engineering. The lab's contributions to today's Navy range \nfrom cutting edge superconducting electrical machinery to patented \napproaches to isolating and silencing machinery on every submarine \nclass.\n  In addition to these and other truly remarkable accomplishments, the \nNaval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division's Annapolis Site has \nserved as the technical training ground for thousands of scientists, \nmachinists, technicians, engineers, and other related lines of \nemployment. It is through their innovation, expertise, and hard work \nthat this facility has been such a critical proving ground for the \nNavy, and I am proud to say that because of our redevelopment strides, \nmany of these experts will continue their excellent work for the Navy \nand other customers in Anne Arundel County.\n  As many of these employees will recall, I fought very hard in 1993 \nwhen the Navy recommended that this site be shut down. And I fought \nagain in 1995 when the BRAC Commission made the final decision to close \nthe Annapolis Center. I continue to believe that the decision was \nunwise, unjustified and failed to take into account the critical \ncapabilities of the highly skilled and experienced team of scientists \nand engineers who have contributed so much to the Navy over the years.\n  After the Navy's decision, many of these dedicated scientists and \nresearchers could have walked away and gone to Philadelphia or found \njobs elsewhere. However, through reuse ventures such as those of VECTOR \nResearch these individuals have made the best of the situation and \nworked to convert this unique facility into a maritime R park. As \nthese businesses continue to expand their marine customer base, we can \nenvision the park as a focal point for maritime high technology into \nthe next millennium. In fact, this month has seen a major milestone in \nthe site reuse process. As some of you know, DTRC houses a Deep Ocean \nSimulation Facility which is world class in nature, and is uniquely \ndesigned and equipped to evaluate commercial and military machinery \ntargeted for deep ocean environments. I am delighted to say that on \nSeptember 15th, operation of this complex was officially transferred \nfrom the Navy to a private firm. As a result of efforts such as this \none, the Navy will also continue to benefit, since a large fraction of \nthis reservoir of essential capability might otherwise have been \ndispersed or lost. Anne Arundel County's decision to take this approach \nfor reuse and its coordinated and innovative strategy in\n\n[[Page S11357]]\n\nthis regard, should serve as an example for the nation.\n  With the spirit of cooperation, and innovative reutilization \nreflected in this effort, I have no doubt that the DTRC will continue \nto contribute not only to the maritime high technology sector of Anne \nArundel County and the State of Maryland, but also to our nation's \ntechnological advancement into the 21st Century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/23/senate-section/article/S11357-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11357]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 SHOOTING DOWN THE BANKRUPTCY LOOPHOLE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am very disappointed that the Senate \nmajority leader brought up the bankruptcy reform bill and then \nimmediately filed for cloture on the bill. If this week's cloture \nmotion had passed, debate would have been blocked and relevant \namendments designed to reform the bankruptcy system would have been \nprohibited from being offered.\n  I was planning to offer an amendment that would have prevented one \nabuse of the bankruptcy system. My amendment was very straightforward. \nIt would have prohibited manufacturers, distributors and dealers of \nfirearms from discharging debts which are firearm related incurred as a \nresult of judgments against them based on fraud, recklessness, \nmisrepresentation, nuisance, negligence, or product liability.\n  Currently, under the Bankruptcy Code, such persons and companies are \nable to evade responsibility and ``take advantage of the system.'' \nThat's what Lorcin Engineering Co., a manufacturer of cheap handguns, \ntold Firearms Business it was doing when it filed for Chapter 11 \nbankruptcy protection in 1996. At the time, Lorcin was one of the chief \nmanufacturers of ``Saturday Night Specials'' or ``junk guns'' and in \n1998, their inexpensive semiautomatic pistol was number two on the list \nof guns traced to crime scenes by ATF. Lorcin's low quality guns, which \ncaused innumerable deaths because of their cheap construction and easy \navailability, were the basis of more than two dozen product liability \nlawsuits. Once Lorcin decided they could not defend their practices \nagainst the multiple liability claims filed against them, they decided \nto protect themselves by using the bankruptcy system to settle these \nlawsuits for pennies on the dollar and be exempted from an additional \nlawsuit filed by the city of New Orleans.\n  Lorcin was able to evade judgments by filing for bankruptcy, and \nother manufacturers are lining up in bankruptcy court to follow their \nlead. Davis Industries, another manufacturer of Saturday Night \nSpecials, has also sought refuge in bankruptcy court, perhaps hoping to \ndismiss the wrongful-death and personal injury suits filed against them \nby individuals and the multiple lawsuits filed against them by local \ngovernments.\n  Currently, there are eighteen categories of debt that are \nnondischargeable under the Bankruptcy Code. The Code makes certain \ndebts nondischargeable when there is an overriding public purpose. One \nspecific example is the nondischargeability of debt incurred by a \ndebtor's operation of a motor vehicle while legally intoxicated. This \naddition to the Bankruptcy Code demonstrates Congress' unwillingness to \nallow debtors to escape debts created by illegal and improper conduct. \nDebts for death or personal injury resulting from unsafe firearms and \ntheir negligent distribution should also be nondischargeable under the \nBankruptcy Code. Like debts incurred by drunk driving, Congress must \nsend a message that it will not permit debtors to escape debts incurred \nby improper conduct.\n  I urge the Senate to begin a reasonable debate on bankruptcy reform \nthat truly address the abuses of the system. I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record, an article from the New York Times, showing \nthe link between some gun manufacturers and the abuse of the bankruptcy \nsystem.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 24, 1999]\n\n             Lawsuits Lead Gun Maker To File for Bankruptcy\n\n                          (By Fox Butterfield)\n\n       In the first sign of the impact of the growing number of \n     municipal lawsuits against the gun industry, a well-known \n     manufacturer of handguns has filed for bankruptcy protection, \n     raising concern among city officials across the country that \n     other firearms companies may also use bankruptcy to try to \n     avoid the suits.\n       The bankruptcy filer, Davis Industries, one of a group of \n     companies in suburban Los Angeles that are controlled by a \n     single family and its friends, produces Saturday night \n     specials, cheap handguns favored by criminals. Davis is one \n     of the 10 largest makers of handguns, and studies have found \n     that its products tend to be characterized by a short ``time \n     to crime''--that is, a remarkably brief period between sale \n     and the point at which they show up as weapons used in \n     criminal acts.\n       In another indication of the pressure created by the \n     municipal lawsuits, Bob Delfay, president of the gun \n     industry's largest trade association, says he plans to \n     propose an unusual conference with senior law-enforcement \n     officials, representatives of the National Rifle Association \n     and executives of gun companies to discuss how the industry \n     and government might curb trafficking by people who buy \n     firearms on behalf of criminals and juveniles.\n       It is unclear precisely what measures Mr. Delfay, of the \n     National Shooting Sports Foundation, has in mind to stop \n     these so-called straw purchases. But any proposals by the gun \n     companies for greater government regulation or industry self-\n     policing of sales and marketing practices would be a \n     substantial departure from the manufacturers' insistence that \n     they are already sufficiently regulated by thousands of laws.\n       Only last week, Mr. Delfay's group took over a more \n     conciliatory gun-industry organization, the American Shooting \n     Sports Council, which had been trying to open negotiations \n     with lawyers for some of the cities suing the firearms \n     makers. In an interview, Mr. Delfay insisted that his idea \n     for a conference was not intended to open the way for a \n     settlement.\n       So far, 22 counties and cities, including Chicago, Los \n     Angeles and Detroit, have sued the gun makers, accusing them \n     of failing to include enough safety devices or negligently \n     marketing their guns in ways that enable criminals and \n     juveniles to buy them. The suits seek damages for extra \n     police and hospital costs resulting from gun violence, but \n     more important, city officials say, they want to force the \n     gun companies to accept greater regulation of the way they \n     design, manufacture and distribute their products.\n       More cities are expected to file suit soon, and lawyers \n     familiar with the issue say New York is close to becoming the \n     first state to bring such a suit. ``If New York comes into \n     this, and there are more suits, at some point soon a critical \n     mass will be reached where the costs alone of defending these \n     suits are going to eat up the gun companies,'' said John \n     Coale, a lawyer in Washington who is representing New Orleans \n     and several other cities that have sued.\n       Mr. Coale, one of the Castano Group of lawyers who were \n     active in suing the tobacco industry--the group is named for \n     a friend of several of them who died of a tobacco-related \n     disease--estimated that the cigarette companies had spent \n     $600 million a year defending themselves against the states. \n     ``The gun companies simply can't afford it,'' he said, since \n     they are so much smaller and sales of guns have been flat or \n     declining for a decade.\n       ``So if you get too many cities and states suing,'' Mr. \n     Coale said, ``the manufacturers will go into bankruptcy \n     protection. And the day that happens, the suits stop and it \n     is lose-lose for everybody.''\n       Davis Industries, of Chino, Calif., filed for bankruptcy \n     reorganization in the Federal bankruptcy court in nearby \n     Riverside on May 27, said Alan Stomel, a lawyer who \n     represented creditors in the unrelated 1996 bankruptcy of \n     Lorcin Engineering, another of the gun makers controlled by \n     the same owners as Davis Industries and known as the Ring of \n     Fire companies (because their locations form a ring around \n     Los Angeles).\n       ``Bankruptcy is a very useful negotiating tool,'' Mr. \n     Stomel said, ``and predictably the more suits that are filed, \n     the more these gun companies are going to file for \n     bankruptcy.''\n       A spokesman for Davis Industries, who declined to give his \n     name, confirmed that the company had filed for bankruptcy. \n     ``We do what we got to do'' in response to the suits, the \n     spokesman said. ``I'm sure other companies will do the same \n     thing.''\n       Mr. Stomel said Davis Industries faced several problems: \n     the municipal lawsuits, wrongful-death and personal-injury \n     suits by individuals, a messy argument between the two \n     owners, Jim and Gail Davis, who were recently divorced, and a \n     bill that is expected to pass the California Legislature that \n     would bar the manufacture of cheap handguns.\n       A lawyer for one of the cities suing the gun makers said \n     bankruptcy ``is going to be a huge pain'' because it will \n     require much more time and expense for the cities, limit the \n     amount of damages they may collect and, perhaps most \n     important, put the litigation in Federal bankruptcy court. \n     Bankruptcy judges, the lawyer said, are more likely to act \n     favorably to the gun companies than urban juries in state \n     courts.\n       But Paul Januzzo, general counsel for Glock Inc., one of \n     the largest handgun makers, said it was unlikely that the \n     older, more established, mostly Eastern firearms companies \n     would turn to bankruptcy.\n       ``We are confident we can win the suits, if we have a \n     number of companies litigating together,'' Mr. Januzzo said.\n       Lawsuits, he added, are nothing new to the industry. ``It \n     would be an unusual gun company that doesn't have a dozen \n     lawsuits a year against it,'' he said. ``This is America.''\n     \n                               ____________________\n     \n     \n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/23/senate-section/article/S11358-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11358]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S11358]]\n\n\n\n NAOMI REICE BUCHWALD, OF NEW YORK, TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \n              JUDGE FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN.

Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor with my \ncolleague from Louisiana, Senator Mary Landrieu, the ``Lake \nPonchartrain Basin Restoration Act of 1999,'' S. 1621. Our goal for \nthis bill is clear and straightforward: to help with the ongoing \nrestoration of the Lake Ponchartrain Basin.\n  As one of the largest estuarine systems in the nation and the largest \none on the Gulf Coast, restoration of the basin merits federal \nassistance.\n  Pollution problems accumulated in the basin for years. The clean up \nof the watershed has been under way for about a decade, but more work \nremains to be done.\n  Spearheading the current restoration has been the Lake Ponchartrain \nBasin Foundation, created by the Louisiana Legislature in 1989. Since \nthen, the Foundation has implemented 38 water quality, habitat and \neducation programs and projects.\n  Coordination and cooperation have been hallmarks of the basin \nrestoration initiative. The State of Louisiana, local governments and \nofficials, citizens, businesses, universities and federal agencies all \nhave contributed to it.\n  Three key basin-area institutions have allied themselves and have \nentered into a Memorandum of Understanding to help facilitate the \nbasin's restoration.\n  These organizations include the Lake Ponchartrain Basin Foundation; \nthe Regional Planning Commission, consisting of Orleans, Jefferson, \nPlaquemines, St. Bernard and St. Tammany Parishes; and the University \nof New Orleans.\n  The legislative initiative which Senator Landrieu and I have \nundertaken has been assembled through these organizations' leadership.\n  Is the basin better off today than it has been for many years? Are \nthere obvious signs of improvement? Has the grassroots campaign of the \npast 10 years been successful?\n  In 1995, pelicans were spotted again and their numbers are on the \nincrease. In 1998, a sea turtle appeared, as well as two manatees. Now \nthere are four manatees. This year, dolphins have been seen for the \nfirst time in 40 years.\n  The pelicans, manatees, dolphins and a sea turtle confirm that the \nhard work and commitment of citizens, the state and the local \ngovernments have improved the basin. With these successes in hand, it \nis vital to the basin's 5,000 square-mile ecosystem that the \nrestoration work continue as vigorously as it has to this point.\n  The bill which Senator Landrieu and I have introduced would authorize \na federal Lake Ponchartrain Basin Restoration Program, to be housed at \nthe Environmental Protection Agency. A key component of the bill would \nbe the authorization of federal funds for the restoration program. As \nimportant, the bill would direct the Federal Government to coordinate \nthe restoration with the State and local agencies and organizations.\n  To carry out the Federal restoration program, the EPA would be \ndirected to establish the Lake Ponchartrain Executive Council. Council \nmembers would include the EPA, the State of Louisiana, the Regional \nPlanning Commission, the University of New Orleans, and the Lake \nPonchartrain Basin Foundation.\n  The EPA, in cooperation with other Federal agencies, the State and \nlocal authorities, would assist the Council with the preparation of a \ncomprehensive, multi-use watershed management plan to restore and \nprotect the basin.\n  Federal grant funds and technical assistance would be available \nthrough the EPA. Certain planning, research, monitoring and voluntary \nrestoration projects would be eligible for funding. In accordance with \nthe management plan, the voluntary restoration projects would address \nvarious waste, runoff, discharge and water quality problems to improve \nthe basin's watershed.\n  Also to be authorized for continued priority funding would be the New \nOrleans Inflow and Infiltration Project.\n  Lake Ponchartrain, the basin's namesake, is located in its midst. The \nlake plays a vital environmental, economic and quality of life role for \nthe 1.5 million people who live around it in 16 Louisiana parishes. A \n630 square-mile body of water, the lake is a major beneficiary of the \nbasin's restoration.\n  Other beneficiaries of the restoration program would be the many \nspecies of fish, birds, mammals, reptiles and plants which are found in \nthe basin.\n  Federal assistance should be provided for a watershed program of this \nsize and impact to assist with the cost of the voluntary restoration \nprojects as well as planning, research, and monitoring projects.\n  I commend all those who have organized and implemented the current \nbasin restoration program over the past decade. They have given so much \nof their time, energy and support to make the basin environmentally \nhealthier today than it has been for many years. All of them deserve \nthe highest tribute and recognition.\n  It is my privilege and honor to serve on behalf of citizens who \nrecognize a serious problem and work cooperatively to solve it and also \nto introduce legislation which would help them continue such a major \nundertaking.\n  For these reasons, I have joined with Senator Landrieu in \ncosponsoring the ``Lake Ponchartrain Basin Restoration Act of 1999.'' I \nurge the Senate's prompt consideration of the bill and look forward to \nworking with other Senators on behalf of its passage.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/23/senate-section/article/S11358-4", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11358-S11359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for a special reclassification rule for certain old agencies as \nnew agencies under the home health interim payment system; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                       medicare home health care\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation \nthat will remedy a problem facing one of Maine's home health agencies--\nHome Health & Hospice of St. Joseph, in Bangor, Maine. This bill would \nreclassify Home Health & Hospice of St. Joseph as a ``new agency'' \nunder the Medicare Home Health Interim Payment System, allowing it a \nhigher per-beneficiary rate.\n  When Congress passed the Balanced Budget Act, the intention was to \nmodestly control the dramatic growth rate of home health care agencies. \nBut the broad financing constraints and administrative regulations \ncodified in the Balanced Budget Act have had unintended consequences. \nAlmost every week I hear concerns from home care agencies in Maine \nabout the implementation of regulations and restrictions on these \nagencies.\n  Since enactment of the Balanced Budget Act, many of our home \nhealthcare agencies have found themselves in a position of financial \ninsolvency. Nationwide, more than 2,000 agencies have closed since \nBBA's passage. The State of Maine had 90 Medicare/Medicaid certified \nhome health care agencies in the beginning of 1998. By the beginning of \n1999, 16 of those agencies had closed.\n  At the time of the BBA's enactment, the Congressional Budget Office \nexpected home health care expenditures to drop by $75 billion over ten \nyears. In March of this year, CBO examined the Medicare program \nexpenditures of the home health agencies and increased the expected \nsavings by $56 billion--a three-quarter increase over the same ten \nyears!\n  As a component of the general funding reductions enacted by the \nBalanced Budget Act, the law created detailed regulations in \ndetermining agency per-beneficiary payment limits. These regulations \nhave had several unforeseen and unintended consequences when applied to \nreal-life agencies.\n  Home Health & Hospice of St. Joseph serves over 700 patients in \nBangor, Maine and the surrounding area. Under the BBA, per-patient cost \nreimbursement is based solely on cost reporting ending in fiscal year \n1994. Unfortunately for Home Health & Hospice of St. Joseph--an \nestablished and vital component of Bangor's health care system--fiscal \nyear 1994 was an unprecedented period of clinical and financial \nupheaval. As a result of these problems, the agency's per-patient \nreimbursement limitation is artificially low. And in spite of the \nextensive clinical and financial reforms enacted during this unique and \ntransitional period, the cost data for this one year is significantly \nand permanently flawed.\n\n  As a result of the anomalous cost report, the Medicare payment amount \nfor Home Health & Hospice of St. Joseph is only 59 percent of the true \ncosts of treating each patient. For every patient the agency treated in \n1998, it lost $1,148. The agency is a cost effective home health care \nagency: its actual per-patient cost of $2,752 is substantially below \nthe national medial of approximately $3,200. Unfortunately, St. \nJoseph's anticipates an aggregate loss of $780,000 for its service to \nMedicare patients over 1998. Simply put, they cannot sustain such a \ndeep loss of funding and continue to operate.\n  Mr. President, I introduce this bill today in order to address the \nproblem faced by Home Health & Hospice of St. Joseph. This legislation \nwill reclassify Home Health & Hospice of St. Joseph as a ``new agency'' \nunder the BBA, and is targeted to St. Joseph's. Mr. President, my state \nrelies on home health agencies for much of its healthcare, and we \ncannot face the prospect of losing such a fine agency.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Grassley, \n        Mr. Murkowski, and Mr. Bayh):\n  S. 1626. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nimprove the process by which the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nmakes coverage determinations for items and services furnished under \nthe Medicare Program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n         The Medicare Patient Access to Technology Act of 1999\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Medicare Patient \nAccess to Technology Act of 1999. I am pleased to be joined by the \ndistinguished Assistant Majority Leader, Senator Nickles, and Senators \nBreaux, Grassley, Murkowski, and Bayh in introducing this legislation.\n  While we all recognize that medical technologies and treatments are \nimproving the lives of millions of Americans daily, gaining access to \nthese innovations is becoming more difficult. Each day, new implantable \nmedical devices are correcting or repairing failing organ systems in \npatients. People are receiving new tests that permit the diagnosis of \ndiseases in their earliest stages without the use of surgery or other \nmore complicated procedures.\n\n[[Page S11364]]\n\nTens of thousands of individuals owe their lives to small, powerful \nminiature devices that monitor and regulate vital physiological \nfunctions and allow patients to live more productive lives.\n  The latest advances in pharmaceutical and biologics are not only \nextending the length of life, but significantly improving the quality \nof life for hundreds of millions of people. Lifesaving and life-\nenhancing innovations must be available to all Americans, and it is our \nduty to ensure that those patients who need them most, America's nearly \n40 million Medicare beneficiaries, have access to them.\n  As part of the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997, we authorized the \nHealth Care Financing Administration (HCFA) to adjust periodically \nMedicare's coverage and payment systems to account for changes in \ntechnology, treatment, and medical care. Unfortunately, without \nCongressional input, there is no guarantee that these expedited \nprocedures will take place.\n  The Medicare Patient Access to Technology Act of 1999 has arisen out \nof growing evidence that without intervention, Medicare beneficiaries \nwill be denied access to the most modernized treatments and innovations \nin health care.\n  After medical technologies, devices, and drugs are approved by the \nFood and Drug Administration, they still must meet several critical \nHCFA requirements before they are available to Medicare beneficiaries.\n  First, before technologies are approved by HCFA for reimbursement, \nthey must be covered, that is fulfill the definitions of ``reasonable \nand necessary.'' Second, they must have an identifying procedure code. \nNew device technologies receive this ``procedure code,'' a four or five \ndigit identification number that allows health care providers to submit \nclaims to payers. Finally, the technologies must be reimbursed through \none of Medicare's payment systems. The  problems arise because each of \nthese levels is plagued by inefficiency, coding delays, and lack of \ndata usage by HCFA.\n\n  My legislation addresses these concerns in five specific ways.\n  First, Medicare payment levels and payment categories will be \nadjusted at least annually to reflect changes in medical practice and \ntechnology. A recent Institute of Medicine study reported that most \nmedical technologies have an average life span of 18 months with many \nmodernizations occurring rapidly. These innovations must, therefore, be \nrapidly processed so that they are accessible to beneficiaries. While \nBBA 97 authorized HCFA to adjust payment systems ``periodically'' to \naccount for changes in technology, there is little promise that this \nwill occur in a systematic, timely and beneficial manner.\n  My bill requires HCFA to review and revise payment categories and \npayment levels for all prospective payment systems (PPS) at least \nannually. These prospective payment systems include hospital inpatient \nand outpatient, physicians, ambulatory surgery facility services. It \nalso calls for public input on the review process.\n  Second, this legislation mandates that valid external sources of \ninformation be used to update payment categories if Medicare's data are \nlimited in scope or, are not yet available. Traditionally, HCFA has \nonly used its own data set, known as the Medicare Provider Analysis and \nReview (MEDPAR) data systems, to evaluate a given technology before \nassigning an appropriate code. The average waiting period for the \nassignment of a new code is 18 months or longer.\n  Furthermore, HCFA refuses to consider partial year or externally \ngenerated data in its decision-making processes. My bill directs HCFA \nto use external sources of data on the cost, charges and use of medical \ntechnologies. This language allows HCFA to utilize high quality data \nfrom private insurers, manufacturers, suppliers, providers, and other \nsources.\n  Third, my legislation will require that national procedure codes are \nupdated more frequently to reduce delays in accessing new technologies. \nCurrently, new products must have an identification code before they \nare eligible for appropriate reimbursement by Medicare. Assigning this \ncode can take 18 months or longer because of the way HCFA has \nstructured its calendar year.\n  This legislation allows HCFA to accept applications quarterly, on a \nrolling basis, thereby allowing the processing of new technologies \nthroughout the year instead of bundling them at one annual submission.\n  Furthermore, the Medicare Patient Access to Technology Act will \neliminate the HCFA requirement that new products be on the market for \nsix months before they are eligible for a new code. This provision will \nensure that new technologies are brought to Medicare beneficiaries more \nrapidly.\n  Fourth, the bill guarantees that local procedure codes for medical \ntechnologies will continue to be used. HCFA has proposed to eliminate \nCommon Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) Level III Local Codes beginning \nin 2000 and replace it with the Level II National Codes. This is \npotentially detrimental to new technologies that are often introduced \ninto local, smaller health care systems before they are expanded into \nnationwide markets. Without the Level III Local Codes, new technologies \nmust be placed into a ``miscellaneous'' code that is often rejected by \npayers thereby denying access of the technology to beneficiaries. The \nmaintenance of the current system will ensure that technologies will be \nencoded at the earliest possible date and processed before moving to \nthe national level.\n  Finally, the legislation authorizes HCFA to create an Advisory \nCommittee on Medicare Coding and Payment. As a result, when HCFA has to \nmake coding and payment decisions, it will be prompt, permit public \nparticipation, and will guarantee Medicare beneficiaries access to the \nhighest quality products and services. The panel would ensure that safe \nmedical technologies are approved, covered, coded and paid by Medicare \nas expeditiously as possible.\n  In addition to the above authorizations, the Medicare Patient Access \nto Technology Act proposes several refinements to the Administration's \nproposed outpatient prospective payment system (PPS). The legislation \naffects three changes to HCFA's implementation of the Balanced Budget \nAct (BBA) of 1997.\n  The first change mandates HCFA to restructure the proposed ambulatory \npayment classification (APC) system to create groups of procedures that \nare more similar in cost and most closely related clinically. The \ncurrent HCFA proposal would create unusual financial incentives that \nwould clearly discourage the use of the most appropriate, cutting-edge \ntechnology. Furthermore by grouping very disparate technologies, \nhospitals will face serious underpayments for certain procedures. I \nbelieve that illogical categorization creates disincentives to use \nnewer, but more expensive products and procedures that provide far \nsuperior patient care.\n  The second change mandates that HCFA retain the current cost-based \nsystem for another four years to compile the cost studies and use data \nand conduct the analysis necessary to classify them in the appropriate \nAPC. The development of these data sets are mandatory and without \nproper clarification. Therefore, these products could receive \nsubstantial underpayment, and, as a result, patient access to newer \nprocedures and products could be limited.\n  Third, the implantable medical technologies should be reimbursed \nunder the new APCs along with other similar medical technologies. They \nshould not be reimbursed through the durable medical technology fee \nschedule. By placing the implantables within the DME propective payment \nsystem, the fee schedule will lock implantables into defined categories \nthat will limit their use and inhibit their access to seniors. By \nplacing them into the proposed APCs with the other medical devices, \nthey will be treated as other new, innovative medical technologies.\n  Again, I am pleased to be joined by my Senate colleagues, Senators \nNickles, Breaux, Grassley, Murkowski, and Bayh, in introducing this \nimportant piece of legislation. This bill supports both our Medicare \nbeneficiaries and our technology, pharmaceutical, and biotechnical \nindustries by continuing to promote life-enhancing innovations. I \nfirmly believe that these significant improvements to our Medicare \ncoding and payment systems will increase the access to modern medical \ninnovation to Americans who need them most, our senior citizens.\n\n[[Page S11365]]\n\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join us in support of this \nimportant legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Harkin, and Mr. \n        Cleland):\n  S. 1628. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nincrease the number of physicians that complete a fellowship in \ngeriatric medicine and geriatric psychiatry, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n          medicare physician workforce improvement act of 1999\n\n  S. 1630. A bill to amend title III of the Public Health Service Act \nto include each year of fellowship training in geriatric medicine or \ngeriatric psychiatry as a year of obligated service under the National \nHealth Corps Loan Repayment Program; to the Committee on Health; \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n               geriatricians loan forgiveness act of 1999\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two pieces of \nlegislation that address our national shortage of geriatricians. I am \npleased that Senators Grassley, Harkin and Cleland are joining me as \noriginal cosponsors.\n  Our nation is growing older. Today, life expectancy is 79 years for \nwomen, and 73 years for men. While the population of the United States \nhas tripled since 1900, the number of people age 65 or older has \nincreased eleven times--to more than 33 million Americans. One-third of \nall health care costs can be attributed to this group. The fastest \ngrowing part of the Medicare population--those over 85--number more \nthan three-and-a-half million. But, according to reports from the \nInstitute of Medicine, the National Institute on Aging, and the Council \non Graduate Medical Education, the number of doctors with special \ntraining to meet the needs of the oldest and frailest Americans is in \ncritically short supply.\n  I first became concerned about this problem when I read a report \nissued by the Alliance for Aging Research in May of 1996 entitled, \n``Will You Still Treat Me When I'm 65?'' The report concluded that \nthere are only 6,784 primary-care physicians certified in geriatrics. \nThis number represents less than one percent of the doctors in the \nUnited States. The report goes on to state that the United States \nshould have at least 20,000 physicians with geriatric training to \nprovide appropriate care for the current population, and as many as \n36,000 geriatricians by the year 2030 when there will be close to 70 \nmillion older Americans.\n  I first introduced legislation to address the national shortage of \ngeriatricians during the 105th Congress. While I am encouraged that \ngreater attention has been focused on this issue, little has been \naccomplished to improve the shortage of geriatricians. The two bills I \nam introducing today, the ``Medicare Physician Workforce Improvement \nAct'' and the ``Geriatrician Loan Forgiveness Act of 1999'' aim--in \nmodest ways and at very modest cost--to encourage an increase in the \nnumber of the doctors Medicare clearly needs, those with certified \ntraining in geriatrics.\n  One provision of the ``Medicare Physician Workforce Improvement Act \nof 1999'' will allow the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \ndouble the payment made to teaching hospitals for geriatric fellows. \nThis provision is limited to a maximum of 400 individuals in any \ncalender year. This is intended to serve as an incentive to teaching \nhospitals to promote and recruit geriatric fellows.\n  Another provision of the Medicare Physician Workforce Improvement Act \nwould direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to increase the \nnumber of certified geriatricians appropriately trained to provide the \nhighest quality care to Medicare beneficiaries in the best and most \nsensible settings by establishing up to five geriatric medicine \ntraining consortia demonstration projects nationwide. In short, this \nwould allow Medicare to pay for the training of doctors who serve \ngeriatric patients in the settings where this care is so often \ndelivered. Not only in hospitals, but also ambulatory care facilities, \nskilled nursing facilities, clinics and day treatment centers.\n  The second bill I am offering today, ``The Geriatricians Loan \nForgiveness Act of 1999,'' has but one simple provision. That is to \nforgive $20,000 of education debt incurred by medical students for each \nyear of advanced training required to obtain a certificate of added \nqualifications in geriatric medicine or psychiatry. My bill would count \ntheir fellowship time as obligated service under the National Health \nCorps Loan Repayment Program.\n  While almost all physicians care for Medicare patients, many are not \nfamiliar with the latest advances in aging research and medical \nmanagement of the elderly. Too often, problems in older persons are \nmisdiagnosed, overlooked or dismissed as the normal function of aging \nbecause doctors are not trained to recognize how diseases and \nimpairments might appear differently in the elderly than in younger \npersons. As a result, patients suffer needlessly, and Medicare costs \nrise because of avoidable hospitalizations and nursing home admissions.\n  A physician who takes special training in the care of the elderly \nbecomes sensitive to the need to evaluate and address the patient's \nbehaviors and moods, as well as her physical symptoms. This is \nespecially important, as the rates of undiagnosed depression and \nsuicide among the elderly are scandalous. By allowing doctors who \npursue certification in geriatric medicine to become eligible for loan \nforgiveness, and by offering an incentive to teaching institutions to \npromote geriatric fellowships, my bills will provide a measure of \nincentive for top-notch physicians to pursue fellowship training in \nthis vital area.\n  Increasing the number of certified geriatricians will not be easy for \na number of reasons. Geriatrics is the lowest paid medical specialty, \nbecause the extra time required for effective and compassionate \ntreatment of the elderly is barely reimbursed by Medicare and other \ninsurers. It takes a special individual to commit himself or herself to \nthe work of helping older patients preserve vitality and functional \nabilities over time. Often the goal for a geriatrician is not to cure \ndisorders, but to delay the onset of disability--that is, simply to \nhelp seniors live as well as possible. For these reasons, existing \nslots in geriatrics training programs sometimes go unfilled today. But \nwhile the work may be difficult and not well compensated, protecting \nquality of life for the elderly is extraordinarily important, and we \nneed physicians whose training explicitly recognizes that.\n  It is similarly difficult for teaching programs to build and remain \ncommitted to maintaining fellowship training in geriatric medicine, \nbecause geriatric faculty are scarce and the type of patients brought \nin by a training program often require extremely complex and high cost \ncare. Simply, it is cheaper to train other specialties, and more \nlucrative in terms of graduate medical education payments to the \nhospital. In fact, there are only two departments of geriatrics at \nacademic medical centers across the entire country.\n  Another barrier to alleviating the shortage of geriatricians is the \nresult of an unintended consequence of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 \n(BBA). A provision in this law established a hospital-specific cap on \nthe number of residents based on the number of residents in the \nhospital in 1996. Because a lower number of geriatric residents existed \nprior to December 31, 1996, these programs are underrepresented in the \ncap baseline. The implementation of this cap has resulted in the \nreduction of, and in some cases, the elimination of geriatric training \nprograms. This is one obstacle that should not be overlooked when \nCongress considers legislation to correct some of the unintended \nconsequences of the BBA.\n  When it comes to training the doctors we need, Medicare's current \npayment system is part of the problem, not part of the solution. The \nMedicare Payment Advisory Commission's (MEDPAC) August 1999 report to \nCongress entitled ``Rethinking Medicare's Payment Policies for Graduate \nMedical Education and Teaching Hospitals'' examines this very issue. \nAccording to the MEDPAC report:\n\n       Where Medicare does not pay for services generally \n     associated with a particular specialty, it may discourage \n     training. For example, although several studies have \n     indicated an inadequate supply of geriatricians, the number \n     of geriatric training slots exceeds the number of people who \n     choose to enter the specialty. This may reflect a lack of \n     payment for services such as palliative care and geriatric \n     assessment.\n\n  Clearly, the incentives in Medicare's payment system are poorly \naligned\n\n[[Page S11366]]\n\nwhen training doctors specifically to care for the elderly is avoided. \nAgain, my bill provides a modest incentive for hospitals to increase \nthe number of training slots available.\n  Medicare should be providing incentives to community-based programs \nto participate in the education of doctors, especially geriatricians, \nby directing graduate medical education payments appropriately to all \nfacilities that incur the additional costs of providing training. My \nbill directs the Secretary to undertake up to five demonstration \nprojects that will do just that.\n  Many reports have highlighted the shortage of geriatricians we have \ntoday. The response to the problem needs to be a national one, and it \nwould be most unwise to simply hope that the labor market will produce \nthe kinds of doctors we will increasingly need. I am especially \ngrateful to the American Geriatrics Society for its assistance in \ndiscussing ways to address the problem. I believe that the Medicare \nPhysician Workforce Improvement Act and the Geriatrician Loan \nForgiveness Acts are steps in the right direction, and I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting these bills.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters of support from the American \nGeriatrics Society and the Alliance for Aging Research be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  American Geriatrics Society,\n\n                                 New York, NY, September 17, 1999.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: The American Geriatrics Society (AGS), \n     an organization of over 6,000 geriatricians and other health \n     care professionals who are specially trained in the \n     management of care for frail, chronically ill older patients, \n     offers our strongest support to the Medicare Physician \n     Workforce Improvement Act of 1999 and the Geriatricians Loan \n     Forgiveness Act of 1999.\n       The AGS is dedicateed to improving the health and well \n     being of all older adults. While we provide primary care and \n     supportive services to all patients, the focus of geriatric \n     practice is on the frailest and most vulnerable elderly. The \n     average age of a geriatrician's caseload exceeds 80, and our \n     patients often have multiple chronic illnesses. Given the \n     complexity of medical and social needs among our nation's \n     elderly, we are strongly commited to a multi-disciplinary \n     approach to providing compassionate and effective care to our \n     patients.\n       As you know, America faces a critical shortage of \n     physicians with special training in geriatrics. Even as the \n     76 million persons of the baby boom generation reach \n     retirement age over the next 15 to 20 years, the number of \n     certified geriatricians is declining. In fact, the August \n     1999 MedPAC report noted the shortage in geriatricians, \n     despite the availability of training positions. The MedPAC \n     report noted that the shortage is caused by faulty system \n     incentives, such as inadequate Medicare reimbursement to \n     geratricians. By providing modest incentives--which will \n     encourage teaching hospitals to increase the number of \n     training fellowships in geriatric medicine and psychiatry, \n     provide loan assistance to physicians who pursue such \n     training, and support development of innovative and flexible \n     models for training in geriatrics--your bills present very \n     positive steps toward reversing that trend.\n       The AGS has been pleased to work closely with your office \n     to develop initiatives to preserve and improve the \n     availability of highest quality medical care for our oldest \n     and most vulnerable citizens. We believe that the ``Medicare \n     Physician Workforce Improvement Act'' and the ``Geriatricians \n     Loan Forgiveness Act'' represent a cost-effective approach to \n     training the physicians our nation increasingly will need. We \n     commend you for your leadership on an issue of such vital \n     importance to the Medicare program and our elderly citizens.\n           Sincerely,\n                                        Joseph G. Ouslander, M.D.,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  Alliance for Aging Research,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 23, 1999.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: As the Executive Director for the \n     Alliance for Aging Research, an independent, not-for-profit \n     organization working to improve the health and independence \n     of older Americans, I am writing in support of the ``Medicare \n     Physician Workforce Improvement Act'' and the ``Geriatricians \n     Loan Forgiveness Act.''\n       The Alliance has worked for many years to bring attention \n     to the critical need for more geriatricians, those physicians \n     who are trained to address the complex needs of older \n     patients. Best estimates suggest that there is a need for at \n     least 20,000 geriatricians at present and nearly 40,000 by \n     the year 2030 to care for the graying baby boomers. Not only \n     are we far short of current needs, with less than 7,000 \n     geriatricians in practice, but far too few doctors in \n     training are choosing this field.\n       The two bills you are introducing represent important first \n     steps in solving this problem.\n       In addition to increasing the number of physicians trained \n     in geriatrics, we need to develop a strong cadre of academics \n     and researchers within our medical schools to help mainstream \n     geriatrics into both general practice and specialties. \n     Increasing the number of fellowship positions in geriatric \n     medicine will improve the situation.\n       We must have this kind of support and commitment from the \n     federal government, along with private and corporate \n     philanthropy if we are to sufficiently provide care for our \n     aging population. The Alliance for Aging Research is \n     encouraged by your leadership and support in this area and we \n     look forward to working with you to bring these issues before \n     Congress.\n           Best regards,\n                                                     Daniel Perry,\n                                               Executive Director.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of Oregon (for himself and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 1629. A bill to provide for the exchange of certain land in the \nState of Oregon; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                          oregon land exchange\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise before the Senate \ntoday to introduce legislation which would facilitate two exchanges of \npublic and private lands in my home State of Oregon: the Triangle Land \nExchange and the Northeast Oregon Assembled Land Exchange (NOALE). In \nterms of acreage, approximately 54,000 acres of BLM and Forest Service \nland is proposed to be traded for nearly 50,000 acres currently held by \nprivate landowners in northeast Oregon. As a result of 4\\1/2\\ years of \ndelays with administrative process, there is enormous support from my \nconstituents for a legislative resolution to the exchange.\n  Both the government and the public have deeply rooted interests in \nthis exchange. Federal agencies are seeking to acquire sensitive river \ncorridors which will improve the efficiency of their protection efforts \nfor threatened and endangered fish. Currently, many of these selected \nlands are intermingled with private parcels and make resource \nmanagement difficult for the agencies. As you know, the improvement of \nfish-bearing streams and riparian areas is critical to the survival of \nmany struggling species of fish in the Northwest.\n  Communities and landowners will also benefit from these exchanges. \nEach and every aspect, from the consolidation of ownership patterns to \nthe release of previously inaccessible timber stands, will boost local \neconomies and enhance the ability of the private sector to manage its \nown lands.\n  In addition, these land exchanges have received the strong collective \nsupport of several Oregon Indian tribes; conservation groups such as \nthe Oregon Natural Desert Association, Oregon Trout and the Sierra \nClub; the Governor and scores of concerned citizens at large.\n  While these exchanges hold enormous benefit for all interested \nparties and for Oregon's natural resources, it is apparent that the \nonly sure means of completing them is through legislation. Mr. \nPresident, I am hopeful that the Senate will take this opportunity and \nsupport my colleague from Oregon and me in the swift passage of \nlegislation to facilitate the Triangle and Northeast Oregon Assembled \nLand Exchanges.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                             By Mr. CONRAD:\n\n  S. 1631. A bill to provide for the payment of the graduate medical \neducation of certain interns and residents under title XVIII of the \nSocial Security Act; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n    graduate medical education fair technical amendment act of 1999\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nGraduate Medical Education Fair Technical Amendment Act of 1999. This \nlegislation will take important steps to sustain and improve the \navailability of medical professionals in communities in my State.\n  Mr. President, as you know, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) \nincluded many measures to control rising health care spending, \nincluding provisions that reduced the level of resources for graduate \nmedical education. In particular, the BBA set a limit on the amount of \nmedical residents for which teaching hospitals can receive \nreimbursement. This cap was set according to the number of medical\n\n[[Page S11367]]\n\nresidents on staff as of December 31, 1996. While this reimbursement \nlimit has helped to contribute to the overall savings generated by the \nBBA, I am concerned that it has unfairly limited the ability of certain \nprograms to adequately train future health care providers.\n  Over the last few years, we have heard much discussion about the \nissue of physician oversupply. As you may know, various experts suggest \nthat the true problem regarding physician supply is an unequal \ndistribution of physicians across the country. In my State of North \nDakota, for example, more than 85 percent of the counties are in health \nprofessional shortage areas. There certainly isn't a physician \noversupply in my state--we are grateful for the health care providers \nserving our communities and we are grateful to have facilities with the \ncapability to train medical residents.\n  Recently, it came to my attention that one of the teaching hospitals \nin my State had committed to training an increased level of medical \nresidents. This situation arose because another facility in my State \nwas no longer able to offer these residents an adequate training \nexperience. The facility's decision to take on the new residents was \nimportant--while we cannot guarantee that physicians trained in my \nState will pursue permanent practice in the State, we know that \nproviders are more likely to serve where they are trained. And it is \nimportant to note that the University of North Dakota produces a higher \npercentage of graduates who practice in rural settings than any medical \nschool in the Nation.\n  The facility took on these residents assuming that they would receive \nadequate Medicare graduate medical education reimbursement to train \nthese individuals. Unfortunately, retroactively set BBA limits capped \nthe allowable reimbursement level just prior to the time the residents \nin question came on board. Thus, the facility was already committed to \ntraining these residents but the funds they depended on to do so were \nno longer available. The result of this situation is that the entire \ngraduate medical residency program is suffering and I am concerned tat \nthis could result in reduced services for beneficiaries.\n  The legislation I introduce today will correct the unintended \nconsequence of the BBA by allowing a technical adjustment to medical \nresident caps in certain situations. I am confident this legislation \nwill help ensure we have adequate resources to meet our health care \nneeds well into the future. I urge my colleagues to support this \nimportant effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. \n        Moynihan):\n  S. 1632. A bill to extend the authorization of appropriations for \nactivities at Long Island Sound; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n\n\n            reauthorization of the long island sound office\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a \nreauthorization bill of critical importance to the future of \nConnecticut's most valuable natural resource, the Long Island Sound. \nThis bill, which I offer with my colleagues Mr. Dodd, Mr. Schumer, and \nMr. Moynihan, reauthorizes the Long Island Sound Office through the \nyear 2005, and increases the grant authorization amount to $10 million.\n  The Long Island Sound is among the most complex estuaries in the \nNational Estuary Program, both in terms of the physical features and \nscientific understanding of the estuary system, and in the context of \necosystem management. Unlike most estuaries, Long Island Sound has two \nconnections to the sea. Rather than having a major source of fresh \nwater at its head, flowing into a bay that empties into the ocean, Long \nIsland Sound is open at both ends, flowing to the Atlantic Ocean to the \neast and to New York Harbor to the west. Most of its fresh water comes \nfrom a series of south-flowing rivers, including the Connecticut River, \nthe Housatonic, and the Thames, whose drainages reach as far north as \nCanada. The Sound's 16,000 square mile drainage basin also includes \nportions of New York City and Westchester, Nassau, and Suffolk Counties \nin New York State. The Sound combines this multiple inflow/outflow \nsystem with a diverse and complex shoreline, and an uneven bottom \ntopography. Taken together, they produce unique and complex patterns of \ntide and currents.\n  The interaction between the Sound and the local human population is \nalso complex. The Sound is located in the midst of the most densely \npopulated region of the United States. In total, more than 8 million \npeople live in the Long Island Sound watershed and millions more flock \nyearly to the Sound for recreation. The Sound provides many other \nvaluable uses, such as cargo shipping, ferry transportation and power \ngeneration. It is largely because the Sound serves such a concentrated \npopulation that the economic benefits of preserving and restoring the \nSound are so substantial. More than $5.5 billion is generated annually \nin the regional economy from water quality-dependent activities such as \nboating, commercial and sport fishing, swimming, and beach going.\n  In 1994, the Long Island Sound Management Conference, sponsored by \nthe EPA, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, \nand the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection, completed a \n$15 million Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan (CCMP). That \nplan was adopted by the Governors of New York and Connecticut and the \nEPA Administrator.\n  The EPA Long Island Sound Office coordinates the implementation of \nthe plan among the many program partners, consistent with the Long \nIsland Sound Improvement Act of 1990. The office is small, staffed by \ntwo EPA employees, whose salaries are covered by EPA's base budget, and \na Senior Environmental Employment Program secretary. In addition, the \noffice supports two outreach positions, with one in each state. It \navoids duplicating existing efforts and programs, instead focusing on \nbetter coordination of federal and state funds, educating and involving \nthe public in the Sound cleanup and protection, and providing grants to \nsupport implementation of the Long Island Sound restoration effort. By \ncoordinating the activities of numerous stakeholders involved in the \nSound's management program, in addition to serving as an educational \nand informational interface with the public, the Long Island Sound \noffice provides an integral local outreach and meeting point.\n  While the quality of the Sound has improved dramatically over the \nyears, there is still much work to be done. Implementation of the CCMP \nwill help restore fish populations that have been impacted by hypoxia, \nwill improve and restore degraded wetlands, and will begin to address \nthe toxic mercury pollution that has lead to health advisories for fish \nconsumption in many of the Sound's waters. Specific near term goals of \nthe office include reducing nitrogen loadings which degrade water \nquality by depleting the Sound of oxygen, supporting local watershed \nprotection efforts to reduce nonpoint source pollution, monitoring and \nexpanding scientific understanding of the Sound, and educating the \npublic and regional stakeholders about the sound and cleanup \nactivities. Federal, State, and private funds have been well-spent over \nthe years to research the conditions in the Sound and to identify \nconservation needs. We are now moving to apply critical funding toward \nimplementing these projects, directly improving the water quality and \nhabitat of the Long Island Sound.\n  Overall, recent federal funding of the program and the office are \nsmall relative to state commitments. New York State has approved $200 \nmillion for Long Island Sound as part of a $1.75 billion bound act. \nConnecticut has awarded more than $200 million in the past three years \nto support upgrades at sewage treatment plants and is a national leader \non wetlands restoration. The Long Island Sound Office now faces a \ndaunting task, orchestrating a multi-billion dollar effort to implement \nefforts to reduce nitrogen loadings that degrade the waters of the \nSound. The modest increase in the authorization levels, and the \nreauthorization of the Long Island Sound Office, therefore represent \ntimely, important contributions to the cooperative regional effort to \nrestore the waters of the Long Island Sound.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n\n[[Page S11368]]\n\n  S.J. Res. 34. A joint resolution congratulating and commending the \nVeterans of Foreign Wars; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                        VFW DAY JOINT RESOLUTION\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation honoring the centennial of the Veterans of Foreign Wars \n(VFW) of the United States, which will occur on the 29th of this month.\n  Earlier this year, the Senate passed my legislation designating \nSeptember 29, 1999, as ``National VFW Day.'' I would like to express my \nsincere appreciation to my colleagues for joining me in honoring the \nmore than 2 million members of the VFW, and urge the approval of this \nlegislation, which congratulates all members of the VFW on the occasion \nof the organization's centennial. Similar legislation passed the House \non June 29 and awaits approval by the Senate. I hope that we can pass \nthis legislation before September 29 in order to pay tribute to these \nbrave protectors of liberty.\n  As I indicated, September 29, 1999, marks the centennial of the VFW. \nAs veterans of the Spanish-American War and the Philippine Insurrection \nof 1899 and the China Relief Expedition of 1900 returned home, they \ndrew together in order to preserve the ties of comradeship forged in \nservice to their country.\n  They began by forming local groups to secure rights and benefits for \nthe service they rendered to our country. In Columbus, OH, veterans \nfounded the American Veterans of Foreign Service. In Denver, CO, \nveterans started the Colorado Society of the Army of the Phillippines. \nIn 1901, the Philippine War Veterans organization was started by the \nPhilippine Veterans in Altoona and Pittsburgh, PA. In 1913, these \nvaried organizations with a common mission joined forces as the \nVeterans of Foreign Wars of the United States. I am truly honored to \nsalute this proud organization.\n  The joint resolution I am introducing today recognizes the unselfish \nservice VFW members have rendered over the last 100 years to the Armed \nForces, to our communities, and other veterans. It also highlights the \nhistoric significance of this important day in the lives of so many \nveterans, and calls upon the President to issue a proclamation \nrecognizing the anniversary of the VFW and the contributions made by \nthe VFW to our Nation.\n  I have nothing but the utmost respect for those who have served their \ncountry. With this legislation, we say ``thank you'' the men and women \nand their families who have served this country with courage, honor and \ndistinction. They answered the call to duty when their country needed \nthem, and this is but a small token of our appreciation.\n  The centennial of the founding of the VFW will present all Americans \nwith an opportunity to honor and pay tribute to the VFW and to all \nveterans. I thank my colleagues for joining me in a strong show of \nsupport and an expression of thanks to the VFW and all \nveterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day":

(a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) One of the most outrageous examples of the failure of \n     the Federal Government to honor its obligations to veterans \n     involves the so-called ``atomic veterans'', patriotic \n     Americans who were exposed to radiation at Hiroshima and \n     Nagasaki and at nuclear test sites.\n       (2) For more than 50 years, many atomic veterans have been \n     denied veterans compensation for diseases, known as \n     radiogenic diseases, that the Department of Veterans Affairs \n     recognizes as being linked to exposure to radiation. Many of \n     these diseases are lethal forms of cancer.\n       (3) The Department of Veterans Affairs almost invariably \n     denies the claims for compensation of atomic veterans on the \n     grounds that the radiation doses received by such veterans \n     were too low to result in radiogenic disease, even though \n     many scientists and former Under Secretary for Health Kenneth \n     Kizer agree that the dose reconstruction analyses conducted \n     by the Department of Defense are unreliable.\n       (4) Although the Department of Veterans Affairs already has \n     a list of radiogenic diseases that are presumed to be \n     service-connected, the Department omits three diseases--lung \n     cancer, colon cancer, and central nervous system cancer--from \n     that list, notwithstanding the agreement of scientists that \n     the evidence of a link between the three diseases and low-\n     level exposure to radiation is very convincing and, in many \n     cases, is stronger than the evidence of a link between such \n     exposure and other radiogenic diseases currently on that \n     list.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     lung cancer, colon cancer, and brain and central nervous \n     system cancer should be added to the list of radiogenic \n     diseases that are presumed by the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs to be service-connected disabilities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/23/senate-section/article/S11370-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11370-S11371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n           committee on agriculture, nutrition, and forestry\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.

Mr. President, it is a pleasure for me to \nrecognize today one of South Carolina's finest public servants, Judge \nLewis Stith. August 1 marked Mr. Stith's 43d year of continued service \nto the town of Sullivan's Island.\n  A native of Sullivan's Island, Mr. Stith and his wife, Marguerite, \nraised their five children there after he returned from service in the \nU.S. Coast Guard during World War II. He later served in the Korean \nwar.\n  In 1956, Lewis Stith was appointed a Charleston County magistrate, a \nposition he held for 25 years. In 1981, he was appointed municipal \njudge of Sullivan's Island, a position he still holds. Judge Stith's \ncivic accomplishments are numerous and include helping to organize the \nSullivan's Island Volunteer Fire and Rescue Department 51 years ago.\n  The Sept. 1-7 issue of the Moultrie News featured an article which \npays tribute to Lewis Stith's commitment to Sullivan's Island and to \nhis wife and children who are continuing the island leadership \ntradition. I ask that the article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                  [From the Moultrie News, Sept. 1999]\n\n                    Lewis Stith of Sullivan's Island\n\n       The ``Island Boys'' ruled the beach back then. Lewis Stith, \n     Burt and George Wurthman, Frank and Vernon Damewood, Tony \n     Blanchard, and John and Otis Pickett, just to name a few, \n     spent their days enjoying the ocean, and playing half rubber \n     on the beach at Sullivan's Island. Life was simple. Being \n     surrounded by summer cottages and neighbors that knew \n     everyone made life a yearlong vacation. The Pavilion was \n     located at Station 22 and Burmester's Pharmacy was where \n     Sullivan's Restaurant now stands. The soldiers at Fort \n     Moultrie shot off the cannons everyday at 5 p.m. to mark the \n     end of the day.\n       Lewis Stith, who was born at Station 24, November 9th, \n     1921, is still there and though his life has taken him on \n     many journeys, he always returns because, ``There's no place \n     in the world like Sullivan's Island!''\n       The son of Luther P. and Susan Maguire Stith, Lewis is a \n     well known figure on Sullivan's Island. After high school, \n     Lewis went on to work for the Army as a Post Exchange Clerk \n     and later as a bookkeeper until WW II. He then entered the \n     Coast Guard and served at various shore stations and was \n     eventually assigned to a troop transport--U.S.S. General A.W. \n     Brewster APA 155--as a gunners mate. He traveled the \n     European, Asiatic and Pacific theaters transporting troops. \n     At the end of the war, Lewis was discharged on the WWII Point \n     System in 1945.\n       Lewis returned to Sullivan's Island to be with his wife \n     Marguerite Strickland and eventually raised five children. \n     His sons are well known islanders as well. Paul is a Wachovia \n     Bank Manager, Marshall is the Mayor of Sullivan's Island and \n     owner of Station 22 Restaurant, and Anthony is the Sullivan's \n     Island Fire Chief. Their two daughters, Debbie White and \n     Susan Hindman, are both school teachers. The Stith's have six \n     grandchildren.\n       After several jobs, 35 years at the Exxon corporation and \n     also serving in the Korean War, Lewis was appointed a \n     Charleston County Magistrate on August 1st, 1956, by State \n     Senator T. Allen Legare. He remained a Magistrate for 25 \n     years. On August 1st, 1981, Lewis was appointed Municipal \n     Judge for Sullivan's Island and is still serving in this \n     position.\n       ``When I was first appointed Magistrate in 1956,'' said \n     Stith ``Mount Pleasant, Sullivan's Island, and the Isle of \n     Palms had only one police officer in each town. Buck Gossett \n     was the only Highway Patrolman in the area and Charleston \n     County had very few officers back then.''\n       Fifty-one years ago, five guys got together to form the \n     Sullivan's Island Volunteer Fire and Rescue Department. \n     Lewis, along with Art Chiola, Joe Rowland, Red Wood and Leo \n     Truesdale are the original five members and are still active \n     in the volunteer effort today. The Army donated two trucks \n     and a station to house them. They were the first volunteer \n     rescue squad in the county.\n       Lewis served as chief of the department, and recalls one \n     particular devastating fire that was very chilling. ``I think \n     it was 1952 on Station 28. The house was in the shape of an \n     H. The kitchen wall backed up to the children's bedroom wall \n     and a gas fire ignited and spread. Art Chiola and I found the \n     children the next day in a closet,'' he said, describing the \n     remains as gruesome. ``Apparently, they couldn't find the \n     door and entered the closet looking for a way out.''\n       The Volunteer Fire Department started some of Sullivan's \n     Island's most popular events including the annual Fish Fry \n     and Oyster Roast. Fifty one years ago, the Fish Fry started \n     as a fund raiser for Red Wood's sister-in-law who need \n     surgery for an aneurysm. It eventually grew into a large \n     community event and the proceeds raised now go to fund the \n     Fire and Rescue Division's special training and equipment. \n     ``We have a tremendous turnout these days,'' said Lewis. \n     ``When we first started it was in the same location that it \n     is now, but all we had was some cinder blocks and a steel \n     plate to cook on. Now things have grown and we have the \n     present facility called `The Big Tin.' ''\n       Lewis and Marguerite remember the good old days on the \n     island. ``After Labor day,'' said Marguerite, ``The \n     vacationers would all go home and there would only be about \n     25 permanent residents.''\n       ``We played recreation activities with the soldiers and got \n     to see first run movies at the fort,'' added Lewis. ``Middle \n     Street was the only road through the town and you could drive \n     your car on the beach.''\n       Marguerite was a Charleston girl, and Lewis met her through \n     a friend. He began to date her and, according to Marguerite, \n     ``We'd come over the Sullivan's Island Bridge and every time \n     he would say, `Smell that good salt air? Isn't it great?' I \n     never told him that I could smell that same air on the Cooper \n     River Bridge and in Charleston,'' she said laughing. ``He \n     thought there was no better place than Sullivan's Island, and \n     he was right!''\n       After Hurricane Hugo though, the island completely changed. \n     ``All the summer cottages were wiped out entirely and \n     replaced with massive homes that tower over the beach. But \n     this is still God's country!'' said Lewis. ``You can't find a \n     better place to raise a family.''\n       August 1st of this year marked the 43rd Anniversary of \n     Lewis's continued service for the Town of Sullivan's Island. \n     He's done many other things for the town, including forming \n     the VFW Walter Brownell Post #3137 on Sullivan's Island. He \n     served as the first Commander.\n       Lewis attributes all of his success to many things, but his \n     greatest accomplishment he said, was marrying his wife and \n     raising his five successful children. ``I owe it all to my \n     good family upbringing. I grew up during the Depression and \n     we just learned to take care of what you had. I am also a \n     member of Stella Maris Catholic Church. These things have \n     taken me where I'm at today.''\n       Still active as a judge, and still loving Sullivan's Island \n     like he always has, Lewis sums it up by saying, ``I've been \n     all over the world, and there is no place like the sandy spot \n     we live on. I love it here.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/23/senate-section/article/S11371-2", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11371-S11373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DAVID LEWIS WILLIAMS\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a tribute \nto Kentucky State Senator David Williams,\n\n[[Page S11372]]\n\nas sincere congratulations for 15 years of service in the General \nAssembly and as encouragement for many more years of accomplishments \nand victories still to come.\n  David is one of the sharpest politicians and smartest people I know. \nHis long-time passion for politics and desire to serve Kentucky is \nevidenced in his hard work in the Kentucky Senate--and in his \nperseverance getting there. David's strong convictions about issues and \nprinciples important to Kentuckians have helped him become a prominent \nfigure in the State legislature, but his climb to the top was not an \neasy one. David lost his first campaign for public office when he ran \nfor county judge-executive, and has often faced tough opposition in the \nSenate. To his credit, David has remained committed to his constituents \nand to the values they elected him to represent.\n  When he was elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives 15 years \nago, David was a country lawyer from Burkesville, Kentucky. His sharp \nmind and peerless rhetorical skills were evident right from the start, \nand helped David eventually come to lead the now-Republican Majority in \nthe Senate.\n  As a fellow public servant, I know first-hand the kinds of \ncommitments and sacrifices that have to be made in order to effectively \nserve a constituency. Clearly, David has demonstrated his willingness \nto take on that responsibility, and has been an example through his \nability to handle the daily demands of being a Senate leader. \nAdditionally, he is a great family man. David's wife Elaine has surely \nbeen a great support and encouragement to him, and deserves \ncommendation for her tireless work in the field of education, as the \ninstructional supervisor for Cumberland County Schools. David is also \ndevoted to his parents, Lewis and Flossie Williams, of Cumberland \nCounty. David's father served as Cumberland County clerk for nine \nconsecutive terms, and was a high school principal and basketball coach \nwhen David was growing up. His parents' work in education and politics \ngave David a solid background that has prepared him well for his \ncurrent leadership role in the State Senate, and will certainly \ncontinue to inspire him in future endeavors.\n  David, on behalf of my colleagues and myself, thank you for your \nfifteen years of service to the 16th district and to the people of \nKentucky. I have every confidence in your ability to lead the State \nSenate, and know that your best days are yet to come.\n  Mr. President, I ask that an article which ran in the Louisville \nCourier-Journal on September 5, 1999, be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n          [From the Louisville Courier-Journal, Sept. 5, 1999]\n\n                  Williams Gets Closer to Senate Peak\n\n                            (By Tom Loftus)\n\n       Burkesville, KY.--David Williams began learning hard \n     political lessons at a young age.\n       In the second grade he lost an election ``for some kind of \n     class favorite'' by a single vote. ``At that time I was \n     chivalrous enough to vote for my opponent,'' Williams said. \n     ``I decided I wasn't going to do that again.''\n       It wasn't the last election Williams would lose, yet come \n     away a bit the wiser--and with his passion for a career in \n     elective office undiminished.\n       Today, after serving 15 years in the General Assembly--many \n     of those years in a minority faction of the minority \n     Republican Party--David Williams stands as perhaps the most \n     powerful member of the General Assembly.\n       This summer's defections of two Democratic senators to the \n     GOP gives the Republicans a majority in the Senate for the \n     first time ever--making Minority Leader Williams into \n     Majority Leader Williams, and likely Senate President \n     Williams.\n       So when the legislature convenes in January, the Senate \n     will be led by this 46-year-old lawyer from Burkesville, a \n     man described as smart and articulate by some, cocky or \n     condescending by others.\n       Williams calls himself a compassionate conservative. Many \n     Democrats consider him their favorite Republican senator.\n       At his core, he's a man who lives government and politics.\n       ``We can't get him out to golf; he really doesn't have any \n     time-consuming hobbies.'' said Cumberland District Judge \n     Steve Hurt.\n       ``He has always been fascinated by the political process. \n     He's the kind of guy who sits up at night watching `Hardball \n     with Christ Matthews' and C-SPAN.''\n       In January, Williams plans to play a little hardball of his \n     own.\n       Last week he said he'd exercise the majority's rightful \n     power to bounce Louisville Democrat Larry Saunders as Senate \n     president.\n       ``I want the majority of the members of the Kentucky state \n     Senate to choose the president they feel most comfortable \n     with,'' Williams said.\n       ``And if it happens to be David Williams, I would be most \n     proud to serve in that position.''\n\n\n                political aspirations run in the family\n\n       Williams runs a one-man law practice in his hometown of \n     Burkesville, county seat of the predominantly Republican \n     Cumberland County. He and his wife, Elaine, who is \n     instructional supervisor for the Cumberland County schools, \n     live in a house valued on tax rolls at $225,000. They have no \n     children. Williams is the only child of Lewis and Flossie \n     Williams, who still live in the house where David grew up.\n       The family regularly attended Burkesville United Methodist \n     Church, and Williams' parents put a high value on the \n     importance of a good education. Lewis Williams was a \n     principal and basketball coach who, after losing his first \n     campaign for county clerk, won nine consecutive elections for \n     that office without opposition.\n       ``We went to Lincoln Day dinners when I was a small boy. I \n     heard (U.S. Sen.) John Sherman Cooper, (Fifth District \n     Congressman) Tim Lee Carter, (U.S. Sen.) Thruston Morton and \n     all those folks,'' Williams said. ``I grew up in the \n     courthouse. After school and on Saturdays I'd hang out there \n     when I was a kid. And I was actively involved in the local \n     party when I was 15 or 16 years old.''\n       At Cumberland County High School, Williams was the senior \n     class president, lettered in baseball, and was captain of the \n     football team. His quotation next to his photo in the 1971 \n     yearbook is: ``The scales of justice can only be balanced by \n     the weight of involvement.''\n       Williams said he particularly liked playing football. He \n     was a center on offense and a tackle on defense. ``If I had \n     been a step quicker I could have played college ball,'' he \n     said. (Hurt, who quarterbacked the 1971 Cumberland County \n     team, suggested Williams would have to have been a bit more \n     than one step quicker.)\n       In fact, though he and his wife like to fish and keep a \n     pontoon boat on Dale Hollow Lake, their favorite pastime is \n     college sports. As a legislator he takes advantage of the \n     chance to buy two tickets to University of Kentucky and \n     University of Louisville football and basketball games. He \n     travels to most UK football games on the road and attends \n     postseason basketball tournaments when UK plays.\n       ``The football season is something I really enjoy,'' he \n     said. ``I usually try to catch U of L when I can. I'm one of \n     those rare people who like both UK and U of L.''\n       Williams is a graduate of both.\n       After high school, he and his then-girlfriend Elaine \n     Grubbs, went on to UK. They dated off-and-on through college.\n       At UK Williams was true to his high school yearbook \n     quotation. Among other things he was in the student senate \n     and ran for student body president--the clean-shaven frat boy \n     who ran against an opponent he describes as ``long-haired and \n     hippie-ish.'' Williams lost.\n       After graduation, Williams enrolled at the U of L Law \n     School. He married Grubbs after his first year there.\n       Williams said he could have studied law at UK but wanted to \n     broaden his experience. And he liked Louisville.\n       ``My closest relatives live in Louisville--aunts and uncles \n     on my father's side of the family--and I visited Louisville \n     often as a boy,'' Williams said. ``I lived in Louisville \n     during some of the summers when I was growing up because when \n     my dad was a teacher, he would go to Louisville and roof \n     houses on construction crews and make good money in the \n     summer. .  .  . We would go up and live with relatives.''\n\n\n                    Lessons learned through setbacks\n\n       After law school, Williams returned to Burkesville to \n     practice law and--at age 25--ran for county judge-executive. \n     His opponent was incumbent Harold E. ``Barney'' Barnes--a \n     Democrat who had been appointed by Gov. Julian Carroll when \n     the elected judge died in office. Williams lost.\n       ``It taught me some interesting political lessons about \n     incumbency,'' Williams recalled. ``When the governor and the \n     local judge have an unlimited amount of blacktop and things \n     like that, it can have a big effect.''\n       But in 1984 Williams ousted state Rep. Richard Fryman of \n     Albany, a fellow Republican. Two years later he succeeded \n     retiring Sen. Doug Moseley of Columbia and has been re-\n     elected to the state Senate three times since--the last two \n     times without opposition.\n       During his Senate tenure, though, Williams was twice \n     rejected by the voters in years when his Senate seat was not \n     up for re-election.\n       In 1992 he won a Republican primary for the U.S. Senate but \n     was drubbed in the general election by popular incumbent \n     Democrat Wendell Ford, who won with 64 percent of the vote.\n       But perhaps the nadir of Williams' political career came \n     the following year.\n       While stewing in a minority faction of the Senate \n     Republican caucus, Williams decided to try to be a prosecutor \n     and ran for commonwealth's attorney in his home four-county \n     district. He lost.\n       But he never considered dropping out of politics.\n       ``I didn't think any of the losses were due to my lack of \n     ability or people not liking\n\n[[Page S11373]]\n\n     me,'' he said. ``I'm no Lincoln, but even Lincoln got beat \n     two or three times.''\n       Longstanding alliances within the small Senate Republican \n     caucus had largely kept Williams out of a leadership position \n     there. But the number of Senate Republicans grew during the \n     1990s.\n       During the 1998 session, after the Republican minority had \n     grown to 18 senators, Williams was part of (but he insists \n     did not lead) an attempt to oust Sen. Dan Kelly's Republican \n     leadership team--a coup that failed when Republican senators \n     voted 9-9.\n       After the 1998 elections changed the make-up of the caucus, \n     Williams finally had the votes he needed to win election as \n     Senate Republican leader.\n       And defections of two Democratic senators to the GOP mean \n     he's likely to become Senate president.\n\n\n                     A mix of attorney and preacher\n\n       Williams said Kentuckians can expect him to take generally \n     conservative stands on most issues.\n       ``But I don't hate government,'' he said. ``I'm not a \n     person who is afraid to use government to effect change. . . \n     . I come from an area of the state that has needs. I've grown \n     up and lived with people who have needs. I've grown up in \n     areas that needed roads, that needed schools.''\n       In fact, in 1990 Williams was one of only three Senate \n     Republicans who voted for the Kentucky Education Reform Act, \n     which included a massive tax increase.\n       ``I voted for it because the school districts in rural \n     Kentucky did not have adequate resources, the students there \n     did not have adequate opportunity,'' Williams said. ``I'm not \n     unalterably wed to every aspect of the Kentucky Education \n     Reform Act. . . . But I still feel like I cast the right \n     vote.''\n       Besides his support of KERA, Williams is known in the \n     legislature for his long fight to win funding for a resort \n     lodge at Dale Hollow, his advocacy of workers' compensation \n     law reform (which Gov. Paul Patton pushed through in 1996), \n     and helping to increase state spending on adult education.\n       Williams is better-known, though, for his skill as a \n     debater. ``David Williams is and has always been one of the \n     most articulate members of the Senate,'' said Senate \n     Democratic Leader David Karem of Louisville. ``There's a \n     wonderful mix of the courtroom attorney and the traditional \n     Kentucky preacher in the way he delivers his speeches from \n     the floor.''\n       Williams said Republicans are inclined to oppose two ideas \n     Patton has floated this year as ways of raising state \n     revenue--raising the gas tax and expanding legal gambling.\n       But he said he's not prepared yet to slam the door on \n     either idea. ``We haven't seen a bill yet,'' he said.\n       And if Williams succeeds in leading the Senate, might he \n     make another race for statewide office?\n       Williams said he has no plans to seek higher office, though \n     he's not ruling out the possibility.\n       Sen. Tom Buford, R-Nicholasville, said Williams could be a \n     strong candidate for governor in 2003. ``He hasn't said \n     anything,'' Buford said. ``But I would watch that.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/23/senate-section/article/S11373-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 IN RECOGNITION OF THE BETHESDA FALCONS\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \nBethesda Soccer Club Falcons for winning the Under-16 girls Maryland \nState Cup Championship.\n  The Falcons defeated their opponent, the Soccer Club of Baltimore \nForce, 11-0. This victory marked the team's seventh consecutive state \ntitle--one for every year that they have been eligible to win--which \nalso happens to be a Maryland record.\n  Every Falcons team member was a contributor to this important \nvictory. On the offensive, the game's leading strikers were Audra \nPoulin and Jenny Potter, who had three goals apiece. Jenna Linden added \ntwo goals to the team's fight, while Christi Bird, Stephanie Sybert, \nand Allison Dooley chipped in the remaining scores for the Falcons. \nThis overpowering offense was aided by the passing and play-making \nabilities of the Falcons' talented mid-fielders: Beth Hendricks, Tara \nQuinn, Jennifer Fields, Susannah Empson, and Tanya Hahnel.\n  One of the keys to the Falcons' victory was their unwavering and \nsteadfast defense which allowed no goals and only a few shots by the \nunrelenting Baltimore Force. This defense was anchored around defenders \nCaitlin Curtis, Amy Salomon and Alison West, while the goal posts were \nkept clear by goalies Anna Halse-Strumberg and Kerry York.\n  It was a fitting ending to the tournament in which the Falcons, \nthrough five games, outscored their hard-working opponents 29-0. The \nfollowing day, the Falcons continued their winning efforts by defeating \nthe Baltimore Soccer Club Pride--another great Maryland team. The \nFalcons finished in first place in the Washington Area Girls' Soccer \nAssociation Under-17 Premier Division.\n  Mr. President, as many of my colleagues know, I believe we must get \nbehind our kids and support them in their hard work. The importance of \nthis principle was demonstrated by Falcons coach, Richie Burke, who did \njust that. As a result, the team fought hard and produced a definitive \nvictory. I'm proud to have such a great team and a fantastic coach in \nMaryland, and I'm proud of all the participants in the Maryland State \nCup Championship for their hard work and dedication.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/23/senate-section/article/S11373-2", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO MR. FRANCIS WILSON\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. \nFrancis M. Wilson and his wonderful and admirable life.\n  Mr. Wilson served as a tech-sergeant during World War II in Germany \nwhen he was only 18 years old. He was an engineer in the Detroit Public \nSchool District, a devoted family man, and an active citizen. The \nchallenges he successfully faced in these capacities have distinguished \nhim within his family, his town, his state, and his country.\n  As a very young boy, he sold ``Liberty'' magazines to supplement his \nfamily's income during the Great Depression. Growing up during a time \nof financial strife led him to find solace in nature. Mr. Wilson was \nexposed to nature during his experience in the military and developed a \nlove and knowledge of it. As a young adult he was able to identify a \nvariety of birds, insects, trees, and flowers. He then went on to form \nand preside over a group of citizens that forced new construction to \nadhere to guidelines designed to protect nearby lakes.\n  Once he reached adulthood, Mr. Wilson found his real love, Dolores. \nTogether they found great joy in their children and grandchildren. Mr. \nWilson wanted to ensure that they received all the advantages that he \ndid not have. He inspired his children to put themselves through \ncollege. He provided them with the opportunity to grow up in a safe \nenvironment, allowing them to mature at a more deliberate pace than the \none that was forced upon him. His wife, Dolores, expresses the best \ntribute to Mr. Wilson when she writes ``this brave, honest, dedicated, \nordinary man was to his family and America `the staff of life' that \nfuels generations to come.''\n  Mr. Wilson expressed his passion for education through his \ninvolvement with children as an engineer of thirty years in the Detroit \nPublic Schools. He gave and received respect from all he knew. He not \nonly led by lecture but, more importantly and effectively, by example. \nHe never left any doubt as to where he stood in a debate and firmly \nbelieved in right and wrong. Mr. Wilson offered little patience for \nindividuals passing on responsibility as an excuse for negligent or bad \nbehavior. Personifying Winston Churchill's statement, ``We make a \nliving by what we get, but we make a life by what we give,'' Mr. \nFrancis M. Wilson left this world an honorable, loyal, selfless servant \nto his country and a loved and missed father, grandfather and \nhusband.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/23/senate-section/article/S11373-3", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11373-S11374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF OAKLAND, MARYLAND\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I would like to bring to the \nattention of my colleagues the celebration of the 150th anniversary of \nthe Town of Oakland, Maryland. The Mayor of Oakland, Asa McCain, Jr., \nand the entire community are planning numerous events to commemorate \nthis milestone.\n  Like so many of Maryland's historic cities and towns, Oakland, which \nwas founded in 1849, has carved its own unique place in American \nhistory. At Oakland's center is one of the oldest railroad stations in \nthe country. The Queen Anne style railroad station designed by E.F. \nBaldwin and built in 1885 by the B & O Railroad is now in the National \nRegistry.\n  The railroad was responsible for popularization of the Oakland area \nas a resort in the late 1800's and resulted in Garrett County's \nflourishing export of timber and coal. Recently purchased by the ``Save \nthe Oakland Station Committee,'' the station will be restored to its \noriginal splendor in an effort to provide a cornerstone for continued \ngrowth in the County. In recognition of\n\n[[Page S11374]]\n\nOakland's community effort to revitalize its economy and preserve its \nhistoric past, the Town received a National Mainstreet Designation from \nthe National Historical Trust in May of this year.\n  Another historically significant location in Oakland is the Church of \nthe Presidents, built in 1868. Three United States Presidents, Grant, \nHarrison, and Cleveland, attended services there and preferred Garrett \nCounty to any other place for their vacations.\n  Today, Oakland and Garrett County are well known as one of the finest \nall-season resort areas, offering abundant sports activities including \nfishing, hiking, skiing--both alpine and cross-country--and boating. \nThe natural beauty of this pristine area of our state led to Oakland's \noriginal name, ``The Wilderness Shall Smile.'' In addition, the town of \nOakland, with its large victorian homes and beautiful tree-lined \nstreets, enhance the appeal of this cool, mountainous retreat.\n  Oakland has faced its share of economic difficulties. The departure \nin 1996 of Bausch and Lomb, the largest employer in the area, dealt a \nsevere blow. Nevertheless, Oakland faced the problem head-on and \norchestrated an intense effort to recruit alternative employers. In \nApril of this year, Simon Pearce, a premier glass maker and Vermont's \nlargest tourism attraction, opened a factory just outside of Oakland. \nThrough the inspired leadership of Mayor Asa McCain, the town of \nOakland will continue to thrive and prosper well towards the Town's \n200th anniversary.\n  Oakland is a model of community spirit and cooperation. The \nactivities planned to commemorate the 150th anniversary exemplify the \ndeep devotion of its residents to their community. I share the pride of \nMayor McCain and all of Oakland's citizens in their Town's historic \npast and optimism for Oakland's continued success in the years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/23/senate-section/article/S11374-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       VET CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to \npublicly acknowledge the five Vet Centers from around this country that \nare being recognized for their superior services as ``Vet Centers of \nExcellence.'' While I am proud of the fine facilities located in \nCalifornia, Arizona, Georgia and West Virginia, the one I want to \npraise today is in my state of Vermont.\n  Vermont is very fortunate to have two Vet Centers--in fact we boast \nthe first in the nation back in the days when the Readjustment \nCounseling Service (RCS) was just getting started with pilot sites \nstrategically located around the country. The nation's first Vet \nCenter, an excellent facility, was designed to help veterans in the \nBurlington, Vermont area.\n  The Vet Center we honor today opened in mid-1981 and is located in \nWhite River Junction, Vermont. It serves veterans on both sides of the \nConnecticut River in Vermont and New Hampshire. The team leader, Tim \nBeebe, assesses their work modestly, saying ``we are just doing our \njob.'' Maybe they don't understand the impact they have. This \nincredible staff go so far above their ``job''. They are caring, \ninvolved and understanding friends, devoted to offering a safe haven to \nthose veterans suffering the emotional wear and tear of battle, often \nthirty years after leaving the service.\n  I am sure I don't need to remind my colleagues in Congress that the \nwork being done at Vet Centers throughout the Country is enormously \nimportant. Over the years, the Vet Center program has been so \nsuccessful in meeting the readjustment needs of Vietnam veterans that \nthe VA Readjustment Counseling Service expanded the scope of their good \nwork to veterans of all eras. This move was heartily endorsed by \nCongress and is now law. Long before this mandate, however, the White \nRiver Junction Vet Center subscribed to an open door policy to all \nveterans. Their message was simply put: ``Welcome home--you are not \nalone.''\n  Mr. President, I believe in the great work being done by Vet Centers \neveryday throughout this country. I also know, however, that a ``Vet \nCenter of Excellence'' award is only given to the those centers that \nstand a little taller than the rest. The White River Junction Vet \nCenter staff exemplifies excellence. I want to offer my warmest \ncongratulations to this incredibly talented group of professionals and \nremind them that they are shining examples to their colleagues in the \n206 Vet Centers around the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/23/senate-section/article/S11374-2", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NORTH DAKOTA STOCKMEN'S ASSOCIATION\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today, I would like to recognize a \nvery important organization in my state, the North Dakota Stockmen's \nAssociation. I would also like to congratulate them on their 70th \nanniversary as an organization. Over the years, the North Dakota \nStockmen's Association has been an invaluable asset to their members \nand to me. In particular, after 70 years of representing North Dakota \nfamily farmers and ranchers, the Stockmen have made great contributions \nto the cultural and economic heritage of North Dakota. Their successes \nhave been accomplished through hard work and their consistent ability \nto produce the highest quality beef in the world.\n  Cattle provide an essential source of income for North Dakota \nfarmers. Based on that fact alone, it is easy to understand the \nimportance of the Stockmen's Association to my state's producers. While \nkeeping the interests of cattle producers in the minds of elected \nofficials, the members of this organization also provide valuable \nstewardship to the land, send their children to rural schools, support \nbusinesses, and help their neighbors through difficult weather and \ntough economic times. I would like to express my deep appreciation for \ntheir enduring efforts to support my state's communities, and again, I \ncongratulate them for 70 years of service to the cattlemen of North \nDakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/23/senate-section/article/S11374-3", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11374-S11375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MICHAEL J. McGINNISS\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Brother \nMichael J. McGinnis, who will be inducted as La Salle University's 28th \nPresident on September 24. Brother McGinnis was previously a member of \nLa Salle's religion department, and for the past five years was \npresident of Christian Brothers University in Memphis, Tennessee.\n  A native Philadelphian, Brother McGinnis joined the Christian \nBrothers University in 1965 and graduated Maxima Cum Laude from La \nSalle in 1970 with a degree in English. He obtained his Master's and \nPh.D. in theology from the University of Notre Dame. While a graduate \nstudent at the University of Notre Dame, Brother McGinniss taught \nundergraduate courses in the Theology Department.\n  Brother McGinniss became assistant professor at Washington \nTheological Union from 1979 to 1984, and in 1984 joined the faculty at \nLa Salle on a full-time basis, reaching the rank of full professor in \n1993. Recognized for his leadership qualities, Brother McGinnis became \nChair of La Salle's Religion Department in 1991 and the following year \nreceived the Lindback Award for Distinguished Teaching.\n  During his tenure as President of Christian Brothers University, \nundergraduate enrollment and retention rates increased, a Master's of \nEducation program was established, the Athletic Department joined the \nNCAA Division II Gulf South Conference, and the Center for Global \nEnterprise was founded.

Mr. President, today I would like to \nrecognize a volunteer group of West Virginians who have joined together \nto educate the public on an important issue affecting our state and the \nnation. These individuals, who have formed Citizens Against Lawsuit \nAbuse, CALA, are disseminating information to the public about our \ncivil justice system, and they are working to encourage jury service \nand personal responsibility in our society.\n  CALA spokespersons based in Huntington, Charleston, Bluefield, Logan, \nBridgeport, Fairmont, Morgantown and other cities in our state are \neducating the public about how lawsuit abuse can affect consumers. The \nCALA groups in West Virginia have raised funds to provide scholarships \nto students statewide through essay contests where the students address \nthe important topic of jury service and personal responsibility.\n  Teaching our children the value of civic responsibility is a vitally \nimportant component of learning, and CALA's efforts have not gone \nunnoticed. By emphasizing the virtues of jury service, CALA is helping \nto give our children a more well-rounded education and is promoting \nvalues which will serve these children, and our future, well. I am \nproud that many of West Virginia's finest students, from our public and \nprivate secondary schools, have participated in these essay contests \nand have been recognized for their efforts in our local media. The \nwinning high school essayists in last year's CALA scholarship contest \nwere Joshua Linville, Sherman High School, Boone County; Amanda Knapp, \nPt. Pleasant High School, Mason County; Matthew Walker, St. Joseph \nCatholic High School, Cabell County; Courtney Ahlborn, Parkersburg \nSouth High School, Wood County; Sarah Mauller, East Fairmont High \nSchool, Marion County; and Misty Lanham, Tygarts Valley High School, \nRandolph County.\n  Citizens Against Lawsuit Abuse groups have declared September 19 \nthrough 25 to be ``Lawsuit Abuse Awareness Week'' in West Virginia. I \ncommend the citizens for their dedication and commitment and to \nacknowledge this week as time of public awareness on the various issues \naffecting civil justice in our state. Our citizens should be encouraged \nto educate themselves about our civil justice system and how they can \nhelp to make it the best in the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/23/senate-section/article/S11375-2", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONGRATULATIONS TO CHIEF JACK KRAKEEL\n\n Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge one \nof Geogia's outstanding civil servants. On August 29, 1999, Jack \nKrakeel, Director of Fayette County's Fire and Emergency Services, was \nnamed Fire Chief of the Year by the International Fire Chief's \nAssociation. This award is a fitting honor to a man who, through his \nhard work and leadership, has provided Fayette County with a superior \nfire and rescue team and has devised innovative methods to deal with \nemergencies.\n  Under Chief Krakeel's leadership, Fayette County's emergency services \nhave found creative solutions to deal with ever-changing challenges. An \nimportant program implemented by the Department requires cross-training \nof employees. All career members of the Fayette County Department of \nFire and Emergency Services are trained as both firefighters and \nparamedics. This gives the department incredible flexibility when \ndealing with severe emergency situations.\n  Fayette County, Georgia, is one of the fastest growing counties in \nthe nation. In response to this rapid increase in demand for services, \nChief Krakeel has developed plans implemented by the Fayette County \nBoard of Commissioners which will maintain an average emergency \nresponse time of five minutes. In a business where the difference \nbetween life and death is often measured in seconds, the importance of \nthis initiative cannot be underestimated.\n  Chief Krakeel's department also recognizes the need to inform \nfamilies, particularly children, on the importance of fire safety. \nUnder Chief Krakeel's leadership, the department was the first in the \nstate to enact a multi-family housing sprinkler ordinance and also \ncreated a portable fire safety education home which teaches children \nhow to escape from a fire.\n  Jack Krakeel has also serves in a variety of leadership roles related \nto emergency services. He is the national Chairman of the National Fire \nProtection Association's ``Technical Project in Emergency Medical \nSystems.'' Also, Chief Krakeel is in his third year as a member of the \nBoard of Directors of the International Association of Fire Chiefs.\n  On a more local level, Chief Krakeel is a member of the Georgia's \nEmergency Medical Services Advisory Council, and is in his twelfth year \nof service with the organization. Not long ago he helped lead the \nformation the joint EMS Committee of the Georgia Association of Fire \nChiefs and the Georgia Firefighters Association.\n  Other accomplishments during Chief Krakeel's impressive career are \ntoo numerous to mention. It is not an exagerration to state that few \npeople have had a greater individual impact on modern emergency service \ntechniques than Chief Jack Krakeel. Mr. President, I offer my \ncongratulations to Chief Krakeel for the honor bestowed upon him, and \nmy hopes that he will continue to provide innovation and leadership for \nyears to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/23/senate-section/article/S11375-3", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11375-S11376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MR. K. PATRICK OKURA\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, this coming weekend a long time \nfriend of mine, Mr. K. Patrick Okura, will be celebrating his 88th \nbirthday. For the past decade, Pat has been extraordinarily active in \nguiding the Okura Mental Health Leadership Foundation in order to \nensure that young Asian Pacific American health professionals, \nrepresenting a wide range of disciplines, will have the skills and \nexperiences necessary to eventually achieve leadership roles throughout \nour nation's health and human services agencies. Pat obtained his \nbaccalaureate and master's degrees in psychology from the University of \nCalifornia at Los Angeles and has long been a member of the American \nPsychological Association which recently published a special article \nhighlighting his monumental accomplishments. He is currently on the \nBoard of Directors of the National Mental Health Association, the U.S. \nCommission on Civil Rights, and the Japanese American National Museum. \nHe is a past-President of the Japanese American Citizens League and \nfounder of the National Asian Pacific American Families Against \nSubstance Abuse.\n  In July of 1971, during the Presidency of Richard Nixon, Pat assumed \nthe position of Executive Assistant to the Director of the National \nInstitute of Mental Health, NIMH. For the next decade, he remained at a \nhigh level policy position within the NIMH, shepherding to fruition \nnumerous innovative mental health initiatives. He was an active \nparticipant in the deliberations of President Carter's landmark Mental \nHealth Commission. For many of us in the U.S. Congress, those were the \nglory days for mental health. There was a sense of genuine excitement \nand optimism. Our nation was finally beginning to understand and \nappreciate the social and cultural aspects of health care, not to \nmention the importance of ensuring that all Americans should receive \nnecessary care. Under Pat's leadership, our nation truly committed \nitself to the far reaching ``deinstitutionalization movement,'' an \neffort which would eventually bring mental illness out of the closet \nand ensure that all of our citizens would retain their individual civil \nliberties, notwithstanding any particular diagnosis, lack of economic \nresources, or lack of immediate family.\n  During the mid-1980s, Pat went on to serve as Special Assistant to \nthe President of Hahnemann University, once again with a unique focus \non those projects and events that made the university the great \neducational institution that it was. As I have already indicated, for \nthe past decade Pat has continued to ``give back'' to our nation by \nensuring that future generations of\n\n[[Page S11376]]\n\nAsian Pacific American health professionals will begin to appreciate \ntheir potential for excellence in leadership. Having had the \nopportunity of personally meeting with his Fellows as they come to \nCapitol Hill each year, I must say that I have always been \nextraordinarily impressed by their dedication and commitment to our \nnation. Pat Okura has truly been a visionary role model for all of us \nand the ultimate public servant. I wish him the best on this truly \nspecial occasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/23/senate-section/article/S11376-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         THE INGHAM COUNTY WOMEN'S COMMISSION 25TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge and \ncongratulate the Ingham County Women's Commission, as they celebrate \ntheir 25th Anniversary.\n  The Ingham County Women's Commission has taken great strides to meet \nthe needs of women since it was founded in 1974. The commission, \noriginally established to serve as a study and research center focusing \non the issues concerning women in the county, was restructured in 1976 \nand took on an advisory role to the Board of Commissioners. They now \nfocus on issues that impact the women of the county. They have \ncontinued their efforts in researching better ways to meet the needs of \nwomen through county resources.\n  What is truly remarkable about this select group is their dedication \nto helping enrich the lives of women. They work closely with the Equal \nOpportunity Commission to overcome discrimination against women. The \ncommission also provides many important and beneficial services to \nwomen. Their greatest accomplishments include involvement with the New \nWay In and Rural Emergency Outreach and the provision of acquaintance \nrape education for high school students. Additionally, they have \nexperienced vast success in helping raise awareness of women's issues \nby developing a sexual harassment policy for county employees, \nsponsoring the Ingham County Sexual Assault Task Force and the Michigan \nCouncil of Domestic Violence.\n  This important group of women are to be commended for their \naccomplishments over the last 25 years. Their hard work and dedication \nto conveying the importance of women's issues will benefit many women \nfor years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/23/senate-section/article/S11376-2", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             LANE KIRKLAND\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, earlier today, there was a memorial \nservice for former AFL-CIO president, Joseph Land Kirkland, on the \ncampus of Georgetown University. I was deeply saddened to hear of \nLane's passing and would like to reflect for just a few moments on his \nlife and his enormous contribution to organized labor in America.\n  Lane Kirland spent virtually his entire working life in the service \nof his country. As a young man, he enrolled in the first class of the \nU.S. Merchant Marine Academy and served the duration of World War II as \na transport officer. Following the war, Lane went back to school, \ntaking night classes at Georgetown, and received a degree in foreign \nrelations in 1948. He intended to enter the foreign service and \nrepresent American interests abroad, but shortly after graduation he \ntook a low-level research position with the American Federation of \nLabor.\n  That seemingly temporary sidestep would become the consuming mission \nof his working life. An unlikely labor leader, born of a well-to-do \nsouthern family and schooled in international relations, Lane became a \nstrong advocate for justice in the workplace and a champion of human \ndignity. From 1948 until, some would say, the day he died, he fought \nfor working people--for higher wages, better health care, and greater \nprotections for workers health and safety. It is a credit to his skill, \nintellect and unflagging determination that he was elected president of \nthe AFL-CIO in 1979, a post he faithfully held for 16 years.\n  Lane was a titan of the American labor movement. A man of great \npersonal strength, Lane used his talent and energy to act upon his \nconvictions, uniting people of diverse backgrounds and improving the \nlives of countless working families across this country and around the \nworld. During Lane's tenure as president, organized labor faced ever-\nincreasing challenges which called for strong, decisive leadership. \nWith union membership declining across the country, Lane fought \nsuccessfully to unite the Nation's largest and best-known unions under \nthe AFL-CIO, guaranteeing the continued vitality of organized labor and \nensuring it a position in American political discourse well into the \n21st century.\n  His vision for trade unionism did not stop at the water's edge. Under \nLane's stewardship, the AFL-CIO reached out to workers around the \nworld. Like few others at the time, Lane understood the global struggle \nembodied in the cold war. He was a man of great insight, and he \nrealized that a fair workplace could be used as a lever to create a \nfairer society. Ardently anticommunist, Lane believed personal freedom \nwas the right of every man, woman, and child and saw the union as a \nvehicle of freedom. Thus, he supported trade unions in China, Cuba, \nSouth Africa, Chile, and Poland, where unions were severely suppressed \nand personal freedoms denied. When Solidarity assumed power in Poland, \nLane's faith in the power of trade unions and lifetime of work to build \nthem were irrefutably vindicated.\n  With Lane's passing, a bright light for trade unions has been \nextinguished. He will be greatly missed. My thoughts and prayers are \nwith his wife, Irena, and his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/23/senate-section/article/S11376-3", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11376-S11377]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO LANE KIRKLAND\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, over the August recess South \nCarolina lost one of her most distinguished native sons, Lane Kirkland. \nUnless you knew Lane personally, you weren't likely to know he was a \nproud South Carolinian. If you did know him personally, there was no \nway not to know he was a proud South Carolinian. He went to South \nCarolina regularly; sometimes to see his brothers Ranny and Tommy, \nsometimes just to go to the wonderful small town of Camden where he \nspent his childhood summers. Whenever we would meet, officially or not, \nwe always spent some time talking about South Carolina.\n  Lane remembered and cherished his roots, but they did not bind him. \nHe had grown up with people who could not see through their rich \nheritage to the future. Lane was acutely aware of this trap and he \nillustrated this brilliantly in a commencement address to the \nUniversity of South Carolina in 1985.\n\n       I owe to Sidney Hook a thought that I offer as my final \n     conclusion from all this. From him I learned the difference \n     between a truth and a deep truth. A deep truth is a truth the \n     converse of which is equally true. For example, it is true, \n     as Santayana said, that those who cannot remember the past \n     are doomed to repeat it. Yet it is equally true that those \n     who do remember the past may not know when it is over. That \n     is a deep truth.\n\n  Lane Kirkland was a complex person as evidenced by his many \ncontradictions. He was a Southerner who found his education and \nopportunity in New York; he descended from planters but had his first \nsuccess as a sea captain; he was a child of privilege who became a \nself-described New Dealer; he was an intellectual who fought for miners \nand mill workers; and perhaps most importantly, he was a liberal anti-\nCommunist.\n  Lane had many triumphs in his life, but none was so important as the \nleading role he played in the liberation of Eastern Europe and the fall \nof the wall. He committed the resources of the American labor movement \nto preserve Lech Walesa and Solidarity. The New York Post wrote that \n``Kirkland must be included among a select group of leaders--including \nRonald Reagan, Pope John Paul II and Lech Walesa--who played a critical \nrole in bringing about the demise of Communism.'' William Safire, no \nfan of organized labor, wrote this about Lane Kirkland and Lech Walesa: \n``Together these two anti-Communist patriots fought the Soviet empire \nwhen the weak-kneed were bleating `convergence'. Their refusal to \ncompromise with evil exemplified the leadership that helped win--the \nword is `win'--the cold war.''\n  As a South Carolinian and an American, I am proud of the central role \nthat Lane played in the central struggle of this century. People in the \nUnited States and around the world know the exhilaration and \nopportunity that freedom brings in part because of\n\n[[Page S11377]]\n\nLane Kirkland. In his last speech in South Carolina, Lane addressed the \nSouth Carolina Historical Society. He opened by saying, ``I am honored \nto be here even though it suggests that I am history.'' In reality Lane \nKirkland made history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/23/senate-section/article/S11377-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11377]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO HEATHER RENEE FRENCH\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate \nHeather Renee French of Maysville, Kentucky, on her recent crowning as \nMiss America 1999.\n  Ms. French is an outstanding young woman who made all Kentuckians \nproud of her impressive showing at this year's prestigious Miss America \npageant. She made history with her win on September 18, 1999, as the \nfirst Miss Kentucky ever to be named as the reigning Miss America--and \nthe goal to help homeless Veterans she's set for her year-long term \nwill likely make history as well.\n  Though young, Ms. French has accomplished a great deal in her 24 \nyears. A graduate of the University of Cincinnati (U of C) \nundergraduate program and a student in the U of C Masters of Design \nschool, she currently teaches at the U of C design school, and is \nworking on a textbook for college-level design students.\n  Her resume boasts extensive service and volunteer experience, \nincluding working with the Make-A-Wish Foundation, volunteering at VA \nhospitals and with the Statewide Vietnam Veterans Awareness Campaign. \nIt is refreshing to see an intelligent, successful young woman who \ntakes the time to spend unpaid hours working to help others.\n  According to post-pageant interviews, Ms. French has indicated that \nthe top priority with her newly-won title is to lobby Congress on \nbehalf of America's Veterans. The daughter of a disabled Vietnam \nVeteran, Ms. French has become acutely aware of the problems Veterans \nface and the obstacles they often have to overcome.\n  I also would like to congratulate the French family, as this is their \nvictory as well. They are to be commended for the love and support they \nprovided throughout Heather's life, and throughout what was surely a \nbusy summer preparing for the September pageant. Her father, Ron, \ndeserves recognition as the inspiration for Heather's strong desire to \nhelp America's Veterans and for the Purple Heart he earned during the \nVietnam War. As a father, it would encourage me to know that my \ndaughters had learned something from a parents' adversity that would \ndrive them to help others with similar experiences.\n  My colleagues and I join in congratulating you, Ms. French, on your \nsuccess and wish you all the best in what will surely be an exciting \nyear.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/23/senate-section/article/S11377-2", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11377]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            ALASKA NATIONAL GUARDSMEN RECEIVE MACKAY TROPHY\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to take this time \nto pay tribute to the men of Air Force Rescue 470, from the 210th \nRescue Squadron in the Alaska Air National Guard. These five men, \nstationed at Kulis Air National Guard Base in Anchorage, Alaska, \nrecently received the Mackay Trophy. The Mackay Trophy is given each \nyear to the person or crew in the United States Air Force for what is \nconsidered the most meritorious flight of the year. The crew of Air \nForce Rescue 470 certainly deserve this prestigious award.\n  Let me tell you a little bit about the rescue they performed which \nled to this recognition. On May 27, 1998, six people, including two \nsmall children, flying in the Tordrillo Mountains, suddenly crashed \ninto a glacier about 10,500 feet above sea level. These people were \ntrapped in their plane, with darkness coming and the temperature \ndropping. Because they were not dressed for the extreme cold that would \ncome, these six people would surely not survive the night.\n  Fortunately for them, they had some of the best trained, best \nequipped, and bravest men were on the way to the crash site. This was \nnot an easy rescue by any means. It was already extremely cold, \nvisibility was only \\1/8\\ of a mile, the wind was anywhere between ten \nand forty knots, and the crashed plane was high up the mountain. \nNormally any one of these factors would make a rescue attempt extremely \nrisky. But Air Force Rescue 470 had to contend with all sorts of \ndeterrents in order to rescue these people before nightfall came.\n  The crew had to fly up to an altitude of over 12,000 feet because of \nthe visibility problem. The thin air made it difficult for the \nhelicopter blades to keep the aircraft aloft and for the men to \nbreathe. As soon as a hole in the clouds appeared, they dove down into \nthe mountainous terrain to land. The weather was only getting worse, \nand the pararescuers had only fifty minutes, because of the limited \nfuel supply, to pry open the wreckage of the downed plane, get everyone \nout, and get them all safely back to the helicopter, six hundred feet \naway. All six lives were saved.\n  Mr. President, I know that the crew of Air Force Rescue 470 were \nsimply happy to be serving their country on this day back in May of \n1998. I also know that they have made countless other rescues, just as \nhave other Rescue units around the country. But I am especially proud \nthat these fine young men of the Alaska Air National Guard were chosen \nfor the Mackay Trophy. So to Lieutenant Colonel John Jacobs, the pilot, \nFirst Lieutenant Thaddeus Stolar, the copilot, Master Sergeant Scott \nHamilton, Master Sergeant Steve Daigle, and Technical Sergeant Greg \nHopkins, the pararescuers, I congratulate you. Both Alaska and the \nnation thank you for your continued efforts to save lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/23/senate-section/article/S11377-3", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11377]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1999\n\n  Mr. BOND.
