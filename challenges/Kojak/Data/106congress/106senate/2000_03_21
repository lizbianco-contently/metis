Mr. President, as has been noted, we will be dealing \ntoday with the repeal of the Social Security earnings limit. I think \nindividuals on both sides of the aisle are eager to deal with this kind \nof legislation.\n  What is the earnings limit? The earnings limit is simply a way of \nsaying that if citizens between 65 and 69 years of age earn over a \nmodest amount of money when they earn outside income by working, the \nGovernment deducts from their Social Security $1 for every $3 they \nearn; that is, for $1 over $17,000, the Government reduces the benefits \n$1 for every $3 of earnings.\n  This makes it very difficult for a number of people who are between \n65 and 70 years of age, who want to be able to sustain themselves, who \nwant to be able to help their families, who want to be able to remain \nindependent and not dependent on Government. Yet Government has this \nrather onerous discriminatory effect on their work habits. It says if \nyou earn money, we are going to take money away from what you have \npreviously earned as a Social Security benefit.\n  The earnings test is a misguided and outdated relic of a time when \njobs were scarce, unemployment was high, when people did not live as \nlong and healthy lives as they do today. It is clearly a disincentive \nfor seniors to work. By telling seniors if they work hard and earn \nmoney, we will just take it away from them or we will deduct it from \ntheir Social Security, we are saying: Seniors need not apply; seniors \nneed not aspire to a better life; seniors need not expect to remain \nindependent--all of which are the wrong statements for us to be making \nto our seniors.\n  There are a great number of seniors who are working anyhow and paying \na penalty for working. It seems strange that in a country that needs \nworkers, we are asking people to pay a high penalty for working: 1.2 \nmillion working seniors are penalized now; 17,523 working seniors in \nMissouri suffer losses in their Social Security as a result of their \nindustry, their willingness to work. But the actual number of seniors \naffected by this pernicious idea of discriminating against seniors in \nthe workplace is much greater than this 1.2 million nationwide or \n17,523 in the State of Missouri. There are millions of seniors who \nchoose not to work or choose to work only a small amount because they \ndon't want to work in such a way that it will erode, undercut, \nundermine, or diminish their Social Security income.\n  Keeping seniors out of our workforce has a serious consequence. It is \nagainst our best interest to remove the kinds of things seniors bring \nto the workforce. They are great workers. They are skilled workers. \nThey are workers of value and experience. The current unemployment rate \nof 4 percent indicates to us that we need skilled and experienced \nworkers. Seniors are highly valuable members of the workforce. Their \ncontinuing contributions are crucial. The only limit to what they have \nto offer is the earnings limit. We should not limit what good people \ncan offer to this country.\n  I have spent quite a bit of time in my home State of Missouri talking \nwith constituents. There are real life examples. Beverly Paxton from \nBelton, MO, who represents the Green Thumb organization, says hundreds \nof seniors would be eager to work without the earnings test. \nFurthermore, some don't try to work for fear that the Social Security \nAdministration might take benefits away. Seniors don't want to have to \nvisit a CPA to find out whether if they go to work they will lose \nbenefits or be taxed at such a high rate that working will actually end \nup costing them money.\n  Many more limit their hours to avoid the Social Security earnings \ntest and its application which would result in the deduction of Social \nSecurity benefits. A manufacturer from Belton, MO, said to me: Seniors \nwork until they reach the income limit. Then they tell the employer: I \nwon't be here next week; I will see you next January.\n\n  Well, what does this do to our situation where we want people to be \nable to work with continuity and our manufacturers and our enterprises \nto be able to provide service with continuity?\n  Here we have an employer who is left in the lurch, having to absorb \ntraining costs or heavy overtime costs because we have said to seniors: \nYou cannot work on a regular basis if that regular basis carries you \nover the income limit. These decisions of people working for quite a \nbit of time and then precipitously dropping off or being underemployed \nby not working very much throughout the entire year are based on the \narbitrary earnings test limit of the Social Security Administration \nwhich says if you pass a certain limit, we will start deducting from \nyour Social Security check. Even when seniors work around the test, \nthey suffer unexpected costs.\n  C.D. Clark from Florissant, MO, had earned $25,000 before trying to \nlimit earnings to protect himself from the test. He had planned to work \nonly 8 months so his Social Security benefits would not be cut; he \nwould get himself down under the limit. The Social Security \nAdministration, however, assumed he would earn the same amount, the \n$25,000 he had earned previously, and withheld his Social Security \nchecks from January through March of this year. When Mr. Clark \ncomplained to the Social Security Administration that he had not \nreached the income limit of $17,000, he was told: We like to get our \nmoney up front--as if Social Security was their money, as if it were \nnot a benefit for which Mr. Clark had paid years and years of taxes.\n  Not only do we find people harmed financially, but seniors express to \nme over and over again that their physical and mental well-being is \npinned upon their ability to keep working. In St. Joseph, MO, working \nis a mental health issue. Seniors who don't work often lose their sense \nof self-worth. This point was not only made to me in my visit to St. \nJoseph but across the State. In Joplin, for example, I was given the \nsame information.\n  To the extent that the earnings test keeps as many as 200,000 \nMissouri seniors from working, it harms the mental well-being of those \n200,000 Missouri seniors who would like to be active. Over and over \nagain, this was a refrain I heard from seniors: We want to work; we \nwant to be active; we need to be.\n  The earnings test can threaten lives in other ways as well. Lois \nMurphy of St. Louis is 65 and works part-time as a registered nurse in \nthe operating room at St. John's Mercy Medical Center. The hospital \nsuffers from a labor shortage and needs help from women like Mrs. \nMurphy who are experienced, willing, and dedicated to work. She limits \nher hours because of the earnings limit. This takes a skilled, \nexperienced, and needed worker out of the hospital, out of the capacity \nof caring for other individuals.\n  Mrs. Murphy wrote to me:\n\n       The $17,000 limit a person could earn plus the small Social \n     Security check is not enough to live comfortably and enjoy \n     your senior years.\n\n  Mrs. Murphy neatly summarized this issue in one simple sentence:\n\n       I think if a senior citizen at age 65 is willing to work, \n     they should be able to earn a lot more or not have a limit.\n\n  Well, I believe Mrs. Murphy is right. Seniors should have the freedom \nto earn if they choose. The problem is that they don't have that \nchoice. We must send the earnings test into retirement. We should \nretire the earnings test, not force the retirement of our senior \ncitizens.\n  One of the business owners and operators I talked to put it this way: \nSeniors are able to work pretty aggressively through most of the year \nuntil they get up to the brink of the Christmas season when they really \nare needed. Then when they are intensely needed, the test kicks in and \nthey have to check out.\n  Many seniors who want to work don't work because of the costs imposed \nby the earnings test. Take, for example, a senior in the 28-percent tax \nbracket. The earnings test kicks in. One out of every $3 is taken away \nfrom Social Security. That turns out to be another tax of roughly 33 \npercent.\n  Then if you add the 7.65-percent Social Security tax on the people, \nand a State income tax of, say, 6 percent, you get up to a 74- to 80-\npercent combined tax load on a working senior citizen. If they have any \nexpenses of going to and from work, or wardrobe expenses associated \nwith work, it could well be that the senior citizen actually loses \nmoney. The Government is so aggressive in reducing their ability to \nearn. The earnings test is pernicious and discriminatory toward \nseniors.\n\n[[Page S1475]]\n\n  This is something we ought to address. I am delighted that the House \nhas done so and that the President has signaled his agreement with what \nthe House has done. I have been working on this since I came to the \nSenate in 1995. I voted to substantially increase the limit in 1997. I \ncalled for the elimination of the test and cosponsored legislation that \nwould get rid of the test.\n  This year, I have introduced legislation that would eliminate the \ntest. My bipartisan legislation has 43 cosponsors, including the entire \nmajority leadership. There are a number of others, organizations and \nall, who have endorsed this concept, including Green Thumb, 60+, the \nSeniors Coalition, National Association of Home Builders, National \nTaxpayers Union, the U.S. Air Force Sergeants Association, Americans \nfor Tax Reform, CapitolWatch, National Tax Limitation Committee, United \nSeniors Association, United Seniors Health Cooperative, and the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce.\n  The point is, the House of Representatives recognized the value of \nthis concept and unanimously voted to eliminate the earnings limit. The \nPresident has indicated he would sign clean legislation, unencumbered \nby extraneous amendments. I believe we should follow the lead of the \nHouse and do what the President is asking us to do--to deliver this \nmeasure which would eliminate the earnings test. It is something I have \nbeen working on now for years. It is a counterproductive, unfair \npenalty. I believe that, because the President is prepared to sign it, \nthe Senate now needs to move forward and eliminate this out-of-date and \ncostly impediment, this discrimination, this very serious problem for \nour seniors, which prohibits our culture from having the benefit and \nvalue of the best effort of many of our very best workers.\n  With that in mind, I look forward to the debate later today. I am \npleased to have had this opportunity to address this issue.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is now in a period of morning \nbusiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/21/senate-section/article/S1475-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1475-S1480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE JUVENILE JUSTICE CONFERENCE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will speak on a matter involving the \njuvenile justice conference--or, perhaps more accurately, I should say \nthe lack of a conference on the juvenile justice bill. It is a matter \nthat concerns me greatly because I was the floor leader on this side \nand the distinguished Senator from Utah was the floor leader on the \nother side when we had over a week of debate on the juvenile justice \nbill. We had a very solid debate. We then passed the bill with 73 votes \nin the Senate. It went to conference, and it was like going into the \nBermuda Triangle; we haven't seen it since.\n  Actually, this Congress has kept the country waiting too long for \naction on juvenile justice legislation and has kept the country waiting \ntoo long on sensible gun safety laws. We are fast approaching the \nfirst-year anniversary of the shooting at Columbine High School in \nLittleton, CO. It has been 11 months since 14 students and a teacher \nlost their lives in that terrible tragedy on April 20, 1999. It has \nbeen 10 months since the Senate passed the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice \nbill. As I said before, it was an overwhelming vote of 73-25.\n  Our bipartisan bill includes modest--and I believe effective--gun \nprovisions. It has been 9 months since the House of Representatives \npassed its own juvenile crime bill, which was on June 17, 1999. Then \nthe leadership in the Congress delayed action on calling a conference \nall summer. It has been 8 months since the House and Senate juvenile \njustice conference met for the first and only time. The Republican \nmajority in the Congress convened the conference on August 5, 1999. \nThey did that less than 24 hours before the Congress adjourned for a \nmonth's vacation.\n  Now, you don't have to be a cynic to recognize this for what it was. \nIt was a transparent ploy to deflect criticism for delay, but also to \nmake sure the conference could not do anything. They would not have \nenough time to prepare comprehensive juvenile justice legislation to \nsend to the President before school began in September. But we did have \ntime to do it before children went back to school in January. We didn't \ndo that. Now I wonder if we will ever do it.\n  The Senate and House Democrats have been ready for months to \nreconvene the juvenile justice conference. We have told the Republicans \nwe would meet with them on a minute's notice. We want to work with \nRepublicans to craft an effective juvenile justice conference report \nthat includes reasonable gun safety provisions. But even though the \nSenate passed this legislation by a 3-to-1 majority, no conference; the \nRepublican leadership has decided not to act.\n  I think this is particularly shameful because the Congress has spent \nmore time in recess than in session during the last meeting of this \nconference. Think about that. We have been out on vacation more time \nthan we have actually been here working since we had that last \nconference. Let's take a couple days off one of these recesses and have \na conference.\n  Two weeks ago, the President invited House and Senate members of the \nconference to the White House, both Republicans and Democrats. He urged \nus to proceed to the conference and to have final enactment of \nlegislation before the anniversary of the Columbine tragedy. \nUnfortunately, the Republican majority has rejected the President's \nplea for action. I think more than rejecting the President's plea for \naction, they have rejected the American people's plea.\n  On April 22 of last year, barely 2 days after the killings at \nColumbine High School, I came to the Senate to urge action. I praised \nthe Democratic leader, Senator Kennedy, and others for their thoughtful \ncomments on these matters and for reaching out to the families of those \nwho were killed that week. At that time, almost a year ago, I urged the \nSenate to rededicate itself to the work of assisting parents, teachers, \nthe police, and others in stemming school violence. I suggested that S. \n9, the Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act of 1999, \nprovided a good place to start.\n  Responding to our efforts to turn the Senate's attention to the \nproblems of school violence, on April 27 the Republican leader came to \nthe floor and said if we withheld for 2 weeks, he could provide a \nlegislative vehicle ``that we could take up, and the Senate would then \nhave an opportunity for debate, have amendments, and have votes.''\n  Senator Lott returned to the floor the following day to repeat his \ncommitment to provide the Senate with the ``opportunity to debate and \nvote on those issues dealing with school violence.'' To Senator Lott's \ncredit, he proceeded to S. 254, the juvenile justice bill, which was \nthen pending on the Senate calendar, and he did that on May 11. We then \nhad 2 weeks of real debate on it--one of the few we have had recently--\nand then the Senate worked its way through this bill. The Hatch-Leahy \njuvenile justice legislation, which passed the Senate on May 20, passed \nwith a strong bipartisan majority and 73 votes, with both Democrats and \nRepublicans voting for it. No one should forget it was a Republican \nmajority that decided to make the juvenile justice legislation the \nvehicle for the antiviolence amendments adopted by the Senate last \nMay. Three-quarters of the Senate voted for our legislation.\n\n  Following the action by the other body, I urged a prompt conference \non the juvenile justice legislation. I took the unusual step of coming \nto the Senate to propound a unanimous consent request to move to \nconference on the legislation, which initially encountered Republican \nobjections. But eventually this request provided a blueprint for moving \nthe Senate to agreeing to conference on July 28 of last year.\n  Unfortunately, that conference was convened for only a single \nafternoon--not with votes but of speeches. Democrats in both the House \nand Senate tried to offer motions about how to proceed to begin some of \nthe discussion. But that was ruled out of order by the Republican \nmajority.\n  Then I spoke on the floor several times last year--on September 8, \nSeptember 9, and October 21--urging the majority to reconvene the \njuvenile justice conference. I joined with fellow Democrats to request, \nboth in writing and on the floor, the majority to let us\n\n[[Page S1476]]\n\nfinish our work on the conference and then send a good bipartisan bill \nto the President. On October 20, 1999, all the House and the Senate \nDemocratic conferees sent a letter to Senator Hatch and Congressman \nHyde calling for an open meeting of the juvenile justice conference. \nThe following year, on March 3, 2000, after yet another shocking school \nshooting involving 6-year-old classmates in Michigan, Representative \nConyers and I wrote again to Senator Hatch and Congressman Hyde \nrequesting an immediate meeting of the conference. The response has \nbeen resounding silence.\n  Two weeks ago, I felt honored to be invited to a White House summit \nby the President of the United States. I joined Senator Hatch, \nCongressman Hyde, and Congressman Conyers in an Oval Office meeting \nwith the President--a very substantive meeting. It went on well over an \nhour on what was a very busy day for the President. He urged the \nreconvening of the conference. He urged action by the Congress to send \nhim a comprehensive bill before the 1-year anniversary of the Columbine \ntragedy. I met with the President again that evening. He said again: \nPlease, will you just meet and send me a bill, especially before the 1-\nyear anniversary of Columbine. His entreaties, which I thought were \nwell intentioned and were done seeking bipartisan support, were \nrebuffed. No conference has been scheduled.\n  This is only the latest in a long series of delays that have plagued \nthis legislation. We had to overcome technical obstacles and threatened \nfilibusters just to begin the juvenile justice conference, and, \nunfortunately, I see no sign of abating the delays. We worked hard on \nthe Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill, S. 254, and passed it by a vote \nof 73 to 25, but we cannot get a conference.\n  What I worry about is the impression we give the country. We will \nstand here and debate symbolism. We will take long recesses. We will \ntalk about everything but the thing that is on the minds of parents and \nschoolchildren.\n  I am blessed with representing a State that I believe has the lowest \ncrime rate in the Nation. We are a State where most of us don't even \nlock our doors. But it is interesting, when I go to schools in my State \nand talk to parents, to teachers, and to the children, they worry. Then \nI go into some of these other larger, urban States, and the concern is \nenormous.\n  We have become a terribly violent nation notwithstanding that the \nvast majority of Americans are good and law-abiding people. I come from \na State where a majority of the people own firearms. I own many myself. \nWe don't have gun control laws in our State. We teach people to respect \nthe weapons they have. But the people in Vermont have the same sense of \nrevulsion that I do when they see some of these shootings and they see \na Congress unwilling to even stand up to a powerful gun lobby.\n\n  Can anybody forget what was probably one of the most terrible \npictures I have seen, and terrible in what it said, at the Jewish day \ncenter in California where a man went in attacking and shooting? You \nremember the photograph of the heavily armed police officers leading \nthe little children out across the street. Every one of us has children \nand has been with children. We have seen them in grade school with a \nteacher leading the group of children. All the children hold hands. \nThey hold hands with the teacher. And what a happy, cheerful time: We \nare going to recess. We are going to class. We are going to learn. And \nthey are protected and safe because they are with their teacher or \ntheir parents. But this time police officers led these children. They \ndid not know what was going on with the heavily armed officers bringing \nthem to safety. The police officers must have children of their own, or \ngrandchildren of their own, and were thinking about what was going on.\n  These are images that frighten people in this country. It is \nreasonable that they are frightened. We ought to respond. We are \ntalking about a juvenile justice bill that has a whole lot of things \nway beyond any question of gun control. It has in it only modest gun \ncontrol. It closes some loopholes in the law where you can't go to a \nflea market in the middle of a Saturday afternoon, and buy a gun \nwithout a real check on your background.\n  We have an opportunity in the conference to cut through partisan \ndifferences to make a difference in the lives of our children and \nfamilies. We need to meet in the conference to debate our motions, and \nvote them up or vote them down, but at least meet and vote. We are paid \nto vote yes or no. We are not paid to pass the buck. That is what is \nhappening here.\n  I don't know what my friends on the Republican side worry about. \nThere are more of them than there are of us. They control the schedule. \nThey have the votes. They can vote down anything they want. The \nprocedural hurdles and the delays that plague this legislation are \nsimply because of the opposition of the gun lobby to any new firearm \nsafety laws.\n  Unfortunately, the leadership is being held hostage by the extreme \nviews of the NRA and other special interests. If they really wanted to \npass effective juvenile justice reforms and protect our children \nagainst gun violence, they could do it tomorrow. The President would \nsign the Hatch-Leahy bill in a second if it reached his desk.\n  Last year, the Y2K Act conference only took 2 weeks to complete, and \na bill was sent to the President to provide legal protections for \nbusiness--legal protections, as it turned out, that they didn't need. \nBut when it comes to protecting our children where there is a real \nneed, we can't act unless the NRA tells us we are allowed to act. That \nis wrong.\n  I didn't come to the Senate to have any group or any special interest \ngroup on the right or the left tell me what I can do or not do. Only \nthe voters of my State can make a decision that they don't like the way \nI vote. They can throw me out. But we should not allow this great body \nto be held hostage by special interest groups--no matter how many \nMembers they have, no matter how much money they spend on television, \nor no matter how outrageous a claim they make.\n  I have stood on this floor many times, but some of the proudest times \nI have had in public service were as a prosecutor in law enforcement. \nLet's listen to our Nation's law enforcement officers. They say pass a \nstrong and effective juvenile justice bill. Ten national law \nenforcement organizations, representing thousands of law enforcement \nofficers, have endorsed the Senate-passed gun safety amendment. They \nsupport loophole-free firearm laws.\n  I remind Senators of the time Members of this Congress turned their \nback on police officers when the NRA said don't ban cop-killer bullets. \nDo you remember that? Law enforcement said: Wait a minute. We put our \nlives on the line for you. How about protecting us?\n  Here are the organizations that have endorsed the gun-safety \namendment and that support loophole-free firearm laws:\n  The International Association of Chiefs of Police, the International \nBrotherhood of Police Officers, Police Executive Research Forum, Police \nFoundation, Major Cities Chiefs, Federal Law Enforcement Officers \nAssociation, National Sheriffs Association, National Association of \nSchool Resource Officers, National Organization of Black Law \nEnforcement Executives, Hispanic American Police Command Officers \nAssociation.\n  These law enforcement officers need help in keeping guns out of the \nhands of people who should not have them. I am not talking about people \nwho use guns for hunting and sport but about criminals and unsupervised \nchildren. These organizations want Congress to move.\n  We recognize there is no single cause and no single legislative \nsolution that will cure the ill of youth violence in our schools or in \nour streets. We have an obligation to do our part. It is time to act.\n  This list represents organizations that endorse the Senate-passed gun \nsafety amendments. These are not organizations that take a pie-in-the-\nsky attitude. These organizations represent people who work in an \nincreasingly violent society, putting their lives on the line to \nprotect all Americans, just as the police officers in the Capitol put \ntheir lives on the line every day to protect everyone. Since I have \nbeen here two have died doing that.\n  These organizations ask: Will you at least stand up for us as we \nstand up for the quarter billion Americans?\n\n[[Page S1477]]\n\n  I see the distinguished senior Senator from Rhode Island on the \nfloor, Mr. Reed. I applaud Senator Jack Reed for his resolution for the \njuvenile justice conference to report a final bill by April 20 of this \nyear, the 1-year anniversary of the Columbine High School shooting.\n  I am proud to cosponsor this resolution. I am proud to work with my \ngood friend. I admire him for his initiative. I yield the floor to the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. I commend the Senator from Vermont for his eloquence and \nhis passionate support of this vital legislation. It is vital to the \nchildren and to the families of this country.\n  As the Senator pointed out, it has been 11 months since the tragic \nincident at Columbine High School. Last April 20, we witnessed with \nhorror and revulsion an attack on children who were just going to \nschool. The entire country stood up as one and said: We have to do \nsomething. We have to stop this senseless gun violence. We have to \ncreate a country in which easy access to firearms and the resulting \nviolence is something of the past.\n  However, it has not stopped. The violence continues every day with \ntragic consequences throughout this country--in Seattle, WA; in \nAtlanta, GA; in Los Angeles, CA; in Honolulu, HI; in Ft. Worth, TX; in \nSidney, OH; in Wilkinsburg PA; in Mount Morris township in Michigan; \nand thousands of other places where, regrettably and tragically, gun \nviolence is so common in this country that it doesn't make the front \npage because the incidents aren't that graphic or that violent.\n  The first anniversary of the tragedy at Columbine High School is just \naround the corner, April 20. Still, the conference committee on \njuvenile justice has not yet discharged their duty and sent back a bill \nthat contains common, safe, gun safety measures that were passed by \nthis Senate. In fact, as the Senator from Vermont pointed out, the \ncommittee has met only once, last August. For 8 months we have waited. \nWe have waited; the American people have waited. We have waited for \ncommonsense protections that have been frustrated and thwarted by the \nRepublican leadership at the behest of the NRA. They have ignored the \nwill of the American people and the overwhelming desire of the American \npeople to protect the safety of their children and the safety of their \ncommunities.\n\n  I believe the American people have waited long enough. Today, along \nwith my colleagues, Senator Boxer of California, Senator Leahy, and \nothers, I will introduce a sense-of-the-Senate resolution calling for \nthe juvenile justice conferees to complete and submit the conference \nreport before April 20, the first anniversary of the Columbine \nshooting, and to include in this conference report the amendments \npassed by this Senate seeking to limit access to firearms by juveniles, \nby convicted felons, and by other persons.\n  Will the passage of this legislation stop gun crime in this country? \nNo, it won't. But it will represent a step forward to impose reasonable \ncontrols on the easy access to firearms for those who should not have \nthem: Children, criminals, those whose mental capacity is diminished \nenough so they resort to violence with these weapons.\n  Within the core of this juvenile justice legislation are simple, \ncommonsense approaches to ensure we have a safer society: Closing the \ngun show loophole, requiring safety locks to be sold with handguns, \nbanning the importation of large capacity ammunition clips, and \noutlawing juvenile possession of assault weapons.\n  We will bring common sense to our gun laws with these measures and, \nhopefully, reduce the avalanche of violence that is engulfing so many \nin this society.\n  In my home State of Rhode Island, in the city of Providence alone, 26 \npeople were murdered in 1999. That is up from 15 in 1998. Firearms were \nused in the vast majority of the killings in both years: 19 out of the \n26 people who were killed last year were killed with firearms, 11 of \nthe 15 the year before. And Providence, my capital, is a small city of \nroughly around 200,000 people.\n  Last year, when we were talking about Columbine High School, if any \nMember came to this floor and said: I predict a 6-year-old child will \nwalk into first grade and kill another 6-year-old child with a handgun, \nwe would have been lambasted as extremists, hysterical, provocateurs, \nirresponsible, reckless. Guess what. It happened. Incidents such as \nthat happen each and every day.\n  Just a few weeks ago in Providence, RI, two young boys were rough-\nhousing with each other--a 17-year-old and a 13-year-old friend--doing \nwhat boys have been doing for a long, long time. They were razzing each \nyear, wrestling with each other, seeing who was the most tough. They \nwent on and on and on. One of them got frustrated. Now, when I was \nyounger, that frustration might have led to a punch in the nose, a \nbloody nose, and some hard feelings, but that was all. Somebody in the \ncrowd had a gun and this young boy recklessly and without thought \ngrabbed that gun just to show how tough he was, pointed the gun at the \n13-year-old, pulled the trigger, thinking nothing would happen, and \nshot that 13-year-old in the head. That shooter, that young man--not a \ncriminal, just a kid rough-housing around in the neighborhood--was so \novercome with remorse that he fled to an adjacent backyard and shot \nhimself in the head.\n  That is gun violence in America today. That is the cost of easy \naccess to firearms. These aren't criminals. These were kids doing \nsomething stupid. But because they had guns, it resulted in death and \ndestruction.\n  We are not kids here. We are supposed to be adults. We are supposed \nto be responsible. We are supposed to represent the best values and \nideals of this country. That means we must stand up and vote on \nmeasures such as this juvenile justice bill.\n  I ask on behalf of the 12 children killed each day by gun violence \nthat we bring this conference bill back to this floor with those \nreasonable gun control measures included. Someone has to speak for \nthem. Someone must speak for them. Someone must demand these measures \ncome before the Senate.\n  We cannot continue to listen to the siren song of the NRA in this \nChamber. We cannot be hypnotized by all the spin and the hype and all \nthe misinformation and misdirection. We have to respond to the reality \nof kids easily getting handguns and unwittingly and, tragically, \nkilling each other.\n  We have a country in which the homicide rate by handguns far \nsurpasses that of any other country in the world. In Japan, in 1996, \nthere were 15 people killed with handguns, in a country of 126 million \npeople. That is 1 person in every 8.4 million. The ratio in the United \nStates? One person out of every 27,000. What is the difference? \nCultural? Genetic? Demographic? They have gun laws that make it \ndifficult for anyone and everyone, willy-nilly, to own handguns.\n  It is the same story the world over. Canada, perhaps the country \nclosest to us in culture, in demographics and ethnicity, is also a \ncountry that had a great frontier, a country that had the same kind of \nchallenges we had opening up their great west. It is a country of \noutdoors men and women; it is a country, in many respects, with the \nsame cultural values we have. Yet in that country, in 1996, 106 people \nwere killed out of a population of 30 million. That is 1 person in \nevery 284,000--many, many, many times fewer people killed by gun \nviolence in a country so similar to ours. The difference? Once again, \nthey have sensible laws that govern access to handguns.\n  We could go on and on. But as long as a criminal can walk into a gun \nshow and buy a gun without a background check and walk out before any \ntype of check can be done, as long as kids can get access to firearms \nwithout safety locks on them so they can use them, as we have seen \nhappen too often, as long as it is harder for a kid to open a bottle of \naspirin than it is to shoot a gun, because we have childproof tops on \naspirin containers, we are going to have these problems.\n  It is our responsibility to act. It is our responsibility to stand \nup. We have not done that. Time is drawing close to April 20, 1 year \nafter Columbine. I cannot think of a better way, not only to \nmemorialize the victims of that shooting but to give meaning to that \nsenseless tragedy, than for this body and the House to send to the \nPresident a gun control measure that will provide the sensible, \nreasonable controls that are so critical.\n\n[[Page S1478]]\n\n  I see the Senator from California. There is no one in this body who \nis not only sensitive but more forcefully engaged in this effort than \nmy friend and colleague, Senator Boxer, someone who I am proud to say \nwill cosponsor this resolution, someone I am proud to say will continue \nher valiant efforts to lead the way for sensible gun control in this \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, how much time remains in the morning \nbusiness period?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Thirty minutes remains under the \ncontrol of Senator Durbin.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will take 60 seconds at this time, and then I will \nyield to Senator Daschle, who will speak on his leader time. I am so \nproud he has come over to the floor.\n  I wish to say in this minute, before my friend from Rhode Island \nleaves, what an amazing addition he is to this Senate. I say that from \nthe bottom of my heart. I served with him in the House and he was a \ngreat House Member. I predict he has an unbelievable future in the \nSenate. Why do I say that? Because he has courage, because he has \nconviction. He is not afraid to take the floor on issues that are \ndifficult; to take on, perhaps, some of the special interests that, \nbelieve me, do not take kindly when you stand up and speak from your \nheart about issues that impact on their bottom line. In this case, it \nis the bottom line of groups out there that want us to take no action \nagainst gun violence.\n  We have a plan. We have a great plan that passed the Senate. It is \nendorsed by so many law enforcement groups and the vast majority of the \nAmerican people. I can think of no more appropriate speaker than our \nDemocratic leader to tie the pieces together and to talk about why the \ntime is ripe.\n  I did offer a similar resolution to that of Senator Reed. I am proud \nto cosponsor his. It got 49 votes--49-49. We didn't know that or Vice \nPresident Gore would have broken the tie. Next time we will be ready.\n  I yield the floor, and I will reclaim it when my leader is finished.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use my leader time and allocate \nthat time to my comments on the floor this morning.\n  Let me begin by acknowledging, as well, the extraordinary leadership, \nnot only of Senator Reed, but of Senator Boxer. Everything Senator \nBoxer has said about Senator Reed is a view that I think is shared by \nRepublicans and Democrats alike. He has come to the Senate and in a \nvery short period of time established himself as an authority on a \nnumber of key issues, including education and defense matters, as well \nas now, on neighborhood safety. I applaud him again for taking the \nleadership, as he has.\n  Senator Boxer, on this, as well as on so many other issues, comes to \nthe floor, grinds it out, and speaks as passionately and as eloquently \nas anybody in this Chamber. It is an extraordinary privilege to work \nwith her as well.\n  I have heard the proposal made by the Senator from Rhode Island that \nwe set for ourselves a date by which we must act with respect to \njuvenile safety, and that we choose a date that we all ought to \nremember--April 20th. Last year, that date, the date of the Columbine \ntragedy, triggered our commitment to better safety and prompted the \nSenate to act. We left with an expectation that, as a result of that \naction in the Senate, things were going to happen, that we could send a \nmessage of hope to the people of Colorado and to the people of this \nNation that we will not tolerate the violence that exists in this \ncountry. We sent the message that we will respond to tragedy with \ncareful, commonsense approaches that will make schools and \nneighborhoods safer, such as balanced gun legislation. That is what we \nsaid and that is how we voted. We are on record as having supported \nsuch commonsense legislation.\n  In poll after poll, it is remarkable the degree to which the American \npeople support the actions taken by the Senate and the amendments \noffered by our Democratic colleagues. It is overwhelming.\n  There has been a sea change, an attitudinal progression on this issue \nin the country--a sea change. I represent a Western State where, after \nyou are born, on your first or second birthday, virtually, you get a \nshotgun--because that is what we do. I am proud I have shotguns. I love \nto go hunting. I love to walk and take in nature in all of its splendor \nin the fall. That is part of the culture of the West. It is a part of \nthe culture of growing up in South Dakota of which I am very proud and \nI love. I will defend it, and I will work to ensure that my children \nand grandchildren and great grandchildren have these same experiences.\n  But there is a difference. That difference is becoming even more \nextraordinarily evident as we read about experiences such as we read \nthis morning in the Washington Post, an agonizing description of what \nkind of setting created this despicable act in Michigan. A young boy, 6 \nyears old, takes a gun, walks into a school full of children, his \nschool, picks out a girl, says, ``I don't like you,'' and shoots her to \ndeath. That story generated a front page article and a spread, inside \nthe paper, of two full pages--and it should have. Why? Because this \nincident illustrates the magnitude of the torturous existence that now \nis becoming more and more prevalent all across this country in schools \nand in neighborhoods.\n  But you could put that kind of story on the front page of the \nWashington Post every single day. It happened in Michigan, but it \nhappened yesterday somewhere else. It happened in Rhode Island shortly \nafter that. It happens every day. Those of us who appreciate the \nculture of a good pheasant hunt recognize there is a huge difference \nbetween that and the disastrous consequences of this proliferation of \nguns that now has become a real threat to the safety and well-being of \nchildren in virtually every school in America today.\n  All the Senator from Rhode Island is suggesting is that at long last \nwe say: Look, we've talked enough. Let's act. We took the first step \nlast May. We expected that we would take additional steps. We have not. \nWe have talked. We have positioned. We have wrung our hands in agony as \none shooting after another has been pasted on the pages of every single \nnewspaper in the country.\n  The litany of additional Columbines has continued all across the \ncountry. These new shootings may not have claimed as many lives. But \nthey are tragedies nonetheless. They ought to trigger action.\n  Let us act. Let us meet in conference and work through our \ndifferences so that we can finally say: We are not only going to talk \nabout this. We are going to do something about it.\n  We recognize that passing the modest gun safety measures in the \nJuvenile Justice report will not completely solve the problem of gun \nviolence. There may be other things that can be done. I am very \ngrateful to HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo, and others in the \nadministration, for having worked out a remarkable and historic new \nagreement with Smith & Wesson.\n  What a statement: for Smith & Wesson to acknowledge that guns are \ninherently dangerous, and that they are going to do something about it. \nRegardless of what their motivation may be, the fact is, they are going \nto do something about it. In making this commitment, they are setting a \nprecedent. I would love to see every gun manufacturer follow Smith & \nWesson's lead. It is common sense.\n  I have long admired President Ford, for many reasons. My admiration \nfor him increased again this past week when he spoke about the need for \nthis Congress to respond in a commonsense way to the gun violence that \nis claiming too many of our children.\n  The American people are looking to us. They want to know that we hear \nthem. They want us to give them some hope that we can solve the real \nproblems facing families and communities--not only in Columbine, but in \nSouth Dakota, Michigan, Rhode Island, California, and all across \nAmerica. The American people want to know that our democratic process \nworks.\n  In these days before the first anniversary of the Columbine tragedy, \nwe ought to take President Ford's wise counsel to heart. For the sake \nof our children, we need to come together and pass common-sense gun \nsafety laws.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my Democratic leader for his \ncomments and his continual leadership on\n\n[[Page S1479]]\n\nthe gun issues that impact the people of our Nation.\n  I want to set into the Record a series of facts, a series of \nstatistics, a series of numbers. I know sometimes when you lay down a \nseries of numbers such as this, people's eyes glaze over and they lose \ntrack of what you are talking about.\n  I urge everyone listening to this to think not about the numbers so \nmuch as the people behind the numbers.\n  In the year 1997, which is the last year for which we have \nstatistics, 32,436 people died from gunshots in America--more than \n32,000 people. I want everyone to think about what it would mean to you \nif any of these 32,000 people were from one of your families, what it \nwould mean to you if it was your dad, if it was your mom, if it was \nyour child, if it was your grandma, if it was your grandpa.\n  Twelve children die every single day from gunfire. Actually, if you \naverage it out, it is between 12 and 13 children under the age of 18--\neach and every day.\n  Our children are dying. And what are we doing? We are dithering \naround doing nothing about it.\n  I understand that this week we are going to take up a flag \ndesecration amendment. There are those who believe we need to protect \nthe flag by authoring an amendment changing the Bill of Rights for the \nfirst time in our history to specifically spell out an antidesecration \nflag amendment. I will be supporting a statute, a bill, to protect the \nflag. I do not think we need to go to such a step as amending the Bill \nof Rights. But be that as it may, flag desecration is an issue.\n  In over 200 years, there has been an average of one flag desecration \na year, and we are acting again. Mr. President, 32,436 people died in \n1997--in 1 year--and we are doing nothing. Why can't we protect the \nflag and take care of protecting the people? Why can't we protect the \ndesecration of the flag by a statute that is easy to do and then bring \nup the juvenile justice bill and protect the thousands of people who \nare dying each and every year? What about the desecration of the \nchildren, of the families?\n  In the 11 years of the Vietnam war--one of the most tragic periods in \nour history--58,168 fine, wonderful, glorious Americans died in combat. \nThere is a number, a number that is enshrined on the wall on that \nbeautiful memorial down here that we all go to often--and we should go \nto often--to pay our respects. It was a war that destroyed so many \nfamilies; and so many veterans who came back then committed suicide \nbecause of that war. It was a time in our history when our country came \nto its knees; 58,168 Americans died in Vietnam over an 11-year period. \nLet me tell you how many Americans have died over an 11-year period \nfrom gunshots not related to any war: 395,441 Americans.\n  Mr. President, 58,168 Americans died in the Vietnam war; 395,441 \nAmericans died from gunshots in an 11-year period. What are we doing \nabout it? Nothing. That is the equivalent of almost seven Vietnam wars \nover an 11-year period. What are we doing about it? Nothing.\n  We hear the NRA President say: We should do nothing. His answer is \ngive more guns to people.\n  For every American who dies from gunfire, another three are injured.\n  Over that 11-year period, we have almost a million people injured \nfrom gunfire. They could be paralyzed. These could be very serious \ninjuries, and sometimes they are. Fifty people killed or injured in \nschool shootings in America in the last year. Thirty-one percent of \nchildren age 12 to 17 know of someone their age who is carrying a gun--\ngun-packing children. We are to blame. They are not to blame. We are \nthe grown-ups. We set the rules. This is a society of law and order. \nWhat are we doing about it in the Senate? Nothing.\n  Fifty percent of children age 9 to 17 are worried about dying young. \nWhat kind of America do we have now? When I was growing up, I didn't \nthink I was going to die young. I thought I was going to go to school, \nget an education, have a family, work, have a life of fulfillment. I \nnever thought for one minute that that could all be ended by a gunshot \nfrom a friend, a classmate on the street, in a McDonald's, in a drive-\nby shooting, road rage.\n  We had better face our problems. We have the greatest country in the \nworld, but we have problems. We need to face them. We are not here to \nignore problems. We are not here to say everything is great. We need to \nact on our problems. This is a problem.\n  Listen to the law enforcement groups that back us on this when we say \nbring out the juvenile justice bill.\n  The juvenile justice bill; that is the one bright spot. We passed it \nin a bipartisan fashion about a month after Columbine, with Al Gore \ncasting a tie-breaking vote on one of the most important amendments. \nThis is what we passed.\n  We closed the gun show loophole--Senator Lautenberg's amendment--that \nallowed criminals to walk into a gun show and simply get it. He could \nbe crazy. He could be a felon. He could be intending to kill people on \nthe street, to kill people in a school, to harm himself. He could walk \ninto a gun show without having a background check. But if he went into \na gun store, he would have to have a background check. All we did was \nclose that loophole. What is the Senate doing about it now? Nothing. It \nis languishing in the committee.\n  We banned the importation of high-capacity clips which are used in \nsemiautomatic assault weapons. That was Senator Feinstein's amendment, \na very important amendment.\n  We prohibit the domestic manufacture of those clips, but the \nimportation continues. These clips are coming in. We simply say: End \nthat importation. We passed that.\n  We passed the Kohl amendment requiring that child safety locks be \nsold with every handgun.\n  We passed the Boxer amendment which required the Federal Trade \nCommission and the Attorney General to study the extent to which the \ngun industry markets its products to juveniles. These companies are \nmanufacturing guns that resemble toys, that are sold to youngsters and \nget them interested.\n  We made it illegal with the Ashcroft amendment to sell or give a \nsemiautomatic assault weapon to anyone under the age of 18.\n  Five amendments, we passed them in a bipartisan way. They went off to \nconference, and they have been languishing for now 9 or 10 months. It \nis the same with Senator Reed's amendment.\n  It is time to stop the dithering. It is time to stop bowing to the \nNational Rifle Association and bowing to the gun lobby. It is time to \nstand up and be courageous, bring those amendments forward, protect our \nchildren, and stop the carnage that is happening in our country.\n\n  Who supports these five sensible gun control amendments? Senator \nLeahy, in his wonderful opening remarks today, put them forward: The \nInternational Association of Chiefs of Police, International \nBrotherhood of Police Officers, Hispanic American Police Command \nOfficers Association, Police Executive Research Forum, Police \nFoundation, Major Cities Chiefs, Federal Law Enforcement Officers \nAssociation, the National Sheriffs Association, the National \nAssociation of School Resource Officers, the National Organization of \nBlack Law Enforcement Executives.\n  We cannot have a more diverse group of law enforcement.\n  We have five important, sensible gun control laws that passed the \nSenate, that went into a conference committee.\n  If one reads how a bill becomes law, they know how it is done: A bill \nhas to pass the House; a bill has to pass the Senate. The juvenile \njustice bills passed both bodies. You then go to the conference \ncommittee. Both sides sit across from each other and talk about what \nbelongs in the bill. They bring the bill forward, and we vote up or \ndown. This bill has languished for 10 months.\n  Now, what is some good news? Senator Daschle alluded to the Smith & \nWesson agreement. Smith & Wesson is the largest manufacturer, if not \none of the largest, of handguns. They have made an agreement as part of \na lawsuit because gun manufacturers are now being sued for these \ndeaths. They have agreed that all their handguns and pistols will now \nbe shipped with child safety devices. Within 2 years, the handguns will \nbe manufactured with internal locks. If a child picks up a gun and they \ndon't know the combination, they will not be able to turn and hurt \nanyone--sensible.\n\n[[Page S1480]]\n\n  Within 1 year, all pistols will be designed so they can't be readily \noperated by a child under the age of 6. Handguns must pass a \nperformance test. That gets to a bill I have about banning junk guns. \nThey will drop these guns down. They will see if they go off. A lot of \nthese handguns are so cheaply made, they fire when you don't want them \nto, and when you need them to, they jam up. They are not good products. \nThey are junk guns. Smith & Wesson is going to put forward a test.\n  Every handgun will be designed with a second hidden serial number so \nthey can be traced in a crime--another very important point. The \ncompany will sell only to authorized distributors and authorized \ndealers who adhere to a strict code of conduct. That means they will \nperform the background check. They will make sure the person coming in \nis not inebriated, is not high on drugs, doesn't have a criminal \nrecord, isn't under age. They will not sell any gun at any gun show \nunless every seller at the gun show conducts a background check. They \nwill not sell their guns until that background check is completed, and \nthey say it may well take 3 days.\n  They will not sell any high-capacity magazines or semiautomatic \nassault weapons. They will not sell products to anyone who has not \ntaken a certified firearms safety course. And Smith & Wesson dealers \nwill only allow purchasers to take one gun with them at a time.\n  They will have to wait a couple of weeks before they get their other \ngun. The company will devote 2 percent of its revenues to development \nof smart guns and within 3 years the smart gun technology, which allows \nonly the authorized person to shoot it, will be in place. All new \nmodels will not be able to accept magazines with a capacity of over 10 \nrounds. There will be an oversight commission to enforce this, which \nwill include representatives from the city and State governments, and \none from the gun industry.\n  So what I have laid out in this presentation, first of all, is the \nfacts on violence in America--irrefutable facts. I give these facts out \nand my colleagues come up and say: Could this be true? Could it be true \nthat in 11 years more than 300,000 Americans have been killed by gun \nviolence? Could it be true that every day 12 or 13 children are killed?\n  They can't believe it. And we send the facts to the Centers for \nDisease Control. We send them to the people who keep these terrible \nstatistics, and they come back to me and say: Senator, you are right. \nWe doubted you. We are sorry. We can't believe this is happening in \nAmerica today. But it is.\n  So we have laid out the data, the facts on gun violence in America. \nWe have laid out the five gun provisions languishing in the conference. \nCommonsense gun control that passed this Senate in a bipartisan way is \nsuddenly being smothered over there in the conference committee, and we \ncan't get it to the floor of the Senate and the House.\n  Day after day we read about 6-year-olds shooting 6-year-olds, 10-\nyear-olds shooting 10-year-olds, 12-year-olds shooting 12-year-olds.\n  We don't deserve to be here if we don't do this. We don't deserve to \nbe here, let alone be reelected, if we don't do this. The Vietnam war \nbrought the country to its knees. We lost 58,000 people-plus in that \nwar. It was a most tragic period of time. I remember that time. But we \nnow have 300,000 people-plus dying from guns in an 11-year period \ncompared to 58,000, and we sit here dithering around doing nothing \nwhile law enforcement tells us to please act. ``We are outgunned,'' \nthey tell us. ``We are losing people. We are losing this war.'' We have \na war in our streets. I laid out the organizations that are backing \nthese five sensible amendments.\n  Finally, I laid out the good news of the Smith & Wesson agreement. I \ncall on every single gun company that wants to stay in business to go \nahead and duplicate what Smith & Wesson has done. I thank them for \nacting. They are taking the heat for acting. I think Senator Daschle is \nright. Maybe they acted only because they had a lawsuit. Maybe they \nacted only because they thought they would go bankrupt if they didn't \nact and people would continue to sue them. The fact is, they acted; \nthey acted on each and every point we have made on this Senate floor.\n  So, yes, we are going to see flag desecration brought up. We know \nover the last 200 years there has been one flag desecration a year on \naverage, while every day 12 children are killed by guns; and over the \npast 11 years 300,000-plus Americans have been killed, and we do \nnothing. The juvenile justice bill is languishing--languishing--in the \ncommittee. I call on the Senators who are in charge of that \nconference--and they are my friends--to break the logjam and bring this \nlegislation to the Senate floor. It passed with a bipartisan vote. \nOverwhelmingly, people want us to do it.\n  The Smith & Wesson agreement proves the point that the time is ripe \nfor these measures. I say if we do it, we will be proud; we will have \ndone something to protect our children, protect our people, protect our \ncommunities, and turn around a blight on our country at a time of great \nprosperity and great hope.\n  I see the Senator who has done such an amazing job in the \nPresidential race. I welcome him back. I thought the issues he raised \nwere vital. I am glad to see him back, and as a result of his \nappearance on this floor, I am happy to yield at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from California for \nher kind remarks. I appreciate, obviously, the time that I was able to \nspend in her great State. I hope she appreciates the economic input \nthat our campaign made, and I hope I can get some rebate from the \nnumerous campaign commercials we purchased in her State. I thank her \nfor the hospitality shown to me by all of the citizens of the State of \nCalifornia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/21/senate-section/article/S1480-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1480-S1481]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 KOSOVO\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this Friday marks the first anniversary of \nNATO's air campaign to drive Serbian forces out of Kosovo. I want to \nspeak briefly this morning about the current situation that, \nregrettably, remains, in the words of the respected newsmagazine, The \nEconomist, ``a mess.''\n  Reports over the weekend that General Reinhardt, the KFOR commander, \nbelieves that peacekeeping troops will likely need to remain in Kosovo \nfor ten years or more have, I am sure, given my colleagues more than \njust cause to worry over the wisdom of our continued involvement there. \nThat is more than understandable, given the divisions among NATO \npeacekeepers, and our allies' frustrating reluctance to meet their \ncommitments to the international police force in Kosovo; considering \nthe U.N.'s predictable difficulty in rebuilding something approaching \nnormal civilian live where ethnic hatreds are as deep-seated as ever; \nand considering that the malevolent Mr. Milosevic continues to make \ntrouble whenever and wherever he can.\n  Surely, the United States needs to be much more forceful with some of \nour allies who assume that the United States will always compensate for \nthe deficiencies of their resolve and accept a greatly disproportionate \nshare of the burden of stabilizing the Balkans. Most importantly, we \nmust insist, and I emphasize that verb, that we have the full support \nof our peacekeeping partners in opposing Serbian efforts to foment \nfurther violence in Mitrovica and elsewhere. One of our allies \nsometimes appears to act, in defiance of the facts on the ground and \nthe dictates of conscience, as a protector of Serb aggressors. Our \nother allies in KFOR should help us persuade our badly mistaken friend \nthat such an attitude is a terrible impediment to KFOR's success.\n  This does not mean that the United States must end or threaten to end \nin the near term our participation in KFOR. Despite the unacceptable \ncircumstances of the weak and endangered peace in Kosovo, it is \ninfinitely preferable to the widespread atrocities committed during the \ncourse of Serbian aggression, atrocities that would surely reoccur were \nNATO to fail in our current mission. But our partners in peace can be \npersuaded by strong American leadership that the American people will \nnot tolerate indefinitely Europe's inadequate commitment to peace and \nstability in their own backyard.\n  Mr. President, I do not mean to overlook or minimize in my discussion \nthe\n\n[[Page S1481]]\n\nchallenges to peace created by ethnic Albanian extremists. We must be \nresolute in opposition to any threats wherever they occur. But it is a \ngrave mistake to forget that nearly all the violence and instability \nafflicting the Balkans over the last decade originated in the \nunspeakable inhumanity of Belgrade's aggressors.\n  The problems in the Balkans are, for the most part, attributable to \nthe Serbian regime, led by an indicted war criminal who continues to \nhold onto power despite overwhelming public sentiment against him. At \nany time, he can be expected to foment conflict in Kosovo, Montenegro, \nor in Bosnia. That the domestic opposition to him has been divided and \nanemic does not detract from the legitimacy of those who seek his \nremoval from power. In every respect, his is the rogue regime that \nconstitutes the greatest threat to regional peace, just as Saddam \nHussein does in the Persian Gulf and Kim Jong Il does in the Korean \nPeninsula.\n\n  The Senate's passage last November by unanimous consent of the \nSerbian Democratization Act was an illustration of the extent of \nCongress' commitment to democratic change in Serbia as the necessary \ncondition to lasting stability in the region. We should never forget \nthat, for all the long and sad history of conflict in the Balkans, it \nwas only when dictatorial regimes sought to exploit ethnic divisions \ndid conflict overwhelm peace. The recent election of a liberal \ngovernment in Croatia has greatly benefited the situation in Bosnia. \nOnly through similar change in Serbia will a lasting peace begin in \nYugoslavia. United States policy in the Balkans, and in Yugoslavia in \nparticular, must be focused on affecting the democratic transformation \nof Serbia that the Serbian people themselves desire.\n  Final passage of the Serbian Democratization Act will be an important \nstep in the right direction. In the meantime, there must be no lifting \nof the sanctions on Serbia, and no repetition in Montenegro of what \noccurred in Kosovo--vague and unbelieved threats to prevent the kind of \nethnic cleansing we are now spending billions of dollars to reverse.\n  In the days ahead, Mr. President, I hope to work again with my \ncolleagues and with the administration to help focus United States \npolicy on achieving the goals in the Balkans that are important to \nprotecting both America's interests and values in Europe.\n  Finally, on a personal note, if I may, Mr. President, as has probably \nbeen noted occasionally, I have been absent from the Senate for some \ntime. I will not burden my colleagues with a full discussion of how I \nspent my time away and what I learned from the experience. Nor do I \nthink the floor of the U.S. Senate is the proper place to discuss in \ndetail my personal feelings or political plans. However, Mr. President, \nI would like to say a few words about the great privilege we all share, \nthe privilege of serving the greatest nation in history.\n  I have enjoyed that privilege since I was 17 years old, and I \nconsider myself fortunate beyond measure to have done so. This country \nand her causes are a blessing to mankind, and they honor all of us who \nwork to make America an even better place, and America's example a \ngreater influence on human history. I felt that way before I ran for \nPresident, and I feel that way today. And although I have lost my bid \nto be President, I will never lose my appreciation for the honor of \nserving America in any capacity, and for the good will and confidence \nof the people of Arizona who allow me to serve in the U.S. Senate, a \nbody that has seen the honorable service of so many more distinguished \nAmericans than the flawed man who addresses you now.\n  I have nothing but gratitude to the American people for the privilege \nof serving them and for their consideration of my candidacy for \nPresident. I have incurred a debt to them that I doubt I can ever fully \nrepay. But I intend to do what I can, working with my congressional \ncolleagues, Republicans and Democrats, to help bring about the changes \nto the practices and institutions of our democracy that they want and \ndeserve.\n  These reforms, Mr. President, are not ends in themselves. They are \nmeans to a much more important end. They are intended to sustain \nAmerica's pride in the way we govern ourselves, and in the end to \nremind us all, those of us lucky enough to serve and those who elect \nus, what a special thing it is to be an American. I was reminded of \nthat every single day of this campaign by Americans, those who \nsupported me and those who did not, who wanted little for themselves \nindividually, but simply for our country to remain, what she's always \nbeen, ``the last, best hope of earth.'' I will never forget it.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation? \nAre we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, what I want to spend some time on this \nmorning is a very important matter that is coming up before the Senate \nshortly--a taxation issue the House has already passed. It is a tax a \nnumber of us have been working to get rid of for years. We are within \nsight of getting that done now, but we do have to get it done. People \nin this body could still block it from happening. I want to make sure \nwe get it through, and that is the elimination of the marriage penalty \ntax.\n  I have spoken about it on the floor a lot of times, perhaps too many. \nBut we are so close to finally getting this done for the 21 million \nAmerican couples who pay this tax that we really just have to see it \nthrough. What I am most fearful of is, once we get the bill out of the \nFinance Committee--they are working on it now, to eliminate this \nmarriage penalty tax--it will come through the Finance Committee, it \nwill be a good bill, it will do much to eliminate the marriage penalty \ntax--not all of it but much of it--but we will get it up on the floor \nand someone will say, ``No, I don't want to get it through,'' or, \n``Yes, I agree with you, but it has to have this rider dealing with \npharmaceuticals for Medicare patients,'' or dealing with minimum wage \nor dealing with some other issue that is extraneous to this important \nsignal we send to America.\n  I want us to get this bill through this Congress. It has cleared the \nHouse. The House has done its job. It is now in the Finance Committee \nin the Senate. We will soon have it here on the floor. Let's take it \nup, let's pass it, let's give it to the President, and do it before \nApril 15 so the President can have that, so we can give some notion of \nrelief to working couples across this country.\n\n  Senator Ashcroft and I and Senator Hutchison of Texas have been \nworking on this issue for some time. This past week, while we were not \nin session, Senator Ashcroft and I held a press conference in Kansas \nCity. We had four couples from Kansas who are currently paying the \nmarriage penalty tax. They think it is ridiculous. They think it is a \nbad signal we send. One gentleman there, one husband, stated he and his \nwife did not get married for 2 years because of the marriage penalty \ntax. They were in college at the time. They knew they wanted to get \nmarried, but they thought, they could not afford to do this because \nthey would have to pay roughly, in their case, about $600 more a year \nin taxes if they got married. They were in college and they said: We \ncan't afford it; $600 is important; we cannot afford to do this. So \nthey didn't. But they were not happy they were forced by their Tax Code \nnot to get married.\n  You would think, actually, we would be giving them $600 to get \nmarried. This is a positive institution. It is something that is \nimportant for the country. It is a clear signal of support for family \nvalues, which we all say we are for. We ought to at least send that \npositive signal, but we don't. Those are four families, each of them \nwho could use the average of $1,400 a year that most couples pay in a \nmarriage penalty.\n  Those are only four, though, in Kansas. I want to show with this \nchart, we\n\n[[Page S1482]]\n\nactually have 259,000 couples who are paying this marriage penalty tax. \nWhat we are talking about eliminating is this portion of it, the \nmarriage penalty that actually exists about 66 different places in the \nTax Code. So we are going to have a lot of other places we need to \nferret this out.\n  At the end of the day, I hope we sunset this Tax Code, reform the \nwhole thing, go to a flatter, simpler, fairer system. But that is for \nanother time.\n  I want to point out, for Members or others who are watching, how \npervasive this marriage penalty tax is in their States. You can go down \nany of the States here: In Wyoming, where the Presiding Officer is \nfrom, 45,336 couples pay a marriage penalty, a tax on being married. \nThat is in Wyoming. You can go anyplace. In Connecticut, 347,306 \ncouples pay that; in Washington DC, 27,117. Go to the big population \nStates, there are more there: New York, 1.5 million; California, 2.752 \nmillion couples paying a marriage penalty tax. It is all across the \nboard, all across the country, that couples, for the privilege of being \nmarried, pay this tax.\n  People know about it. Now we are seeing public opinion polls that \nshow people know they are paying a tax for the privilege of being \nmarried. As my colleagues can see, this is not an issue that just \naffects a few people in a few States; it affects America's working \nfamilies. It simply must be corrected this year.\n  I say to my colleagues, do not hook any riders to this bill that will \nkill it and then say you are for eliminating the marriage penalty tax. \nIf you hook riders to this bill that will kill it, you are against \neliminating the marriage penalty tax.\n  Further, I point out to people, the marriage penalty tax affects \nAmerica's children. I have many letters from people which demonstrate \nthat. In fact, Gary and Charla Gipson commented in a letter they wrote \non this subject:\n\n       If we are really interested in ``putting children first,'' \n     then why would this country penalize the very situation \n     (marriage) where kids do best? When parents are truly \n     committed to each other, through their marriage vows, their \n     children's outcomes are enhanced.\n\n  I do not want to take the full length of time to talk about this bill \ntoday because we have talked about it enough in the past. But I do want \nto make sure people understand that this does affect two-wage earner \ncouples making between $20,000 and $75,000 a year.\n  Clearly, we need to make the elimination of the marriage penalty tax \na priority to help all of these families, not just a few. The House \nbill does much of this. I think we can put forward an even better bill \nin the Senate that takes away more of the marriage penalty tax than \neven the House version does.\n\n  America's families deserve this break. I would like to be able to \ntell my families back in Kansas that, yes, this Congress does stand for \nfamily values. One of the things we are doing to help support these \nfamilies is eliminating the marriage penalty tax. It is a good and \npositive and right signal that we can send at a time we are having so \nmuch trouble with families.\n  I just came from a Commerce Committee hearing where we were talking \nabout and had testimony regarding the impact of interactive violent \nvideo games on children. There the concern was the increased level of \noverall violence in this society, and even the interactive nature of it \nin video games and its negative impact on children.\n  Constantly, people in that hearing were saying: I hope parents know \nwhat video games their children are playing. We hope the parents are \nworking with their children and communicating on this issue. In each \ncase, they were talking about the role and the need and the importance \nof parents and their active participation.\n  What better signal can we send than to say we believe that is true \nand we are not going to penalize you for being married parents. We are \nnot going to penalize you for being in that situation. We are going to \nremove this marriage penalty tax and let you keep an average of $1,400 \nper year. We have a chance to pass this legislation. We have the time \nto do it. This is the appointed hour for us.\n  I also want to send a signal to the President that I think we are \ngoing to get this bill through this Senate. We have gotten it through \nthe House. I am calling on the President to sign this bill, sign the \nmarriage penalty tax elimination bill, and not to obfuscate the issue \nor say that it is about something else or it is too expensive. If it is \ntoo expensive for Government, imagine how expensive it is for these 21 \nmillion American couples who are out there paying this extra tax.\n  Is it really too expensive for us to invest a little bit of money in \nthese working families to encourage them, to support them, to say they \nhave the most important task in America; that is, raising our next \ngeneration? We should be saying to them: You deserve a break today. You \ndeserve to be able to have this support coming to you from this \nGovernment instead of being taxed. You should be supported.\n  If anything, we should subsidize the family situation rather than tax \nit.\n  Mr. President, please sign this bill when it gets to you so we can do \naway with this onerous burden.\n  There may be other colleagues who will come to the floor later to \ntalk about this issue but at this time that is the extent of my \ncomments on this particular topic.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/21/senate-section/article/S1482-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1482-S1483]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE FOR SENIOR CITIZENS\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, for the last 3 months I have come to the \nfloor of the Senate on more than 20 occasions to talk about the need \nfor this Congress to pass legislation that would cover senior citizens' \nprescription drug needs under Medicare. I have said again and again \nthat this country can no longer afford not to cover prescription drugs.\n  Before we broke for the work period at home, I talked about a case, \nfor example, from Hillsboro, OR, of a senior citizen who had to be \nplaced in a hospital for more than 6 weeks because he could not afford \nhis medicine on an outpatient basis. Just think about that wasted \nmoney. The older person could not get help on an outpatient basis for \nhis medicine, and the doctor said we have no choice but to put that \nperson with a leg infection in the hospital so he can get prescription \ndrug coverage under Part A of the Medicare program.\n  Today, I brought with me a letter from an elderly woman in Phoenix, \nOR. She receives $1,100 per month in Social Security. Her prescription \ndrug bills run $1,000 a month. She is 74 years old, and she wrote me: \nWhat can you do to help?\n  I think it would be a tragedy for this Congress to not go forward on \na bipartisan basis and enact meaningful relief for the Nation's older \npeople who are getting clobbered with these prescription drug bills. \nAgain and again, we are hearing from seniors in these instances where \nthey have been hospitalized because they could not afford their \nmedicine on an outpatient basis, where when they are done paying for \ntheir prescription drugs for the month, they have only a couple hundred \ndollars left to pay for food, heat, and housing. In a country as strong \nand prosperous as ours, we can't allow this kind of tragedy to \ncontinue. I think it is absolutely critical that this be addressed on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  For many months now, I have teamed up with the Senator from Maine, \nMs. Snowe, on a bipartisan bill. We use marketplace forces to ensure \nthat older people have bargaining power in the private sector to be in \na better position to afford their medicine. Right now, these HMOs get \nbig discounts; they have lots of clout in the marketplace--HMOs and the \nprivate sector plans. If you are an older person who walks into a local \npharmacy, you in effect have to subsidize those big buyers. You get \nshellacked twice. Medicare doesn't cover prescription medicine and, in \neffect, in the marketplace you subsidize the people with clout.\n  The Snowe-Wyden legislation uses private sector bargaining power, \nalong the lines of what we have in the Congress with the Federal \nEmployees\n\n[[Page S1483]]\n\nHealth Benefits system, so that the dollars seniors use for private \nhealth insurance are pooled, and they have real negotiating power so \nthey are in a position to get more reasonable prices for their \nmedicine.\n  Some have said we ought to just put the Government in charge of this, \nsort of have rate regulation. Well, I think that would be a big \nmistake. The biggest concern I have about that approach is it would \ncause a lot of cost shifting. You could have the Government be the big \nkid on the block and drive the system through the Health Care Financing \nAdministration, but you would put all the costs onto somebody who is 27 \nor 28 and is working hard trying to get ahead, and their prescription \ndrug bill would have gone up because the Congress didn't address this \nMedicare issue in the right way.\n\n  Fortunately--and I think he deserves enormous credit--Senator Daschle \nhas been working to try to reconcile the various approaches. He has \ntalked with me about this issue, almost on a daily basis, in an effort \nto try to have the Senate come together and enact meaningful relief. He \nstakes out principles that I think can be supported on both sides of \nthe aisle--principles such as making sure the program is voluntary, \nthat no senior citizen be required to do anything; if they wanted to \nkeep their current coverage, they would be allowed to do that. We want \nto make sure the action we take on prescription drugs is consistent \nwith long-term Medicare reform. I think the approach I have advocated, \nin terms of creating more choices and more options in the marketplace, \nis consistent with responsible Medicare reform.\n  We have talked about bargaining power in the private sector, the way \nthe responsible private insurance companies have acted. I think that is \nsomething that will attract Members on both sides of the aisle. I think \nSenator Daschle is absolutely right in terms of trying to bring the \nSenate together to find the common ground and pass meaningful \nlegislation.\n  We will have a chance this week to make the first significant step in \nthe Senate toward passing this legislation. As the Budget Committee \nmeets--and I sit on the Budget Committee, and Senator Snowe sits on the \nBudget Committee--we will have a chance to ensure that in this budget, \nwhich is not just facts and figures but, really, the hopes and \naspirations of the American people--we, in effect, set aside the funds \nneeded to go forward and enact a meaningful prescription drug program \nfor the Nation's older people.\n  I don't want to see this Congress adjourn without making this \nimportant addition to the Medicare program. There is not a single \nexpert in the health field--Democrat or Republican--who doesn't believe \nthat if you designed the Medicare program from scratch today, you would \nnot cover prescription drugs. They all think it is something that is \nessential to meaningful Medicare reform. I intend to keep coming back \nto this floor again and again and again throughout this session of the \nCongress to talk about prescription medicine.\n  For about 7 years, before I had the honor of being elected to the \nother body, I was director of the Gray Panthers at home. We believed \nthat prescription drug coverage in Medicare was important then. But, \nfrankly, it is vastly more important now because the drugs of this \ncentury essentially aren't just drugs that, as we saw back then, are \nprimarily to help people when they are sick; the new drugs are \nabsolutely key to helping folks to stay well. They help folks to lower \nblood pressure and cholesterol. It is a way to hold down Medicare \ncosts. Because of the result of folks being able to stay healthy, they \ndon't land in the hospital and incur enormous costs that are engendered \nby Part A of the Medicare program.\n  I am going to keep coming to the floor of this body to talk about the \nneed for bipartisan action on prescription drugs, to urge the Senate to \nfollow the counsel of Senator Daschle. I know Senator Snowe and others \non the other side of the aisle are interested in finding common ground. \nI am going to keep urging that we work on this issue and not adjourn \nthis session of Congress until we have provided this relief to the \nNation's older people. I come again with a whole sheaf of cases of \nolder people who are writing and asking what we can do to help. They \nare asking Congress to act this year, not put this off until after the \nelection and use it as a political football again.\n  I think we owe it to the Nation's older people and their families to \naddress this issue, as Senator Daschle suggests, in this Congress; that \nwe come together as Members of the Senate to make this improvement to \nthe Medicare program that is long overdue. I intend to keep coming back \nto the floor of this body again and again and again reading these \ndirect and very poignant accounts about why this coverage is so \nimportant until we get this legislation enacted.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/21/senate-section/article/S1483-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1483]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 5, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the title as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5) to amend title II of the Social Security \n     Act to eliminate the earnings test for individuals who have \n     attained retirement age.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, before proceeding to the opening statements, \nI yield to Senator Gregg who will speak briefly on his proposed \namendment. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator \nfrom Delaware allowing me to proceed out of order. I very much \nappreciate that generosity on his part. I also appreciate his courtesy \nas we develop this piece of legislation and congratulate the Senator \nfor bringing it to the floor.\n  Repealing the earnings limitation is a very important step to assist \npeople who have reached eligibility age for retirement to have a better \nlifestyle. It allows them to work harder, work longer, work at their \noption versus at the Government's option, and keep the proceeds of what \nthey earn versus losing it because of this artificial reduction in \ntheir benefits, which is presently the law under the earnings \nlimitation test.\n  It is a very appropriate piece of legislation. It is one which I \nfully congratulate the chairman of the Finance Committee for authoring \nand bringing forward, and it is something which I have strongly \nsupported for many years. In fact, yesterday I spoke at some length \nrelative to a bill that has been introduced by myself and a number of \nother Members of the Senate, including members of the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Kerrey, Senator Breaux, Senator Grassley, Senator \nThompson, and Senator Robb, along with Senator Thomas. That piece of \nlegislation is a comprehensive attempt to reform Social Security, to \nmake it solvent for the next 100 years. As part of that comprehensive \nreform, we included the earnings limitation repeal, which is very \nappropriate legislation.\n  However, I do think if it were being done in a perfect world it would \nbe done in a comprehensive reform of the entire Social Security system \nbecause we well know Social Security is facing disastrous consequences \nbeginning in the year 2008 when the baby boom generation retires, \nfollowed closely by the year 2014 when the system actually starts to \nrun a cash deficit and is aggravated to the point of crisis by the \nperiod 2020 to 2040 when we actually run up an absolutely massive \ndeficit which will have to be passed on to the younger generation \nthrough tax increases or through a cut to the benefits of the older \ngeneration, but it would be a deficit in the vicinity of $7 trillion \nunder the present benefit structure.\n  We need to address that. We need to address the whole issue of Social \nSecurity reform, in my opinion. That is why\n\n[[Page S1484]]\n\nI have worked with Members of the Senate to draft this comprehensive \nbill.\n  As I said, one element of the comprehensive bill is the repeal of the \nearnings limitation. That is a very appropriate step and one which \nshould have been taken many years ago, that will be very beneficial for \nour Nation as our population and the demographics of our population \nages so people, as they become older but are still living longer, will \nhave the opportunity to participate in the workforce, be productive \ncitizens without being penalized by the Government and having some of \ntheir benefits taken away under Social Security.\n  As part of the earnings limitation repeal, I wanted to introduce an \namendment to address some of the issues of transparency, of disclosure, \nof telling people in America in plain English what the Social Security \nsystem's present economic status is and what it is going to be in the \nfuture. The proposal I was going to offer was basically a mirror of the \nproposal which came out of the professional group which oversees \nreviewing the Social Security Administration, the Technical Panel on \nAssumptions and Methods of the Social Security Advisory Board, a board \nput together as an arm of the Social Security Administration to come up \nwith ideas for how to improve the Social Security Administration.\n  They came up in November of 1999 with a whole series of proposals as \nto information that should be made available to the American public. It \nwas not complicated information, and in fact they stressed it should be \nput forward in plain English terms so Americans everywhere could \nunderstand the status of the Social Security system.\n  But it was important information, such as:\n  What will the program cost each year? We should know that as an \nAmerican people.\n  What is the projected cash-flow deficit in the program? That is \nanother very important fact we should know in deciding how we are going \nto deal with Social Security.\n  What are the benefits the system can actually fund? I cannot think of \nany information that would be more important than that.\n  What is the impact of all of this on the overall Federal budget? That \nis another very important point of information.\n  All this information should be made available to the American public. \nThat is why the Technical Panel on Assumptions and Methods of the \nSocial Security Advisory Board recommended this type of disclosure \noccur. So my amendment was going to make as part of the law a \ncommitment we would make those disclosures to the American people \nthrough the auspices of the Social Security Administration. It is basic \ninformation, critical information for people making informed decisions.\n  Regretfully, I tell the American people that we have a very big \nproblem coming. Maybe there was some resistance because if that type of \ninformation were available, people would start scratching their heads, \nsaying, ``Gee, we do have a big problem; maybe we should address it.'' \nThat is the goal I have, obviously--to use this information to energize \naction and move this Congress, and especially the White House, down the \nroad of substantively addressing the whole Social Security issue rather \nthan this narrow question of the earnings limitation question.\n  However, having stated the outline of the amendment and having gone \ninto much more depth yesterday, I have been working with the chairman, \nand he has agreed, to try to work this type of language into some other \nprocess where it will not complicate his life on this bill but where it \nwill still be language which will at some point become law and which \nwill effectively address the issues raised by the Social Security \nAdvisory Board so we can get full disclosure to the American people.\n  I very much appreciate the chairman's commitment to work with me on \nthis. As a result, I have decided not to offer this amendment.\n  I believe the chairman has requested I yield to him the time which \nwould have been available under my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I wonder if I could detain the \ndistinguished Senator from New Hampshire for just a moment to say how \nvery much I agree, and I am sure this side agrees, with the points he \nhas made, as the chairman has indicated.\n  In August of 1994, legislation reestablished the Social Security \nAdministration as an independent agency. It had all but got lost in the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services. In the Congressional Directory \nthere were more than 200 names between the name of the Secretary and \nthe name of the Social Security Commissioner. It was very much an \nagency far down and with no real independence. It is now an independent \nagency. It has a trustees' report that comes out every year--the \ntrustees being the Secretaries of the Treasury, of Labor, of Health and \nHuman Services, the Commissioner of Social Security and two public \ntrustees. It has the Social Security Advisory Board.\n  Now, after many years, we are sending out each year to every citizen \nover 25 a statement of how much they have paid into the system and what \nthey could expect to receive as a benefit at the age of retirement and \nsuch like--information nobody ever had before. You could get it, but \nyou had to know where to look for it. The kind of openness Senator \nGregg speaks of continues this disposition. I hope we will reinforce \nit. I certainly think we could have language in our report commenting \nin this regard. I congratulate the Senator for what he has said.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator from New York will yield, I appreciate \nthose comments. I know the efforts which have been made by the Senator \nfrom New York, trying to make the Social Security system solvent. I \ngreatly admire them.\n  I would say, this information would be in addition to the information \nthat is already available. The Senator from New York makes the point, \npeople are now told how much they should receive in benefits. What they \nare not told and what this information would tell them is, where are we \ngoing to get the money and what are the shortfalls in the Federal \nGovernment that will be created by paying those benefits, and isn't \nthat what you should be worried about as a recipient: Where is the \nmoney going to come from?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. A fair point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I thank Senator Gregg for his statement. I \nexpress my appreciation to Senator Moynihan for his statement as well. \nI look forward to working with the Senator from New Hampshire as well \nas the ranking member on how to provide the information needed to allow \na clear and concise understanding of Social Security. We look forward \nto proceeding ahead with this proposal.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the remaining time allotted \nfor debate on the Gregg amendment be equally divided, under the control \nof the two managers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, today is a great day for millions of \nseniors, for their families, and for their employers. The Senate will \nvote shortly to repeal a provision in the Social Security law that \ndiscourages seniors from working, the so-called earnings limit. \nRepealing this earnings limit is an important step in preparing Social \nSecurity for the 21st century.\n  Social Security is a marvelous program. Now and in the future, both \nfor today's seniors and for our children, Social Security is the \nfoundation of a secure retirement for most Americans. Social Security \nhas lifted millions from poverty and is especially important to women. \nBut the Social Security earnings limit discourages seniors from \nworking. Seniors can have their benefits reduced by as much as one-\nthird as long as they work. As a result, many seniors choose to cut \nback their hours or stop working altogether.\n  The fact is, the earnings limit is a part of a bygone era. It is the \nproduct of the Great Depression, a time when folks believed that an \nindividual should retire completely and make room for others to work. \nIt is antiquated and antiproductive.\n  Although Congress has made the earnings limit less onerous over the \nyears, it has worked only too well. In the early 1950s, almost 50 \npercent of men over age 65 were working. Today,\n\n[[Page S1485]]\n\nit is only 17 percent. These numbers are even lower for women. But in \nthe new economy we realize the importance of men and women remaining \nproductive participants in our workforce. In the new economy, we \nappreciate skill and experience.\n  Abolishing the earnings limit is not only good for seniors, it is \ngood for America. It is good employment and economic policy. It is also \ngood government. It will improve public service by the Social Security \nAdministration.\n  Repealing the earnings limit will help strengthen the retirement \nsecurity of Americans by giving seniors a choice of working longer and \nsaving more.\n  As Americans live longer, work will likely be more and more important \nto the financial security of seniors, again, especially for women. \nAlso, seniors who work may be better able to voluntarily delay their \nSocial Security benefits. As a result, they will receive a larger check \nwhen they do elect benefits, in effect, by banking those benefits.\n  Repealing the earnings limit is good employment and economic policy. \nWe live in a world of great new potential and exciting changes. The \nInternet--the communications revolution--is creating huge new \nopportunities. Breakthroughs in biotechnology promise longer and \nhealthier lives.\n  Among all this change, however, there is one constant: Our success as \na nation depends on the hard work and talent of our people. Today, we \nunderstand economic growth is a function of the number of workers and \nthe productivity of each worker. As a nation, we benefit from more \nworkers, not fewer.\n  According to Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, we are \nbeginning to suffer from a serious worker shortage that threatens our \neconomic expansion. In just 5 years--in 2005--when baby boomers reach \nretirement age, we will need more older Americans working just to \nmaintain the Nation's labor force.\n  We do not need disincentives that discourage some of our Nation's \nmost experienced workers from working. Abolishing the earnings limit \nwill allow us to protect the Nation's economic gains of the past 17 \nyears. It will not only help to raise the standard of living for many \nof our seniors but help keep the strongest economic growth in our \nlifetime on track. This is a win-win situation.\n  Repealing the earnings limit has one other very important value: \nImproving public service by the Social Security Administration. \nAdministering the earnings limit is complex; it is difficult. It costs \nsomething close to $100 million per year and is the culprit in the vast \nmajority of Social Security benefit payment errors. These payment \nerrors are a huge source of frustration to seniors. With this \nlegislation, we will now be avoiding that.\n  Let me also note that there are no long-term costs associated with \nthis bill. No senior receives any greater amounts of benefits. Rather, \nwe simply provide seniors with greater choice over when they receive \nthese benefits.\n  I am very proud of what the Senate Finance Committee and the Senate \nitself has been able to accomplish over the past 5 years. We have \nbalanced the budget and have begun to pay down the public debt. We have \nstrengthened Medicare and expanded health care, especially for children \nand people with disabilities. We have provided new educational \nopportunities. We have fixed a broken welfare system. We have cut \ntaxes. We have reformed the IRS. We have protected the Social Security \ntrust fund.\n  With the passage today of the Social Security earnings limit repeal, \nwe will add one more significant accomplishment to this list. Without \nquestion, there is still much to do on Social Security reform. But this \nlegislation is a clear and vivid demonstration that we can work \ntogether in a bipartisan way to achieve lasting and valuable changes in \nSocial Security.\n  In closing, let me note that the President has asked for a clean \nbill, one without extraneous amendments. With the exception of the \nmanagers' amendment, which fixes a technical problem with the House \nbill, we intend to provide that.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support this bill, to sweep away the \nearnings limit--a relic of the Depression--and to move Social Security \ninto the 21st century.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, it is a special joy for this Senator, in \nhis last months of his last term, to rise on this subject in perfect \nunity with the chairman. I will make remarks out of habit and custom \nperhaps, but I could not say anything better than has been said. I \nendorse it completely.\n  The House has done us a service in sending us a bill which we have \nbeen working on for years. Just 4 years ago, we increased the earnings \nlimit to where it would be $30,000 by the year 2002. But now this gets \nrid of it. It is an anachronism. As the chairman said, when we enacted \nSocial Security, unemployment was 25 percent. Sir, it is now 4 percent. \nThe range of skills in our economy was wholly different then. Coal \nmines were no place for 70-year-olds; computer terminals are. It is as \nsimple as that.\n  An absolutely important, central point to make is, the repeal of the \nearnings test has no long-run cost. All of the foregone benefits of \ncontinued work were made up later when retirement came, or at age 70. \nAs the chairman has accurately said, calculating that makeup can be \nfantastically complex and has been costly.\n  It is the one complaint citizens have with Social Security. They \nbelieve they are not getting what is theirs. The adjudication and so \nforth is a needless waste and an expensive one. With this legislation, \nthe problem will be behind us.\n  Repealing the earnings test, for those reaching normal retirement, \nwill increase outlays by $19.4 billion over 6 years and $20.3 billion \nover 11 years, but this is simply the up-front costs of a long-term \nabsolute even outcome. Extra benefits will not be paid because over \ntime it will be, as you can say, a wash. The advantages are so much \ngreater to pass this now when we have some comfort in our budgetary \nsurplus in the Social Security trust fund. It is the right thing to do.\n  I say, and I think so would my revered chairman, that we would prefer \nto abolish all earnings tests for all retired workers. Right now, \npeople can retire at age 62 and receive benefits, and there is a \ncorresponding diminishment thereafter. We could get rid of all that \nvery readily. But it is not before us today. Sufficient unto this day \nis the work we will have done.\n  I will leave it there, sir. I have some comments, but I will not go \nmuch further.\n  There are those who say: If you let people retire early at a lower \nlevel of benefit, they will do so. Then, later on their spouses will be \ndeprived, and so forth. That is an argument I am not sure is \nappropriate to social insurance.\n  It is a fact that three-quarters of all persons now retire before age \n65, which argues, I think--and I don't know why we can't learn more \nabout this; we can if we would try--that Americans are pretty well off. \nThey are in a position to do so, and they opt for it. We must keep in \nmind we are talking about social insurance. It is not for us to judge \nthe behavior of the citizens who have paid into a system and are being \npaid back by it.\n  I think the finest summation of this was made by Winston Churchill in \n1911. He was then a member of Parliament from the Liberal Party, and it \nfell to him to manage, as we are managing here, a system of \nunemployment insurance which we would get to in 1935 as a title in the \nSocial Security Act. It took us another generation.\n  Churchill at that time was met with the argument that if you gave \nunemployed workers a benefit, an insurance benefit--they would pay into \nthe system, the employer and the workers--that they would spend the \nmoney on drink. He said: ``Well, yes, perhaps; it's their money.'' He \nwas not one much given to the ``nanny state,'' as I think the term was \nin these years.\n  It is not for us to judge how wisely people will exercise their \noptions. They are their options. Today we have freed up the system, \nmaking it more comprehensible and saving a lot of administrative effort \nthat is really, again, not productive.\n  I look forward to a good debate. I see my friend from Nebraska on the \nfloor. He has been hugely influential in the discussion and debate \nabout these matters in years past. I know he will be now. I look \nforward to listening with close attention to his comments.\n  With that, I thank the chairman once again and yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S1486]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, did the chairman rise to speak again?\n  Mr. ROTH. We did have Senator Kyl coming down to speak next, going \nback and forth.\n  Mr. KERREY. Is he arriving here imminently?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I intend to vote for this piece of \nlegislation. I think it is good and needed legislation. But I don't \nthink anybody should be deluded as to why we are taking it up.\n  I remember the Boskin Commission. A number of years ago there was a \nquestion as to whether or not the CPI was overstating the actual cost \nof living for seniors who were eligible either for an old age, a \nsurvivor, or a disability payment. There was a question as to whether \nor not it was overstated. So we impaneled this commission to evaluate \nwhether or not it was overstated. They came back and said, yes, it was \noverstated by a point, 1.1.\n  Out of 535 Members of Congress, maybe 20 people declared they were \nwilling to vote for a 1.1-percentage reduction. If Boskin had come back \nand said it was understated by a point, there would have been 535 votes \nfor it just like that. Nobody would have minded messing with the Bureau \nof Labor Statistics. Nobody would have cited philosophy, et cetera.\n  We are a Congress that has been talking about Social Security reform, \nsaving Social Security first. The President had a year's worth of \ndiscussions. We have been talking about this for several years now. It \nis not rocket science. Social Security is not a difficult problem to \nfigure out. It is not like health care. Medicare is very complicated. \nTeenage violence is very complicated, as is the disintegration of the \nfamily. There are a lot of issues which are so complicated that it is \nhard to come up with an answer. But this one is not.\n  What happened is, from 1983 until approximately 12 months or so ago, \nthe Social Security system was generating some assistance to us in \nreducing the size of our deficit. So when the Social Security \ntransaction to purchase bonds occurred and the Treasury ended up with \nsome cash, they used the proceeds to pay for general services of the \nGovernment. Very few people objected to that, so long as it was helping \nus.\n  Well, now we are into a surplus. All of a sudden you can't do that \nanymore. All of a sudden we find ourselves in a position to be able to \ntake care of the earnings test.\n  I will make it clear. I am for ending the earnings test. The Senator \nfrom New York and I have a piece of legislation that will eliminate the \nearnings test all the way to 62. Our proposal brought a problem to the \nsurface. This bill has not been heard by the Finance Committee. We have \nnot considered some of the problems that may be created as a \nconsequence of taking this action.\n  Members should understand that the earnings test isn't just a deduct. \nIt is also an add-on to future benefits. That is why it doesn't cost us \nanything over 20. Over 10, it costs us $22 billion. Over 10 years, this \nproposal costs us $22 billion. If I came down and proposed a $22 \nbillion add-on for Americans under the age of 5, there would be a \nbudget point of order offered against it. But because it is for \nAmericans over the age of 65, for some reason, there is silence on that \npoint.\n  I can't quite figure it out. Maybe a colleague will be able to tell \nme why no budget point of order was filed against a proposal to spend \n$22 billion more on people over the age of 65, where there would be if \none were to be filed on people under the age of 5. I am sure there is \nan explanation for it. I am not smart enough to be able to figure it \nout.\n  A consequence of this is going to be largely good. Under Social \nSecurity, we have an old age, a survivor, a disability, and a medical \nbenefit called Medicare and Medicaid. The old age benefit is the one to \nwhich we are referring. I believe Americans who are over the age of \n65--that is who this affects. Eighty percent of all new beneficiaries \ntake Social Security benefits at 62, 63, and 64. So this affects the 20 \npercent who wait until 65. They are going to have to measure whether or \nnot this is going to be good for them. For most of them, it will be \ngood. For most of them, they will be able to say: Well, I am not likely \nto be living long enough to benefit from the ``add-back'' that is going \nto occur later. So perhaps I am going to come out money ahead.\n\n  Again, understand that the earnings test doesn't only have a \nsubtract. It adds back in future years.\n  One of the interesting things is, when we have proposed to eliminate \nthe earnings test at 62, 63, and 64, some people have come forward and \nsaid that that could increase the number of women who are living in \npoverty because they are going to calculate that that add-back later on \nis more beneficial to them than the elimination of the earnings test at \n62, 63 and 64. I don't know if that is going to happen for people age \n65, 66, and 67. It may. There may be some for whom the earnings test is \nnot a benefit. The committee hasn't heard it.\n  It is politically popular. It passed the House, I believe, \nunanimously. It will pass the Senate 100-0 as well. There will be nary \na dissenting vote when it goes through the Senate. But it has not been \nheard by committee. It was heard by the Ways and Means Committee. It \nwas not heard by the Finance Committee. It has a lot of political steam \nbehind it.\n  This is a good thing to put on an add. This is a good thing to say \nyou support. It is very difficult to be against this proposal.\n  I point out, again, we have not done comprehensive reform of Social \nSecurity. People under the age of 40 are going to pay a terrible price \nfor that. We have an unprecedented demographic problem. It is not \ncomparable to the problem the Senator from New York faced in 1983 when \nSocial Security was fixed once before. The last time, we fixed Social \nSecurity for a number of reasons. The political environment has \nchanged. I can't imagine enacting what was enacted in 1983, given the \ncurrent political climate, which is essentially: I want to fix the \nproblem, but I am against any increase in taxes or any cuts in \nbenefits. If you can give me a good solution for Social Security that \ndoesn't increase taxes or doesn't cut benefits, I am for it. Otherwise, \ndon't sign me up for anything.\n\n  Well, we would not have enacted the 1983 reforms if that was the \nstandard we used to guide us. The problem we face in the future is not \nthe same as the problem we faced in 1983. It is a demographic problem \nthat is unprecedented in this country--a doubling of the number of \nbeneficiaries. We are going to have a very steady increase in the \nnumber of people in the workforce of 7 or 8 million people working over \nthe next 30 years, 40 million new beneficiaries. It is not likely that \nthe baby boomers will come to Congress and ask for less. They are \nprobably going to ask for more and say Boskin was wrong, that the CPI \nshould be increased by two or three points because they have lots of \nthings they want to buy.\n  Postponing this problem makes it difficult for us to stand before an \naudience of people under 40 and say we care about them, because they \nare going to face a tremendous problem. I heard the Senator from New \nYork mention this change in the law that we had 2 years ago, where the \nSocial Security Administration sent out a notice that wasn't accurate. \nThey should have sent out one to everybody under 40 which said under \ncurrent law you have a 33-percent cut in benefits heading your way. \nThey did not disclose that. They presumed in that notice that Congress \nwas going to increase the taxes by 50 percent. Well, I daresay if you \ncame to the floor of the Senate now and offered an amendment to \nincrease the payroll tax by a point, you would be lucky to get a half \ndozen votes.\n  I think this is a good piece of legislation. It is long overdue. The \ndistinguished chairman described it accurately. I think, for the most \npart, it is going to be beneficial to people over the age of 65. Though \nI think there will unquestionably be some, as there would be 62, 63, \nand 64, who, as a consequence of not getting that add-back later on, \nmay find themselves actually not being helped as much as we think.\n\n[[Page S1487]]\n\n I will support the underlying legislation and look forward at a later \npoint in this debate to offering an amendment.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me express my appreciation to Senators \nRoth and Moynihan, and especially to Senators Bob Kerrey and Judd Gregg \nfor their efforts. This is clearly an idea where the time has come. My \ncolleagues are correct to emphasize that saving Social Security for the \nfuture will require us to put aside the prospect of partisan gain for \nthe good of the country and of our senior citizens. I respect the point \nthey have made.\n  I hope the step we are taking today, which could not be taken without \na bipartisan consensus, bodes well for future reform of Social \nSecurity. I am quite pleased to see that the Senate is on the verge of \ntaking this momentous action of eliminating the earnings test for those \nbetween the ages of 65 and 69. It is a step that is long overdue.\n  Many of us have been calling for the repeal of this test for many \nyears. In fact, the occupant of the Chair and I were part of the 100th \nclass of Republicans in the House of Representatives who made repealing \nthis earnings test one of our projects. We have been at this for a long \ntime. When I came to the Senate, I joined Senator John McCain, who has \nbeen a champion for this cause, in introducing the Senior Citizens' \nFreedom to Work Act in the opening days of the 106th Congress. When we \ndid that, I wondered whether it would fare any better than when we had \noffered it in the past. Now, at long last, we have forged a bipartisan \nconsensus for taking action which even includes the President, and \nrelief is finally in sight for working seniors.\n\n  I have always believed it just wasn't right to impose steep taxes on \npeople who tried to work after reaching retirement age. It isn't right \nthat under current law seniors between the ages of 65 and 69 lose a \ndollar for every $3 they earn above the threshold of $17,000. In fact, \nlast year, 800,000 seniors lost a portion of their benefit because of \nthis unfair tax. It isn't right that, combined with regular income \ntaxes, and the taxation of Social Security benefits, the earnings test \nsubjects some working seniors to an effective marginal tax rate of more \nthan 100 percent. That is not right.\n  We all know this earnings test was created during the Depression era \nwhen policymakers felt an urgent need to give opportunities to young \nworkers by encouraging seniors to leave the workforce. Today, America \nfaces an extraordinarily tight labor market and seniors are living \nlonger, more productive lives.\n  In that context, a policy that penalizes our most experienced \ncitizens for their hard work is not just unfair, it is \ncounterproductive. America needs the skills and knowledge senior \ncitizens have acquired, especially in today's competitive global \nmarketplace.\n  I believe repealing the earnings test also affirms our commitment to \nthe values of self-help and personal responsibility.\n  After working to accomplish this repeal throughout my entire time in \nthe Congress, I am very pleased to note that we are so close to \ncompleting the job today. Again, my compliments to all those people who \nhave worked so hard to make this a reality.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Arizona, Mr. McCain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Roth for his leadership \nand stewardship of this important legislation.\n  Obviously, I urge my colleagues to support swift passage of this much \nneeded legislation to eliminate the unfair and discriminatory Social \nSecurity earnings test.\n  For over a decade, I and a few staunch supporters have been fighting \nto eliminate the earnings test that penalizes senior citizens who want \nor need to work. We began our battle in 1989 and have offered \nlegislation in each of the last six Congresses to repeal the earnings \ntest. In the beginning, we had only a few allies, notable amongst which \nwas the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, \nwhich has been at the forefront of this effort, as have my dear friends \nJohn Kyl and Mike DeWine.\n  I am pleased now that so many Members from both sides of the aisle, \nas well as President Clinton, understand that senior citizens have a \nright to work without being penalized for doing so. With this recent \ngroundswell of support, we can finally eliminate this penalty on our \nNation's hard-working senior citizens.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the National Committee to \nPreserve Social Security and Medicare in support of this legislation be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1)\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, most Americans are shocked and appalled \nwhen they discover that older Americans are penalized for working. \nAmericans should never be penalized or discouraged from working. Yet \nthat is exactly what the Social Security earnings test does. The \nearnings test punishes Americans between the ages of 65 and 70 who want \nto remain productive after they reach retirement age and are eligible \nto receive Social Security benefits.\n  The Earnings Test mandates that, for every $3 earned by a retiree \nover the earnings limit, the retiree loses $1 in Social Security \nbenefits. This is clearly age discrimination, and it is very wrong. Due \nto this cap on earnings, our senior citizens, many of whom exist on \nfixed, low incomes, are burdened with a 33.3 percent tax on their \nearned income. When this is combined with Federal, State, local and \nother Social Security taxes, it amounts to an outrageous 55 to 65 \npercent tax bite.\n  In 1996, Congress passed and President Clinton signed into law the \nSenior Citizens Right to Work Act. This legislation took a step in the \nright direction by gradually increasing the $11,250 earnings limit to \n$30,000 by the year 2002. This year, the earnings limit is $17,000. But \nan individual who is struggling to make ends meet with just their \nSocial Security benefits plus $17,000 a year in earned income should \nnot be faced with an effective marginal tax rate that exceeds 55 \npercent.\n  The Social Security Earnings Test is a relic of the Great Depression, \ndesigned to move older people out of the workforce and create jobs for \nyounger workers. Today's booming economy, with the lowest unemployment \nrate in three decades, can support full employment for both young and \nold. In addition, experts are predicting a labor shortage as the ``baby \nboom'' generation ages, with our elderly population growing much faster \nthan the number of younger workers entering the workforce. According to \nthe U.S. Chamber of Commerce, ``retaining older workers is a priority \nin labor intensive industries, and will become even more critical by \nthe year 2000.'' The Social Security Earnings Test is counter-\nproductive because it discourages these willing, diligent older \nAmericans from staying in the workforce.\n  Our senior citizens can continue to make valuable contributions to \nour economy. Often, their knowledge and experience compliments or \nexceeds that of younger employees. Tens of millions of Americans are \nover the age of 65, and together they have over a billion years of \ncumulative work experience.\n  More importantly, many of the older Americans penalized by the \nEarnings Test need to work in order to cover their basic expenses, \nincluding food, housing, and medicine. Many seniors do not have \nsignificant savings or a private pension. For this reason, low-income \nworkers are particularly hard-hit by the Earnings Test.\n  In fact, wealthy seniors, who have lucrative investments, stocks, and \nsubstantial savings, are not affected by the earnings limit. Their \nsupplemental ``unearned'' income is not subject to the earnings \nthreshold.\n  Finally, let me stress that repealing the burdensome and unfair \nEarnings\n\n[[Page S1488]]\n\nTest will not further jeopardize the solvency of the Social Security \nTrust Funds. Those who claim otherwise are engaging in cruel scare \ntactics. The Social Security benefits working seniors lose due to the \nEarnings Test penalty are benefits they earned by contributing to the \nsystem throughout their working years. In fact, studies indicate that \nrepealing the Earnings Test would actually result in a net increase of \n$140 million in federal revenues because more seniors would be earning \nwages and paying taxes, including payroll taxes that would go into the \nSocial Security Trust Fund.\n  Repealing the Earnings Test is very important to the financial \nsecurity of many of our nation's seniors. But let me take this \nopportunity to remind my colleagues of the very precarious financial \ncondition of the entire Social Security system and the urgent need for \na serious, bipartisan effort to reform and revitalize this cornerstone \nof many Americans' retirement planning.\n  My colleagues must recognize that repealing this onerous tax on our \nnation's senior citizens is an important step toward a fairer, flatter, \nsimpler tax code. The 44,000-page Code is a cornucopia of favors for \nspecial interests and a chamber of horrors for average Americans. It \npenalizes people for getting married and for wanting to pass along the \nfruits of their labors to their children. It is overly complex and \nburdensome.\n  We should act now to eliminate the loopholes and subsidies for \ncorporations and special interests. We should act now to eliminate the \nonerous marriage penalty, reduce estate and gift taxes, and encourage \nfamilies to save and invest for their future priorities, such as \ncollege and health care needs. We should begin the march toward a \nfairer, flatter tax system by expanding the 15 percent tax bracket to \nallow more Americans to pay taxes at the lowest rate. Combined with the \nrepeal of the Social Security Earnings Test, these and other changes to \nthe tax code would provide much-needed tax relief to those who need it \nmost--our nation's low- and middle-income senior citizens and families.\n  The only way to achieve real reform of the Social Security system is \nto work together in a bipartisan manner.\n  I am speaking specifically of the leadership of the Senator from New \nYork, Mr. Moynihan. I can think of no greater gift to the American \npeople than to act on this issue before Senator Moynihan leaves this \nbody. It's time to abandon the irresponsible game of playing partisan \npolitics with Social Security. Democrats will have to stop using the \nissue to scare seniors into voting against Republicans. Republicans \nwill have to resist using Social Security revenues to finance tax cuts. \nAnd both parties must stop raiding the Trust Funds to waste retirement \ndollars on more government spending. We must face up to our \nresponsibilities, not as Republicans or Democrats, but as elected \nrepresentatives of the American people with a common obligation to \nprotect their interests.\n  We have an obligation to ensure that Social Security benefits are \npaid as promised, without putting an unfair burden on today's workers. \nExperts agree that the only way to save Social Security without cutting \nbenefits or raising payroll taxes is to allow every American to invest \na portion of their Social Security savings in private, higher-yielding \naccounts. I believe a good start would be to let each person invest \nabout 20 percent of what they pay in payroll taxes in a personal \nretirement account. These personal accounts would be controlled by the \nindividual, and the individual would be able to monitor the growth of \ntheir investment. An added benefit is that each account would be a \n``personal lockbox'' that could no longer be used by Congress for pork-\nbarrel projects.\n  In the near term, there is a cost to moving funds out of the Trust \nFunds into these private accounts, and we must set aside the funds \nnecessary to pay promised benefits while the personal accounts of \nworkers are maturing. Simply locking up the Social Security surplus \nthat comes from payroll taxes--a considerable accomplishment in and of \nitself--is not enough to save Social Security. We will need between $5 \nand $7 trillion in additional funding over the next 50 years to keep \nthe current system running. I believe we must start now by reserving 62 \npercent of the non-Social Security budget surplus to shore up the Trust \nFunds while we begin to implement a plan for personal retirement \naccounts.\n  By passing this important legislation to repeal the Social Security \nEarnings Test, we have the opportunity to restore to our nation's \nseniors the right to work without penalty to ensure their financial \nsecurity. But this is just the first step. We must work together to \ndevelop fair and effective reforms that will preserve and protect the \nSocial Security system for current and future retirees, while allowing \nall Americans, particularly low- and middle-income individuals, the \nopportunity to share in the great prosperity that our nation enjoys \ntoday.\n  I thank the Senator from Delaware for his leadership. I especially \nthank the Senator from New York for his courageous leadership in \nsuggesting a viable and important way to save Social Security, along \nwith the Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Kerrey. I tell the Senator from New \nYork that I talked about it during this entire campaign. It resonates, \npeople want it, and we ought to enact it.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I yield another 15 minutes to the \nSenator from Arizona.\n  (Laughter.)\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like, if the Senator from New York \nwill allow me, 1 more minute.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Of course. Please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from New York that \nall over in this campaign I talked about the leadership of Senator \nMoynihan of New York, Senator Kerrey of Nebraska, and their proposals, \nwhich met with some derision in some quarters. But the fact is, when \nyou consult the experts, they will tell you this is really the only way \nwe can allow people to invest their retirement funds in a personal \nsavings account over which they then will have control. But we need to \nget money into the fund in order to allow them to do that.\n  I think the Senator from New York has made an enormous contribution. \nI hope we can join together in a bipartisan fashion and enact that \nproposal. It may not be a perfect proposal; there may be some changes \nthat need to be made on it; but the heart of it is the solution to the \nSocial Security crisis, which we all know is coming beginning in the \nyear 2014.\n  I thank my colleague from New York.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                    National Committee to Preserve\n\n\n                                 Social Security and Medicare,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 20, 2000.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Russell Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: On behalf of its millions of members \n     and supporters, The National Committee to Preserve Social \n     Security and Medicare thanks you for your leadership on \n     earnings limit repeal. We are truly grateful for your \n     committed efforts on behalf of senior Americans.\n       Senator McCain, I remember when we began the battle to \n     eliminate the unfair Social Security earnings limit more than \n     a decade ago. At that time, we had just a few allies in \n     Congress. You immediately recognized the inherent unfairness \n     of punishing seniors who, either out of necessity or choice, \n     continued to work after reaching the normal retirement age.\n       We are quite pleased to see so many members of Congress now \n     willing to fight for seniors' freedom to work. With this \n     newfound support, the egregious earnings test will likely be \n     eliminated for those who have attained normal retirement age.\n       The members of the National Committee to Preserve Social \n     Security and Medicare are delighted that passage of earnings \n     limit repeal now seems imminent. Thank you again, Senator \n     McCain, for your determined efforts and tenacious commitment. \n     Without your hard work over the years, I doubt that we would \n     be facing victory on this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Martha A. McSteen,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Delaware and \nthe Senator from New York for their leadership on this issue, finally \ngetting it to the floor in this form. I think it is very clear we are \ngoing to pass it and give the needed relief to our senior citizens.\n\n[[Page S1489]]\n\n  I could not go forward without mentioning my colleague, Senator \nMcCain. Senator McCain received a huge welcome back to the Senate. No \none has forgotten what has happened in the last 3 months. I think a \ngreat impact has been made on the politics of our country. I think the \ncontribution made by Senator McCain will resonate for a long time to \ncome. He has brought new people into the process. He has shown what \ncourage is. He has given people an idea of what courage and serving \none's country can do. I think he has added tremendously to the process. \nOur Republican caucus met at noon, and he got the longest standing \novation he probably ever will get. Certainly it was heartfelt. I think \neveryone is very glad we are going to have him back and working with \nMembers to put together many of the reforms about which we have been \nspeaking.\n  It happens that the bill we are discussing today was originally \nintroduced by Senator McCain. He was the first to introduce the bill to \nrepeal the earnings test on Social Security benefits.\n  In 1935, when Social Security was passed, we had a very different \nsenior citizen population and a very different need in our country. \nPeople didn't live as long. They were not as healthy. They were not as \nvigorous. They didn't want to work, by and large, after the age of 65. \nToday, if people want to work after the age of 65, they have \ncontributed to Social Security all their lives, and they decide they \nwant to take their benefits, what happens? They get docked. For every \ndollar over $17,000 a Social Security recipient receives, they lose $3 \nin their Social Security benefits.\n  Today is not 1935. Today people are vigorous. Many people want to \nwork. Many people want to supplement their incomes. We also have a need \nfor more workers in this country. We have very low unemployment. Our \nhigh-tech companies are asking people to come back to work. They need \nskilled workers. Our service industry is burgeoning. It needs skilled \nworkers. This group of senior citizens is among the best in our \ncountry, and they now have a surtax because they receive Social \nSecurity benefits.\n  Let me give an example. If someone earns $26,000 a year and they are \non Social Security, they lose $3,000 of their benefits. The average \nSocial Security recipient receives $9,600 in benefits. So one-third of \ntheir benefits is lost if they go to work.\n  What Senator McCain said is very important. The people to whom this \nmatters most are the people who need it. It is not the person who has \nbeen fortunate in life and has investments; they are not worried about \nthe $9,600 or $12,000 in Social Security benefits. It is the person who \nis living on $26,000 or $30,000 a year who wants to be able to work to \nadd a little extra cushion. That is what was intended under Social \nSecurity; that would be a baseline. Hopefully, one would have the \nability to have savings to add to their retirement security. Some \npeople have not gotten the savings so they want to work.\n  There is no reason in today's good times to severely penalize a solid \nworker, someone we actually need for our economy.\n  I thank Senator Roth from Delaware and Senator Moynihan from New York \nfor bringing this bill to the floor. Senator Ashcroft has been a great \nleader, as well as Senator McCain. Many have worked together on this.\n  The bottom line is, this is an idea where the time has passed. It \nhasn't come, it has gone. We should have done this years ago. We have \nchipped away at it. We are on a roll right now to take that earnings \ntest up to $30,000 from $17,000. That is not good enough. We can \neliminate it. This is the right thing to do. This is the time to do it. \nWe have a burgeoning economy. We need the workers. We need the high-\ntech employees. We need these solid citizens in our economy. If they \nwant to be here, they should have the choice.\n  I urge our colleagues to pass this quickly. I hope we can pass it \ncleanly, get it to the President, and give these people the opportunity \nto make their choices in their senior years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I first thank the Senator from Texas for \nher more than generous remarks to our committee. We appreciate that.\n  I believe now a distinguished member of the committee about whom \nSenator McCain was speaking a moment ago, the Senator from Nebraska, \nhas an amendment to offer. I believe there is an hour.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2885\n\n(Purpose: To redesignate the term for the age at which an individual is \n             eligible for full, unreduced old-age benefits)\n\n  Mr. KERREY. I send an amendment to the desk, and I ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Kerrey] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2885.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end add the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. REDESIGNATION OF TERM FOR AGE AT WHICH AN \n                   INDIVIDUAL IS ELIGIBLE FOR FULL, UNREDUCED OLD-\n                   AGE BENEFITS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Title II of the Social Security Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 401 et seq.) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``retirement age'' each place it appears \n     and inserting ``the age of eligibility for full, unreduced \n     old-age benefits'';\n       (2) by striking ``early retirement age'' each place it \n     appears and inserting ``the age of earliest eligibility for \n     old-age benefits''; and\n       (3) by striking ``delayed retirement'' each place it \n     appears and inserting ``delayed entitlement for old-age \n     benefits''.\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 202(q)(9) of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 402(q)(9)) is amended by striking \n     ``early retirement'' and inserting ``early entitlement for \n     old-age benefits''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall take effect on the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. I understand under a previous unanimous consent the vote \nwill occur at 4 o'clock. Is that correct?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. That is entirely agreeable to us.\n  Mr. ROTH. We are happy to have the vote at 4 o'clock. There is no \nunanimous consent stated.\n  Mr. KERREY. I am not sure I will take a full 30 minutes on my side. \nLet me describe the amendment first and see where it goes.\n  My amendment is essentially a conforming amendment. It is an \namendment that conforms a change we are about to make with the change \nin the language relating to earnings that occur between age 65 and 69.\n  Senator Moynihan and I have a proposal to eliminate the earnings test \nfrom 62 to 65. Some groups are opposed because they are concerned that \nfor low-income working women there could be an increase in the number \nof women who are under the poverty guidelines as established by the \nFederal Government. It is an interesting fact. I am not sure of the \nvalidity of the forecast.\n  We are changing the program from a retirement program to an old-age \nprogram. I support that change. To change Social Security so that it is \nno longer a retirement-based program is very important.\n  Since 1935, we have either said to workers: You have to retire before \nyou are eligible; or we have said: If you continue to work, there will \nbe a penalty that will occur as a consequence of whatever earnings you \nhave.\n  That is what we are trying to eliminate.\n  My amendment is a fairly simple, straightforward amendment. I don't \nknow that I need to talk a great deal about it. It merely inserts \nlanguage that makes it clear that full or semi-retirement is no longer \nrequired to collect benefits, that what is necessary is to merely meet \na tested age--62, 63, 64, and on and on--and for those currently \naffected by the earnings test, for 65 through 69, there will no longer \nbe a test of earnings and a deduct that will occur.\n  But, in addition to eliminating the earnings test, we are also \nfundamentally changing the old-age benefit part of the Social Security \nprogram, I believe in a way that is constructive, that will change the \nprogram from a retirement-based program to a program based on a test of \nage.\n  I am attempting with this amendment to merely bring the language of \nthe law in conformance with what we will be doing with the underlying \nprovision, which is to say you no longer have to retire and have little \nearned income in order to receive benefits. All\n\n[[Page S1490]]\n\nyou have to do under this program is meet a test of age. That one \ndollar for three dollars--up to $17,000 of income--deferrment of \nbenefits will no longer occur--from 65 to 69.\n  I support the underlying bill. This amendment will bring the language \nof the law in conformance to what the underlying bill does.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROTH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the vote occur on \nor in relation to the pending Kerrey amendment at 4 p.m. and the time \nbetween now and the vote be equally divided in the usual form.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that passage of H.R. 5, as amended, \noccur at 10 a.m. on Wednesday, March 22, and that paragraph 4 of rule \nXII be waived.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent the time between 9:45 a.m. and 10 \na.m. on Wednesday be equally divided between the chairman and ranking \nminority member of the Finance Committee for closing remarks on the \nSocial Security earnings bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. In light of this agreement, I announce on behalf of the \nleadership the 4 p.m. vote today will be the last vote of the day.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Nebraska would \nlike to resume his discourse.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I am going to speak until Senator Robb \ngets down to the floor.\n  As I said earlier, I support the elimination of the earnings test \nfrom 65 to 69, and believe the amendment I have offered would be a \npositive conforming change that will make it clear, regarding Social \nSecurity at age 65, there is no longer a requirement to be retired. \nThat is what the current law says, you have to be retired. ``Retirement \nbenefit at normal retirement age'' is how it is described in the \nstatute. My amendment would conform the changes we are making in H.R. 5 \nto alter the program that reduces benefits according to income from one \nthat would no longer offer that reduction to beneficiaries.\n  Beneficiaries evaluate their income versus what Social Security is \ngoing to do all the time. One of the interesting things about the \nprogram is to observe that nearly 80 percent of beneficiaries take an \nearly benefit. They have a 20-percent reduction in benefits.\n  The baby boomers may come in here 15 years from now and want to get \nrid of that, for all I know, but right now it is a 20-percent reduction \nin benefits. Mr. President, 80 percent of Americans, when they become \neligible for the old age benefit, will opt to take that 20-percent \nreduction--not all of them are doing it at 62--some are taking a \nsmaller cut in benefits at 63 or 64--because they calculate the \nbenefits will be greater than retiring at 65 if they survive for 10 \nyears. There is a lot of  thinking that goes on, including with the \nearnings test, the calculation of what the deduction will mean and what \nthe add-back will provide in future years.\n\n  I would like to spend a little time again, until Senator Robb gets \ndown here, to talk about the underlying problem. The earnings test \nelimination bill, the legislation we are going to pass 100-0 tomorrow, \ndoes address one of the problems, though it only addresses it \npartially. It addresses the earnings test imposed from age 65 to 69. It \ndoes not address the earnings test imposed from age 62 to 64. But there \nare other problems that the status quo creates for future \nbeneficiaries. We need to think about it that way. I would like to show \nmy colleagues the ways delaying reform will cause future workers and \nbeneficiaries to suffer.\n  The biggest problem with delaying reform is that it forces hard \nworking, lower and middle class Americans to bear a disproportionate \nshare of the burden of debt reduction--the same people who bore a \ndisproportionate share of the great deficit reductions in 1980s and \n1990s. People being paid by the hour are now being told we are going to \nuse a significant portion of their FICA taxes--which are supposed to be \ndedicated to benefit payments--to pay down debt. That is basically what \nthis phrase ``saving Social Security'' means when you examine it more \nclosely.\n  It is true the debt will be nearly eliminated by 2013 if we use all \nof the surpluses to pay down debt--but then it goes right back up again \nin the 2020s to fund Social Security benefits for the baby boomers. So, \nif you are under the age of 15 today, when you become eligible you are \nlooking at debt levels that will be somewhere between two and three \ntimes what they are today. So the do-nothing plan, taking no action at \nall--there are still 500 Members of Congress who have not signed onto a \nspecific piece of legislation--results in a substantial increase in the \ndebt out into the future.\n  The other thing that could happen in the future a consequence of this \nhuge demographic bulge of baby boomers is a massive payroll tax \nincrease or a cut in benefits. The baby boom generation will start \nretiring in 2010. There will be a 40-million-person increase in the \nnumber of beneficiaries from 37 to 77, but only a 7 or 8 million person \nincrease in the number of people who are working.\n  Social Security is essentially a tax on people who are working, \ntransferred in a progressive fashion to people who are eligible as a \nconsequence of meeting a test of age, survivorship, or disability. It \nis a progressive transfer program. We have a trust fund that \naccumulates as a reserve against contingencies but it is a pay-as-you-\ngo program. It is a tax that is transferred in a very progressive \nfashion. Indeed, that 12.4-percent tax today, along with the tax on \nincome and the interest that is earned on the debt that is paid with \nincome taxes, there is about $150 billion more--$550 billion of total \nincome coming into the Social Security system this year against about \n$400 billion in checks that are written to pay for it.\n  That reserve builds up over time. I will not go into that particular \nproblem, but anytime you have to convert any of those bonds, you have \nto use income taxes to convert the bond. Starting in about 2014, we \nwill have to start drawing the trust funds down with additional \ninfusions of income tax into the program.\n  What does this all mean for today's workers? If you are under the age \nof 40--there are approximately 150 million Americans under the age of \n40--you are looking at the following problem: Congress will either have \nto reduce your benefits by 33 percent or Congress will have to enact a \npayroll tax increase of about 50 percent to accommodate the demand that \nwill be there, the liability that will be there, under current law.\n  Obviously, a tax increase of that magnitude seems unacceptable. But \nthis is what current law calls for. So if you are a Member of Congress \nthat supports the do-nothing approach, you support a 33-percent cut in \nbenefits or a 50-percent increase in taxes.\n  The reason I mention that is that with the plan I have introduced \nwith Senator Moynihan, the plan we have introduced with Senators \nBreaux, Gregg, and Robb, I have received a lot of attacks. People say: \nYou are reducing benefits out in the future. How dare you reduce \nbenefits out in the future, let alone suggest we need some additional \nrevenue with tax increases?\n  None of the proposals out there have called for massive tax \nincreases. Our proposal has a 2-percent reduction in the payroll tax, \nbut it is funded with offsets in benefits out in the future, as well as \nincreased benefits coming from the individual accounts--\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KERREY. Yes.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Two percentage points?\n  Mr. KERREY. Two percentage points, that is correct. Not 2 percent of \nthe 12.4; but 2 percentage points overall, from 12.4 to 10.4 percent. \nUnder current law, a substantial increase in the publicly-held debt \nwill occur.\n  In addition, there is a problem with the existing program in that \nlow-income-earning beneficiaries do not have enough of their income \nreplaced by the current benefit formulas. The Social Security reform \nproposal that I have\n\n[[Page S1491]]\n\nintroduced with a bipartisan group of Senators increases benefits for \nlow income workers by changing these benefit formulas.\n  I hear lots of my colleagues, especially on this side of the aisle, \ntalk a lot about the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer. \nIt is true that the gap is widening, but if you want to solve the \nproblem, you cannot do it just by increasing the minimum wage or \nincreasing the earned-income tax credit. You have to change the law so \npeople of all incomes have the opportunity to generate wealth. The \ncurrent Social Security program does not offer that opportunity. Our \nproposal would.\n  Finally, there is growing intergenerational inequity in our Federal \nbudget. We may not be spending too much on people over age 65 today. \nBut by the time I am eligible for Social Security, and the cohort \ncoming right behind me--the baby boomers--in my view, we will be.\n  So colleagues understand, today if you take all Federal and State \nfunding on people over the age of 65 and the people under the age of \n18--that is State and Federal spending--we spend three times as much on \npeople over age 65 as we do on people under the age of 18.\n  Again, I do not think it is too much today. I do not think we are \nspending an excessive amount today. But spending on seniors continues \nto increase. The year-to-year spending increases are getting larger. \nAgain, nobody should suffer the illusion of where this money comes \nfrom. It comes from a tax on wages on today's workers.\n  If we underinvest in the skills and the training and the education of \nthese kids, which in my view we are, in favor of politically popular \nmoves that spend more and more money on people over the age of 65--and \nunderstand, there are 50 percent more Americans under the age of 18 \nthan over the age of 65--if we continue to do that for very long, when \nwe get to the year 2030  there will only be two workers per retiree. If \nI get to pick Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, I am in good shape. But I \ndon't. I pick an average. One of the things we need to consider, as \nwell, is the do-nothing plan is heading in a direction of creating, in \nmy view, substantial intergenerational inequities in the Social \nSecurity program itself.\n\n  Social Security and Medicare are popular because they currently have \nsome semblance of generational equity. People of all ages support \nSocial Security and Medicare because they see them as a fair social \ncontract. But in 10 or 15 years from now, my view is, looking at the \nnumbers, and with there likely to be a decreasing number of young \npeople, they are not going to have to be told by politicians, they are \ngoing to look at the contract and say: Wait a minute, this deal is not \nvery good for me. They are not going to like it and will rise up and \nget angry about it.\n  For these reasons, I would argue that the status quo plan offered by \nthe do-nothing caucus is dangerous. What we need is a comprehensive \nreform plan--that is bipartisan in nature--to finally fix the problems \nin the Social Security.\n  Obviously, the elimination of the earnings test is a very popular \nSocial Security reform measure. The other ones are unpopular but \nrequire difficult votes in order to make the changes. I hope that we, \nat some point, are able to come together to solve the larger problem of \nSocial Security that exists in all these different ways.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank the Senator from Nebraska once again and say I \nregret he was necessarily away from the floor when the Senator from \nArizona spoke almost precisely in your terms, and spoke about the \nlegislation you have offered, and said, yes, it would often produce \nderision when you talked about it on the campaign trail--we know a \nlittle bit about derision, both of us do--but he said a bipartisan \nsolution is necessary and possible. If we cannot see it coming, we will \nbe remembered for not having done so.\n  I see that my friend, the distinguished Senator from Virginia, is on \nthe floor.\n  Would the Senator like 5 minutes?\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Virginia--more if he requires \nit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from New \nYork. I am delighted to join, as I just mentioned to him, the ``amen'' \nchorus.\n  I rise to support my friend from Nebraska in his continuing effort to \nstrengthen Social Security for the long term. I commend him for his \ntireless work on behalf of the seniors of this country, as well as \ntheir children and grandchildren, as he fights to both strengthen \nSocial Security and lessen the burden of debt we leave to future \ngenerations.\n  I share Senator Kerrey's frustrations over the failure of this body \nto strengthen Social Security. I am pleased we can now afford to repeal \nthe earnings test. I fully support this bill. But this is only one of \nmany steps that need to be taken. We cannot continue to deal with a \nprogram as large and as vital as Social Security on a piecemeal basis. \nWe owe both our seniors and our children so much more.\n  The facts are simple. By the year 2013, payroll taxes we collect will \nnot be sufficient to pay for Social Security payments. By the year \n2034, the program will only be able to pay for 72 cents out of every \ndollar of benefits we have promised senior citizens in America. Worst \nof all, these figures are based on our economy continuing to click \nalong at the same pace it is right now. If we have a sudden downturn or \nperiod of stagnation, we will be in trouble much sooner.\n  It is time to start telling the American people the truth. If we do \nnot strengthen our Social Security program, we will have to either cut \nbenefits or increase payroll taxes--or both. We cannot afford to let \nthat happen.\n  Even worse, from my perspective, the bills would have to be paid by \nour children and grandchildren. They deserve a better legacy from us \nthan a mountain of debt.\n  The good news is, slowly but surely, we are making progress. In the \npast several years, we have been able to remove the Social Security \ntrust fund surplus from the calculation of the onbudget surplus. While \nI am pleased we have taken this first step toward fiscal \nresponsibility, we need to do much more. Setting aside the surplus in \nthe Social Security trust fund is prudent, but it does not take care of \nthe underlying and very fundamental problems.\n  Now is the time to act. We need to strengthen the Social Security \nprogram so today's senior citizens get the benefits they have been \npromised. We need to strengthen the Social Security program so our \nchildren and grandchildren are not unfairly burdened with our debt. We \nneed to do more. I support what we are doing today, but we need to do \nmore.\n  I conclude my remarks by thanking the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom New York, who is, regrettably, in the judgment of many of us, \ngoing to be retiring from this institution, and the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Nebraska, who, equally regrettably, is going to be \nretiring from this institution. Both will be sorely missed.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank the Senator most sincerely.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to Senator Hagel.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I add my thanks to the distinguished \nchairman of the Finance Committee and the ranking member, Mr. Moynihan. \nAnd I tag on to what my friend and colleague, Senator Robb, said \nregarding the loss to this body and to America as we find Senators \nMoynihan and Kerrey serving their last year in the Senate. In a narrow, \nparochial sense, Mr. Kerrey's impending retirement makes me the new \nsenior Senator from Nebraska. However, I would have gladly put that \naside for the interest of our senior Senator from Nebraska staying on, \nas well as Mr. Moynihan, who adds the kind of enlightenment, \nenhancement, and leadership to an issue that is so critical to this \ncountry and to our future.\n  With that, I, too, rise in support of H.R. 5, the Senior Citizens' \nFreedom to Work Act of 2000. I am also a cosponsor of the Senate \ncompanion bill, S. 2074, the Social Security Earnings Test Elimination \nAct.\n  I think it is appropriate this afternoon to acknowledge our friend \nand colleague, Senator McCain, who has recently rejoined the Senate \nafter his odyssey throughout America over the\n\n[[Page S1492]]\n\nlast few months. Senator McCain was an early sponsor of repealing the \nSocial Security earnings test and fought hard and provided essential \nleadership early on. I acknowledge Mr. McCain's early leadership on \nthis issue.\n  We have heard today how this legislation will repeal the Social \nSecurity earnings test, which is a disincentive for seniors to work by \nreducing seniors' Social Security benefits according to the amount of \nincome they earn. We know this legislation will allow seniors between \nthe ages of 65 and 70 to go back to work or continue to work and not \nworry about being penalized for their productivity or losing their \nSocial Security benefits.\n  As America moves into the new century, it will need more workers in \nthe workforce, not less. Productive capacity is the engine that drives \neconomic growth. That means we must have skilled workers and managers \nand experienced workers and managers. The passage of this bill helps \nAmerica with this great challenge. It will help America retain this \nvital resource of skilled and experienced workers and managers.\n  However, this legislation will not fix Social Security. It will not \nfix our long-term workforce challenge. The solvency of Social Security \nis one of the great challenges facing America today. We must reform \nSocial Security or it will not be there for future generations. We know \nthe figures.\n  In 1999, there were 35 million Americans, 13 percent of total \npopulation, 65 years of age or older. By the year 2030, there will be \n70 million Americans, 20 percent of the total population, who will be \n65 years of age or older. In 2010, the first group of the 76 million \nbaby boomers will become eligible for Social Security benefits. And in \n2030, the number of workers paying into Social Security per \nbeneficiary, as Senator Kerrey has acknowledged, will drop to 2 from \nthe present 3.3.\n  With this increasing number of beneficiaries and a smaller workforce \ncontributing to the Social Security system, if Congress does not enact \nreform, Social Security benefit payments will begin to exceed the taxes \ncollected in the year 2014. My colleagues who have spoken before me on \nthe floor this afternoon have pointed out in rather significant clarity \nthe consequences of that.\n  I don't have all the answers to what we must do, but I am sure of one \nthing--this Congress needs to act sooner rather  than later. We must \nreform Social Security and improve it for future generations.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I ask for an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. ROTH. One minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I thank the Chair.\n  We know there is an anticipated projection of a $2.3 trillion surplus \nin Social Security trust funds over the next 10 years. But we do know \nthat if, in fact, we are to reform Social Security, whatever projected \nsurplus occurs must remain in Social Security. Second, we must reform \nSocial Security in a way that starts to develop personal wealth. \nPersonal retirement accounts would harness the power of private markets \nand compounding interest, providing a much higher rate of return on \neach individual's investment. This also gives ownership to each \nindividual, meaning choices and more responsibility for their own \neconomic future.\n  The changes we make to Social Security should not affect current or \nsoon-to-be beneficiaries. We can create a system that still provides a \nsafety net for those who are most vulnerable in society but offers \nyounger workers the opportunity to create wealth and save for their \nfutures.\n  Finally, the Social Security system we now have affects all \nAmericans. It will continue to affect all Americans. The decisions we \nmake today will profoundly affect the lives of all Americans. We must \nnot squander the time we now have to deal with the solvency of Social \nSecurity.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the passage of this \nrelevant, important, and timely legislation.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside so I may offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2886\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I submit a managers' amendment on behalf of \nmyself and Senator Moynihan and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Roth], for himself and Mr. \n     Moynihan, proposes an amendment numbered 2886.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the first word and insert the following:\n\n             1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Senior Citizens' Freedom to \n     Work Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. ELIMINATION OF EARNINGS TEST FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE \n                   ATTAINED RETIREMENT AGE.\n\n       Section 203 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 403) is \n     amended--\n       (1) in subsection (c)(1), by striking ``the age of \n     seventy'' and inserting ``retirement age (as defined in \n     section 216(l))'';\n       (2) in paragraphs (1)(A) and (2) of subsection (d), by \n     striking ``the age of seventy'' each place it appears and \n     inserting ``retirement age (as defined in section 216(l))'';\n       (3) in subsection (f)(1)(B), by striking ``was age seventy \n     or over'' and inserting ``was at or above retirement age (as \n     defined in section 216(l))'';\n       (4) in subsection (f)(3), by striking ``age 70'' and \n     inserting ``retirement age (as defined in section 216(l))'';\n       (5) in subsection (h)(1)(A), by striking ``age 70'' each \n     place it appears and inserting ``retirement age (as defined \n     in section 216(l))''; and\n       (6) in subsection (j)--\n       (A) in the heading, by striking ``Age Seventy'' and \n     inserting ``Retirement Age''; and\n       (B) by striking ``seventy years of age'' and inserting \n     ``having attained retirement age (as defined in section \n     216(l))''.\n\n     SEC. 3.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The amendments made by this Act shall apply with respect to \n     taxable years ending after December 31, 1999.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, let me briefly describe the managers' \namendment. This amendment would fix a technical problem with the House \nbill that would inadvertently impose a more stringent earnings limit on \ncertain Social Security beneficiaries age 64 than provided under \ncurrent law.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a description of the amendment be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Description of the Managers' Amendment\n\n       The Managers' amendment would make a technical correction \n     to H.R. 5, the ``Senior\n\n[[Page S1493]]\n\n     Citizens Freedom to Work Act'', that abolishes the Social \n     Security earnings limit for Social Security beneficiaries \n     ages 65-69. As written, the House bill would impose a more \n     stringent earnings limit on certain Social Security \n     beneficiaries who are age 64 than provided under current law \n     after 2000.\n\n\n                              current law\n\n       Under current law, there are two earnings limits, one that \n     applies to Social Security beneficiaries ages 62-64, the \n     other to beneficiaries ages 65-69. In 2000, under the \n     earnings limit for beneficiaries 62-64, a beneficiary has his \n     or her Social Security benefits reduced by $1 for every $2 in \n     earnings over $10,080. For beneficiaries 65 to 69, benefits \n     are reduced by $1 for every $3 in earnings over $17,000; this \n     threshold rises to $25,000 in 2001 and $30,000 in 2002. There \n     is no earnings limit for beneficiaries over age 70.\n       Eligibility for the 65-69 earnings limit is determined by \n     the calendar year in which that beneficiary turns 65, \n     regardless of the month in which the beneficiary actually \n     turns 65. Thus, for example, in 2000 a beneficiary who turns \n     65 in December would have the 65-69 earnings limit apply to \n     him or her throughout the entire calendar year of 2000. \n     Eligibility for the age 62-64 earnings limit, and for no \n     limit at age 70, begins with the month a beneficiary turns 62 \n     or 70.\n\n\n                               house bill\n\n       H.R. 5 would abolish the earnings limit for beneficiaries \n     above the ``normal retirement age'' (currently age 65). \n     However, effective 2001, under H.R. 5, a beneficiary would \n     not be eligible for the age 65 earnings limit (i.e., no \n     earnings limit) until the month in which that person reaches \n     age 65. Otherwise, the age 62-64 earnings limit would apply. \n     Thus, a beneficiary who turned 65 in December 2001 would have \n     an earnings limit for most of 2001 of $10,440, which is \n     substantially less than current law ($25,000).\n\n\n                       Senate managers' amendment\n\n       The manager's amendment would make a technical correction \n     to H.R. 5 to continue permanently the current law practice \n     that for the year in which a Social Security beneficiary \n     reaches the normal retirement age (currently age 65), the \n     current law age 65-69 earnings limit applies until the month \n     in which the beneficiary reaches the normal retirement age \n     (age 65). When the beneficiary reaches the normal retirement \n     age, the earnings limit would no longer apply.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield back all time on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, may I express the gratitude I have, and \nI am sure our revered chairman has, for our staff who worked this out. \nIt was not easy. It was a weekend's work at a minimum, which sounds \nsimple when so described, to try to get it into legislative language. \nBut it was necessary. It is understood on the House side that, yes, \nthat was a mistake we had not realized or we had not taken care of. So \nwe now have done so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2886) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2885\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, what is the order of business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 12 minutes remaining on the Kerrey \namendment.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I see the distinguished Senator from \nIndiana has risen. Does he wish to speak?\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I was going to make a statement first.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. The Senator from Delaware will speak and then 5 \nminutes, or such as remains, will be yielded to the Senator from \nIndiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I begin by recognizing the important \ncontributions of Senator Kerrey, both to the Finance Committee and to \nthe Senate. In particular, he is a unique and important voice in the \nnational debate on Social Security and Medicare reform. He has taken \nthoughtful but not always popular positions on how these programs \nshould be reshaped, both to better serve our Nation's seniors and to \nensure that these programs can be sustained.\n  Indeed, much of the current debate over Social Security reform dates \nto 1993, when Senator Kerrey conceived and then later chaired the \nBipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform. On the Finance \nCommittee, his energy and expertise are highly regarded by his \ncolleagues.\n  Having said that, I must oppose this amendment. I understand why \nSenator Kerrey has offered it. And on a more appropriate bill, I might \nsupport it. Certainly, as a nation, we need to rethink carefully what \nwe mean by retirement. However, I believe instead we should act to move \nthis legislation to the President as quickly as possible. That means no \nother amendments other than the managers' amendment, which fixes a \ntechnical problem of the House bill.\n  I have received a letter from Chairman Archer and Congressman Rangel \nsaying that any other extraneous amendments will require a conference. \nNeedless to say, other issues might be raised in the conference.\n  Mr. President, I trust my friend from Nebraska will understand why I \noppose this amendment. I hope he will accept my pledge to continue to \nwork with him on these important issues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nIndiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his indulgence. This \nis my first opportunity to point to the fact that Senator Moynihan's \nmother was a longtime resident of our State. We are very proud of that \nfact, and I am pleased to note it today. Our colleague, Senator Gregg, \nis not with us, but I thank him for his leadership on this issue. It is \nnot surprising to me that a former Governor is leading the way on a \nmatter of such importance in terms of fiscal responsibility. Likewise, \nI commend our colleague, Senator Kerrey. I am not the least bit \nsurprised that someone whose courage has been tested on the field of \nbattle also has the courage to address one of the foremost challenges \nof our time--a challenge that is important to the future of our \ncountry, yet escapes the ability of many politicians to address. I \nsalute Senator Kerrey for his leadership on this very important issue.\n  I, too, rise in support of the cause of repealing the earnings test \nlimit on the Social Security benefits. It is the right thing to do at \nthis time with unemployment being so low and the economy so strong. \nThis will inject much needed talent on the part of senior workers into \nthe economy. It is only right that if people are living longer, we \nshould enable them to earn more to support themselves. Since it doesn't \nhave a long-term fiscal impact, it is the right thing to do from that \nstandpoint.\n  On this particular bill and on this particular vote, no profiles in \ncourage will be written on the floor of the Senate today. I am \nconcerned and I add my voice to others--a growing chorus--in calling \nfor meaningful reform in the Social Security system and to ensure its \nlong-term financial viability.\n\n  The trends are disturbing. Over the last 40 years, the percentage of \nour Federal budget that has now gone to entitlement expenditures has \ndoubled from about a third of Federal expenditures to two-thirds. Some \nprojections are accurate. In the coming decades, fully 100 percent of \nFederal expenditures may be comprised of entitlements, leaving nothing \nleft for things such as education, the environment, children's issues, \nhealth care, or national defense--literally nothing but entitlements, \nas important as they may be.\n  Clearly, this is a course that we cannot sustain forever. Likewise, I \nnote that the percentage of Federal revenues raised through taxes \nfunding entitlements has also doubled over the last 20 years, from 16 \npercent to fully one-third of Federal revenues now raised from payroll \ntaxes. These taxes are regressive in nature and fall heavily and \ndisproportionately on the middle class.\n  I believe in the importance of investment in education, science, \nresearch, and other important areas of our national budget, and it is \nbecause I believe in the importance of tax relief for the middle class \nthat I believe very strongly we must embrace the cause of meaningful \nreform of entitlements in general, and particularly Social Security, if \nwe are going to enable ourselves to meet these other important \nchallenges as well.\n  This is something that should unite the right and the left. Those on \nthe right should be concerned about a return to the days of debt and \ndeficit spending and the corresponding slowdown in economic growth that \nwould inevitably result. Those on the right should be concerned about \nan increasing percentage of our Federal budget basically being put on \nfiscal autopilot.\n\n[[Page S1494]]\n\n Those on the left should be concerned about shoring up and preserving \nnot just temporarily, but in the long run, a fundamental part of our \nSocial safety net, the Social Security system, a legacy of which we can \nrightfully be proud. And those on the left should also be concerned \nabout maintaining the discretionary ability to invest in the other \nimportant things that will make our country a more prosperous and \ndecent place in the years to come.\n  Despite this seeming ground for compromise between the left and \nright, too often a consensus evades us. It is difficult in a democracy \nto make hard choices. Yet our constituents have a right to expect no \nless from us. It takes wisdom and courage on the part of those \nproposing this reform, forbearance upon our political opponents' part, \nand ultimately wisdom and understanding on the part of the American \npeople.\n  I wish to close my remarks by commending those who have risen to \nspeak out in favor of the cause of meaningful entitlement reform. It is \nessential not only to preserving the benefits for those we claim to \nchampion today; it is also important for proving the efficacy of our \ndemocratic institutions on the threshold of the 21st century. I thank \nmy colleagues for their courage in taking up this issue. Senator \nKerrey's voice will be missed in the years to come. I hope to add mine \nin my own humble way, and ultimately we will achieve this objective. I \nthank Senator Moynihan and yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the chairman has very generously agreed \nto allow the Senator from Nevada to speak for 5 minutes. That would \nperhaps run us over the 4 o'clock time set for the vote. I ask \nunanimous consent for an extra 2 minutes in that regard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I express my appreciation to a very \ndistinguished and fair chairman and the ranking member for \naccommodating this Senator.\n  I rise in strong support of the Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act, \nbipartisan legislation to repeal the Social Security earnings limit.\n  For a number of years, I have joined with my colleague, Senator \nMcCain, in efforts to repeal this unfair penalty. In my judgment, this \nlegislation is long overdue. The earnings limit has unfairly penalized \nSocial Security recipients who have chosen to continue to work and \ndiscouraged others from remaining in the workforce and contributing to \nour country's economic growth.\n  It is confusing to beneficiaries and it is difficult to administer. \nIt is time to repeal the earnings limit and thus allow Social Security \nrecipients who continue to work to do so without a reduction in their \nbenefits.\n  It becomes very clear that the time has come to revoke this \nunjustified policy when we consider why it was imposed in the first \ninstance. The Social Security earnings test was a Depression-era \npolicy, originating nearly 70 years ago as a mechanism to cope with the \nhigh levels of unemployment. Our country now faces a very different \ndilemma--a tight labor market in many areas, including my own State of \nNevada, which makes it difficult to recruit qualified employees.\n  It is simply illogical to prevent those who are willing and able to \ndo so from joining the economy by working in areas that desperately \nneed their talents. While many people choose to retire from their jobs \nat the traditional age of 65, or earlier, more and more workers want to \ncontinue working well into their late sixties and into their seventies.\n  One of the incentives, of course, for working beyond retirement age \nis the greater financial security that their additional income \nprovides. However, for people between the ages of 65 and 70, the \nfinancial benefits of staying in the workforce are diminished by the \nunjustified earnings limit. Too many seniors, especially those with \nhigh medical bills, struggle on their very limited incomes. The last \nthing they need is a Government-imposed penalty.\n  Currently, for every $3 a worker aged 65 to 70 earns above $17,000, \nthe worker's Social Security benefit check is reduced by $1. That is \nquite a disincentive to working. At a time when we put great emphasis \non all Americans joining the workforce, it makes little sense to \ndiscourage employment for a large, experienced, and valuable segment of \nour population.\n  It is also important to note that the repeal does not adversely \naffect the long-term financial health of the Social Security trust \nfund. Eventually, the Social Security Administration would actually \nsave money because it would not have to administer the complicated \nearnings test.\n  This, then, is a win-win situation for all involved. Seniors can \ncontinue to work and earn income without their previously earned Social \nSecurity benefits being unfairly reduced while the Government is \nminimally affected.\n\n  Our colleagues in the House of Representatives have recently voted \nunanimously to pass this legislation. It is now our turn to do so, and \nI hope the Senate will act swiftly to enact this legislation to repeal \nthis unfair penalty.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, my amendment is merely a conforming \namendment. If you support the underlying amendment, which changes \nSocial Security from a retirement program to a program that simply has \na test of age as opposed to a status of work, I urge colleagues to make \nthis change. It will make it a lot easier to do reform in the future. \nIt has nothing to do with moving the eligibility age; that stays the \nsame. The amendment substitutes the words ``old age'' and ``age test'' \nfor the word ``retirement.'' So they will no longer be required to \nretire in order to be eligible for this benefit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The question is on agreeing to \nthe Kerrey amendment.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I would like to expedite the consideration \nof this amendment. But it is important that we move ahead with the \nlegislation so that it can be referred expeditiously to the President. \nFor that reason, I move to table the amendment. I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.

The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, following my brief remarks and the \nremarks of Senators Baucus, Bunning, and Graham, in that order, I ask \nunanimous consent that all time be yielded back on the pending Social \nSecurity bill and there then be a period for the transaction of morning \nbusiness with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I encourage any Members who wish to speak on the \nSocial Security issue to do so in morning business following the \nunanimous-consent agreement just propounded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I join in the request of the Senator \nfrom Georgia. Other fair matters have arisen that require our chairman \nand ranking member to be, in effect, in a meeting. Therefore, we are \nleaving the floor open and encourage all who wish to speak to come and \ndo so.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, it is interesting that so much of our \nlabor law dates back to the mid-1930s. H.R. 5 is a measure that deals \nwith modernizing attitudes about work habits and workers and bringing \nthem into the new century.\n  It was in 1935, during the Great Depression, that it was decided to \ndiscourage people who were 65 and older from working. That was done by \nsaying: If you do work, we can't keep you from working, but for every \n$3 you earn, we are going to take $1 of it, or charge you a surtax of \n33 percent. It was a very arduous and imposing tax on individuals on \nSocial Security.\n  There are a number of major changes that have occurred in the \nworkplace, but two I emphasize have become uniquely significant for \nthis group of workers, age 65 to 69.\n  No. 1, the United States is effectively unable to fill its workplace. \nWe deal with that issue on a daily basis. We need workers. We need \npeople who are highly trained, who have developed an expertise, as \nsenior workers have done. And we need them to stay in the workplace, if \nwe are going to fill the American workplace.\n  The second issue that has created a very serious and significant \nchange is that many of these workers must do so in order to keep up \nwith the financial pressures of this time, with the increase in costs \nof medicine and other matters dealing with senior years.\n  It is inherently unfair to tax these earnings over $17,000 and to \npunish people for entering the workplace when, indeed, we want them to \nenter the workplace; we want them to stay in the workplace. They are no \nlonger keeping somebody else from getting a job. We can walk down any \nstreet in America today and see: ``Now hiring.'' ``Now hiring.'' \nCompany after company in our country cannot find sufficient workers.\n  We also don't have to spend much time in an audience anywhere in \nAmerica that we do not hear a senior object to the fact that if he or \nshe believes they must continue to work or want to work, they are so \ndeeply penalized by Federal tax law. By repealing the earnings limit, \nwe will be providing tax relief to about 1.2 million seniors in America \nbetween the ages of 65 and 69. It will amount to about $23 billion--not \na small number--over 10 years.\n  This is the right thing to do, and it is the right time to do it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 5, the Senior \nCitizen's Freedom to Work Act. I am a cosponsor of the Senate version \nof this bill, S. 2074.\n  The earnings test, to remind my colleagues, is a Depression-era \nholdover which reduces Social Security benefits for working retirees. \nWhen Social Security began 65 years ago, its creators hoped older \nworkers would withdraw from the work force and make more room for \nyounger workers. This was back in the 1930s, in the Depression.\n  So they reduced retiree's Social Security benefits according to a \nformula, which today causes the loss of $1 in benefits for every $3 \nearned over $17,000 for those between the ages of 65 and 69.\n  While this might have made sense during the Great Depression, which \nat its peak saw one out of every four Americans without jobs, driving \nolder workers out of the workforce simply does not reflect the needs of \ntoday's America. Americans today are retiring sooner, and the number of \nemployed males over the age of 65 has fallen from 47 percent 50 years \nago to less than 17 percent today. In addition, we all know the \nsolvency of the Social Security Trust Funds is threatened because our \nsociety is aging. In 1950, there were 17 people in the workforce for \nevery person drawing Social Security benefits. By 1999, this number had \ndropped to less than 4 people working for every one person drawing \nbenefits. And under the intermediate projections of the Social Security \ntrustees, this number will drop even further, to less than 2 people \nworking for every one beneficiary by 2075.\n  In today's era of low unemployment, it simply makes no sense to \npenalize retirees who want to continue working. And as we look at the \ncontinued graying of our society throughout the 21st century, it will \nbecome even more critical to eliminate disincentives to work for this \ngrowing segment of our population.\n  Working seniors are a vital employee pool for America's businesses. \nWe need the experience they bring from a lifetime of learning to help \ntrain our younger workers. And many seniors need the income that comes \nfrom these jobs to help make ends meet. The earnings test especially \nhurts senior citizens who face heavy medical bills or other expenses in \ncaring for a spouse or other family members. Yet over 630,000 seniors \ntoday are receiving reduced Social Security benefits simply because \nthey want or need to work. And there is no way to know how many more \nonly work part of the year because they don't want to earn more than \nthe $17,000 limit.\n  We should recognize that enacting this legislation is not without its \ntradeoffs. Those who have their benefits reduced because of the \nearnings test today receive higher lifetime benefits after they turn \n70. For some retirees, this tradeoff could cost them in the long run. \nBut for seniors who are having trouble making ends meet today, the \npromise of higher benefits after they turn 70 seems hollow indeed.\n  So I am glad that we are finally at least taking this first step \ntoward restructuring the Social Security system to face the realities \nof our workforce in the 21st century. I am also glad, that even in this \nhighly charged political climate, Democrats and Republicans can still \nfind some issues that we can agree on.\n  I hope we can continue to look for more issues like this as the \nsession continues. Putting aside our political differences for the good \nof the American people, after all, is what the public wants.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5, the \nSenior Citizens Freedom to Work Act, and the repeal of the Social \nSecurity earnings limit.\n  This is a day that many of us have worked toward for a long time, and \nthe sooner we can pass this bill and send it in to the President, the \nbetter. Our seniors deserve it.\n  I think by now we all know how the earnings limit works. It penalizes \nseniors between 65 and 70 who receive Social Security benefits but also \ncontinue working. For every $3 they earn over the earnings limit, they \nlose $1 in benefits. Under current law, in 2000 the limit is $17,000. \nIt rises to $25,000 next year, $30,000 in 2002, and with inflation \nafter that.\n  The earnings limit is a Depression era relic whose time has come and \nlong gone. It first became law back in the 1930's when Social Security \nwas started, and was passed by Congress as a way to encourage seniors \nto retire so that their jobs could be taken by younger, unemployed \nworkers.\n  At a time when our economy was fighting for its life, and \nunemployment was close to 25 percent, an earnings limit might have \nseemed like a good idea. Now when unemployment is threatening to dip \nbelow 4 percent and many of our nation's employers are\n\n[[Page S1496]]\n\nclamoring for more workers, it's clear that the earnings limit has \noutlived whatever usefulness it once might have had.\n  From time to time over the years, Congress has looked at changing the \nearnings limit. In fact, several times we did tweak it here and there \nby raising the income level. But, like a vampire, the earning limit has \nbeen hard to kill altogether--it continued to threaten seniors and \ntheir livelihoods.\n  Now we have the opportunity to get rid of the earnings limit \naltogether. I say that it's time to drive a stake through the heart of \nthe earnings limit once and for all.\n  Mr. President, I was privileged to serve in the other body as the \nchairman of the Social Security Subcommittee for 4 years, and before \nthat as the Ranking Member for 4 years. It was my bill that we passed \nin the 104th Congress that lifted the earnings limit to its current \nlevel of $30,000 from what was then $11,250.\n  If we could have repealed it altogether, we would have. But the \nbudget landscape was different back then. We were still looking at huge \ndeficits, and we were using Social Security surpluses to finance \ngeneral government programs.\n\n  Now things are different. We have budget surpluses across the board, \nand we can focus on doing the right thing for seniors irrespective of \nother spending and tax needs. Our economic prosperity has handed us a \ngolden opportunity to repeal the earnings limit. Times have changed for \nthe better.\n  I know there are others in Senate who have worked on this issue for \nyears. But, for my colleagues who have not lived with legislation to \nrepeal the earnings limit as long as some of us, let me just briefly \ndescribe for them what it has been like over the past 14 years for \nthose of us who have been trying to pass legislation.\n  In 1987, those of us who had just been elected to the House for the \n100th Congress adopted as a project the repeal of the earnings limit. \nAnd at least 11 bills were introduced in Congress to lift or repeal the \nlimit altogether, and we worked the issue hard. But, nothing happened. \nIt was like banging your head against a wall.\n  Then during the 101st Congress, then-Congressman Denny Hastert, and \nanother 100th congressional class member, introduced a bill to repeal \nthe limit and got 267 cosponsors in the House. Again, nothing happened.\n  In the 102d Congress, we managed to get 278 supporters in the House \nto support our bill to lift the earnings limit. We talked up the issue \nconstantly. Still, nothing.\n  So we kept plugging along, and once again in the 103d Congress, we \nintroduced a bill and signed up over a majority of the House--225 \nMembers--on our legislation. But, guess what? Nothing happened.\n  Then something did happen. In 1994, Republicans took control of \nCongress. And in 1995, as part of the Contract with America, we passed \nlegislation to lift the earnings limit to its current annual level of \n$30,000. This was one of the most popular bills we passed that year, \nand I was proud to be the lead sponsor.\n  But, we still weren't finished because this proposal was part of \nlarger legislation that was vetoed by President Clinton as part of his \ngovernment shutdown strategy. He said he liked the earnings limit \nrepeal, but he vetoed the bill anyway.\n  So we were back at Square One. But, we took the President at his word \nthat he liked the earnings limit repeal, so after the veto we quickly \npassed a stand-alone bill in the House to increase the earnings limit \nin late 1995. The next March, we included it in must-pass legislation \nto lift the Federal Government's debt ceiling, and it was signed into \nlaw.\n  In all, it took almost 10 years to raise the earnings limit, so I \nhope my colleagues keep this in mind now that we have a chance to act \nquickly to get rid of the limit altogether.\n  Mr. President, people are living longer and longer. And many of them \nwant to work after they turn 65. They want to work longer, and they can \ndo more. Why on earth should we penalize them--by taking benefits they \nhave already paid for--for doing that?! It just doesn't make sense to \npay them with one hand, and to rob them with the other.\n  The average life expectancy for women in America is almost 80 now. \nFor men, it's getting close to 75. That's a big increase from must a \nfew decades ago when we passed Social Security and the earnings limit.\n  Now, many seniors want, and need, to work for income after they \nofficially retire. Social Security and pensions sometimes aren't \nenough, and if seniors want to feather their nests with a salary, more \npower to them.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill. Not only will seniors \nthank us, we can take heart in knowing that the Congressional Budget \nOffice tells us that we will even save $700 million in Social Security \nadministrative costs by repealing the earnings limit. There are 800 \nemployees at SSA who help administer the earnings limit. After this \nbill becomes law, they will be freed to perform other tasks for the \nSocial Security Administration.\n  We have the opportunity to do away with the earnings limit \naltogether, and I say ``the sooner the better.'' I can't think of one \ngood reason not to pass this bill immediately, and get it down to the \nWhite House as soon as possible. It's good policy, it's good politics \nand it's the right thing to do for our seniors and our country.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today, the Senate is making an important \nreform in Social Security which will benefit hundreds of thousands of \nsenior citizens each year. Because of the action we are taking today, \nthose between the ages of 65 and 69 who continue to work will no longer \nhave a portion of their Social Security benefits withheld. The \n``earnings test'' in current law reduces the Social Security benefits \nof those in the 65 to 69 age group by $1 for every $3 they earn \nannually over $17,000. It affects nearly eight hundred thousand men and \nwomen each year. It unfairly denies them a portion of the Social \nSecurity benefits which they have earned by a lifetime of hard work. \nOnce this bill is signed into law, these seniors will receive the full \nbenefits to which they are entitled whether or not they choose to \nremain in the workforce after age 65. President Clinton has urged \nCongress to repeal the earnings limit, and he will sign the bill as \nsoon as it reaches his desk. Repeal of the earnings limit is the right \nthing for us to do, and now is the time for us to do it.\n  The concept of an earnings limit goes back to the Depression era when \nSocial Security was first enacted. At that time, unemployment was high \nand it was hoped that the creation of Social Security would encourage \nolder workers to retire and create openings for younger men and women \nwho desperately needed jobs. The employment picture today is \ndramatically different. We face a shortage of skilled workers and our \neconomy can benefit from the continued participation of older workers \nin the workforce. Their experience and sound judgment is a national \nresource. Men and women in their late sixties are healthier than in \ngenerations past and the majority of jobs no longer involve physical \nexertion. Those who choose to work beyond age 65 should not have \nfinancial barriers erected in their paths. The earnings limit in \ncurrent law is such a barrier and it should be removed without further \ndelay.\n  The most important aspect of repealing the earnings limit is that it \nwill increase the freedom of senior citizens to work or retire as they \nchoose. When to retire is an intensely personal decision--influenced by \nthe individual's health, the financial needs of their family, their \ncareer interests, and the nature of the work that is available to them. \nThe rules of Social Security should not restrict a senior's range of \nchoice. Those who decide to continue working after age 65 and those who \ndecide to retire should be treated equitably. Both groups should be \neligible to receive the full Social Security benefits they have earned.\n  In 1996, I was pleased to join with my Senate colleagues in voting to \nraise the earnings limit gradually over the succeeding five years. \nBecause of that amendment, the financial burden on thousands of senior \ncitizens has already been reduced. With enactment of this legislation, \nwhich I wholeheartedly support, the burden of the earnings limit will \nbe completely eliminated, so that all seniors receive full Social \nSecurity benefits, whether or not they remain in the workforce after \nage 65. They have earned it.\n\n[[Page S1497]]\n\n  Several of my colleagues have used this legislation as an opportunity \nto voice their perspective on the future of Social Security, and they \nhave painted a bleak picture. I strongly disagree with their \ncharacterizations.\n  Social Security is fundamentally sound. It has sufficient resources \nto fully fund current benefits for 35 years. Due to the gradual aging \nof the American population, Social Security will begin to experience a \nrevenue shortfall after 2035. However, if we plan for the future by \naddressing this problem in the near term, that revenue shortfall can be \neliminated with relatively minor adjustments to the system. The benefit \nexpectations of future recipients can be preserved, and the solvency of \nSocial Security insured for future generations.\n  We need to preserve the program as an inflation adjusted guaranteed \nbenefit for those who depend on it to pay for the basic necessities of \nlife. For two-thirds of America's senior citizens, Social Security \nretirement benefits provide more than half their annual income. For 42 \npercent of them, it constitutes more than three-quarters of their \nincome. Social Security enables millions of elderly to spend their \nretirement years in security and dignity. Without Social Security, half \nthe nation's elderly would be living in poverty. Converting a portion \nof Social Security into private investment accounts, as some have \nsuggested, would be much too risky for elderly men and women who have \nno other source of financial security.\n  The major proposals which would direct a portion of each worker's \npayroll taxes into private accounts would all reduce the level of \nguaranteed Social Security benefits substantially. Whether or not a \nretiree made up those lost dollars would depend on factors largely \nbeyond his or her control. Workers who reach retirement age during an \neconomic downturn cannot simply delay their retirement indefinitely \nuntil the market goes up. Private accounts, subject to the ups and \ndowns of the stock market, are fine as a supplement to Social Security. \nBut, they are no substitute for Social Security.\n  President Clinton's budget proposal would use the debt service \nsavings which will result from paying down the national debt over the \nnext fifteen years to extend the life of the Social Security Trust \nFund. Since the current Social Security surplus is being used to pay \ndown the debt, it is appropriate for the Social Security Trust Fund to \nreceive the resulting savings. More than half of the projected \nshortfall in the Trust Fund over the next 75 years could be eliminated \nby adopting this policy. If we dedicated all of the savings in debt \nservice costs to the Social Security Trust Fund, the solvency of the \nsystem would be extended to beyond 2050, fully providing for the \nretirement of the baby boom generation.\n  We need to address the long term financial problems of Social \nSecurity in a way which keeps faith with the historic mission of the \nprogram--to provide senior citizens with a guaranteed, inflation \nadjusted benefit which will enable them to live in security and \ndignity.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support the Senior Citizens Freedom to \nWork Act. Repeal of the earnings limit will enable those who remain in \nthe workforce beyond age 65 to receive the full Social Security \nbenefits they have earned. It will greatly help these working seniors \nand it will strengthen our overall economy. It is the right thing to \ndo.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to support elimination of \nthe Social Security earnings test for individuals who have attained \nSocial Security retirement age--currently age 65. Currently, if these \nretirees work, their Social Security benefits are reduced $1 for every \n$3 of earnings above $17,000 per year. This is an unfair result for \nmany older Americans who are receiving Social Security benefits after a \nlifetime of work but who must continue to work to supplement their \nretirement income. In my own state of Vermont, many people work beyond \nage 65. They should not have to give up a portion of their hard-earned \nSocial Security benefit because they need to take a job.\n  The earnings test can also be a problem for employers. Older workers \nare often in demand by employers because of their expertise and an \noverall tight labor market. The reduction in Social Security benefits \ncan be a barrier to older workers reentering the workforce.\n  The earnings test presents a special problem for small business \nowners receiving Social Security benefits. Small business owners are \nsubject to both the dollar earnings test and a self-employment test \nthat can involve an extensive audit to establish their level of \nearnings. Eliminating the earnings test will also eliminate the need \nfor these audits. And removing the incentive for older small business \nowners to retire could mean continued employment opportunities in their \nbusinesses for other older workers.\n  There has been an earnings test for Social Security benefits since \nthe Social Security Act was passed in 1935, during the Great \nDepression. The earnings test originally was a way to encourage older \nworkers to retire, to free up jobs for younger workers.\n  The earnings test has always been unpopular, especially with those \nage 65 and older. In response, Congress has changed the earnings test \nprovisions several times over the years--increasing the amount a \nbenefit recipient can earn without a benefit reduction. The earnings \nlimit for those age 65 and older currently is $17,000 and rises to \n$25,000 in 2001 and to $30,000 beginning in 2002. It provides a higher \nearnings limit and smaller reduction for older benefit recipients--$1 \nfor each $3 of annual earnings over $17,000 for those age 65-69, \ncompared to $1 for each $2 of earnings over $10,080 for those age 62-\n64--and lowering the age at which an individual can work without \nsuffering a benefit reduction to age 70 from age 72. It is time now to \nfurther lower that age to the Social Security retirement age, so that \nonce a worker reaches that age--currently 65--the worker's Social \nSecurity benefit will not be reduced, no matter how much the worker \nearns.\n  We have before us legislation to eliminate the earnings test for \nindividuals at Social Security retirement age. I have cosponsored \nSenator Ashcroft's bill, S. 2074, and we have the House-passed bill, \nH.R. 5. These bills would free the approximately 800,000 Social \nSecurity benefit recipients currently ages 65 through 69 from the \ncurrent law that reduces, and in some cases eliminates, their Social \nSecurity benefits if they work and earn above the earnings test. I urge \nmy colleagues to act quickly to make this legislative change for older \nworking Americans.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, this morning I spoke in morning business \non the repeal of the Social Security Earnings Limit, an onerous tax \nburden on seniors who want to continue working. This afternoon, while \nwe are discussing the bill, I would like to re-emphasize my support for \nrepealing this unfair test.\n  Earnings test is a misguided and outdated relic of the Great \nDepression--when jobs were scarce, unemployment high, and people did \nnot live as long and healthy lives as they do today.\n  By limiting the amount a person 65-69 can earn, it provides a \ndisincentive for seniors to work. For every dollar a senior aged 65-69 \nearns over $17,000, the government reduces benefits by $1 for each $3 \nof earnings.\n  This test penalizes 1.2 million working seniors nationwide, and \n17,523 working seniors in Missouri suffer. The actual number of seniors \naffected is far greater, though, as millions of seniors choose not to \nwork, or limit their earnings because of the penalty.\n  The effect of this test is to keep seniors out of the workforce, and \nit has serious consequences. More workers create more jobs, not fewer \njobs. With our current unemployment rate of 4 percent--we need skilled \nand experienced workers.\n  Unfortunately, the earnings limit keeps too many qualified, \nexperienced seniors out of the workforce. Seniors have the skills, \nintegrity, work ethic, and experience that make them highly valuable \nmembers of the workforce. Their continuing contributions are crucial. \nThe only limit to what they have to offer is the earnings limit.\n  Recently, I spent some time with constituents in Missouri, and found \nmany seniors in my home State of Missouri are harmed by the earnings \ntest. Beverly Paxton from Belton, who works with ``Green Thumb'' to \nfind jobs for seniors, told me that hundreds of seniors would be eager \nto work without the earnings test. Furthermore,\n\n[[Page S1498]]\n\nsome don't try to work for fear that the Social Security Administration \nmight take their benefits away. Seniors don't want to visit a CPA to \nfind out if they will lose benefits.\n  In addition, many more seniors limit their hours to avoid the test. A \nmanufacturer in Belton told me that some seniors work until they reach \neligibility, then tell the employer: ``I won't be here next week, I'll \nsee you next January.'' This leaves employers in the lurch, having to \nabsorb training costs or heavy overtime costs. These decisions based on \nthe earnings test impose productivity costs on the economy.\n  Even when seniors work around the test, they suffer unexpected costs. \nC.D. Clark, from Florissant, Missouri, and who has since moved to \nKentucky, had earned $25,000 before trying to limit earnings to protect \nhimself from the test. This year, he planned to only work 8 months so \nthat his Social Security benefits would not be cut.\n  The Social Security Administration, however, assumed he would earn \nthe same amount, and withheld his Social Security checks from January \nthrough March of this year. When Mr. Clark complained to the SSA that \nhe had not yet earned $17,000, he was told, ``We like to get our money \nup front.''\n  I recently received a letter from Lois Murphy of St. Louis, who is \n65, and works part time as an RN in the operating room at St. John's \nMercy Medical Center. The hospital suffers from a labor shortage, and \nneeds help from women like Mrs. Murphy, who are experienced and willing \nto work. But she limits her hours because of the earnings limit, taking \na skilled, experienced--and needed--worker out of the hospital.\n  In her letter, Mrs. Murphy wrote: ``The $17,000 limit a person could \nearn plus the small Social Security check is not enough to live \ncomfortably and enjoy your senior years.'' Mrs. Murphy neatly \nsummarized this issue in one simple sentence: ``I think if a senior \ncitizen at age 65 is willing to work, they should be able to earn a lot \nmore or not have a limit.'' I believe that Mrs. Murphy is right. \nSeniors should have the freedom to earn if they choose. But the problem \nis that they don't have that choice. We must send the earnings test \ninto retirement.\n  I have been working on this since I came to the Senate. In 1995, I \nvoted to substantially increase the limit. In 1997, I called for the \nelimination of the test and cosponsored legislation that would get rid \nof it. This year, I have introduced legislation that would eliminate \nthe test. My bipartisan legislation has 43 cosponsors, including the \nentire majority leadership.\n  Organizations that support me on this include: Green Thumb, 60+, the \nSeniors Coalition, National Association of Home Builders, National \nTaxpayers Union, the U.S. Air Force Sergeants Association, \nCapitolWatch, Americans for Tax Reform, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, \nthe National Tax Limitation Committee, and the United Seniors \nAssociation.\n  It is time to eliminate this counterproductive and unfair penalty. \nThe House has already acted. The President is prepared to sign this. \nThanks to the hard work of Chairman Roth, who is managing this bill, \nthe Senate is now ready to pass the earnings test repeal as well. I \nurge my colleagues to join us in support of this measure, and grant \nseniors the opportunity to earn freely in their golden years.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Social \nSecurity Earnings Test Elimination Act of 2000, which I have \ncosponsored.\n  The earnings limit is the amount of money a Social Security recipient \ncan earn without having a portion of his or her benefits deferred. \nCurrently, that limit is $17,000 per year for retirees between the ages \nof 65 and 69. For every $3 in earnings above that limit, these seniors \nhave $1 in benefits deferred.\n  I believe that this is grossly unfair. Last year, my colleague from \nIowa, Senator Grassley, and I proposed lifting the Social Security \nearnings test on retirees between the ages of 65 and 69. We did not \npropose outright elimination because we did not think, at that time, \nthat the surplus would be large enough to sustain elimination. Now, a \nyear later--and thanks to our continued economic boom--I believe it is \npossible to eliminate the earnings test outright, and still adhere to a \nresponsible and fiscally sound budget.\n  Over 1 million seniors nationwide face this earnings test. My own \nstate, California, has more seniors affected by the earnings test than \nany other state: 161,000, according to the Bureau of the Census.\n  For these 161,000 Californians--and hundreds of thousands of others \nall across this country--this legislation represents an important step \nin removing the unfair burden that the earnings test places on them \nsimply because they wish to continue working. As President Clinton said \nin his February 29 letter to House leaders:\n\n       We should reward every American who wants to and can stay \n     active and productive.\n\n  For example, a letter I received from the American Health  Care \nAssociation holds:\n\n       The nursing facilities we represent make a concerted effort \n     to employ senior citizens to care for their peers. They're \n     reliable and honest workers, who have compassion for those in \n     their care. We have had difficulty hiring or retaining these \n     employees because of the threat of losing Social Security \n     benefits after their annual earnings have passed $17,000.\n\n  Elimination of the earnings test is important not just to those \nretirees who want to continue to work, but to those who need to \ncontinue to work and who are currently faced with an Hobson's choice: \nContinue to work and have Social Security benefits reduced, or stop \nworking and rely only on Social Security for retirement security. For \nall too many of these retirees--over half of those helped by this \nlegislation have incomes under $45,000 per year, including Social \nSecurity--both of these choices leave them financially squeezed. For \nwomen, who are twice as likely as men to retire in poverty, this is an \nespecially important issue.\n  This legislation offers a third choice: Continue to work and continue \nto receive those Social Security benefits.\n  Moreover, I believe that elimination of the Social Security earnings \ntest is warranted because the original logic of the earnings test no \nlonger holds. Congress imposed the earnings test to provide a \n``disincentive'' to older workers to continue to work, so as to make \nroom for younger workers during the Great Depression. In our new, \ntwenty-first century economy, unemployment is at historic lows and \nfirms are nearly desperate for workers.\n  I do not believe that passage of this legislation will address many \nlong-term problems regarding the solvency of the Social Security \nsystem. We have much work remaining on that score. But for the hundreds \nof thousands of seniors who either need or want to continue to work \npast age 65, this legislation represents an important step in creating \na fairer and more secure retirement. I urge my colleagues to support \npassage of the Social Security Earnings Test Elimination Act of 2000.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, as a cosponsor of this \nimportant legislation, I believe the time has come for us to put an end \nto the Social Security earnings test.\n  Our seniors have worked hard to build a life for their families and \nhave given up a great deal to provide a future for all of us. They have \nmade sacrifices far beyond what has been required of most of us.\n  And yet, many in Washington and in the White House have sought to \nreward seniors by snatching more and more of their hard-earned dollars.\n  Unfortunately, staying in the work force is often not a choice, but a \nnecessity. Many seniors are forced to work either for survival or \nbecause they must supplement their meager monthly Social Security \ncheck.\n  Seniors should not be punished for simply trying to make it to the \nend of the month.\n  This bill represents the first step in reversing many of the punitive \ntaxes we have levied on both seniors and working families across \nAmerica.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote in favor of this monumental legislation.\n  Every year, about 800,000 seniors suffer the affects of the Social \nSecurity earnings test--many of whom can barely afford the month's rent \nor proper meals.\n  Under the current law, recipients of Social Security between the ages \nof 65 and 69 can only earn up to $17,000 without penalty.\n  However, any income in excess of $17,000 would have the Federal \nGovernment taking $1 for every $3 they earn.\n  This means that the Federal Government is imposing a marginal tax \nrate\n\n[[Page S1499]]\n\nof 33 percent on the poorest segment of our society. But it does not \nstop there.\n  Andrew Quinlan, executive director of Capital Watch correctly states:\n\n       To further add insult to injury, workers must also pay a \n     host of taxes on the original dollar, which may raise their \n     marginal income tax rate to greater than that of sports stars \n     and Wall Street high rollers.\n\n  Sandra Butler, president of United Seniors Association echoes that \nthought:\n\n       The punitive nature of the Earnings Limit is obvious; By \n     itself, the Earnings Limit imposes a 33 percent marginal tax \n     rate on seniors.\n\n  Ms. Butler continues:\n\n       In combination with federal income and payroll taxes, the \n     Earnings Limit forces seniors to pay higher marginal tax \n     rates than millionaires. This is unconscionable.\n\n  I must agree. Some seniors could be looking at a marginal tax rate of \n59 percent. This tax is unconscionable. But as Machiavellian as that \nmay sound, it gets worse for seniors who are forced or choose to retire \nearly.\n  Seniors who retire between the ages of 62-65 have $1 for every $2 \nthey earn in excess of $10,080 confiscated from their check. \nTranslation: Uncle Sam is taking half of every dollar earned from those \nwho can least afford it.\n  Established during the depression of the 1930's, the earnings test \nwas meant to discourage older workers from re-entering the labor force \nand taking jobs from younger workers.\n  However, with the extremely tight labor pool available to employers \ntoday, it makes sense to access the experienced, productive, and \nvaluable work force seniors represent.\n  Gerald Howard, senior vice president with the National Association of \nHome Builders agrees.\n  He says:\n\n       Because the skills of decades ago are no longer taught in \n     current education and training programs, home builders \n     recognize the special need to keep and utilize the unique \n     talents of retirees.\n       For our nation's home builders, retaining skilled retirees \n     is important in meeting our workforce needs.\n\n  According to the Department of Labor, 240,000 new workers must be \nrecruited and trained each year to meet the Nation's growing demands in \nthe building industry alone. However, these requirements are not being \nmet.\n  And it is not limited to the building industry. All sectors are \nfeeling the pinch.\n  Dr. Charles Roadman, president and CEO of American Health Care \nAssociation has urged the President and the Vice President to ``take \nbold action to ease the shortage of skilled nursing professionals that \nhas reached epidemic levels'' by supporting the Congress in their \neffort to eliminate the earning penalty.\n  If we wish to continue growing the economy, we must free up those \nwith the experience and know-how to meet countries employment needs--\nour seniors.\n  Unfortunately, the Social Security earnings test serves as a \ndisincentive for those who may wish to work. This disincentive effect \nis magnified when viewed on an after-tax basis.\n  Senior citizens who work stand to lose a substantial percentage of \ntheir Social Security benefits due to the Social Security earnings \ntest.\n  In addition to the earning test tax, they must also continue to pay \nSocial Security taxes, and, most likely, other Federal and State income \ntaxes as well.\n  The Social Security earnings test forces senior citizens to avoid \nwork, seek lower paying work, or get wages ``under the table,'' turning \nhonest folks who are just trying to get by into common criminals.\n  The Social Security earnings test is unfair and inappropriate. It \nimposes a form of ``means test'' on retirement benefits.\n  Social Security benefits have been earned by a lifetime of \ncontributions to the program. American workers have been led to regard \nSocial Security as a government-run savings plan.\n  Indeed, their acceptance of the near 15-percent Social Security \npayroll tax has been predicated on the belief that they will get their \nmoney back at retirement.\n  Thus, most Americans do not accept the rationale that the return of \ntheir money should be decreased just because they continue to work.\n  Additionally, the Social Security earnings test discriminates against \nsenior citizens who must work in order to supplement their benefits.\n  Clearly, the Social Security earnings test is inequitable to our \nNation's senior citizens who are in the greatest need of extra income.\n  In addition to being complicated and difficult for folks to \nunderstand, the Social Security earnings test is complex and costly for \nthe Government to administer.\n  For example, the test is responsible for more than one-half of \nretirement and survivor program overpayments.\n  Elimination of the earnings test would help minimize administration \nexpenses, and recipients would be less confused and less tempted to \ncheat on reporting their earnings.\n  Finally, repealing the Social Security earnings test would greatly \naid our country's economy. Our senior would be likely to work more and \nthe American economy would benefit from their experience and skills.\n  The combined increase in the amounts that they would pay in Social \nSecurity and other taxes, as well as the additional contribution to our \ngross domestic product, would largely offset the increase in benefit \npayments.\n  For decades, our senior citizens have worked and dutifully. They have \npaid their share into the Social Security retirement account and it is \nonly fair that they receive their Social Security benefits in full when \nthey retire.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in passing this legislation.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 5, the \nSenior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act. This bill, which unanimously \npassed the House of Representatives on March 1, would end the practice \nof withholding a portion of Social Security benefits simply because a \nbeneficiary chooses to work beyond the statutory retirement age.\n  The Social Security earnings test has always been one of the most \nillogical aspects of the Social Security system. Under current law, a \nbeneficiary between the ages of 65 and 69 may only earn up to $17,000 \nwithout losing benefits. After that amount, $1 of Social Security \nbenefit is lost for every $3 of earnings.\n  Throughout my tenure in Congress, I have supported efforts to \nminimize the effect of the earnings test. For example, in 1998, I \nsupported the Taxpayer Relief Act which would have raised the level of \nexempt income to $39,750 in 2008. Unfortunately, the 105th Congress \nadjourned before the Senate could consider this legislation. While \nraising the earnings limit would have been a step in the right \ndirection, a total elimination of the earning test is clearly the right \nthing to do.\n  The Social Security Administration estimates that 800,000 \nbeneficiaries are affected by the earnings test. People spend a \nlifetime putting that money into their Social Security accounts and \nthey ought to have full access to it without limiting their other \nopportunities for making an income. The present system is holding them \ndown, it is holding the economy down, and it should be changed. It is \nwrong to withhold any portion of a benefit that was duly earned by \nyears of work and contributions to the system. Social Security was not \nmeant as a single source of retirement income. Why then does the \ngovernment penalize those seniors who choose to earn additional income \nthrough work? This is especially confusing in a time of low \nunemployment when companies are desperately looking for skilled and \nexperienced employees. Government should encourage self-sufficiency, \nnot penalize it.\n  I am pleased that H.R. 5 will be brought to a vote shortly. I am a \ncosponsor of a similar bill introduced by Senator Ashcroft. These bills \nwould completely eliminate the earnings test for Social Security \nrecipients who have reached retirement age, allowing them to earn \noutside income without a reduction in benefits. What we have now is a \ndisincentive for people to work who want to continue to contribute to \nour growing economy. Any meaningful reform of Social Security should \npreserve the system and allow those who want to work to continue to do \nso. This measure is the right thing to do and is long overdue.\n  I congratulate the House of Representatives on its unanimous passage \nof this bill and am encouraged that President Clinton has voiced his \nsupport for the bill. I would also like to thank Senator Ashcroft for \nhis leadership on this issue. I urge my colleagues\n\n[[Page S1500]]\n\nto join me in passing this bill and restoring a measure of fairness for \nsenior citizens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, in 1991, I spent one of my monthly workdays at a Winn-\nDixie grocery store in Santa Rosa County, FL. I worked as a bagger \nstanding at the end of the checkout line putting the groceries of the \ncustomers of that store into a paper or plastic bag they had selected \nand then taking it out to their car.\n  The man I worked with throughout that day was Jim Young. Jim has a \nhistory that is typical of many retired Americans. He had worked both \nin a military and a civilian capacity. He had looked forward to his \nretirement time in a place of paradise and came to a place where he \nthought he could find paradise. Unfortunately, Jim had a few \ndifficulties that had the effect of necessitating he seek employment in \norder to supplement his retirement income. It was then that he \nencountered the restrictions on earnings after retirement and the \nimpact that this was about to have on his Social Security. Jim, \ntherefore, had to go through an elaborate process of adjusting his work \nschedule so as to minimize the adverse effect of the earnings limit on \nhis total income and to be able to fashion his way through what he \nfound to be an inexplicable restriction on his capacity to work, make a \ncontribution, and supplement his income.\n  It was that experience with Jim as much as anything that caused me to \nbe interested in the issues before us today. I am pleased to have \nplayed a role in the 1996 action which was described by our colleague \nfrom Kentucky, which substantially raised the cap on earnings to its \ncurrent $17,000 and gave significant relief to people such as Jim \nYoung.\n  Today, we are finishing the job. With the passage of this \nlegislation, we will eliminate any earnings restraint on Social \nSecurity retirement income. We will no longer be shackled by a 1930s \nconcept that we have to discourage older workers from continuing their \nproductive lives in order to open up positions for younger workers. If \nthere ever was a time in our Nation's history where that concept has \nbeen rendered an anachronism, it is at the beginning of the 21st \ncentury. We need the productive talent of Americans such as Jim Young. \nWe need to encourage people to think they will be able to extend their \nperiod of working and contributing to our Nation's economy as long as \nit is in their interest to do so, and not by applying arbitrary \nrestraints to their earnings in the form of a penalty against their \nSocial Security income.\n  I will be very pleased tomorrow when we vote on what I anticipate \nwill be an overwhelming majority in favor of eliminating this 1930s \ndinosaur which still occupies too big a space in the living room of \nSocial Security.\n  I wish to use this opportunity to talk about another dinosaur that is \noccupying too much space. That is the dinosaur of an excessive focus on \nSocial Security as we think about the retirement lives of older \nAmericans. In fact, Social Security is becoming a declining portion of \nthe total revenue of retired Americans, and will continue to decline as \na portion of their income for the foreseeable future.\n  Retirement in America is today based on a three-legged stool. Those \nthree legs are employer-sponsored retirement plans, individual savings, \nand Social Security.\n  I believe, rather than talking about the issue of Social Security \nreform, what we should be talking about is the issue of retirement \nsecurity reform so we can focus on all of the relevant components of \nthe retirement package upon which most Americans rely. We need to add a \nfourth component to this discussion; that is, a much more intense \neffort at encouraging Americans to plan for their retirement.\n\n  It has been said--and not only in jest--that most Americans spend \nmore time planning a 2-week summer vacation than they do the 15, or 25, \nor more years they will live in retirement. That may have been a \npractice that was acceptable when retirement was not as complex as it \nis today, when retirement did not involve as much self-responsibility \nas it does today, when retirement did not include as many facets, from \nlong-term care to providing for your physical health and well-being.\n  I believe these four components--employer-sponsored retirement plan \nreform, encouragement of individual savings, strengthening Social \nSecurity, and the promotion of preretirement planning--are the basis of \nan American national effort at enhanced retirement security. The goal \nof that enhanced retirement security should be to place all Americans \nin a position to be able to, with reasonable assurance, anticipate that \nthey will have in retirement a significant percentage of their \npreretirement income. Many have suggested that the appropriate goal \nwould be 75 percent of preretirement income as the reasonable \nattainable goal of America.\n  What do we need to do in order to reach a 75-percent goal? Soon I \nwill be introducing legislation that will encompass the subjects of \nemployer-sponsored retirement plans, individual savings, strengthening \nSocial Security, and the promotion of preretirement plans.\n  This afternoon, in the context of the elimination of one old attitude \nfrom our Social Security system; that is, the necessity to cap the \nearnings of retirees, I will lay out a few comments about the \nelimination of another old attitude, that the only thing we need to \nfocus on is Social Security reform. We need to focus on employer-\nsponsored retirement plans, particularly as they relate to small \nbusinesses.\n  In my State, in the last 5-plus years, we have added well over 1 \nmillion new jobs. Most of those new jobs have come from businesses that \nemploy less than 25 people. In fact, over 70 percent of the new jobs in \nAmerica are from small businesses with less than 25 employees. It is \nexactly those small businesses that are the least likely to have an \nemployer-sponsored retirement plan.\n  I believe--and so does Senator Grassley of Iowa, with whom I have \nworked closely on these matters--that the principal focus of our \nattention needs to be to encourage small businesses to provide pension \nbenefits for their employees. We introduced legislation to this end. \nThat legislation, styled as S. 741, contains the following components:\n  It expands coverage by providing incentives for small businesses to \nbegin offering pension coverage.\n  As an example, it will assist small businesses in paying some of the \nstartup costs in the establishment of a pension plan. It increases \nportability, making it easier for employees to move retirement money \nfrom one plan to another as they change jobs. We know today the average \nAmerican will work at seven jobs during the course of their working \nlifetime. They need to be able to carry their pension benefits from one \njob to the next.\n\n  S. 749 strengthens pension security and enforcement. It reduces red \ntape associated with pension plans and has its own encouragement for \nretirement education.\n  The second thing we need to do is to assist Americans with their \nretirement savings. Again, the focus is on Americans who work for \nsmaller businesses where most of the new jobs are being created, and \nAmericans who have not had a tradition of saving as part of their \nretirement security.\n  The President has proposed a program in which the Federal Government \nprovides matching contributions for lower and moderate-income families \nwho save for retirement. The structure of this utilizes existing \nsavings vehicles such as IRAs, or individual retirement accounts, and \n401(k)s. Rather than creating new government-run accounts, we utilize \nthe structure in which many Americans already have started the process \nof saving for retirement.\n  There would be economic incentives provided to lower income families \nto encourage their employers to offer these plans. Employers are \nfinding in this very tight job market that they need to provide \nincentives to retain their current workforce and attract new workers. \nIt is hoped by encouraging more employers to provide retirement savings \naccounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s that it will make it more attractive \nfor persons to work for those employers.\n  We are suggesting there should be some modifications of the current \nIRAs and 401(k)s, particularly in two areas. One, we propose to \nrestrict the ability to withdraw funds from the 401(k)s or IRAs. There \nare many important, legitimate, credible reasons why a person\n\n[[Page S1501]]\n\nwould want to withdraw money from their retirement accounts--to buy a \nnew home, finance education, or deal with an unexpected health \nemergency. However, if too many of those allowances for withdrawal are \nlegalized we could end up with many Americans having a hollowed-out \nretirement account. They have a retirement account in substance, but \nthe resources have been withdrawn for purposes earlier in their \nlifetime. We want to give the maximum assurance that if the Federal \nGovernment is going to be supplementing retirement accounts, the funds \nwill end up financing retirement.\n  We also propose to restrict the investment options in order to \nmaximize the fund safety. Retirement accounts are not intended to be \ncasinos. They are accounts with substantial emphasis on security and \npredictability so that people will have a sense of confidence in their \nretirement years.\n  The third element is Social Security, its solvency and safety. In my \nopinion, Social Security should be thought of as the safety net \nunderneath individual savings and employer-based pension systems. It is \nthe ultimate and final source of retirement security. For that reason, \nI believe Social Security should continue to be what it has been since \nits inception--a defined benefit plan. That is a plan in which \nAmericans will have a high degree of confidence as to what that check \nwill be every month from Social Security. Social Security is not the \nplace to be encouraging excessive speculation. There are other \nopportunities where people can engage in speculation if they wish to \nuse their retirement as a means of attempting to expand their net \nworth. I do not believe Social Security is the place to do so. Social \nSecurity provides 67 percent of America's single-person households with \none-half or more of their income; Social Security provides 44 percent \nof the multiperson households with one-half or more of their income.\n\n  However, Social Security is facing serious challenges. We are all \nfamiliar with the demographics. Over the next 20 or 30 years, the \nnumber of persons drawing Social Security will approximately double \nfrom its current 40 million. The 1999 Social Security trustees report \nstated that the Social Security program lacks the resources necessary \nto meet its contractual obligations over the next three generations. \nUsing the trustees' immediate forecast, Social Security revenue will \nfall short of the amount needed to fund existing committed benefits by \nas much as 15 percent.\n  I believe there are a number of reforms we need to make in the Social \nSecurity system in order to strengthen it and to assure that the \ncontract which exists between the Government of the United States of \nAmerica and the citizens of the United States of America can and will \nbe honored. One proposal which has been made by the President which I \nstrongly support is the concept that we ought to allocate a portion of \nthe non-Social Security surplus to help meet this pending shortfall in \nthe Social Security trust fund.\n  What is the justification for using non-Social Security surplus to \nstrengthen Social Security? Almost every Member of Congress has now \naccepted enthusiastically the principle that all of the Social Security \nsurplus should be used to pay down the national debt as a means of \nstrengthening our ability to meet our Social Security obligations. I \ncertainly join those strong supporters of that fiscally prudent \npractice and principle. It is estimated we will have approximately $2 \ntrillion of Social Security surplus over the next 15 to 20 years. If we \nmaintain our discipline and use those funds to pay down that portion of \nthe national debt which is held by the public, when fully reduced we \nwill find an annual interest savings--assuming interest rates are \napproximately what they are today--of about $120 billion a year that we \nwill not have to pay in interest because we have used that Social \nSecurity surplus to pay down the debt currently held by the public.\n  I believe all or a substantial portion of that $120 billion of \ninterest savings ought to go into the Social Security trust fund. It \nwas the Social Security trust fund and its surpluses, the additional \namount paid by working American men and women, which made it possible \nto use the Social Security to pay down the national debt. Why isn't it \njustified, why isn't it both legally and morally appropriate, to then \nhave a portion of those interest savings--I personally advocate all of \nthose interest savings--to then be used to strengthen the very Social \nSecurity system which has made that debt reduction possible?\n  The fourth component of a national program of retirement security is \nto promote greater preretirement planning. There is going to be much \ngreater individual responsibility for preparation for retirement for \nthis and future generations of Americans. They need to be encouraged \nand given the means by which to make intelligent decisions, intelligent \ndecisions occurring almost immediately as they enter the workforce so \nthey will be as well prepared as possible for their retirement \nyears. These decisions are going to be complex. They will require \nchanges in attitude, in lifestyle. They will particularly require a \ngreater focus on savings rather than consumption.\n\n  I believe, for instance, we should consider using the Social Security \nnotices, which are now going to be provided on an annual basis to all \nfuture Social Security recipients, as a window so Americans can see the \nkind of information they will need to make good choices on a whole \narray of issues that will affect their status in retirement, from \npurchasing long-term care insurance--which I hope we will soon make \nmore affordable by changes in the tax law--to steps they should take to \nassure their physical, emotional, and mental health in their retirement \nyears as well as decisions which affect their finances in retirement.\n  So these are the four components of a 21st century approach to \nAmericans in retirement. I look forward to soon returning to the Senate \nfloor to introduce this legislation and to speak on it in somewhat \ngreater detail. I encourage my colleagues to take an interest in this \nimportant subject, and I invite them to join me.\n  Again, I am enthusiastic about the action we are about to take in \nwhich we eliminate an anachronism from the 1930s which continues to be \npart of our Social Security system in the 21st century. I hope we will \nsoon be prepared to take strong action to deal with some of the old \nattitudes that retirement was only Social Security, an attitude which \nalso is an anachronism of the 1930s that continues to have too much \nsaliency in the 21st century.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the legislation \nbeing discussed today to be more fair to our senior citizens, to \nencourage them to work. I hope final passage will be voted on tomorrow.\n  I always like to follow the Senator from Florida because it gives me \nan opportunity to thank him for the cooperation he has given me in our \nwork on some of the other legs of the retirement income stool. We think \nof Social Security as one of those, another is savings, and the other \none is pensions. He and I have worked closely together in a bipartisan \nway to formulate pension legislation to encourage savings, to encourage \nemployers to have established pension systems, and particularly to \nencourage the self-employed and smaller corporations to set up pension \nsystems. So I thank him for that.\n  This legislation might not be considered part of the three-legged \nstool we always talk about of income security for retirement--Social \nSecurity, pensions, and private savings--but it is an opportunity for \npeople who want to work, to work without penalty. That obviously is a \nvery strong component, and heretofore there has been a disincentive to \nthat activity. This eliminates that disincentive.\n  If I could sum up, I see at least two perspectives to this \nlegislation.\n  One, as a matter of public policy in America, we should not have \ndisincentives to productivity. Obviously, when you earn over a certain \namount of money as a senior citizen drawing Social Security and you \nhave to pay back $1 out of every $3, that is a disincentive to work. We \nought to eliminate that disincentive.\n  A second factor is to judge people in American society on the basis \nof their competence and their merit and not on the basis of some \narbitrary age, based on a policy that was thought good for the 1930s. \nToday we would not think it was good even for the 1930s. It does not\n\n[[Page S1502]]\n\nconsider people's competence because the policy that was set up 65 \nyears ago was, when you got to be 65, you were shoved out into the \nstreet to make room for younger people to come into the workforce. That \nwas wrong.\n  The third thing about this legislation is the high rate of taxation. \nPeople who earn over this amount of money have to pay back $1 out of \nevery $3 they earn over a certain amount. That is a very high marginal \ntax rate, maybe the highest marginal tax rate of any American.\n  Consider, if you earn over $17,000, you pay back $1 out of every $3. \nConsider also that you are already reporting, if you are earning over a \ncertain income, 85 percent of your Social Security to be taxed a second \ntime. It was taxed when you earned it in your working years; then \nconsider that you pay income tax; then, last, you pay the same payroll \ntax everybody else pays. You can get such high marginal tax rates that \nit is almost a laugh to call it taxation. You should call it \nconfiscation. Confiscation of resources in our system of government is \nnot legitimate. It is a disincentive to productivity.\n  At a time in our Nation's history when we are experiencing \nunprecedented prosperity, we are also experiencing a shortage of \nexperienced labor. The national unemployment rate is 4.1 percent, the \nlowest level in 30 years. In my home State of Iowa, it is even lower. \nIowa's unemployment rate is 2.2 percent. The legislation we are \ndebating would help alleviate some of the skilled labor shortage by \nremoving a disincentive for older Americans to remain in the workforce \nif they, of their own free will, want to stay in the workforce.\n  The bill before us would eliminate the cap on earnings for Social \nSecurity beneficiaries between the ages of 65 and 69. Under current \nlaw, those beneficiaries have their benefits cut by $1 for every $3 \nthey earn over that $17,000. I have already referred to that.\n  This benefit cut applies, of course, only to earned income. An \nindividual could still have savings, or income from pensions, totaling \nany amount and continue to collect full Social Security benefits. The \ndifference between earned and so-called unearned income does not \ndetract from the injustice of the current Social Security and tax \npolicy. That is why this law must be repealed. It sends a wrong message \nthat productivity among our older citizens should be discouraged.\n  I would like to give some examples of people from whom I have heard \nin my own State who are hurt by this earnings limit.\n  A person by the name of Delaine Jones is working in Glenwood, IA. He \nis 65 years old. He understands he may live for another couple of \ndecades and may not always be able to work. He would like to earn as \nmuch as he can while he is able to, so he can financially prepare for a \nhigh quality of life later in his life.\n  Then we have Sherman and Nancy Sorem of Marshalltown, IA. They were \naffected by the earnings limit last year.\n  Sherman worked for 35 years for Fisher Controls, a major corporation \nin Marshalltown, IA. When that corporation downsized, he retired from \nhis position as office manager of the accounting department. However, \nbecause of his expertise, he was called back each year to help out and \nto advise and consult with the department.\n  Last year, Fisher Controls needed his expertise for a longer period \nof time than ever before. Unfortunately, Mr. Sorem could not continue \nworking because he would have worked long enough to earn above the \nearnings limit. He and Nancy were frustrated. He could not justify \nlosing his Social Security benefits by his continued work.\n  Ron Ballinger, a third person I have heard from, works for a \nfinancial processing company in Cedar Rapids, IA. He worked full time \nlast year and was interested in working part time this year. However, \nhe will have to officially retire in April because he will have earned \nup to the cap on earnings.\n  According to the Social Security Administration, almost 800,000 older \nAmericans nationwide have their benefits cut because of the earnings \nlimit. Mr. President, 800,000 people face the same issue as the three \nIowans to whom I have referred. Keep in mind, that statistic does not \nreveal anything about how many of our older citizens do not remain in \nor go back to the workforce at all because they cannot afford a cut in \nbenefits.\n  I have received letters and phone calls from all over Iowa and all \nover the country because in my position as chairman of the Senate Aging \nCommittee, they write to me about their concerns even though I am not \ntheir Senator. These letters and phone calls are from older people \ndiscouraged by the earnings limit.\n  Their hard-earned Social Security benefits are cut by $1 for every $3 \nthey earn. They see it as a tax on their continued productivity. I see \nit as unfair and, if I might say, even un-American. This very country \nof ours, particularly at this time of low unemployment, and \nparticularly when you consider the globalization of our economy, needs \nskilled labor, skilled workers, people who are skilled because of a \nlifetime of work in a certain profession.\n  What happens if we do not fill that skilled labor void? We lose \nproductivity. Then we lose our global competitive edge. Where can we \nlook for skilled labor? We have qualified people who want to work, our \nolder citizens. We cannot afford to lose their expertise and skills.\n  A letter I received from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce states:\n\n       American business is facing a severe worker shortage in \n     many sectors and areas of the country. Jobs are going \n     unfilled, especially those positions that require skilled \n     workers. By removing the disincentive to work, this \n     legislation allows seniors to apply their lifetime of \n     valuable knowledge and experience to the business world and \n     fill some of these positions.\n\n  Recognizing the need to encourage seniors to remain in the workforce \nis not a new idea. In fact, a report on Future Directions for Aging \nPolicy was published in May of 1980 by the House of Representatives \nSelect Committee on Aging, the Subcommittee on Human Services. At that \ntime, I happened to serve as ranking Republican on that subcommittee \nwhen I was a Member of the other body.\n  I would like to read from the Future Directions for Aging Policy from \n21 years ago. I refer to page 3 of the report summary:\n\n       At the base of such a service approach must lie an economic \n     strategy. We have sketched such an economic base in Appendix \n     5. It is designed to coalesce around work and income. \n     Tomorrow's seniors will want to work (trends toward early \n     retirement are already reversing according to a recent Lou \n     Harris poll), will be capable of working, and will need to \n     work.\n\n  I remind you, this was 20 years ago that Congress said this.\n\n       Inflation's effect on fixed incomes will see to that. \n     Public policy will have to create opportunities to work, both \n     by removing barriers of age discrimination and by stimulating \n     private sector employment of seniors. Moreover, income earned \n     will have to be preserved for much longer than ever before, \n     necessitating major reforms of America's pension systems.\n\n  That is something I have referred to that the Senator from Florida \nand I have been working on, as well.\n\n       Social Security and Supplemental Security Income, because \n     these are the backbone of our present economic strategy, will \n     probably have to be restructured in the future.\n\n  I think we have known for a long time that what we are finally about \nto do must be done. I am glad it is being done. The earnings test, \nenacted as part of the original Social Security Act passed in 1935, is \noutdated.\n  Sixty years ago, our country was in the midst of a depression. One in \nfive people eligible to work was unemployed. The original law meant to \ndiscourage older Americans who were eligible to collect benefits from \ntaking jobs younger people could fill. But that situation has changed--\nas unjustified as it was at the time--so our public policy today needs \nto be changed.\n  Because of my position as chairman of the Aging Committee, more \nacutely than others, I recognize the changing role of senior citizens \nin our society. This generation of older Americans has different \nresponsibilities than past generations. We have seen a sharp rise in \nthe number of grandparents who are raising their grandchildren. \nFurthermore, it is far more common for people to live into their \neighties and nineties. Some of these very old Americans depend on their \nchildren who are often in their sixties to help care for them and pay \nfor their at-home expenses, medical bills, groceries, and a host of \nother\n\n[[Page S1503]]\n\nexpenses. Eliminating the Social Security earnings limit will help \nraise the standard of living for these families.\n  While fixing this inequity in the retirement system will give fair \ntreatment to those ages 65 to 69 who have paid into the program during \ntheir working years, I do not stand here and say that it is going to \naddress Social Security's long-term demographic challenges.\n  When the baby boom generation comes on board, the revenue and benefit \nstructure will not be able to sustain the obligations under current \nlaw. That is why I have worked with six of my Senate colleagues--\nSenators Judd Gregg, Bob Kerrey, John Breaux, Fred Thompson, Craig \nThomas, and Chuck Robb--to craft bipartisan Senate reform legislation.\n  Our bill, the Bipartisan Social Security Act, which happens to be S. \n1383, is the only reform legislation which has been put forth in the \nSenate which would make the Social Security trust fund permanently \nsolvent--meaning, as you have to look out 75 years, under existing law, \nto project its solvency, our legislation has been declared to \naccomplish that by the General Accounting Office. In fact, it is the \nonly one before the Congress that does that.\n  I will continue to press ahead and work to build a consensus among \nour colleagues to save Social Security and achieve long-term solvency \nfor generations to come.\n  We, as a Congress, must recognize that even in this era of \nsurpluses--meaning budget surpluses--there are serious long-term \nfinancial problems facing Social Security. These problems do not go \naway because we have a surplus and a good economy. The longer we wait \nto address reform of Social Security, the more difficult the problems \nwill be to address, and the less time the baby boom generation will \nhave to prepare.\n  As a nation, we have an evolving definition of what it means to be \nold. Americans are living longer and in better health. The traditional \nretirement age comes too soon for older people who want to or need to \nwork past age 65. Some people want to retire; some people want to leave \nthe workforce. Obviously, this legislation does not affect that \ndecision of theirs. They can still do it. But if you want to \ncontribute, if you want to remain productive, if you want to be in the \nworkforce, by golly, through this legislation, we say we would love to \nhave you do that. We remove economic disincentives to your doing that \nthat are presently in the law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to address the body on the \nSocial Security Earnings Test Elimination Act.\n  This is a good time. We are finally going to do something good for \nAmerica's senior citizens. Americans should be free to work if they \nchoose. With passage of this bill, we will help elderly Americans stay \nin the workforce longer. It should be their choice, not the \nGovernment's coercion, that determines whether they stay in that \nworkforce a longer period of time.\n  They have spent a lifetime paying into the Social Security trust \nfund. It is simply not fair to deprive them of their Social Security \nbenefits simply because they choose to stay in the workforce longer or \nchoose to begin working again after retirement. That is common sense to \nme, and that is why this bill has so much appeal.\n  Particularly at a time when the cost of living is increasing, it is \nimportant to allow our seniors who choose to work or those who are \nforced to work because of rising prices to do so without being \npenalized.\n  I will talk about a particular individual in Kansas whom I had the \nprivilege of meeting a month ago. His name is Ron Frampton, from \nKingman, KS. He has farmed with his family most of his life. I met him \nwhen I was touring the Mize Manufacturing Company, a small manufacturer \nin Kingman, KS. Mr. Frampton came up to me as I was walking through the \nproduction line and asked me if we were going to eliminate the Social \nSecurity earnings test. I said I thought we were going to get the bill \nthrough. He said: Good; I need it.\n  Then he related to me his situation. He had worked on a family farm, \nwas born on the farm and worked there all his life. Then in the 1980s, \nwhen we had a hard financial downturn for agriculture, he got caught in \nthat downturn. His savings for his entire family were wrapped up in \nthis farm. That is where he plowed all of his income, all of his \nsavings, back into the farm. When the economy moved against him in the \n1980s, he lost the farm and, thus, a big part of his life, a big part \nof his family, a big part of his sense of being. He also lost his \nretirement security that he had outside of Social Security. His \nretirement savings were that farm.\n\n  Now he has to work. He doesn't have the savings on which he had \ncounted. He has to be able to work, and he needs the Social Security \nincome as well. This bill helps Ron Frampton and his family in Kingman, \nKS. It addresses that need. It says if he needs to work, he wants to \nwork, let him work, and don't penalize him for doing it.\n  This bill allows people older than 65 and younger than 70 to earn \nincome without losing their Social Security benefits. That is as it \nshould be. It is an important bipartisan measure that passed \noverwhelmingly in the House and, I expect, will pass overwhelmingly in \nthe Senate. It sends an important and positive signal to America's \nretired workers who have spent their lives working to make this country \nbetter. We need this for America's seniors.\n  I am delighted we are going to pass this bill for all the seniors in \nthe country but particularly for Mr. Frampton and for his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/21/senate-section/article/S1503-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon).

MOORE, UNITED STATES AIR FORCE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to recognize \nand say farewell to a Mississippi native and distinguished Air Force \nofficer, Major General William F. Moore, upon his retirement from the \nAir Force after more than thirty years of commissioned service. Major \nGeneral Moore has served with distinction, and it is my privilege to \nrecognize his many accomplishments and to commend him for the superb \nservice he has provided to the Air Force and the Nation.\n  Major General Moore graduated from the U.S. Air Force Academy and \nreceived his commission in 1969. Since then, Major General Moore's \nassignments have made untold contributions to national security. Upon \ngraduation from the Air Force Academy, General Moore served with the \nDrone and Remotely Piloted Vehicles System Program Office, Aeronautical \nSystems Division, at Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. In his next \nassignment, General Moore served in the Office of the Deputy Chief of \nStaff for Development Plans, Headquarters Air Force Systems Command, \nAndrews Air Force Base, Maryland. In 1976, General Moore was selected \nto attend and received a Master's Degree in Business Administration \nfrom the Air Force Institute of Technology, Wharton School of Finance \nand Commerce, University of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia.\n  General Moore's next assignments were as Executive Office and Project \nOfficer with the Peacekeeper ICBM Engineering Directorate, Ballistic \nMissile\n\n[[Page S1504]]\n\nOffice at Norton Air Force Base, California, and as Director of Program \nControl, Joint System Program Office for the Advanced Medium Range Air-\nto-Air Missile, at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. In 1985 General Moore \nwas selected for the prestigious Air War College at Maxwell Air Force \nBase, Alabama. Following completion of the Air War College, General \nMoore was the Director of Cost, Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for \nComptroller, Headquarters Air Force Systems Command, Andrews Air Force \nBase, Maryland, and then the Small ICBM Deputy Program Director at \nNorton Air Force Base.\n  In 1989 General Moore attended the Program Manager's Course at the \nDefense Systems Management College, Fort Belvoir, Virginia. General \nMoore then returned to the Small ICBM Program as the Program Director. \nHe then served as the Deputy Director of Strategic, Special Operation \nForces and Airlift Programs, Office of the Assistant Secretary of the \nAir Force for Acquisition, the Pentagon, Washington, D.C. In 1992, \nGeneral Moore was assigned as the Vice Commander of the San Antonio Air \nLogistics Center. In 1993 General Moore was promoted to Brigadier \nGeneral.\n  In 1994, General Moore served as the Program Executive Officer for \nBombers, Missiles and Trainers, Office of the Assistant Secretary of \nthe Air Force for Acquisition, the Pentagon, Washington, D.C. In 1995, \nGeneral Moore became the Director of Special Programs in the Office of \nthe Secretary of Defense. In this capacity, he was responsible for \ncoordinating the planning, budgeting, and management of extremely \nsensitive Department of Defense special access classified programs. In \n1997, General Moore received his second star, in 1998, was assigned as \nthe Deputy Director for the newly formed Defense Threat Reduction \nAgency (DTRA). As the Deputy Director of DTRA, General Moore held and \nexcelled in one of the most complex and challenging assignments in the \nDepartment of Defense--the creation of DTRA. DTRA was created, in the \nwords of the Secretary of Defense: ``to fill a major void in the \ndefense of the nation against weapons of mass destruction''. \nEstablished by a Defense Reform Initiative in November 1997, General \nMoore led the successful accomplishment of a vital and monumental \nstrategic task--consolidation into one organization the bulk of DoD's \narms control, cooperative threat reduction, and technology security \nregimes, as well as weapons of mass destruction (WMD) related research \ndevelopment test and evaluation (RDT) programs. DTRA also coordinates \nand prioritizes Chemical/Biological programs for the Joint Staff, and \nprovides an integrated national architecture for response to WMD \nthreats to civil and military populations; and is a full partner with \nthe Departments of Energy, Justice and State to provide national \ndeterrence for WMD.\n  General Moore is a fully certified acquisition professional whose \nawards include two Defense Distinguished Service Medals, the legion of \nMerit with oak leaf cluster, the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, the \nAir Force Commendation Medal with two oak leaf clusters, the National \nDefense Service Medal with service star, the Armed Forces Expeditionary \nMedal, and the Vietnam Service Medal.\n  During his long and distinguished career, General Moore served the \nnation with excellence and distinction.

Mr. President, last week the Senate acted resoundingly and \npassed the critically needed conference report for funding the Federal \nAviation Administration (FAA). I commend the efforts of our majority \nleader, Senator Lott, the Appropriations Committee chairman, Senator \nStevens, and Budget Committee chairman, Senator Domenici. My colleagues \nhere and over in the House have worked hard to arrive at this \nconsensus. Both as a Senator and frequent flyer, I appreciate their \nefforts.\n  At this time, I would like to reiterate several points I made during \nlast year's debate in the Senate having to do with allowing exemptions \nto the current perimeter rule at Ronald Reagan Washington National \nAirport. I believe that the conference report balances the interests of \nstates inside the perimeter with those of us from Western States who \nlack convenient access to Reagan National.\n  I know my colleagues are aware of my support for efforts to ensure \nthat these limited exemptions must benefit citizens throughout the \nWest. I believe we must make it clear that these limited number of \nexemptions should not be awarded solely or disproportionately to one \ncarrier. I fully anticipate that the Department of Transportation will \nensure that the maximum number of cities benefit from these slots.\n  While I would have preferred to eliminate the perimeter rule \naltogether, which I believe would have substantially improved access to \nthe West, I am hopeful that DOT will ensure that small and midsized \ncommunities in West, especially in the Northern tier, have improved \naccess through hubs like Salt Lake City.\n  I believe an important component of aviation reform is to improve air \nservice for communities that have not experienced the benefits of \nderegulation to the extent large markets have. Today, Utahns must \ndouble or even triple connect to fly into Reagan National. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues and the DOT to ensure that \ncitizens in the west have improved access and a variety of options when \nthey travel.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/21/senate-section/article/S1504-3", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1504-S1505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        LEVEL III DIRECT ACCESS\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I would like to clarify an important \nissue contained in the conference agreement on S. 376, the satellite \nreform bill, with respect to ``Level III direct access.''\n  The conference agreement provides authority for so-called ``Level III \ndirect access''--which is the ability of customers other than INTELSAT \nsignatories to enter into agreements with INTELSAT for ordering, \nreceiving and paying for space segment capacity--but it says nothing \nabout the signatory fee that COMSAT is entitled to receive from direct \naccess users as determined by the FCC's direct access order made \neffective December 6, 1999. I understand it is the intent of the \nconferees to preserve this signatory fee to compensate COMSAT for the \ncosts it incurs as the U.S. signatory to INTELSAT during its brief \ntransition to a procompetitive privatization.\n  Nothing in the conference agreement is intended to vacate the FCC's \n``Level III direct access'' order made effective December 6, 1999, \nincluding its assessment of a signatory fee to be charged\n\n[[Page S1505]]\n\nto direct access users to offset COMSAT's signatory costs. I would also \nadd that Congress is addressing direct access to INTELSAT before it \nprivatizes. After privatization, when INTELSAT become a commercial \ncompany like any other, it can make whatever business decisions it \nwants with respect to marketing or distribution arrangements--again, \njust as other companies do. Once privatized, the government should not \nbe interfering, let alone dictating, these arrangements one way or \nanother.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/21/senate-section/article/S1505-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         EDUCATING OUR CHILDREN\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an issue of \nparamount importance to this nation, how we educate our children.\n  We in the Senate have the difficult task before us of passing \nlegislation that re-authorizes the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct which determines how the Federal Government allocates money to our \npublic schools.\n  Unfortunately, all signs from the Committee point to yet another \npolitical stalemate and neither side appears to be pushing any closer \ntoward common ground.\n  In hopes of breaking this unproductive dynamic, I have joined with a \ngroup of my moderate Democratic colleagues here in the Senate to \npromote a ``Third Way'' on ESEA, one that synthesizes the best ideas of \nboth sides into a whole new approach to federal education policy.\n  We are calling this bill the ``Three R's'' and it is a bold effort at \nstreamlining numerous Federal education programs and refocusing federal \nresources on raising academic achievement. This blueprint will give \nmore funding and flexibility to local school districts, in exchange for \ngreater accountability.\n  Mr. President, today I would like to specifically talk about the \ncomponent of the bill that focuses on teacher quality. We call our bill \nthe ``Three R's'' and a similar acronym can apply to our efforts to \nimprove teacher quality. Our plan can best be summed up by ``Four \nR's'': recruiting, retention, resources, and above all . . . RESPECT.\n  The difficulty schools experience today in recruiting and retaining \nquality teachers is one of the most enormous obstacles facing our \neducation system. We cannot expect students to be successful if they \ndon't work with quality teachers; and we can't expect quality teachers \nto stay in the profession if they don't get adequate training, \nresources or respect.\n  Most experts agree that teacher quality is as important as any other \nfactor in raising student achievement. The legislation we are \nintroducing today would consolidate several teacher training \ninitiatives into a single formula grant program for improving the \nquality of public school teachers, principals and administrators.\n  This proposal would increase professional development funding by 100 \npercent to $1.6 billion annually and target that funding to the \nneediest school districts. In my home State of Arkansas, this will mean \nan additional $12 million for teacher quality initiatives.\n  In addition, the ``Three R's'' would give States and school districts \nmore flexibility to design effective teacher recruitment and \nprofessional development initiatives to meet their specific needs.\n  One overreaching goal we propose today is to require that all \nteachers be fully-qualified by 2005. Even the best teachers can't teach \nwhat they don't know or haven't learned themselves. To be successful, \nwe must work harder to reduce out-of-field teaching and require \neducators to demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the subjects \nthey teach.\n  I have the highest respect for the teachers, principals, and \nsuperintendents who dedicate their talent and skills everyday to \nprepare our children for tomorrow. I think they have some of the \nhardest, and most important, jobs in the world. Our Nation's future, in \nlarge part, depends on the work that they do. Our teacher quality \nproposal is an example of how combining the concepts of increased \nfunding, targeting, flexibility and accountability, we can join with \nstate and local educators to give our children a high-quality education \nevery child deserves.\n  I hope this plan will serve as a blueprint to improving public \neducation as we enter into what is sure to be a lengthy and contentious \nESEA debate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/21/senate-section/article/S1505-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1505-S1506]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ST. PATRICK'S DAY STATEMENT BY THE FRIENDS OF IRELAND\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, last week, the Friends of Ireland in \nCongress released its annual St. Patrick's Day Statement. The Friends \nof Ireland is a bipartisan group of Senators and Representatives \nopposed to violence and terrorism in Northern Ireland and dedicated to \na United States policy that promotes a just, lasting and peaceful \nsettlement of the conflict, which has taken more than 3,100 lives over \nthe past 30 years.\n  I believe this year's Friends of Ireland Statement will be of \ninterest to all of our colleagues who are concerned about this issue, \nand I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Statement by the Friends of Ireland, Saint Patrick's Day 2000\n\n       On this first St. Patrick's Day of the new millennium, the \n     Friends of Ireland in the United States Congress join 45 \n     million Irish-Americans of both traditions in celebrating the \n     unique bonds between our two nations. We send greetings to \n     the President of Ireland, Mary McAleese and warmly welcome \n     the Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, on his third St. Patrick's Day \n     visit to Washington. We share the hopes of the Irish people \n     that the current impasse in the Northern Ireland peace \n     process will be broken soon.\n       We are deeply troubled by the suspension of the \n     democratically elected Government of Northern Ireland by the \n     British Government and the stalemate over decommissioning. We \n     urge all political leaders in the North to recommit \n     themselves to the spirit and letter of the Good Friday \n     Agreement. We have provided strong and consistent support \n     throughout the peace process to all parties committed to \n     peace, and we reaffirm our commitment to the full \n     implementation of the Agreement.\n       The Good Friday Agreement was endorsed decisively by the \n     people of Ireland both North and South with majorities from \n     both traditions. It is a mandate given to those working on \n     behalf of peace, justice and the creation of a new beginning \n     in Northern Ireland. Successful implementation is predicated \n     on the concurrent resolution of all the interdependent \n     aspects of the Agreement. The successful implementation of \n     the agreement must be the clear goal for all who want to \n     consolidate the progress that has been made and to avoid the \n     danger of failure for yet another generation in Northern \n     Ireland.\n       At this time, the institutions of devolved government are \n     suspended. The suspension was not caused by any failure of \n     the institutions themselves, nor by any violation of the \n     Agreement, but by an internal political crisis focused on the \n     issue of decommissioning. We encourage the political leaders \n     to bridge this crisis of confidence and secure the \n     reinstatement of the institutions as soon as possible. Their \n     absence creates a gap which the enemies of peace can and will \n     exploit. It is vital that they are not permitted to succeed. \n     The ongoing cease-fires are major confidence building \n     measures, and it should be made clear that any return to \n     violence is not an option. We condemn unequivocally all acts \n     of violence.\n       We call on all sides to implement additional confidence \n     building measures. Root causes of violence--prejudice, \n     religious intolerance and sectarianism--must also be \n     eliminated. The nationalist and unionist communities must see \n     that politics is working and believe their future can rest \n     with the actions of their democratically elected \n     representatives in the Assembly.\n       The issue of confidence in the integrity of the democratic \n     institutions set up under the Good Friday Agreement must not \n     be seen as confined to the agenda of any one side. It is a \n     shared requirement which all have a vital stake in restoring. \n     Each party is committed under the Agreement to ensure the \n     viability and effective operation of the political process \n     pledged in the Agreement by persuading those who hold weapons \n     that such weapons can have no role whatsoever in a democratic \n     system.\n       In spite of discouraging setbacks, we believe that a way \n     forward can be found on this difficult issue by building on \n     the progress already made. We welcome the acknowledgment by \n     the IRA that ``the issue of arms needs to be dealt with in an \n     acceptable way and this is a necessary objective of a genuine \n     peace process.'' We also welcome the work in identifying and \n     advancing the context where this goal can most successfully \n     be achieved. We consider a crucial test to be whether the \n     electorate in Northern Ireland can be reassured that their \n     democratic wishes will not be undermined by actual or \n     threatened recourse to guns from any side.\n       We believe there is now an acceptance of this fundamental \n     principle across the entire political spectrum which offers a \n     basis for reaching an accommodation, provided the parties \n     approach it in a spirit of reciprocal action, and with \n     sensitivity about the real constraints on each side and the \n     need for skillful and patient management of these \n     constraints. We urge renewed dialogue in\n\n[[Page S1506]]\n\n     this spirit using the Independent Commission headed by \n     General de Chastelain. The paramilitaries must put weapons \n     beyond use and make progress on the decommissioning issue.\n       The British Government must reasonably scale down its \n     military presence in the North. We also give particular \n     importance to the timely implementation of the Patten Report, \n     including the urgent appointment of an Oversight Commissioner \n     and assistants, the early publication of a detailed \n     implementation plan, and the speedy passage of legislation. \n     We believe the publication of the Criminal Justice Review \n     should begin a program of significant reforms. We support \n     changes that ensure a police force with representation from \n     both communities and a criminal justice system which will \n     command loyalty from all people living in Northern Ireland. \n     These are the essential ingredients necessary in the creation \n     of a just and peaceful society.\n       We also note the importance of moving forward on human \n     rights and equality issues under the Agreement. This includes \n     the creation of a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland and the \n     obligation to promote equal opportunity. We emphasize the \n     continuing need to demonstrate public commitment to human \n     rights and accountability through the establishment of \n     independent inquiries into the Finucane, Nelson and Hamill \n     cases.\n       We support the initiative taken by the Irish and British \n     Prime Ministers at the beginning of this month to launch a \n     round of intensive consultations to restore the institutions \n     of the Good Friday Agreement and deal with the arms issues as \n     quickly as possible.\n       Over this St. Patrick's Day period, we will be urging all \n     the leaders from Northern Ireland to recognize the importance \n     of what is at stake, the danger of delay, and the need for a \n     genuine and sincere collective effort to overcome these last \n     remaining obstacles to the full implementation of the Good \n     Friday Agreement.

Crippen, Director).\n       Enclosure.\n\n       Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate, March 15, 2000\n\n\n  H.R. 150.--National Forest Education and Community Purpose Lands Act\n\n(As reported by the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources on \n                             March 9, 2000)\n\n       CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 150 would have no \n     significant impact on the federal budget. Because the \n     legislation would affect offsetting receipts (a form of \n     direct spending), pay-as-you-go procedures would apply; \n     however, CBO estimates that any such effects would total less \n     than $500,000 each year. H.R. 150 contains no \n     intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in \n     the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would impose no costs on \n     state, local, or tribal governments. H.R. 150 would benefit \n     some local governments by giving them the opportunity to \n     acquire National Forest land for public schools at a nominal \n     cost.\n       H.R. 150 would authorize the U.S. Department of Agriculture \n     (USDA) to lease or convey land in the National Forest System \n     (NFS) to state and local governments for educational, \n     recreational, and other public purpose uses. State and local \n     governments would pay USDA a nominal amount for use of the \n     land, with the federal government retaining any mineral \n     rights. Under the legislation, USDA could transfer only \n     parcels of land where the value to the state or local \n     government of the proposed use exceeds that of continued \n     federal ownership. If used for any unauthorized purpose, the \n     land would revert to the federal government. The legislation \n     generally would require USDA to notify an applicant within \n     120 days of receiving an application as to whether the land \n     will be leased or conveyed, or provide a written explanation \n     as to why such a determination has not been made.\n       CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 150 could result in \n     forgone offsetting receipts if USDA would have sold one or \n     more of the leased or transferred parcels at fair market \n     value under current law. CBO estimates that any such loss of \n     receipts from land sales would total less than $500,000 each \n     year. Even through we expect state and local governments \n     would desire the opportunity to lease or acquire valuable NFS \n     land at substantially discounted rates, such land is rarely \n     sold under current law. As a result, we estimate that \n     enacting the bill would not result in any significant loss of \n     federal receipts. Additionally, CBO estimates that any \n     increase in receipts from leasing or transferring NFS land \n     under H.R. 150 would also total less than $500,000 a year.\n       On May 5, 1999, CBO prepared a cost estimate for H.R. 150, \n     a bill to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to convey \n     Natural Forest System lands for educational purposes, and for \n     other purposes, as ordered reported by the House Committee on \n     Resources on April 28, 1999. These two versions of the \n     legislation are similar and the estimated costs are the same.\n       The CBO staff contact is John R. Righter, who can be \n     reached at 226-2860. This estimate was approved by Peter H. \n     Fontaine, Deputy Assistant Director for Budget Analysis.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/21/senate-section/article/S1506-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1506]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           DCA PERIMETER RULE\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the DCA \nPerimeter Rule and its impact on the West. This is very important to me \nbecause it affects western States, like Montana.\n  I support the recent conference provisions that allow exemptions to \nthe current perimeter rule at Ronald Reagan Washington National \nAirport. The Conferees should be commended for working to create a \nprocess that balances interests of Senators from states inside the \nperimeter and those of us who are from western states that do not have \nconvenient access to National Airport.\n  Right now passengers from small and medium-sized communities in the \nWest are forced to make double and sometime even triple connections to \nfly to National Airport, or any other Washington airport. Let me talk \nfor a minute about my home state of Montana. It takes an entire day to \nget from Washington to Montana or visa versa. In order to fly into \nMontana you need to fly in to Salt Lake, or Denver, or one of the other \nwestern hubs and wait for one of the two or three 60 passenger flights \nthat flies into Montana that day.\n  This is true for small communities throughout the West, especially in \nthe Northwest corner that use hubs like Salt Lake City.\n  The conference report has the potential to improve access throughout \nthe West. I believe it is important that the Department of \nTransportation ensure that this benefit is not limited to a few large \ncities which already have a variety of options for flying to \nWashington.\n  By enforcing this rule we are making access to DC easier for western \nstates. The nation's Capital should be accessible without hassle to the \nentire country. I do not like the fact that if someone from my home \nstate of Montana wants to come here to talk to their nations \nrepresentative that they need to spend an entire day traveling, and \nwaiting in airports for a connection.\n  My support for this effort dates back to when this legislation was \nfirst introduced.

Mr. President, I rise today in celebration of the \n44th anniversary of Tunisian independence. On March 20, Tunisia--one of \nAmerica's oldest allies--will mark its 44th year of independence, but \nour two nations have been sharing the ideals of freedom and democracy \nfor a much longer time.\n  In 1797, our two nations signed a treaty calling for ``perpetual and \nconstant peace.'' Indeed, for the past 200 years, our two nations have \nenjoyed such a friendship. Whether protecting Mediterranean shipping \nlanes against Barbary pirates, opposing the Nazi war machine in North \nAfrica, or supporting Western interests during the cold war, the United \nStates could count on Tunisia. More recently, Tunisia displayed great \ncourage in urging other Arab nations to seek an accord with Israel. \nTunisia has built on that pioneering stand by playing an important role \nas an honest and fair broker at delicate points in the Middle East \npeace process.\n  By adopting progressive social policies that feature tolerance for \nminorities, equal rights for women, universal education, a modern \nhealth system, and avoiding the pitfall of religious extremism that has \ntormented so many other developing countries. Tunisia has built a \nstable, middle-class society. In stark contrast to its two neighbors, \nTunisia has been a quiet and wonderful success. In fact, Tunisia became \nthe first nation south of the Mediterranean to formally associate \nitself with the European Union.\n  Tunisia has been a model for developing countries. It has sustained \nremarkable economic growth, and undertaken reforms toward political \npluralism. It has been a steadfast ally of the United States and has \nconsistently fought for democratic goals and ideals. Tunisia has \nresponded to President Dwight D. Eisenhower's request to consider the \nUnited States as ``friends and partner'' in the most effective way--by \nits actions.\n  In commemoration of 44 years of independence for Tunisia, I urge my \ncolleagues to reflect on our strong commitment to Tunisian people, who \nare still our friends and partners in North Africa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/21/senate-section/article/S1507-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1507]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL S. McGILL\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nmy long-time friend and Chief of Staff, Michael S. McGill. I have known \nMike for nearly two decades and have had the privilege of working with \nhim when I was Mayor of San Francisco and during my tenure in the U.S. \nSenate. I have a great respect and appreciation for Mike, who has \ndevoted his life to public service and served the state of California \nwith excellence and honor.\n  Mike earned a B.S. in business administration at the University of \nKansas, and is still an avid Jayhawks fan. He earned his Master's in \npolitical science at the University of Texas, which prepared him for a \nlong and distinguished career in public service. In 1967, Mike joined \nthe U.S. Department of State as a Foreign Service Officer and was \nassigned to the Model Cities Program in Fort Worth, Texas. There he \ncommitted his time and energy to issues affecting urban communities.\n  After moving to San Francisco in 1972, Mike developed a passion for \nwater policy, the issue area in which he has provided me with \nindispensable knowledge and advice. He served for three years as \nexecutive director of the Bay Area Economic Forum, and for seven years \nas executive director of the San Francisco Planning and Urban Research \nAssociation (SPUR). As head of SPUR, he faced competing agricultural, \nurban, and environmental interests, but he was able to mediate these \ndifferences to the benefit of California.\n  Since 1993, Mike has served as my Chief of Staff. He has done an \noutstanding job. He has managed my five Senate offices, which serve \nmore than 32 million constituents. This in itself is a tremendous \nundertaking, and I am proud to say that Mike has succeeded in ensuring \nthat the people of California are served with care, compassion, and \nefficiency.\n  As the cornerstone of my staff for the past seven years, Mike's \ndedication and integrity have earned him the respect of everyone he has \nworked with and advised. His door is always open, because no issue is \ntoo big or too small for Mike's attention and guidance.\n  In particular, Mike's advice in approaching and solving the water \nissues that impact California has been invaluable. In my state, water \nis our lifeblood, and this has made it a contentious issue. I have been \nthankful to have Mike's experience and insight on an issue that is by \nno means an easy one.\n  In my office, we can count on Mike and his wealth of knowledge that \nranges from politics to baseball to American history. He and his wife \nMary enjoy traveling throughout the country, visiting presidential \nhomes and Civil War battlefields. He is also a dedicated father to two \nwonderful daughters, Deidre and Erin, who are proud of his \naccomplishments.\n  Mike will be leaving my office to return to one of his passions, \nurban planning, this time at the General Services Administration. There \nhe will work in the Public Buildings Service, managing and preserving \nhistoric buildings and landmarks. I have no doubt that Mike will be an \nasset to the GSA, just as he has been to my office.\n  It is with sadness, but also great pride, that we bid farewell to \nMike McGill. He has been a true friend and a valued advisor throughout \nthe years. Mike is one of California's treasures, and he will be sorely \nmissed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/21/senate-section/article/S1507-3", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1507-S1508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         RECOGNITION OF MIKE BUCK, ENUMCLAW HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, two weekends ago I had the pleasure \nof joining a unique group of volunteers and high school students in \nEnumclaw, WA, in the first steps toward restoring a forested wetland on \nNewaukum Creek.\n  This project is sponsored by the city of Enumclaw and the Mid-Puget \nSound Fisheries Enhancement Group (MPSFEG). MPSFEG and the city of \nEnumclaw have entered into an agreement for the group to remove \nnonnative vegetation and plan various native wetland species. The group \nwill monitor the project for 3 years to ensure success of the project.\n  MPSFEG's Troy Fields and Fiona McNair were kind enough to explain the \nchallenges facing Newaukum creek salmon, and how restoring such \nwetlands will increase water quality and habitat, and therefore \nincrease the chances of young fish surviving.\n  MPSFEG is joined in this effort by a group of enterprising students \nfrom Enumclaw High school, led by their teacher Mike Buck. Mr. Buck has \nused many different sites in the watershed including this one as an \noutdoor laboratory for his science classes. Projects have included \nwater quality and stream insect monitoring and restoration.\n  Mike's approach to teaching is unique, and one that I am wholly \nimpressed with. He has taken it upon himself to involve these young \npeople in science-based restoration projects where they can best \nwitness the results of their efforts--in their own backyard.\n  It is for this reason that I was proud to award Mike Buck with an \nInnovation in Education award for excellence and creativity in hands-on \nscience learning. This project is yet another example of why decisions \naffecting our children's education should be made locally, not in \nWashington DC. No federal bureaucrat could understand the\n\n[[Page S1508]]\n\ndifficult prospects Newaukum Creek salmon face in their return home to \nspawn. And no federal bureaucrat could successfully turn that challenge \ninto an educational opportunity that also works for returning salmon as \nMike Buck has.\n  Therefore, I propose to my colleagues here in the Senate that this \nsuccessful venture is further proof that local educators will be able \nto make the best decisions about the unique needs of their \nstudents.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/21/senate-section/article/S1508-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  THE HONORABLE JOHN J. CALLAHAN AWARDED THE GAUDETE MEDAL FROM SAINT \n                         BONAVENTURE UNIVERSITY\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Justice \nJohn J. Callahan, New York's longest serving Judge on the Supreme Court \nAppellate Division, Fourth Department. For 21 years he epitomized the \nhonor and dignity to which all of us engaged in the political life of \nour nation should aspire.\n  What an exemplary alumni Saint Bonaventure University has chosen on \nwhich to bestow this prestigious tribute. The Gaudete Medal is awarded \nto leaders who have exemplified the philosophy of St. Francis of Assisi \nin their professional and personal lives. This spirit has been evident \nin Justice Callahan's dedication to his court, community, family, and \nhis inspiring courage in spite of personal suffering.\n  To begin, one must know that Jack is a fellow Irish-American and the \ngreat and indispensable achievement of the Irish is that they made it \nAmerican to be ethnic. He has contributed significantly to the Irish-\nAmerican community in Buffalo. On the contribution of the Irish I have \nwritten:\n\n       What did the Irish do? First, they stayed in the cities, \n     remaining highly visible. Next, they kept to their faith. \n     Thus the Roman Catholic Church became a major American \n     institution. Then they went into politics.\n\n  St. Bonaventure University has seen fit to honor a gentleman and a \npatriot. I knew of Jack's dedication to the Navy or should I say the \nSilent Service from working with him on numerous projects for the City \nof Buffalo, his cherished home. As a result of his tireless efforts all \nwere successes.\n  It was back in 1978, at Jack's request, that I wrote to W. Graham \nClayton who was the Secretary of the Navy at the time, to urge the Navy \nto name a submarine in honor of the Queen City of the Lakes. A nuclear \npowered attack submarine, the SSN 715 was christened the Buffalo in \n1983 with the Judge, his wife Lillian, and their son Thomas, then a \nMidshipman at Annapolis, looking on. There hadn't been a ship named for \nBuffalo since 1922.\n  As a submarine veteran of World War II, the Judge felt that it was \nimperative that a decommissioned World War II type submarine be an \nintegral part of the Buffalo & Erie County Naval & Servicemen's Park. A \npark that he himself helped make a reality. The USS Croaker is docked \non the Buffalo River at the foot of Main Street in no small part to \nJudge Callahan's efforts. Some 20 of Jack's shipmates from the USS \nSterlet SS 392 joined together to reminisce about their combat days in \nthe Pacific theater aboard the USS Croaker 1996. As one who served in \nthe Pacific theater, I can attest to the existence of a special \ncamaraderie that unites those at sea for months at a time.\n  After returning from the war, Jack continued his education with the \nhelp of the G.I. Bill, as did I. Jack earned his undergraduate degree \nin Business Administration from St. Bonaventure University in 1951 and \na Judicial Doctorate from the University of Buffalo Law School in 1954. \nJack was honored by his alma mater, the University of Buffalo, with the \nDistinguished Alumni Award for the Judiciary in 1989.\n  The son of Irish immigrants from County Kerry, Judge Callahan \npossesses an exemplary work ethic and ability to endure any trial. Jack \nand Lillian Hart Callahan will be married for 40 years this July and \nfrom their union has come eight children and soon to be nine \ngrandchildren. They have been truly blessed.\n  Thomas and Mary Bridget Callahan, Jack's parents, saw that their six \nchildren received a Catholic education through the Great Depression. \nJack and Lillian made the opportunity for Catholic education available \nto their children and were sure to stress the value of such a \nprivilege. Those efforts were not in vain. Their sons John Joseph Jr. \nand Patrick Francis are physicians. Appropriately, Patrick Francis, \nnamed in honor of St. Francis of Assisi, graduated from Saint \nBonaventure University. Thomas, Timothy, and Michael all graduated from \nthe United States Naval Academy. Not to be outdone--their three \ndaughters; Mary Catherine Malley is a corporate attorney with Hodgson \nRuss Andrews Woods & Goodyear in Buffalo, Maureen Gallagher is a \ndentist, and Kathleen is my Deputy Press Secretary. I should thank Jack \nand Lillian for loaning her to me.\n  His legal background is both extensive and impressive. Judge Callahan \npracticed law as a trial lawyer in Buffalo for 20 years and served as a \nconfidential clerk to New York State Supreme Court Justice Ann Mikol. \nHe was elected to the New York State Supreme Court in 1975 and \nappointed to the Appellate Division by my good friend Governor Hugh \nCarey in 1979.\n  In his exceptional judicial career he has sat on approximately 20,000 \ncases. This past fall the Judge was honored by the Catholic Lawyers \nGuild as the recipient of the St. Thomas More Award which was given for \nhis outstanding service to the legal community and the community at \nlarge.\n  It is with great pleasure that I join his family and many friends \nfrom Saint Bonaventure University and Buffalo to applaud this truly \nremarkable man.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/21/senate-section/article/S1508-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO MAUREEN NEUBERGER\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, each of us who are \nprivileged to serve in this chamber are well aware of the history of \nthe Senate and the contributions of those who came before us. I am \nmindful every day that I serve in the seat held for thirty years by \nMark Hatfield.\n  Another who held this seat with distinction from 1960-1967 was \nMaureen Neuberger, who was the first woman ever to represent Oregon in \nthe United States Senate, and the third woman in history to serve here. \nMrs. Neuberger passed away last week at the age of 94, and I rise today \nto pay tribute to this remarkable Oregonian.\n  Oregon is a state known for its pioneers and trailblazers, and \nMaureen Neuberger was no exception. She began her political career in \n1950 at a time when women in public office were very much a novelty. \nUpon her election to the Oregon State House of Representatives, she \nbecame one half of a truly historic couple. Her husband, Dick \nNeuberger, was serving in the Oregon State Senate, and they became the \nfirst couple in United States history to serve together in a state \nlegislature.\n  Maureen continued to serve in the legislature even after her husband \nwas elected to the United States Senate in 1954. Upon his death in \n1960, Maureen was elected to the United States Senate in her own right.\n  During her years in this chamber, Senator Neuberger earned a \nreputation as an advocate for consumer rights. She sponsored \nlegislation creating warning labels on cigarette packages, challenged \nthe meat-packing industry for artificially adding water to hams, and \nexposed bedding manufacturers who sold flammable blankets.\n  She chose to retire from the Senate after serving one term, but \nremained active through service on presidential commissions and \nteaching at universities. Throughout her life, she also served as a \nmentor and role model to Oregon women from both political parties who \nentered the public service arena.\n  As my State's largest newspaper, The Oregonian, editorialized about \nSenator Neuberger:\n\n       Only 27 women have served in the Senate in U.S. history. \n     She was third. The ones who served after (her)--including the \n     nine who serve today--might not have been there at all if \n     Maureen Neuberger had not helped pave the way.\n\n  I was privileged to meet Senator Neuberger during my service in the \nOregon State Senate. I recall her as a gracious and straight talking \nperson who never lost her interest in the issues of the day. Both \nOregon and America are better for her life and service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/21/senate-section/article/S1508-3", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1508-S1509]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                INGVALD BERNARD JACOBSEN'S 90TH BIRTHDAY\n\n Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to give honor to \nIngvald Bernard\n\n[[Page S1509]]\n\nJacobsen, Uncle Barney, who will be celebrating his 90th birthday on \nMarch 25th. He is the first born of Gina Brathen Fyhrie Jacobsen and \nPeder Jacobsen.\n  Although Mr. Jacobsen was born in Racine, Wisconsin, due to the death \nof his grandmother, he and his family moved to Norway. While a young \nboy in Norway, Ingvald learned the value system he has maintained for \nthe past 90 years through a strong belief in the Bible by which his \nmother and grandfather lived. He became a Christian at his mother's \nknee before starting school and has been a walking example of what it \nis to be Christian all his life: never the preacher, always the doer of \nkind deeds for others, expecting nothing in return for those kind acts.\n  Mr. Jacobsen's early years were lean on material things and long on \nthe hard work of a farm and a life on the seas helping to earn the \nfamily living. He attended school three days a week and completed his \neducation by age 14. He was confirmed in the small Lutheran church on a \nNorwegian island, and still uses the New Testament he was presented \nwith that day in 1924.\n  After returning to the United States in 1928, Mr. Jacobsen's first \njob was landscaping the new golf course in Forest Hills, New Jersey, \nwhere he worked with his father. When that job was completed, he moved \nto Chicago. Thereafter, he had many jobs that led to a position at \nNorthwestern University lasting 25 years.\n  In 1935, Mr. Jacobsen joined a fraternal order called Sons of Norway, \na group of Norwegian immigrants that got together for fellowship. This \nfellowship grew by leaps and bounds all around the world and has become \na vehicle for keeping the old traditions of Norway alive, as well as \nthe language. He has held every office possible in his local lodge and \ndistrict and served as an international director for eight years, a \ngreat honor for him. Because of his faithfulness and hard work \nthroughout the Norwegian community in the Midwest, King Olav V awarded \nhim the King Olav medal in 1973.\n  Throughout his years in the Chicago area, Mr. Jacobsen gave of \nhimself above and beyond the call of duty. At Trinity Lutheran Church, \nhe sang in the choir, greeted people at the door with a warm welcome, \nand was in charge of the coffee hour and Easter breakfast for years. He \npicked up countless children for Sunday School and led the Boy Scout \ntroop in the church. Every year near Christmas time, he saw to it that \nthe residents of the Norwegian home for the elderly in Chicago had a \ntraditional cod-fish dinner. He chose the fish, picked it up, peeled \nthe potatoes, and than poached the fish and saw that it was served to \nevery person. His reward came in the form of tins of fresh, Norwegian \nhomemade cookies baked by the ladies auxiliaries of these homes.\n  Mr. Jacobsen was asked to serve on the Tall Ship committee when in \n1976 the Norwegian Tall Ship Christian Radich came to Chicago to \ncelebrate the 200-year anniversary of our country's birth. He was also \na member of the select few who greeted King Olav V in Chicago in 1975, \nwhen the 150th anniversary of a sailing vessel finally made it to \nChicago from Norway. He was honored by traveling the city with King \nOlav V, spending many days and hours in his company including a large \ndinner attended by dignitaries from around the world.\n  After the death of his wife, Bernie Lars, Mr. Jacobsen sold his home \nand built a beautiful addition to his daughter's home. Since 1997, \nfollowing a successful battle with cancer, he has resided with his \ngranddaughter, Solveig, in Illinois part of the year and with his \noldest daughter, Carolyn, and her husband in the mountains of North \nCarolina during the remainder of the year.\n  Mr. Jacobsen will be celebrating his 90th birthday with countless \nfriends and relatives, including five who will come from Norway. \nGrateful people filled with joy and happy memories of this gentle \ngiant--he still stands tall at 6 feet 3 inches--will gather to honor \nand thank him. I join those many friends and relatives in wishing him a \njoyous and rich celebration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/21/senate-section/article/S1509-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1509]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNITION OF IRISH-AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of \nIrish-American Heritage Month and take this occasion to salute the \ngenerations of Irish descendants who have helped my home state of \nMinnesota grow and prosper.\n  When millions of Irish men, women, and children fled their homeland \nand the great potato famine that gripped Ireland beginning in the \n1840s, they looked to America as a place of abundant food, freedom, and \nopportunity.\n  Most came here with little, yet the riches they have given back to \nthis country and our state cannot be measured.\n  At the urging of Archbishop John Ireland, early leader of the \nMinnesota Catholic Church, many of those first immigrants became \nemployees of the Great Northern Railroad and settled in Minnesota, \nalong the railroad lines heading toward Montana. Since then, our Irish-\nAmerican population has flourished; surveyed for the 1990 census, \n574,183 Minnesotans claimed at least some Irish ancestry.\n  During Irish-American Heritage Month, and on the occasion of Saint \nPatrick's Day, I salute Minnesota's ``sons and daughters of Ireland'' \nand offer to our large and enthusiastic Irish community the heartfelt \nwords of the familiar Irish blessing:\n\n     May the road rise up to meet you,\n     May the wind be always at your back,\n     May the sun shine warm upon your face,\n     And the rains fall soft upon your fields,\n     And until we meet again, may God hold you in the palm of His \n           hand.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/21/senate-section/article/S1509-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1509]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    JOHN J. LESSNER'S 100TH BIRTHDAY\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Mr. John \nJ. Lessner, resident of Lapeer, MI, who on March 10th of this year \ncelebrated his 100th birthday. It is my pleasure to honor him not only \nfor having reached this landmark birthday, which is quite an \naccomplishment in itself, but also, and I think more importantly, for \nhaving lived his life in a manner truly worthy of commendation.\n  One of Mr. Lessner's favorite sayings is ``Work-a-Million,'' and he \nhas certainly lived by this virtue. For thirty-nine years he worked as \na high-school teacher and coach, for thirty-seven years a football and \nbasketball official, he sold world-book encyclopedias for twenty-four \nyears, worked at the H.C. Frick Coal Mine and Monogahela Railroad for \nfifteen summers, spent nine years working towards his M.A. in \nEducation, which he received from West Virginia University in 1953, \nspent six years constructing a home for his family and himself, spent \nthree years playing fullback for the Brownsville (PA) Independence \nFootball Team, and all this after he began his adult life by serving \nhis country for a year in the U.S. Army.\n  On top of all this, Mr. Lessner, somehow found the time to be not \nonly an active community member, but a community leader. He helped \norganize and develop two Parent Teacher Associations, in Greene County, \nPA, and Washington County, PA. He served as the first, twelfth and \ntwenty-fifth president of the Greensboro Lions Club in Greensboro, PA. \nDuring World War II, he served as the Air Raid Warden for Brownsville, \nPA. And every Sunday, for eighteen years, he volunteered his time as a \nSunday School Superintendent at Christian Church in Brownsville, PA, \nand then later at Mapletown Methodist Church in Mapleton, PA.\n  Most important to Mr. Lessner, though, has always been his family. He \nnow resides in Lapeer, MI, with his son Jack, the eldest of his two \nchildren. He moved to Lapeer from Monroeville, PA, where he lived near \nhis daughter, Maryjane. And undoubtedly one of his greatest days came \non December 27, 1979, when he and his wife, Doris Steeves, celebrated \ntheir fiftieth wedding anniversary.\n  This may be selfish on my part, but as I read the biography of Mr. \nLessner, my only wish was that he had spent more of his one-hundred \nyears in Michigan. His is a brand of remarkable that, unfortunately, \nyou do not run into everyday. Regardless, John J. Lessner is a true \nrole model, and we are glad to have him now. So, on behalf not only of \nmyself but also of all my Michigan constituents, I would like to wish \nMr. Lessner a happy 100th birthday, and I hope that there are many more \nto celebrate in the future.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/21/senate-section/article/S1510-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1510]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S1510]]\n                   TRIBUTE TO J.W. ``BUD'' FORRESTER\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, ``To live fully,'' said \nOliver Wendell Homes, ``is to be engaged in the passions of one's \ntime.''\n  Those words came to mind with the recent passing of the remarkable \nOregon journalist, J.W. ``Bud'' Forrester. Mr. Forrester's family and \nfriends can take solace in the fact that here was a man who truly lived \na full life, for here was a man who dedicated himself to the passions \nof our time.\n  As a journalist, Bud Forrester earned a reputation as one of the best \nnewspaper editors in my state. Whether at the helm of the Daily \nAstorian, or my home town newspaper, the East Oregonian, Bud Forrester \ncalled them like he saw them, and could always be counted on to stand \nup for what he believed was right for his community and his state.\n  That same commitment and common sense were also provided to countless \nboards and commissions, on which Bud Forrester served throughout his \nlife. President of the Columbia River Maritime Museum, member of the \nState Board of Higher Education, member of the Oregon Land Conservation \nand Development Commission, unofficial advisor to Senators and \nGovernors, community fund raiser and philanthropist extraordinaire--the \nlist of Bud Forrester's contributions go on and on.\n  I consider myself very privileged to have known Bud Forrester, and \nknow that his legacy of being engaged on the passions of our time will \ncontinue in the hands of his son, Steve, who serves as Editor and \nPublisher of the Daily Astorian.\n  The bottom line is that Oregon is a better place because of Bud \nForrester. I join with countless others in my state in extending my \nsympathies to the Forrester family, and in paying tribute to a true \noriginal who indeed lived life fully.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/21/senate-section/article/S1510-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1510]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                SILEX ASSEMBLY OF GOD CHURCH DEDICATION\n\n Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate and \nhonor Silex Assembly of God in Silex, Missouri. On March 26th, they \nwill be dedicating their new church building. This dedication and \ncelebration is a tribute to God's faithfulness to the congregation, \nwhich began gathering together in 1942. It is also a tribute to their \nlabor of love and personal generosity, led by Pastor and Mrs. John \nPool.\n  Pastor Pool, who retired in 1985, agreed to step up to the pulpit \nagain when the Silex church called upon him to lead them. Now, at age \n81, he and the congregation have built their new church themselves, \nwith volunteer labor and sacrificial contributions of time and money. \nMrs. Pool has helped feed the volunteer groups day after day. Their \ndevotion to Christ brings honor to the name of the Lord.\n  I join those gathered for this wonderful occasion, including the \nPool's five children and most of their grandchildren, in bringing best \nwishes for a memorable celebration as Silex Assembly of God renews its \ncommitment to the redemptive mission of Christ.

the progression from HIV to an AIDS diagnosis \n     for many has slowed considerably as a result of these \n     therapies;\n       Whereas, it is estimated that more than 6,000 residents of \n     Indiana are currently living with HIV disease;\n       Whereas, it is estimated that an additional 1,300 or 21 \n     percent, of Hoosiers with HIV disease are unaware of their \n     diagnosis, and hundreds of individuals know that they are \n     HIV-positive but are not receiving care regularly;\n       Whereas, it is estimated by the Centers for Disease Control \n     and Prevention that there are 40,000 new HIV infections in \n     the United States each year;\n       Whereas, HIV/AIDS in Indiana disproportionately impacts \n     communities of color, gay and bisexual men and women, as well \n     as economically-depressed and other underserved communities;\n       Whereas, in 1999 the rate of HIV disease among Whites was 7 \n     per 100,000, while the rate among Hispanics was 19.3 per \n     100,000, and the rate among African Americans was 44 per \n     100,000;\n       Whereas, in 1999 the rate of HIV disease among White males \n     was 13 per 100,000, while the rate among Hispanic males was \n     29.9 per 100,000, and the rate among African American males \n     was 59.8 per 100,000;\n       Whereas, in 1999 the rate of HIV disease among White \n     females was 1.3 per 100,000, while the rate among Hispanic \n     females was 8.4 per 100,000, and the rate among African \n     American females was 29.8 per 100,000;\n       Whereas, the rate of HIV disease among African American \n     females more than doubled compared to the rate among White \n     females from 1998 to 1999;\n       Whereas, as many as 16 percent of new HIV infections occur \n     in people under age 25, and one in eight are in young people \n     under age 22;\n       Whereas, young adults ages 20-29 represent 20% of reported \n     AIDS cases, but represent 38% of newer cases of HIV \n     infection;\n       Whereas, increasingly, some individuals with HIV disease \n     have also been diagnosed with substance abuse and/or mental \n     illness (dual diagnosis);\n       Whereas, substance abuse is a factor in well over 50% of \n     HIV infections in some United States cities;\n       Whereas, Indiana looks to the Federal Government to assist \n     the State in meeting the expanding health care and social \n     services needs of the people living with HIV disease;\n       Whereas, the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resource \n     Emergency (CARE) Act was first adopted by Congress in 1990;\n       Whereas, the Ryan White CARE Act expires on September 30, \n     2000;\n       Whereas, since its inception, the Ryan White CARE Act has \n     ensured the delivery of vital medical care and treatment and \n     essential support services to thousands of Hoosiers, \n     including medical examinations, laboratory procedures and \n     evaluations, pharmaceuticals, dental care, case management, \n     transportation, housing, legal assistance, benefits education \n     and assistance, treatment education and adherence, and mental \n     health counseling;\n       Whereas, in more recent years the State has developed the \n     Health Insurance Assistance Program, (HIAP), using a portion \n     of\n\n[[Page S1512]]\n\n     Ryan White CARE Act dollars to purchase comprehensive health \n     insurance policies for hundreds of Hoosiers through the \n     Indiana Comprehensive Health Insurance Association (ICHIA), \n     Indiana's high risk insurance pool, at roughly one-half of \n     the cost of providing medical and pharmaceutical services \n     under the State's Early Intervention Program (EIP) and AIDS \n     Drug Assistance Program (ADAP);\n       Whereas, under Federal law, the Ryan White CARE Act is \n     designated as the provider of last resort; therefore, it is \n     recognized as the critical safety net program for low-income \n     uninsured or underinsured individuals;\n       Whereas, the Federal Budget for Fiscal Year 2000 contains \n     increased funding for the Ryan White CARE Act, and Indiana is \n     expected to receive $7,813,713 beginning April 1, 2000;\n       Whereas, funding under Title II of the Ryan White CARE Act \n     pays for care, treatment and social services;\n       Whereas, over 80% pay for life-extending and life-saving \n     pharmaceuticals under Indiana's AIDS Drug Assistance Program \n     (ADAP) and for comprehensive health insurance policies under \n     Indiana's Health Insurance Assistance Program (HIAP);\n       Whereas, title III of the Ryan White CARE Act provides \n     funding to public and private nonprofit entities in Indiana \n     for outpatient early intervention and primary care services;\n       Whereas, the goal of the Ryan White CARE Act Special \n     Projects of National Significance (SPNS) Program (Part F) is \n     to advance knowledge about the care and treatment of persons \n     living with HIV/AIDS by providing time-limited grants to \n     assess models for delivering health and support services;\n       Whereas, SPNS projects have supported the development of \n     innovative service models for HIV care to provide legal, \n     health and social services to communities of color, youth, \n     hard to reach populations, and those with dual diagnoses in \n     Indiana; and\n       Whereas, the Midwest AIDS Training and Education Center \n     (MATEC) is funded as part of Part F of the Ryan White CARE \n     Act, and in Indiana, MATEC trains clinical health care \n     providers provides consultation and technical assistance, and \n     disseminates ever-changing information for the effective \n     management of HIV disease; Therefore,\n       Be it resolved by the Senate of the General Assembly of the \n     State of Indiana, the House of Representatives concurring:\n       Section 1. That the Indiana General Assembly affirms its \n     support of the Ryan White CARE Act, and urges the Congress of \n     the United States to expeditiously reauthorize the Act in \n     order to ensure that the expanding medical care and support \n     services needs of individuals living with HIV disease are \n     met.\n       Section 2.

A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965, to reauthorize and make improvements to that Act, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions.\n\n\n   public education reinvestment, reinvention, and responsibility act\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a new plan for \nFederal education spending to refocus our national education policy on \nhelping states and local school districts raise academic achievement \nfor all children, putting the priority for federal programs on \nperformance instead of process, and on delivering results instead of \ndeveloping rules.\n  In broad terms, the public Education Reinvestment, Reinvention, and \nResponsibility Act--better known as the ``Three R's''--calls on states \nand local districts to enter into a new compact with the federal \ngovernment to work together to strengthen standards and improve \neducational opportunities, particularly for America's poorest children. \nIt would provide states and local educators with significantly more \nfederal funding and significantly more flexibility in targeting aid to \nmeet their specific needs. In exchange, it would demand real \naccountability, and for the first time consequences on schools that \ncontinually fail to show progress.\n  From my visits with parents, teachers, and principals over this past \nyear, it is clear that we as a nation still share a common love for the \ncommon school, for its egalitarian mission, for its democratizing \nforce, and for its unmatched role in helping generation\n\n[[Page S1513]]\n\nafter generation rise and shine. Unfortunately, we are asking schools \nto do more than they were designed to do, to compensate for disengaged \nparents and divided communities--for instructing teenage girls on how \nto raise their children while they try to raise the GPAs, to nourishing \nthe bodies and psyches of grade-schoolers who often begin the day \nwithout breakfast or affection, to policing school halls for guns and \nnarcotics.\n  At the same that schools are trying to cope with these new and \ncomplex stresses and strains, we are demanding that they teach more \nthan that have ever taught before in our history. The reality is that \nin this high-tech, highly-competitive era, there are fewer low-skilled \nindustrial jobs available, and a premium on knowledge and critical \nthinking, meaning it is no longer enough to provide some kids with just \na rudimentary understanding of the basics. Employers and parents alike \nwith better teachers, stronger standards, and higher test scores for \nall students, as well as state-of the art technology and the \nInformation Age skills to match.\n  It is a tribute to the many dedicated men and women who are \nresponsible for teaching our children that the bulk of our schools are \nas good as they are, in light of these intensifying pressures. But the \nstrain is nevertheless building, and with it serious doubts about our \npublic schools and their capability to meet these challenges. Just this \nfall the Democratic Leadership Council, of which I am proud to serve as \nchairman, released a national survey showing that two-thirds of the \nAmerican people believe our public schools are in crisis.\n  I was surprised by that high percentage, which may be skewed somewhat \nby lingering shock over the growing incidents of school shootings. But \nwe must admit that our public schools are not working for a lot of our \nkids. And, as a result, I believe that our public education system is \nfacing an enormously consequential test, which will go a long way \ntoward determining our future strength as a nation. It is a test of our \ntime whether we can reform and in some ways reinvent our public \neducation system to meet these new demands, without compromising the \nold ideals that have sustained the common school for generations.\n  For us to pass this test, we have to first recognize that there are \nserious problems with the performance of many public schools, and that \npublic confidence in public education will continue to erode if we do \nnot acknowledge and address those problems soon. While student \nachievement is up, we must realize the alarming achievement gap that \nseparates minorities from Whites and low-income students from their \nmore affluent counterparts. According to the state-by-state reading \nscores of fourth-graders on the National Assessment of Educational \nProgress, the achievement gap between African American and White \nstudents grew in 16 states between 1992 and 1998. The gap between \nHispanic and White students grew in nine states over the same period of \ntime. We must also question whether our schools are adequately \npreparing our youth to enter the global economy when, in international \nstudents, U.S. 12th graders score below the international average in \nmathematics and science compared to 21 other nations.\n  We also have to acknowledge that we have not done a very good job in \nrecent years in providing every child with a well-qualified teacher, a \ncritical component to higher student achievement. We are failing to \nattract enough good minds in the teaching profession--one survey of \ncollege students in 21 different fields of study found that education \nmajors ranked 17th in their performance on the SAT. We are failing to \nadequately train enough of these aspiring teachers at education \nschools--in Massachusetts last year, to cite one particularly egregious \nexample, 59 percent of the 1,800 candidates who took the state's first-\never certification exam flunked a literacy test that the state board of \neducation chairman rated as at ``about the eighth-grade level.'' And, \nwe are failing to deliver teachers to the classroom who truly know \ntheir subject matter--our national survey found that one-fourth of all \nsecondary school teachers did not major in the core area of \ninstruction, and that in the school districts with the highest \nconcentration of minorities, students have less than a 50 percent \nchance of getting a math or science teacher who has a license or a \ndegree in their field.\n  With that said, we also have to acknowledge that while more money \nalone wont solve our problems, we cannot honesty expect to reinvent our \nschools without it either. The reality is that there is a tremendous \nneed for additional investment in our public schools, not just in urban \nareas but in every kind of community. Thousands of crumbling and \novercrowded schools to modernize. Two million new teachers to hire and \ntrain. Billions in spiraling special education costs to meet.\n\n  We also have to recognize the basic math of trying to raise standards \nat a time of profound social turbulence that we will need to expend new \nsums to reach and teach children who in the past we never asked to \nexcel, and who in the present will have to overcome enormous hurdles to \ndo so. I believe any child can learn--any child--and that has been \nproven over and over again in the best schools in both my home state of \nConnecticut and in many of America's cities.\n  There are in fact plenty of positives to highlight in public \neducation today, which is something else that we have to acknowledge, \nyet too often don't. I have made a concerted effort over the last few \nyears to visit a broad range of schools and programs in Connecticut, \nand I can tell you that there is much happening in our public schools \nthat we can be heartened by, proud of, and learn from.\n  There is the John Barry Elementary School in Meriden, Connecticut, \nwhich was singled out by the U.S. Department of Education as a \nDistinguished title I School for its work with disadvantaged students. \nLike many urban schools, Barry has to contend with a high-poverty, \nhigh-mobility student population, but through Reading Recovery and \nother interventions, Barry has had real success improving the reading \nskills of many of its students.\n  There is the Side by Side Charter School in Norwalk, one of 17 \ncharter schools in Connecticut, which has created an exemplary \nmultiracial program in response to the challenge of Sheff v. O'Neill to \ndiminish racial isolation. With the freedom that goes with its charter, \nSide by Side is experimenting with a different approach to classroom \nassignments, having students stay with teachers for two consecutive \nyears to take advantage of the relationships that develop, and by all \nindications it is working quite well for those kids.\n  And there is the BEST program, which, building on previous efforts to \nraise teacher skills and salaries, is now targeting additional state \naid, training, and mentoring support to help local districts nurture \nnew teachers and prepare them to excel. In this regard Connecticut is \nfar ahead of most of the country in adapting its teacher quality \nprograms to meet today's challenges--setting high performance standards \nboth for teachers and those who train them, helping novices meet those \nstandards, and holding the ones who don't accountable. The result is \nthat Connecticut's blueprint is touted by some, including the National \nCommission on Teaching and America's Future, as a national model for \nothers to follow.\n  A number of other states, led by Texas and North Carolina, are moving \nin this same direction--refocusing their education systems not on \nprocess but on performance, not on prescriptive rules and regulations \nbut on results. More and more of them are in fact adopting what might \nbe called a ``reinvest, reinvent, and responsibility'' strategy, by (1) \ninfusing new resources into their public education systems; (2) giving \nlocal districts more flexibility; and (3) demanding new measures and \nmechanisms of accountability, to increase the chances that these \ninvestments will yield the intended return, meaning improved academic \nachievement for all students.\n  This move to trade flexibility for accountability, and to focus on \nperformance instead of process, is not the definitive answer to passing \nthe test I outlined earlier, of adapting our public schools to the \nrapidly-changing environment around us. There are obviously other parts \nof the equation, none more important that parental involvement. \nEverything we know from research indicates that an engaged parent makes \na crucial difference in student achievement, particularly in terms of \nreading, and we have to do\n\n[[Page S1514]]\n\nmore to get parents to play a more active role in their children's \nlearning. But when it comes to improving the delivery of public \neducation, the reinvestment and reinvention approach is the best \nsolution I have heard yet, and probably our best hope for extending the \npromise of equal opportunity into the new century.\n  In Congress, our opportunity now is with the upcoming reauthorization \nof the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Today, nearly $15 \nbillion in Federal aid flows through ESEA programs to states and local \neducation authorities, and other educational entities annually. While \nthis constitutes a minute fraction of all the money spent on public \neducation each year, it is still a lot of money, and past experience \nshows that Federal money has a habit of influencing local behavior. If \nwe can reformulate the way we distribute those additional dollars, and \npeg our national programs to performance instead of process, we can go \na long way toward encouraging more states and local school districts to \nreinvest and reinvent public education, while taking more \nresponsibility for its outcomes.\n  Unfortunately, Congress seems more interested in being an agent of \nrecrimination. We spend most of our time positioning ourselves for \npartisan advantage rather than trying to fix serious problems. We \nreduce a complicated issue to a simplistic multiple choice test, \nforcing a false choice between more spending and programs, or block \ngrants and vouchers. And, the answer we are left with is none of the \nabove.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues Senators Bayh, \nBreaux, Graham, Kohl, Landrieu, Lincoln, and Robb in introducing this \ngroundbreaking legislation that signifies that there is a better way, a \nthird way to address education reform. It builds on the progress many \nstates have already made through the standards movements. It calls for \nstreamlining and consolidating the maze of programs under the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act into five goal-oriented titles, \neach with more money and fewer strings attached, and all of them geared \ntoward encouraging innovation, promoting what works, and ultimately \nraising academic achievement for all students.\n  We would concentrate our efforts on closing the achievement gap \nbetween the haves and have-nots, fostering English proficiency for \nimmigrant children, improving the quality of teaching for all children, \npromoting choice and competition within the public system, and \nstimulating innovative and high performance educational initiatives. We \nwould ask the states to set performance standards in each of these \nareas, and in exchange for the new funding and flexibility we provide, \nwe would hold states accountable for delivering demonstrable results. \nWe would reward success and, for the first time in the history of ESEA, \npunish chronic failure.\n  We agree with our Democratic colleagues that we need to invest more \nresources if we want to meet the new challenges of the new century, and \nprepare every student to succeed in the classroom. That is why we would \nboost ESEA funding by $35 billion over the next five years. But we also \nbelieve that the impact of this funding will be severely diluted if it \nis not better targeted to the worst-performing schools and if it is not \ncoupled with a demand for results. That is why we not only increase \nTitle I funding by 50 percent, but use a more targeted formula for \ndistributing these new dollars to schools with the highest \nconcentrations of poverty. And that is why we develop a new \naccountability system that strips federal funding from states that \ncontinually fail to meet their performance goals.\n  We also agree with our Republican colleagues that federal education \nprograms are too numerous and too bureaucratic. That is why we \neliminate dozens of federally microtargeted, micromanaged programs that \nare redundant or incidental to our core mission of raising \nacademic achievement. But we also believe that we have a great national \ninterest in promoting broad national educational goals, chief among \nthem delivering on the promise of equal opportunity. It is not only \nfoolish, however, but irresponsible to hand out federal dollars with no \nquestions asked and no thought of national priorities. That is why we \ncarve out separate titles in those areas that we think are critical to \nhelping local districts elevate the performance of their schools.\n\n  The first would enhance our longstanding commitment to providing \nextra help to disadvantaged children through the Title I program, while \nbetter targeting $12 billion in aid--a 50 percent increase in funding--\nto schools with the highest concentrations of poor students. The second \nwould combine various teacher training and professional development \nprograms into a single teacher quality grant, increase funding by 100 \npercent to $1.6 billion annually, and challenge each state to pursue \nthe kind of bold, performance-based reforms that my own state of \nConnecticut has undertaken with great success.\n  The third would reform the Federal bilingual education program and \nhopefully defuse the ongoing controversy surrounding it by making \nabsolutely clear that our national mission is to help immigrant \nchildren learn and master English, as well as achieve high levels of \nachievement in all subjects. We must be willing to back this commitment \nwith essential resources required to help ensure that all limited \nEnglish proficient students are served.\n  Under our approach, funding for LEP programs would be more than \ndoubled to $1 billion a year, and for the first time be distributed to \nstates and local districts through a reliable formula, based on their \nLEP student population. As a result, school districts serving large LEP \nand high poverty student populations would be guaranteed federal \nfunding, and would not be penalized because of their inability to hire \nsavvy proposal writers for competitive grants.\n  The fourth would respond to the public demands for greater choice \nwithin the public school framework, by providing additional resources \nfor charter school start-ups and new incentives for expanding local, \nintradistrict choice programs. And the fifth would radically \nrestructure the remaining ESEA and ensure that funds are much better \ntargeted while giving local districts greater flexibility in addressing \nspecific needs. We consolidate more than 20 different programs into a \nsingle High Performance Initiatives title, with a focus on supporting \nbold new ideas, expanding access to summer school and after school \nprograms, improving school safety, and building technological literacy. \nWe increase overall funding by more than $200 million, and distribute \nthis aid through a formula that targets more resources to the highest \npoverty areas.\n  The boldest change we are proposing is to create a new accountability \ntitle. As of today, we have plenty of rules and requirements on inputs, \non how funding is to be allocated and who must be served, but little if \nany attention to outcomes, on how schools ultimately perform in \neducating children. This bill would reverse that imbalance by linking \nFederal funding to the progress states and local districts make in \nraising academic achievement. It would call on state and local leaders \nto set specific performance standards and adopt rigorous assessments \nfor measuring how each district is faring in meeting those goals. In \nturn, states that exceed those goals would be rewarded with additional \nfunds, and those that fail repeatedly to show progress would be \npenalized. In other words, for the first time, there would be \nconsequences for poor performance.\n  In discussing how exactly to impose those consequences, we have run \ninto understandable concerns about whether you can penalize failing \nschools without also penalizing children. The truth is that we are \npunishing many children right now, especially the most vulnerable of \nthem, by forcing them to attend chronically troubled schools that are \naccountable to no one, a situation that is just not acceptable anymore. \nThis bill minimizes the potential negative impact of these consequences \non students. It provides the states with three years to set their \nperformance-based goals and put in place a monitoring system for \ngauging how local districts are progressing, and also provides \nadditional resources for states to help school districts identify and \nimprove low-performing schools. If after those three years a state is \nstill failing to meet its goals, the state would be penalized by \ncutting its administrative funding by 50 percent. Only after four\n\n[[Page S1515]]\n\nyears of under performance would dollars targeted for the classroom be \nput in jeopardy. At that point, protecting kids by continuing to \nsubsidize bad schools becomes more like punishing them.\n  I must address another concern that may be raised that this is a \nblock grant in sheep's clothing. There are substantial differences \nbetween a straight block-grant approach and this streamlined structure. \nFirst, in most block-grant proposals the accountability mechanisms are \nvague, weak and often non-existent, which is one reason why I have \nopposed them in the Senate. Our bill would have tangible consequences, \npegged not just to raising test scores in the more affluent suburban \nareas, but to closing the troubling achievement gap between students in \npoor, largely minority districts and their better-off peers.\n  This leads me to another way this bill is different. Unlike many \nblock-grant supporters, I strongly believe that we have a great \nnational interest and a national obligation to promote specific \neducational goals, chief among them delivering on the promise of equal \nopportunity, and that is reflected in our legislation. While it makes \nsense to streamline and eliminate as many strings as possible on \nFederal aid, to spur innovation and also to maximize the bang for our \nFederal buck, it does not make sense to hand over those Federal bucks \nwith no questions asked, and thus eliminate the Federal role in setting \nnational priorities. That is why, in the restructuring we have \ndeveloped, we have maintained separate titles for disadvantaged \nstudents, limited English proficient students, teacher quality, public \nschool choice, and high quality education initiatives, all of which, I \nwould argue, are critical to raising academic achievement and promoting \nequal opportunity. And that is why of the more than $6 billion increase \nin annual funding I am proposing, $4 billion would be devoted to title \nI and those students most in need of our help.\n  It is a fairly common-sense strategy--reinvest in our public schools, \nreinvent the way we administer them, and restore a sense of \nresponsibility to the children we are supposed to be serving. Hence the \ntitle of our bill: the Public Education Reinvention, Reinvestment, and \nResponsibility Act, or the Three R's for short. Our approach is humble \nenough to recognize there are no easy answers to turning around low-\nperforming schools, to lifting teaching standards, to closing the \ndebilitating achievement gap, and that most of those answers won't be \nfound here in Washington anyway. But it is ambitious enough to try to \nharness our unique ability to set the national agenda and recast the \nfederal government as an active catalyst for success instead of a \npassive enabler of failure.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on a matter of great \nimportance and urgency to me. We are at a crossroads in American \neducation and that is why I join with my colleagues Senators Lieberman, \nLandrieu, Kohl, Lincoln, Breaux, Graham, and Robb in offering the \nPublic Education Reinvestment, Reinvention, and Responsibility Act.\n  Since the middle of the 1800s, when Horace Mann and a group of others \ndedicated our country to the principle that every child should have \naccess to a good public education, we have held that out as an ideal \nfor our country. In the middle 1960s, there was growing recognition \nthat for too many of our children, this principle was really a hollow \ndream. And so, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) was \nborn. We introduce our version of ESEA today in recognition of the fact \nthat for too many millions of American children the dream of a quality \npublic education is still sorely lacking.\n  The consequences of any of our children not receiving a quality \neducation are far greater than ever before. For the first time in our \nnation's history, the growing gap between the educational ``haves'' and \n``have nots'' threatens to create a permanent underclass. If we do not \naddress these shortcomings, the knowledge and information gap will lock \nmany of our citizens out of the marketplace and prevent them from \naccessing opportunity in the New Economy. We stand here today in \nrecognition of the fact that the solutions of the 1960s are inadequate \nto meet the challenges of the 21st Century and the years beyond. We \nstand here today to say the status quo is not good enough; that we must \ndo better.\n  Our legislation proposes dramatic change in a significant rethinking \nof business as usual when it comes to education policy here in \nWashington, D.C. We propose a substantial increase in our nation's \ninvestment in education, because we recognize that we can't expect our \nschools, particularly our poorer schools, to get the job done if we \ndon't give them the tools to get the job done. We propose an increase \nof $35 billion over five years in Federal education spending, a 50 \npercent increase for Title I funding, 90 percent increase for \nprofessional development funding for teachers, over a 30 percent \nincrease for innovative programs, and nearly a doubling in funding for \nCharter schools and Magnet Schools so as to give parents greater public \nschool choice. This is a significant investment of public dollars.\n  But we do more than just throw money at the problem, because we know \nthat taxpayers, parents, and most of all our children, have a right to \nexpect more from us. Instead, we focus on accountability. In return for \nincreased investment, we insist upon results. We focus on outcomes, not \nincomes. No longer will we define success only in terms of how much \nmoney is spent, but instead of how much our children know. Can they \nread and write, add and subtract, know basic science?\n  No longer will we define accountability in terms of ordering local \nschool districts to spend dollars in particular ways, but instead in \nterms of whether our children are getting the skills they need to make \na successful life for themselves. This is a significant rethinking from \nthe things that have prevailed here in Washington for several decades.\n  Our proposal also provides a substantial amount of flexibility. We \ndon't agree with our colleagues on the far right in block grants which \nwould allow money to be diverted from public education or to allow \ndollars to be diverted from focusing on our poorest students. But we do \nallow for local principals and superintendents to have a much greater \nsay in determining how best to spend those dollars, because we believe \nthat those at the local level who labor in the classrooms and the \nschools every day, can make those decisions far better than those of us \nwho now work on the banks of the Potomac.\n  It was Thomas Jefferson who said that a society that expects to be \nboth ignorant and free is expecting something that never has been and \nnever shall be. So we put forward this proposal because we know that \nthe cause of improving public education is critically important to our \neconomy, critically important to the kind of society that we will be, \nand essential to the vibrancy of our democracy itself.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today as a proud cosponsor of the \nPublic Education Reinvestment, Reinvention, and Responsibility Act of \n2000--better known as ``Three R's.'' I have been pleased to work with \nthe education community in Wisconsin, as well as Senator Lieberman and \nour other cosponsors, on this important piece of legislation. I believe \nthat this bill represents a realistic, effective approach to improving \npublic education--where 90 percent of students are educated.\n  We have made great strides in the past six years toward improving \npublic education. Nearly all States now have academic standards in \nplace. More students are taking more challenging courses. Test scores \nhave risen slightly. Dropout rates have decreased.\n  In Wisconsin, educators have worked hard to help students achieve. \nFourth-graders and eighth-graders are showing continued improvement on \nState tests in nearly every subject, particularly in science and math. \nThird-graders are scoring higher on reading tests. Test results show \nsome improvement across all groups, including African American, \ndisabled, and economically disadvantaged groups.\n  Unfortunately, despite all of our best efforts, we still face huge \nchallenges in improving public schools. The most recent TIMSS study of \nstudents from 41 different countries found that many American students \nscore far behind those in other countries. In Wisconsin, scores in \nmath, science and writing are\n\n[[Page S1516]]\n\ngetting better but still need improvement. And test scores of students \nfrom low-income families, while showing some improvement, are still too \nlow.\n  Mr. President, I strongly support the notion that the Federal \ngovernment must continue to be a partner with States and local \neducators as we strive to improve public schools. As a nation, it is in \nall of our best interests to ensure that our children receive the best \neducation possible. It is vital to their future success, and the \nsuccess of our country.\n  However, addressing problems in education is going to take more than \ncosmetic reform. We are going to have to take a fresh look at the \nstructure of Federal education programs. We need to let go of the tired \npartisan fighting over more spending versus block grants and take a \nmiddle ground approach that will truly help our States, school \ndistricts--and most importantly, our students.\n  Our ``Three R's'' bill does just that. It makes raising student \nachievement for all students--and eliminating the achievement gap \nbetween low-income and more affluent students--our top priorities. To \naccomplish this, our bill centers around three principles.\n  First, we believe that we must continue to make a stronger investment \nin education, and that Federal dollars must be targeted to the neediest \nstudents. A recent GAO study found that Federal education dollars are \nsignificantly more targeted to poor districts than money spent by \nStates. Although Federal funds make up only 6-7 percent of all money \nspent on education, it is essential that we target those funds where \nthey are needed the most.\n  Second, we believe that States and local school districts are in the \nbest position to know what their educational needs are. They should be \ngiven more flexibility to determine how they will use Federal dollars \nto meet those needs.\n  Finally--and I believe this is the key component of our approach--we \nbelieve that in exchange for this increased flexibility, there must \nalso be accountability for results. These principles are a pyramid, \nwith accountability being the base that supports the federal \ngovernment's grant of flexibility and funds.\n  For too long, we have seen a steady stream of Federal dollars flow to \nStates and school districts--regardless of how well they educated their \nstudents. This has to stop. We need to reward schools that do a good \njob. We need to provide assistance and support to schools that are \nstruggling to do a better job. And we need to stop subsidizing failure. \nOur highest priority must be educating children--not perpetuating \nbroken systems.\n  Mr. President, I believe the ``Three R's'' bill is a strong starting \npoint for taking a fresh look at public education. We need to build \nupon all the progress we've made, and work to address the problems we \nstill face. This bill--by using the concepts of increased funding, \ntargeting, flexibility--and most importantly, accountability--\ndemonstrates how we can work with our State and local partners to make \nsure every child receives the highest quality education--a chance to \nlive a successful productive life. I look forward to working with all \nof my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, as well as education \ngroups in my State, as Congress debates ESEA in the coming months.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 2255. A bill to amend the Internet Tax Freedom Act to extend the \nmoratorium through calendar year 2006; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n\n                  the internet tax freedom act of 2000\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation \ntoday to extend the moratorium on Internet taxes through 2006. This \nwill ensure that Internet commerce remains free from burdensome, \nanticonsumer taxation while we discuss a fair and equitable tax \nstructure for our new economy. This bill simply extends the law passed \nby Congress and signed by the President in October 1998.\n  The 1998 legislation imposed a moratorium and provided for a \ncommission to report to Congress. While the Commission has not yet \nreported its recommendations, it is clear from published reports of \ntheir deliberations and from interviews with their members that a clear \nconsensus is not imminent. More discussions and more time is necessary \nto arrive at a fair conclusion. Although I feel strongly that in the \nend a permanent moratorium is the best policy, which is why I \nintroduced legislation to impose a permanent ban on Internet taxes, I \nalso have become convinced that we need more time to determine how \nstate and local governments will be affected. We need to consider \nwhether the macroeconomic benefits of the new economy will outweigh the \npotential losses in direct revenues, how to ensure a level playing \nfield for all venues of commerce, and how to simplify the overwhelming \nmorass of tax rules, regulations and paperwork so that opportunities \nfor new or small businesses are not lost in complex and archaic \nbureaucracy.\n  The compromises being discussed by the Commission are a good start to \nthe debate, but more time is necessary to pursue these and other \npossible options. It is becoming increasingly clear that the answer to \ntaxation of the internet must affect taxation of other commerce media, \nsuch as catalog sales, as well. We need to reexamine the level of \nservices which the public wants to be provided by government and \ndetermine how to provide necessary revenue to accomplish the people's \nwill. We need to ensure that taxation is not simply imposed to increase \ngovernment bureaucracy.\n  Recent studies indicate that state and local governments will not \nsuffer during this interim period. A June 1999 report by the well-known \nand respected auditing and business consulting firm or Ernst & Young \nconcludes that total sales and use taxes not collected by state and \nlocal governments from Internet e-commerce transactions in 1998 \namounted to only ``one-tenth of one percent of total state and local \nsales and use tax collections.'' Another May 1999 analysis of Internet \ncommerce transactions through 2003 by Austan Goolsvee and Jonathan \nZittrain, published in the National Tax Journal, predicts ``even with a \n70 percent rate of growth in retail e-commerce transactions, a revenue \nloss of less than 2 percent of sales tax revenue.''\n  There are multiple reasons for this very marginal impact on state and \nlocal revenues. First, most of the e-commerce transactions are wither \nbusiness-to-business transactions, or for services, such as financial \nservices and travel, which are exempt from sales and use taxes in most \nstates. Ernst & Young estimated only 13 percent of the total e-commerce \nsales transactions were of a type which would be subject to sales and \nuse taxes if conducted in person.\n  Second, as pointed out by Austan Goolsbee and Jonathan Zittrain, the \nInternet is a ``trade creator''--that is, many transactions which occur \nthrough e-commerce would not take place at all without the internet.\n  Third, the Internet does not divert sales only from brick and mortar \nretailers, but also from mail order catalogs. Those sales are also \nsubject to sales and use tax only where a nexus, a physical presence, \nin the taxing state.\n  We are currently seeing a continued rise in state and local revenues. \nMany states are currently debating how to refund money to their \ncitizens, whether to cut sales taxes or income taxes. Thus, this \nmoratorium should not negatively impact their ability to provide \nservices during the interim.\n  It is important to look at the full picture here. The Internet is \nfilled with web sites of small businesses which are expanding in ways \nwhich would never have before been economically feasible. For example, \na small store in a small town which has historically had a limited \nmarket for its good now has a website that allows it to market and sell \nto people all over the country--all over the world. It increases its \nbusiness and needs to hire more employees, and pays taxes on its \nincreased revenues. The states and local governments benefits, not only \nfrom the additional taxes paid on the revenues, but in the economic \nbenefits of additional jobs.\n  The potential burden of complying with tax regulations and the \npaperwork involved under current law for as many as 7,500 estimated \ntaxing units in this country would ovrwhelm many businesses, especially \nsmall businesses. An example in the March 13, 2000 edition of \nInteractive Week is instructive. ``If you're a raw peanut, five states \nwould require that sales taxes are paid\n\n[[Page S1517]]\n\non your purchase. If you're roasted, 11 states charge a sales tax. Add \nsome honey to that roasting, and now 21 states say you're taxable. Get \ndrenched in caramel and mixed with caramel-coated popcorn and suddenly \nyou're a snack, and 31 states will call the tax man.''\n  While I hope that the debate will conclude with a decision to leave \nthe Internet as a ``tax-free-zone,'' I believe that it is important to \ncontinue the discussion and to move all stakeholders toward a \nconsensus. This temporary extension of the moratorium already approved \nby Congress and the President will allow us to do that. This is a good \ncompromise which will serve as a catalyst for consideration of the \nbroader tax policy issues which need to enter into this discussion to \nensure a fair and equitable tax system in this country.\n  I intend to move this bill through committee expeditiously and look \nforward to debating it on the Senate floor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2255\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. INTERNET TAX MORATORIUM EXTENDED THROUGH 2006.\n\n       Section 1101(a) of the Internet Tax Freedom Act (47 U.S.C. \n     151 nt) is amended by striking ``3 years after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act--'' and inserting ``on December 31, \n     2006:'',\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN (for himself and Mr. McConnell):\n  S. 2256. A bill to amend title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and \nSafe Streets Act of 1968 to provide standards and procedures to guide \nboth State and local law enforcement agencies and law enforcement \nofficers during internal investigations, interrogation of law \nenforcement officers, and administrative disciplinary hearings, to \nensure accountability of law enforcement officers, to guarantee the due \nprocess rights of law enforcement officers, and to require States to \nenact law enforcement discipline, accountability, and due process laws; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\nTHE STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT DISCIPLINE, ACCOUNTABILITY AND DUE \n                          PROCESS ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I rise with Senator Biden to \nintroduce the State and Local Law Enforcement Discipline, \nAccountability and Due Process Act of 2000. American families can turn \non the news every night and see the reality of the war against crime \nand drugs. No one understands the dangers of this battle better than \nthe men and women on the front lines. I'm talking about our nation's \npolice officers.\n  We have entrusted the difficult work of protecting society to police \nofficers. They know the stress and the strain of walking the daily \nbeat, of being caught in the crossfire in a world of gangs and drugs. \nThey do a very difficult job, and with few exceptions, they do it with \nhonor and skill.\n  We should always remember that the vast majority of police officers \nwork responsibly and risk their lives for all of us. In the words of \none officer, `the ultimate sacrifice could occur at any time. * * * \n[The] gangs and criminals have rewritten the rule book.'\n  To make matters worse, the pressure of crime and drugs--of gangs and \nthugs--is multiplied by the fear of unjust disciplinary actions. Our \nlaw enforcement officers face intrusive investigations into their \nprofessional and personal lives--oftentimes at the behest of some \nrecently arrested criminal looking for a payback.\n  Unfortunately, many police officers are denied the same basic \nprocedural and due process rights that the rest of us enjoy and take \nfor granted. As a result, our officers live in the fear of: being \ninvestigated without notice; being interrogated without an attorney; \nand, being dismissed without a hearing.\n  We insist that police officers respect the constitutional rights of \nthe citizens they serve. We insist that they adhere to the letter and \nspirit of our laws. We insist that they respect due process in their \nwork. It is past time for us to give them the same kind of legal rights \nthat every other citizen has come to enjoy. That is why Senator Biden \nand I have introduced this bill.\n  This bill strikes an important balance: it makes sure every police \nofficer has basic fundamental procedural rights, while at the same time \nensuring that citizens have the opportunity to raise legitimate \ncomplaints and concerns about police officer accountability.\n  For example, the bill guarantees due process rights to every police \nofficer subject to investigation for noncriminal disciplinary action. \nSome of these rights include: the right to be informed of the \nadministrative charges prior to being questioned; the right to be \nadvised of the results of an investigation; the right to a hearing and \nan opportunity to respond; and the right to be represented by counsel \nor other representative.\n  At the same time the bill ensures that legitimate citizen complaints \nagainst police officers will be actively investigated, and that \ncitizens will be informed of the progress and outcome of those \ninvestigations.\n  Finally, I must conclude by explaining that this bill is a product of \nyears of input from the men and women who have experienced the daily \npressures of police service, and continue to endure them. This \nlegislation has benefitted from the thoughtful ideas and past support \nof many law enforcement groups, including the Fraternal Order of \nPolice, the National Association of Police Organizations, and the \nInternational Brotherhood of Police Officers.\n  In particular, I am grateful to the contribution made by the \nFraternal Order of Police. Over the past 8 years, I have worked closely \nwith the Kentucky FOP to develop and promote this legislation.\n  The time has come to protect those who protect us. We must give our \nlaw enforcement officers the basic and fundamental rights that they \ndesperately need and richly deserve.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. TORRICELLI:\n  S. 2259. A bill to amend title 28, United States Code, to divide New \nJersey into two judicial districts; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n        creating a northern and southern district of new jersey\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a \nbill that will help bring more criminals to justice and create a better \nfederal judicial system in New Jersey. This legislation will divide the \nfederal District of New Jersey into the Southern and Northern Districts \nof New Jersey which will enable the federal courts and federal agencies \nto better serve the approximately 8 million residents of the state. It \nwill also bring much needed federal law enforcement resources to the \nstate, particularly southern New Jersey.\n  Under the bill, the proposed Southern District of New Jersey would \ninclude 8 of the 21 counties in New Jersey and the Northern District of \nNew Jersey would include the remaining 13. The federal courthouses \nwould be located in Camden and Trenton for the Southern District and in \nNewark for the Northern District. All federal cases arising in the \neight-county Southern District would be heard in the federal court in \nCamden or Trenton and cases from the 13-county Northern District would \nbe heard in Newark. The bill would also result in the creation of \nseveral new federal positions for the Southern District including a \nClerk of the Court, U.S. Attorney, U.S. Marshal, and a Federal Public \nDefender, among others.\n  By creating a new Southern District of New Jersey, more federal \ncrime-fighting resources will be brought to a region which crime \nstatistics reveal is besieged by violent crime. In 1998, southern New \nJersey accounted for 25 percent of the state's urban murders, 32 \npercent of the state's murder arrests and 33 percent of the state's \narrests for violent crimes. This initiative will also ensure that \ncrime-fighting decisions are made locally instead of by officials who \nare based elsewhere in the state and that law enforcement officials in \nthe region will get the resources needed to prosecute crimes \neffectively and expeditiously.\n  The creation of two districts will also provide relief from the crush \nof cases that have crowded the dockets of the federal courts in \nsouthern New Jersey and caused a severe backlog in the system. In 1998 \nalone, 281 federal criminal\n\n[[Page S1518]]\n\ncases were filed in federal courts in southern New Jersey and 161 \ncriminal cases were still pending at the end of the year. In that same \nyear, 2,116 civil cases were filed and 1,318 civil cases were pending \nat the end of the year. Moreover, of the 95 federal judicial districts \nacross the nation, more than half generated fewer criminal and civil \ncases than southern New Jersey and in some cases with far more federal \njudicial and law enforcement resources. Currently, only 10 percent of \nthe FBI agents, 15 percent of the United States Marshals and 18 percent \nof the Drug Enforcement Administration agents in New Jersey are \nassigned to the region. Of the 119 Assistant United States Attorneys in \nthe state, only 12 are assigned to South Jersey.\n  Finally, the creation of a new Northern and Southern Districts of New \nJersey is warranted based on the sheer size of the state. The current \nDistrict of New Jersey is the third most populous federal judicial \ndistrict in the nation. Of the 25 states that have a single federal \njudicial district, New Jersey has the largest population and more than \na dozen states with smaller populations have multiple judicial \ndistricts. In fact, with more than 2 million residents in the southern \ncounties, the population of the proposed Southern District of New \nJersey would exceed that of almost half of the current judicial \ndistricts and the proposed Northern District would rank even higher.\n  This initiative enjoys broad bipartisan political support in New \nJersey, and a similar bill has been introduced and cosponsored in the \nU.S. House of Representatives by the entire southern New Jersey \nCongressional delegation. The measure also has strong support in the \nsouthern counties and is backed by all eight southern county bar \nassociations, the South Jersey Police Chief's Association, the Chamber \nof Commerce of Southern New Jersey and various former county \nprosecutors and former federal law enforcement officials.\n  While the process of reviewing and deliberating the merits of this \nlegislation will be lengthy and time consuming, this is an idea which \nis long overdue. The citizens of New Jersey deserve a better federal \njudicial system and their fair share of federal crime-fighting \nresources. I look forward to working with my colleagues to secure \npassage of this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation appear in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2259\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In 1978, the Judicial Conference of the United States \n     established a procedure for creating new Federal judicial \n     districts, which is still in force. According to the \n     ``Proceedings of the Judicial Conference, September 21-22, \n     1978'', this procedure requires that 4 principal criteria be \n     taken into consideration in evaluating the establishment of a \n     new Federal judicial district: caseload, judicial \n     administration, geography, and community convenience.\n       (2) The criterion of ``caseload'' is found to include the \n     total number of Federal court cases and the number of cases \n     per Federal judge, for both civil and criminal Federal cases.\n       (3)(A) The substantial criminal caseload concentrated in \n     the southern counties of New Jersey requires the creation of \n     a separate judicial district.\n       (B) 281 Federal criminal cases originated in the 8 southern \n     New Jersey counties in 1998 and were handled by the 5 judges \n     of the Camden vicinage and the 3 judges of the Trenton \n     vicinage.\n       (C) The criminal caseload in the southern region of New \n     Jersey exceeds that of 51 of the current Federal judicial \n     districts. Only 44 of the 95 Federal district courts have \n     more criminal cases filed than the southern region of New \n     Jersey.\n       (D) For example, in the Eastern District of Virginia (9 \n     judges), 110 criminal cases were filed in 1998. In the \n     District of Connecticut (8 judges), only 221 criminal cases \n     were filed in 1998.\n       (4)(A) The substantial civil caseload concentrated in the \n     southern counties of New Jersey requires the creation of a \n     separate judicial district.\n       (B) 2,116 Federal civil cases originated in the 8 southern \n     New Jersey counties in 1998 and were handled by the 5 judges \n     of the Camden vicinage and the 3 judges of the Trenton \n     vicinage.\n       (C) The civil caseload in the southern region of New Jersey \n     exceeds that of 52 of the current Federal judicial districts. \n     Only 43 out of the 95 Federal districts have more civil cases \n     filed than this region of the New Jersey District.\n       (D) For example, in the Southern District of West Virginia, \n     a separate judicial district with 5 judges, only 1,315 civil \n     cases were filed in 1998. The Western District of Tennessee, \n     similarly, with 5 judges, had only 1,581 civil cases filed in \n     1998.\n       (5) The criterion of ``judicial administration'' is found \n     to include the backlog of pending cases in a Federal judicial \n     district, which hinders the effective resolution of pending \n     business before the court.\n       (6)(A) The size of the backlog of pending cases \n     concentrated in the southern counties of New Jersey requires \n     the creation of a separate judicial district.\n       (B) The number of pending cases in the Camden vicinage of \n     New Jersey exceeds the number of cases pending before entire \n     judicial districts with similar numbers of judges, clearly \n     indicating that southern New Jersey merits a separate Federal \n     judicial district. For example, there are 1,431 civil cases \n     pending before the Camden vicinage, and only 113 of those \n     were commenced in 1999. The Western District of Tennessee, \n     with 5 judges, had only 1,104 civil cases pending in 1998. \n     The Western District of Oklahoma had only 1,359 civil cases \n     pending in 1998 before 6 judges. Finally, there are 161 \n     criminal cases pending before the Camden vicinage, while the \n     entire Southern District of Indiana, with 5 judges, had only \n     116 criminal cases pending in 1998.\n       (7) The criterion of ``geography'' is found to mean the \n     accessibility of the central administration of the Federal \n     judicial district to officers of the court, parties with \n     business before the court, and other citizens living within \n     the Federal judicial district.\n       (8)(A) The distance between the northern and southern \n     regions of New Jersey creates a substantial barrier to the \n     efficient administration of justice.\n       (B) The distance from Newark, New Jersey to Camden, New \n     Jersey is more than 85 miles.\n       (C) When a new Federal court district was created in \n     Louisiana in 1971, the distance between New Orleans and Baton \n     Rouge (nearly 80 miles) was cited as a major factor in \n     creating a new district court, as travel difficulties were \n     impeding the timely administration of justice.\n       (9) The criterion of ``community convenience'' is found to \n     mean the extent to which creating a new Federal judicial \n     district will allow the court to better serve the population \n     and diverse communities of the area.\n       (10)(A) New Jersey's culturally and regionally diverse \n     population of 8,000,000 citizens, widely distributed across a \n     large State, is inconvenienced by having only 1 judicial \n     district.\n       (B) Of the 25 States that have only a single Federal \n     judicial district (including Puerto Rico, the United States \n     territories, and the District of Columbia), New Jersey has \n     the highest population.\n       (C) More than a dozen States have smaller populations than \n     New Jersey, yet they have multiple Federal judicial \n     districts, including Washington, Oklahoma, Iowa, Georgia, \n     West Virginia, and Missouri.\n       (11) In evaluating the creation of a new Southern District \n     of New Jersey, the Judicial Conference should seek the views \n     of the chief judge of the affected district, the judicial \n     council for the affected circuit court, and the affected \n     United States Attorney as representative of the views of the \n     Department of Justice, as required in the procedure \n     established by the ``Proceedings of the Judicial Conference, \n     September 21-22, 1978''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to allow property owners to maintain existing \nstructures designed for human habitation at Lake Sidney, Georgia; to \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n              THE LAKE SIDNEY LANIER HOME PRESERVATION ACT\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation \nthat is of the utmost importance to a group of homeowners in my state. \nThey face one of the most chilling scenarios that could confront a \nproperty owner--the condemnation and destruction of their home by the \nfederal government without compensation.\n  The series of events that led to this unfortunate situation began \nnearly fifty years ago. In 1957, Lake Sidney Lanier was completed by \nthe United States Army Corps of Engineers to serve as a reservoir for \nAtlanta and as a flood management project for northeast Georgia. Over \nthe years this lake, located near the head of the Chattahoochee and \nChestatee Rivers, developed into one of the great landmarks in my \nstate. More importantly, many families have chosen to build homes on \nproperty adjacent to the lake.\n  When the lake is full, water rises to 1,071 feet above sea level. \nWhen the lake was completed in 1957, the Corps established a flood \ncontrol easement, or ``flood line,'' of 1,085 feet above sea level. The \nCorps decreed that no structures could be built below this line. \nUnfortunately, the Corps did not make an accurate initial survey of \nthis easement. Between 1967 and 1972, a second survey of the lake was \nmade by foot, and beginning in 1983, yet another survey was begun to \ndetermine if private structures were violating the Corps easement. This \nsurvey is about halfway complete.\n  In the meantime, properties which were based upon the early surveys \nwere sold to families looking to build a home along the lake. Many, if \nnot all, of these home owners were unaware of this easement when they \npurchased property along the lake. Therefore, I believe many homes, \nwhich were believed to be compliant with all Corps property lines when \nconstructed, in fact encroach upon the easement. No one is entirely \nsure how many of the thousands of homes along the lake accidentally \nencroach on the Corps' easement.\n  Last year, the Corps began enforcing the easement in some areas. They \ndecreed that homes which violate the easement must be brought into \ncompliance or be destroyed. Now, Mr. President, you and I know very \nwell that it is very difficult to move a house. Therefore, destruction \nis often the only option for most home owners.\n  To make matters worse, property owners lack legal recourse. Because \nthey were unaware of the easement requirement, means for dealing with \nit were not built into their property deeds. In short, numerous home \nowners face a dire situation should the Corps decide to enforce the \neasement all around the lake.\n  To solve this problem, today I introduce the Lake Sidney Lanier Home \nPreservation Act. It is both simple and fair. My legislation allows \nhome owners who accidentally violated the easement to sign a release \nexempting them from the Corps requirement. In exchange for this, the \nhome owner surrenders all rights to legal recourse against the United \nStates if the Corps is forced to flood the lake to the easement level. \nAt this point, I would like to point out that Lake Lanier has never \napproached the 1,085 foot easement line--its historic high was a full \nseven feet below the flood line, which was recorded in spring 1964. In \nrecent years, the lake has been below full pool almost year round.\n  Upon enactment of this bill a home owner will have one year to \nrequest that the Corps survey their property and determine if they need \nto seek a waiver. The home owner not the Corps, pays for the survey. If \na home is found to be in violation of the easement, the home owner has \n90 days to decide whether to seek a release from the easement, or to \nbring the structure into compliance.\n  My bill also applies only to homes built or begun prior to January 1, \n2000. This will provide closure to this issue and discourage any more \nhomes from being built below the flood line.\n  Mr. President, I wish there were a simple answer to the dilemma \nfacing home owners along Lake Lanier. While the Corps has a \nresponsibility to fulfill its responsibility to protect citizens in the \nevent of a flood, we simply cannot allow hard working families to lose \ntheir homes in response to a hypothetical situation that could never \narise.\n  My colleague in the House of Representatives, Mr. Deal, introduced \ncompanion legislation. It is my hope that we can move the Lake Sidney \nLanier Home Preservation Act forward as quickly as possible, and bring \npeace of mind to home owners caught in a situation beyond their \ncontrol.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SARBANES (for himself, Mr. Robb, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Bayh, \n        and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 2261. A bill to encourage the formation of industry-led training \nconsortia, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                    industry training consortia act\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today, along with several of my \ncolleagues, I am introducing the Industry\n\n[[Page S1520]]\n\nTraining Consortia Act to provide our nation's workforce with the \ninformation technology and computer skills it needs to meet the \nemerging and rapidly changing requirements of our various technology \nsectors. The purpose of this legislation is to assist our business \nsector in establishing a national technology training infrastructure to \nprovide our workforce with the skills it requires to remain competitive \nin the global, high technology marketplace.\n\n  The United States is currently the world's science and technology \nleader. We have achieved this status largely because we have had the \nmost skilled, innovative, and competitive workforce in the world. \nIndeed, technical innovation, according to a report by the President's \nCouncil of Economic Advisers, has been responsible for more than half \nof America's productivity growth over the past fifty years. But \ntechnology is evolving so rapidly that some of our workers are being \nleft behind. If we fail to keep them honed and highly skilled we risk \nlosing our competitive edge.\n  Having the appropriate information technology skills is becoming more \nand more important in all sectors of our economy, not only in the high \nand biotech industries and the manufacturing sector, but also in the \nso-called low-tech industries. More than half of the new jobs created \nbetween 1984 and 2005 require or will require some education beyond \nhigh school. The percentage of workers who use computers at work has \nrisen from 25% to 46% between 1984 and 1993. Moreover, firms today are \nnot only using more technology, but are also reorganizing production \nprocesses in new ways, such as cellular production, use of teams, and \nother high performance structures and methods requiring higher levels \nand new kinds of skills.\n  A growing number of industries throughout the country are reporting \nserious difficulties in hiring workers with appropriate computer and \ninformation technology skills. The Bureau of Labor Statistics has \nestimated that between 1998 and 2008 we will need 2 million more newly \ntrained and skilled Information Technology workers. That's an average \nof 200,000 additional workers a year.\n  In my own State of Maryland, we currently face an estimated shortfall \nof 10-12,000 workers with appropriate technology skills. A Maryland \nDepartment of Business and Economic Development survey indicates that \n80% of firms which hire manufacturing or skilled trade workers, \nreported significant difficulty in finding applicants with the required \nskills for technology intensive jobs. The same survey indicates that \nmore than two-thirds of businesses hiring computer technicians, \nengineers, analysts, or other technical or laboratory personnel \nexperienced difficulty finding qualified workers. It also mentions that \nfifty-five percent of firms that hire college-level scientists or \ntechnical program graduates reported the same difficulty and that 62% \nof these firms reported that their need for hiring these types of \ngraduates is expected to increase over the next five years.\n  While well intentioned, many existing training programs across the \ncountry are not structured to address this problem head on, from the \nperspective of industry. And while some post-secondary training \ninstitutions have reached out to industry and become more customer-\nfocused, more still must identify ways to respond directly to the \nchanging skills needs of our employers. Our community colleges, and \neven four-year colleges and universities, cannot shoulder the entire \nburden of continually reassessing skill needs and providing up-to-date \ntraining and equipment with which to train workers in relevant \nknowledge and skills. Some colleges and universities have been able to \nestablish partnerships with larger firms that have human resource \ndepartments, but building partnerships with small and medium-sized \nfirms has proven more difficult.\n\n  Many firms, but particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, have \nlimited capacity to engage in significant and sustained workforce \ndevelopment efforts. Managers and owners of most firms are simply too \nbusy running their business to develop training systems, especially for \nnew or dislocated workers. Firms also often lack information on what \nkind of training they need and where they can get it. As a result, most \nforego training initiatives and instead try to hire workers away from \nother companies in related fields.\n  And because workers are so mobile, individual employers are reluctant \nto bear the burden of training employees, whether they are new or \nincumbent workers, simply due to the likelihood that they will leave to \nwork for a competitor. Without an adequate return on the investment for \npaying to train their employees, coupled with an increasingly \ncompetitive global marketplace, many larger companies have begun to cut \nback on their in-house training programs.\n  A unique approach, one flexible enough to address the fluctuations, \ntransitions and emerging needs of our high technology economy is \nrequired. In order to train and educate new entrants to the workforce, \nworkers dislocated by economic change, and workers already in the \nworkplace facing increased demands for higher levels of technology \nrelated skills, we need an industry driven training infrastructure.\n  The legislation I am introducing would establish working groups \nacross the country in which employers, public agencies, schools, and \nworkers can pool resources and expertise to train workers for emerging \njob opportunities and jobs threatened by economic and technological \ntransition. It will help develop targeted consortia of industry, \nworkers and training entities across the country to assess where and \nwhat gaps exist and provide the skills that industry and workers \nrequire to remain competitive and on the cutting edge.\n  Specifically, it would authorize a grants program--to be overseen by \nthe Department of Commerce, in consultation with the Department of \nLabor,--and provide up to a $1 million federal match, for every dollar \ninvested by state and local governments and the private sector for \nthese working groups. The Department of Commerce would be authorized to \nbudget $50 million annually for this purpose and funds would be \nallocated through a competitive grants process, with each consortia of \nfirms as applicants.\n  This legislation will allow industries to identify their own skills \nneeds and build these consortia around their common requirements. \nAlliances would serve to harness the expertise of state and local \nofficials, educational leaders, regional chapters of trade associations \nand union officials and pool the resources available among these \nentities. But each group would be predominantly made up of industry, \nand would be industry driven. Indeed, if we are going to address what \nis becoming a skills crisis in this country, our businesses must have a \nleadership role in establishing the means by which we continue to build \nand upgrade the skills of workers in technology related fields.\n  Smaller scale versions of the types of skills alliances which my \nlegislation proposes to develop have already shown promise. In \nWisconsin, metal-working firms have banded together with the AFL-CIO in \na publicly sponsored effort that used an abandoned mill building as a \nteaching facility, teaching workers essential skills on state-of-the-\nart manufacturing equipment. Rhode Island helped develop a skills \nalliance among plastics firms, who then worked with a local community \ncollege to create a polymer training laboratory linked to an \napprenticeship program that guarantees jobs for graduates. In \nWashington, DC telecommunications firms donated computers, and helped \nto set up a program to train public high school students to be computer \nnetwork administrators and are now hiring graduates of the program at \nan entry-level salary of $25,000-30,000.\n  With these grants, this approach can grow and flourish. Each of these \ninitiatives is an investment in our workforce for the 21st Century. If \nwe are to truly transition the U.S. worker to a technology based \neconomy, we must ensure that these best practice examples become \nstandard practice. I urge my colleagues to join me in ensuring the \nswift enactment of this legislation. I ask unanimous consent that a \ncopy of this legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S1521]]\n\n                                S. 2261\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to establish \nwithin the Veterans Health Administration the position of Advisor on \nPhysician Assistants, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n\n\n   recognition of physician assistants in the department of veterans \n                          affairs act of 2000\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce today \nthe ``Recognition of Physician Assistants in the Department of Veterans \nAffairs Act of 2000,'' which I am delighted to cosponsor with Senators \nJeffords and Hutchison. The bill before us would establish within the \nVeterans Health Administration an advisory position on physician \nassistants--an action long overdue.\n  It is baffling to me that the VA--the largest single employer of \nphysician assistants in the country--does not provide direct \nrepresentation for physician assistants. VA has nearly 1,200 physician \nassistants working in hospitals and clinics, yet VA is the only federal \nhealth care agency that does not have a physician assistant in a \nleadership role. Skimming through the VA phone directory, we find much \nneeded representation for social workers, dentists, audiologists and \nspeech pathologists, nutritionists, recreational therapists, and \nnurses. Physician assistants, however, are hidden within the bailiwick \nof the Chief Consultant for Primary and Ambulatory Care.\n  This lack of physician assistant leadership has translated into a \nlack of knowledge about the profession at the national level--which, in \nturn, has filtered down to the local level. For example, the scope of \npractice for physician assistants is not uniformly understood in all VA \nmedical facilities and clinics. Practitioners in the field also report \nconfusion regarding such issues as privileging, supervision, and \nphysician countersignature. Some facilities unnecessarily restrict the \nability of physician assistants to provide medical care, while others \nwill not hire physician assistants. The unfortunate consequence of \nthese restrictions is to limit veterans' access to quality medical \ncare.\n  In June 1997, the final report of a work group to explore internal \npractice barriers for Advanced Practice Nurses,\n\n[[Page S1522]]\n\nClinical Pharmacy Specialists, and Physician Assistants was issued. To \ndate, we have seen no response regarding what VA plans to do to \nimplement the recommendations contained in the report.\n  Although the work group's report does not contain a specific \nrecommendation for an advisory position, the report clearly states that \n``many times unnecessary, inappropriate restrictions have been placed \non their [PAs] practice.'' An advisor would be especially helpful in \nclarifying all issues associated with the profession, including \neducation, qualifications, clinical privileges, and scope of practice. \nI firmly believe that such an advisor is the key to removing barriers \nto greater use of these valued health care professionals. I also \nencourage VA to move ahead with the other recommendations contained in \nthe work group report.\n  I personally understand the huge importance of physician assistants. \nMy own state of West Virginia is highly dependent upon their expertise. \nWe count on them to provide quality health care in a cost-effective \nway.\n  In closing, I thank the Veterans Affairs Physician Assistants \nAssociation, which has always provided me with the most up-to-date \ninformation about the state of the physician assistant profession. I \nhope the Committee on Veterans' Affairs will work expeditiously to pass \nthis bill out of committee. Physician assistants--and their patients--\nare depending upon it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2264\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Recognition of Physician \n     Assistants in the Department of Veterans Affairs Act of \n     2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. ESTABLISHMENT OF POSITION OF ADVISOR ON PHYSICIAN \n                   ASSISTANTS WITHIN OFFICE OF UNDERSECRETARY FOR \n                   HEALTH.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--Subsection (a) of section 7306 of title \n     38, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating paragraph (9) as paragraph (10); and\n       (2) by inserting after paragraph (8) the following new \n     paragraph (9):\n       ``(9) The Advisor on Physician Assistants, who shall carry \n     out the responsibilities set forth in subsection (f).''.\n       (b) Responsibilities.--That section is further amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subsection (f) as subsection (g); and\n       (2) by inserting after subsection (e) the following new \n     subsection (f):\n       ``(f) The Advisor on Physician Assistants under subsection \n     (a)(9) shall--\n       ``(1) advise the Under Secretary for Health on matters \n     regarding the optimal utilization of physician assistants by \n     the Veterans Health Administration;\n       ``(2) advise the Under Secretary for Health on the \n     feasibility and desirability of establishing clinical \n     privileges and practice areas for physician assistants in the \n     Administration;\n       ``(3) develop initiatives to facilitate the utilization of \n     the full range of clinical capabilities of the physician \n     assistants employed by the Administration;\n       ``(4) provide advice on policies affecting the employment \n     of physician assistants by the Administration, including \n     policies on educational requirements, national certification, \n     recruitment and retention, staff development, and the \n     availability of educational assistance (including \n     scholarship, tuition reimbursement, and loan repayment \n     assistance); and\n       ``(5) carry out such other responsibilities as the Under \n     Secretary for Health shall specify.''.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators \nRockefeller and Hutchison in the introduction of the Recognition of \nPhysician Assistants in the Department of Veterans Affairs Act of 2000. \nThis legislation will establish a position of advisor on physician \nassistants within the office of the Undersecretary of Health for \nVeterans Affairs.\n  Physician assistant are very valuable members of the VA health care \ndelivery team. But unlike most components of the team, physician \nassistants have no representative within the VA's Office of the \nUndersecretary for Health. As the largest employer of physician \nassistants in the country, the VA will be establishing important \nprecedents as the role of physician assistants evolves over the coming \ndecade. Physician assistants must be part of the discussion and \nrepresented at the level where key health care delivery decisions are \nmade.\n  An advisory position would be established by this legislation to \ninform the Undersecretary for Health on such matters as optimal \nutilization of physician assistants by the VA, the advisability of \nestablishing clinical privileges and practice areas, the development of \nappropriate educational requirements and certification criteria, and \nother matters.\n  This representation is critically important at this time. As the VA \nmoves toward Medicare Subvention and the requisite billing expertise, \nquestions will continually arise surrounding the role of physician \nassistants. There must be consistent input on these matters directly \nfrom physician assistants.\n  I urge my colleagues to carefully consider this legislation and I \nhope it is quickly enacted into law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Lott, Mr. \n        Brownback, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Gramm, Mr. Thomas, and Mr. \n        Inhofe):\n  S. 2265. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \npreserve marginal domestic oil and natural gas well production, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                 MARGINAL WELL PRESERVATION ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce with \nmy colleague from Louisiana, Senator Breaux, and the other cosponsors \nof the bill, the Marginal Well Preservation Act of 2000. This bill \nrepresents a necessary and workable proposal to ensure that the United \nStates does not lose even more of its domestic energy production and to \nhelp prevent the further escalation of gasoline, diesel, and home \nheating oil prices for consumers.\n  Mr. President, just a few days ago, on March 18, President Clinton \nannounced his support of a number of provisions to respond to the \nrecent spike in oil and gasoline prices in America. Among the issues to \nwhich he referred, I was most pleased and surprised to hear the \npresident express his support for, quote, `tax incentives . . . for \ndomestic oil production,' enquote.\n  Well I for one welcome the President's long overdue endorsement of an \nissue that I and many other Senators have been promoting, discussing, \nand introducing legislation on for years. It is unfortunate that the \nPresident's newfound support for domestic oil production comes now, \nrather than a year ago when our domestic producers were being wiped-out \nby record low oil prices and when communities across Texas and other \nstates were having their economic and tax base decimated. Nevertheless, \nI do welcome the president's comments, and I urge him to now turn those \ncomments into action.\n  I publicly urge him and the Treasury Department to pledge to sign \ninto law, and to urge Congress to pass, the bill we are introducing \ntoday. Called the Marginal Well Preservation Act of 2000, this bill \nborrows from legislation I introduced earlier this year to create \nincentives to keep marginal wells (those producing fewer than 15 \nbarrels per day--and a corresponding level for natural gas) in \nproduction during times when oil and gas prices fall below break-even. \nThe bill also contains provisions that the Administration explicitly \nendorsed over the weekend: the same-year deduction of geological and \ngeophysical (exploratory) and delay rental costs associated with lease \ndevelopment. Taken together, these two provisions will help ensure a \nminimal level of protection for our nation's independent oil and gas \nproducers and will help prevent America from becoming even more \ndangerously dependent on foreign oil.\n  Mr. President, in addition to the President's recent round of \nproposals, tt seems as if everyone these days has their own ``quick \nfix'' to address the recent spike in oil and gas prices. But regardless \nof what short term solutions may be proposed, as America slips further \nand further into dependence on foreign oil the volatility of oil and \ngasoline prices is almost certain to get worse. The only logical \nresponse to this crisis is to increase our domestic supply of oil and \ngas.\n  Much of the estimated 350 billion barrels of our domestic oil reserve \nlies not on public lands, but on private property where oil and gas \nproduction already occurs. Why isn't that oil and\n\n[[Page S1523]]\n\ngas being produced? The answer is that much of it is in small pockets \nand is relatively difficult to retrieve. Such ``marginal well'' \nproduction accounts for roughly 20 percent of our domestic oil \nproduction, or about as much as we import from Saudi Arabia.\n  But while these wells are critical to our energy security, they are \nthe most susceptible to oil price crashes, like we saw during 1998 when \noil fell below $10 per barrel. During this time we lost over 65,000 \nAmerican jobs and over 150,000 marginal oil and gas wells. And despite \nthe high price of oil today, the small, independent producers that own \nthe majority of marginal wells cannot assume the economic risk of re-\nopening them because there is no assurance that the price of oil will \nnot again fall in the near future (see enclosed article).\n  The Marginal Well Preservation Act will provide a tax credit of $3 \nper barrel for the first three barrels of production when oil falls to \nbetween $17 and $14 per barrel for oil, and a corresponding price for \nnatural gas. This represents the average break-even price for these \nwells. In states like Texas, where marginal well tax incentives have \nbeen enacted, the result has been to keep thousands of wells open that \nwould have been closed, and thousands of American jobs here that would \nhave moved overseas. Such a tax credit at the federal level would \nreduce our dependence on foreign oil and help us meet our growing \ndemand for natural gas.\n  If we were to enact the marginal well tax credit today, we would not \nonly ensure a long-term safety net for producers, but we would also \ncreate an incentive today to re-open those shut-in wells. In fact, a \nreasonable estimate is that, within a reasonably short period of time, \nwe could bring half, or 75,000 of those shut-in wells back into \nproduction. This would mean an addition of about 250,000 barrels of \ndaily production. Given that America uses 19 million barrels of oil per \nday this may not seem like much, but when one considers just how tight \nthe supply of oil is today, this relatively small increase in \nproduction could have a significant impact in the price of crude oil \nand oil products like gasoline and diesel fuel.\n  In addition, Mr. President, this bill brings the U.S. Tax Code in \nline with the present-day realities of the oil and gas industry by \nallowing oil and gas exploration (geological and geophysical) costs to \nbe expensed rather than capitalized, and by allowing delay rental lease \npayments to be deducted in the year in which they are paid, rather than \nwhen the oil is actually pumped. The Administration's own endorsement \nof this measure, which I and others have been promoting for years, \nshould mean it's quick enactment into law, and I hope that it does.\n  In fact, the Administration estimates that allowing the expensing of \nexploration costs alone could spur an additional daily production of \n126,000 barrels, on top of the roughly quarter million barrels that the \nmarginal well provision would bring back in the near-term. For those \nkeeping score, that totals almost 400,000 barrels of added daily \nproduction that can conservatively be expected to result from the \npassage of this bill. But it must be done soon. We are quickly \napproaching a $2 per gallon nationwide price for gasoline, and we have \nnot even entered the peak vacation driving season. Americans need \nrelief now, and this bill will give it to them.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is long overdue, and I appreciate the \nsupport of Senator Breaux and my other colleagues who are cosponsoring \nthe bill. Most importantly, I urge the President and my other \ncolleagues in the Senate, particularly those from non-energy producing \nstates, to join with us in supporting this effort. High prices and low \nprices are two sides of the same coin, and it is high time we realize \nthat. Price dives are as detrimental to producers as price spikes are \nto consumers.\n  We can break this cycle, and we can do it now by passing the Marginal \nWell Preservation Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2265\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Con. Res. 97\n\n       Whereas multiple sclerosis is a chronic and often disabling \n     disease of the central nervous system which often first \n     appears in people between the ages of 20 and 40, with \n     lifelong physical and emotional effects;\n       Whereas multiple sclerosis is twice as common in women as \n     in men;\n       Whereas an estimated 250,000 to 350,000 individuals suffer \n     from multiple sclerosis nationally;\n       Whereas symptoms of multiple sclerosis can be mild, such as \n     numbness in the limbs, or severe, such as paralysis or loss \n     of vision;\n       Whereas the progress, severity, and specific symptoms of \n     multiple sclerosis in any one person cannot yet be predicted;\n       Whereas the annual cost to each affected individual \n     averages $34,000, and the total cost can exceed $2,000,000 \n     over an individual's lifetime;\n       Whereas the annual cost of treating all people who suffer \n     from multiple sclerosis in the United States is nearly \n     $9,000,000,000;\n       Whereas the cause of multiple sclerosis remains unknown, \n     but genetic factors are believed to play a role in \n     determining a person's risk for developing multiple \n     sclerosis;\n       Whereas many of the symptoms of multiple sclerosis can be \n     treated with medications and rehabilitative therapy;\n       Whereas new treatments exist that can slow the course of \n     the disease, and reduce its severity;\n       Whereas medical experts recommend that all people newly \n     diagnosed with relapse-remitting multiple sclerosis begin \n     disease-modifying therapy;\n       Whereas finding the genes responsible for susceptibility to \n     multiple sclerosis may lead to the development of new and \n     more effective ways to treat the disease;\n       Whereas increased funding for the National Institutes of \n     Health would provide the opportunity for research and the \n     creation of programs to increase awareness, prevention, and \n     education; and\n       Whereas Congress as an institution, and Members of Congress \n     as individuals, are in unique positions to help raise public \n     awareness about the detection and treatment of multiple \n     sclerosis and to support the fight against multiple \n     sclerosis: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) all Americans should take an active role in the fight \n     to end the devastating effects of multiple sclerosis on \n     individuals, their families, and the economy;\n       (2) the role played by national and community organizations \n     and health care professionals in promoting the importance of \n     continued funding for research, and in providing information \n     about and access to the best medical treatment and support \n     services for people with multiple sclerosis should be \n     recognized and applauded; and\n       (3) the Federal Government has a responsibility to--\n       (A) continue to fund research so that the causes of, and \n     improved treatment for, multiple sclerosis may be discovered;\n       (B) continue to consider ways to improve access to, and the \n     quality of, health care services for people with multiple \n     sclerosis;\n       (C) endeavor to raise public awareness about the symptoms \n     of multiple sclerosis; and\n       (D) endeavor to raise health professional's awareness about \n     diagnosis of multiple sclerosis and the best course of \n     treatment for people with the disease.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/21/senate-section/article/S1526-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1526]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 276--TO EXPRESS THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \n CONFEREES ON THE VIOLENT AND REPEAT JUVENILE OFFENDER ACCOUNTABILITY \nAND REHABILITATION ACT SHOULD SUBMIT THE CONFERENCE REPORT ON THE BILL \nBEFORE APRIL 20, 2000, AND INCLUDE THE GUN SAFETY AMENDMENTS PASSED BY \n                               THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. \nSchumer, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Levin, \nMrs. Boxer, Mr. Robb, Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Biden, Mr. Byrd, \nMr. Kerry, Mr. Reid, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Bryan, and Mr. Bingaman) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Con. Res. 97 \nintroduced earlier today by Senator Reed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the concurrent \nresolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 97) expressing the \n     support of Congress for activities to increase public \n     awareness on multiple sclerosis.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, this resolution expresses the support of \nCongress for activities that will raise public awareness of multiple \nsclerosis.\n  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, often disabling disease of the \ncentral nervous system. Symptoms can range from mild numbness in the \nlimbs to paralysis and blindness. Most people with MS are diagnosed \nbetween the ages of 20 and 40, but the unpredictable physical and \nemotional effects of this debilitating disease can be lifelong. The \nprogress, severity and specific symptoms of MS in any one person cannot \nyet be predicted, but advances in research and treatment are giving \nhope to those affected by the disease. It is known that MS afflicts \ntwice as many women as men, however, once an individual is diagnosed \nwith MS, their symptoms can be effectively managed and complications \navoided through regular medical care.\n  Nationally, it is estimated that between 250,000 and 350,000 \nindividuals suffer from MS, which is approximately 1 out of every 1,000 \npeople. In Rhode Island, the rate is slightly higher--1.5 out of every \n1,000. Over 3,000 individuals and their families in my home state are \naffected by this disease.\n  It is my hope that through this resolution we can bring greater \nattention to the devastating effects of this disease, while also \nbuilding support for additional research. It is through more\n\n[[Page S1529]]\n\nintensive research efforts by agencies such as the National Institutes \nof Health that we will better understand some of the potential causes \nof this disease, as well as develop more effective methods of \ntreatment, and maybe someday prevention. Indeed, it is only with \ngreater resources that we can build public awareness about MS and \nenhance our scientific understanding of this mysterious illness.\n  I take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude to the \nNational Multiple Sclerosis Society as well as the Rhode Island Chapter \nof the Multiple Sclerosis Society for their encouragement and \nassistance in developing this important Resolution. It is through their \ngrassroots efforts that individuals suffering from MS can get \ninformation about their disease as well as learn more about resources \navailable in their communities, research being conducted, and support \nservices for family members. Their support is essential to those who \nhave been afflicted with MS, and I hope that through this resolution \nthe Congress can assist in bolstering these important efforts.\n  In closing, I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nimportant resolution to raise awareness and encourage people to become \nmore educated about this debilitating disease.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I ask unanimous consent that the concurrent resolution \nand preamble be agreed to en bloc, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and that any statements relating thereto be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 97) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The concurrent resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 97\n\n       Whereas multiple sclerosis is a chronic and often disabling \n     disease of the central nervous system which often first \n     appears in people between the ages of 20 and 40, with \n     lifelong physical and emotional effects;\n       Whereas multiple sclerosis is twice as common in women as \n     in men;\n       Whereas an estimated 250,000 to 350,000 individuals suffer \n     from multiple sclerosis nationally;\n       Whereas symptoms of multiple sclerosis can be mild, such as \n     numbness in the limbs, or severe, such as paralysis or loss \n     of vision;\n       Whereas the progress, severity, and specific symptoms of \n     multiple sclerosis in any one person cannot yet be predicted;\n       Whereas the annual cost to each affected individual \n     averages $34,000, and the total cost can exceed $2,000,000 \n     over an individual's lifetime;\n       Whereas the annual cost of treating all people who suffer \n     from multiple sclerosis in the United States is nearly \n     $9,000,000,000;\n       Whereas the cause of multiple sclerosis remains unknown, \n     but genetic factors are believed to play a role in \n     determining a person's risk for developing multiple \n     sclerosis;\n       Whereas many of the symptoms of multiple sclerosis can be \n     treated with medications and rehabilitative therapy;\n       Whereas new treatments exist that can slow the course of \n     the disease, and reduce its severity;\n       Whereas medical experts recommend that all people newly \n     diagnosed with relapse-remitting multiple sclerosis begin \n     disease-modifying therapy;\n       Whereas finding the genes responsible for susceptibility to \n     multiple sclerosis may lead to the development of new and \n     more effective ways to treat the disease;\n       Whereas increased funding for the National Institutes of \n     Health would provide the opportunity for research and the \n     creation of programs to increase awareness, prevention, and \n     education; and\n       Whereas Congress as an institution, and Members of Congress \n     as individuals, are in unique positions to help raise public \n     awareness about the detection and treatment of multiple \n     sclerosis and to support the fight against multiple \n     sclerosis: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) all Americans should take an active role in the fight \n     to end the devastating effects of multiple sclerosis on \n     individuals, their families, and the economy;\n       (2) the role played by national and community organizations \n     and health care professionals in promoting the importance of \n     continued funding for research, and in providing information \n     about and access to the best medical treatment and support \n     services for people with multiple sclerosis should be \n     recognized and applauded; and\n       (3) the Federal Government has a responsibility to--\n       (A) continue to fund research so that the causes of, and \n     improved treatment for, multiple sclerosis may be discovered;\n       (B) continue to consider ways to improve access to, and the \n     quality of, health care services for people with multiple \n     sclerosis;\n       (C) endeavor to raise public awareness about the symptoms \n     of multiple sclerosis; and\n       (D) endeavor to raise health professional's awareness about \n     diagnosis of multiple sclerosis and the best course of \n     treatment for people with the disease.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/21/senate-section/article/S1529-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, MARCH 22, 2000\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

Mr. President, I rise now in strong support of a \nresolution offered by my colleague, Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island. \nAt the same time, I commend him for all of his hard work in support of \ngun safety measures.\n  We are soon approaching an anniversary. Most anniversaries have a \nhappy ring to them--wedding anniversaries, birthdays are often called \nan anniversary. Those are pleasant moments. But the anniversary we are \ntalking about now is one we will remember for decades to come. It is \nthe anniversary of a mammoth American tragedy.\n  It is only 31 days until April 20, 2000, the 1-year anniversary of \nthe terrible tragedy at Columbine High School in Colorado. We all \nremember that awful day almost a year ago. Across the Nation, people \nsaw and heard the shocking news reports. Two students had stormed into \ntheir school and systematically shot and killed 12 classmates and a \nteacher. They also wounded 23 other students and teachers.\n  It makes me shudder when I recall the bloody carnage of that day. I \nhad to shake my head in disbelief that this outrage could be committed \nin a school. No parent and no grandparent could avoid thanking goodness \nfor the safety of their own families when they saw the horrors of those \nmoments.\n\n[[Page S1530]]\n\n Those innocent, young people, full of life, running, scared, \ndesperate, trying to get away from the gunmen--the image of the young \nman hanging out of the window trying to reach safety.\n  We thought that incident, that tragedy, would finally wake up \nCongress. That Congress would say: Let's end this; let's do what we can \nto stop this. And here, almost a year later, since that tragic moment, \nthe American people have an obligation and a right to ask: What has \nCongress done to prevent another tragedy? How has Congress answered the \ncries and pleading of parents and grandparents who want to protect \ntheir children? What has Congress done to protect other families from \ngun violence? I ask the question and I will give the answer: Absolutely \nnothing. And it is a disgrace.\n  I and some of my colleagues have tried. During the debate on the \njuvenile justice bill, the Senate passed several gun safety measures, \nincluding my amendment to require criminal background checks at gun \nshows. It was a very close vote, a 50-50 tie. The Vice President, in \nhis role as President of the Senate, came in to break the tie. And with \nthat vote the Senate passed my measure to require background checks at \ngun shows. But still Congress has not completed action on that \nlegislation, despite the support of organizations that we all know and \nagree with when it comes to law enforcement, groups endorsing the \nSenate-passed gun safety amendments, such as the International \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police, the International Brotherhood of \nPolice Officers, Police Executive Research Forum, Police Foundation, \nMajor Cities Chiefs, Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, and \nothers. They all ask why we can't do something about controlling gun \nviolence in our society.\n  We tried. I remind my colleagues that the gun show loophole amendment \nhad bipartisan support. I was pleased to have that support from our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle, people such as Senators DeWine, \nFitzgerald, Lugar, Voinovich, Warner, and Chafee, who is no longer with \nus. They all voted for my amendment.\n  And the juvenile justice bill, with the gun safety amendments, passed \nby a vote of 73-25. So there was strong, bipartisan support for moving \nforward on juvenile crime and trying to reduce gun violence. But that \nwas back on May 20 of last year, 10 months ago. We have to look at what \nhas happened since then.\n\n  The shootings haven't stopped. Most recently, there was a 6-year-old \nshot by a classmate in Michigan. There was another shooting spree near \nPittsburgh, where five people were shot and three died when a gunman \nopened fire on a McDonald's and a Burger King.\n  There have been more shootings, from Fort Gibson, OK, to Los Angeles, \nCA, where a gunman opened fire at a daycare center. We all remember the \nlittle children being led from a day school--holding a policeman's \nhands. They were being led away from someone who would later kill a \npostal worker because he had a different complexion than the killer. \nAnd there was also Fort Worth, TX, where young people at a prayer \nmeeting were assaulted by a gunman. It has been one shooting after \nanother. And these tragedies demonstrate that unless all communities \nare safe from gun violence, no community is safe from gun violence.\n  But while the vast majority of Americans want Congress to act, there \nis one special interest that says, no, the status quo is more than \nenough. The National Rifle Association has worked with its allies in \nthis body and in the House of Representatives to block legislation \nevery time it comes up. The same old reaction. Every time Congress \nwants to pass gun safety laws, the NRA calls on its friends to prevent \nprogress.\n  Recent statements from the NRA show how desperate and extremist they \nhave become. A man named Wayne LaPierre, the NRA executive vice \npresident, attacked President Bill Clinton. He said that President \nClinton was ``willing to accept a certain level of killing to further \nhis political agenda.'' That comment is outrageous, insulting, \nreckless, and irresponsible. But Mr. LaPierre didn't stop there. He \nalso accused President Clinton of having ``blood on his hands'' because \nof the shooting of the basketball coach, Ricky Byrdsong. Just when you \nthought the NRA could not go any lower, they managed to do it.\n  The NRA is so wrong because, in that case, it was the State \nauthorities who failed to pursue and prosecute Ricky Byrdsong's killer \nwhen he failed the background check. These painful comments are an \noutrage, and Mr. LaPierre and the whole organization, the NRA, ought to \napologize to Mrs. Byrdsong.\n  The NRA is out of touch with the American people. Look at the polls. \nThere is overwhelming support for common sense gun safety measures. The \nAmerican people are pleading with Congress to reduce gun violence. And \nthey want to close the gun show loophole that permits unidentified \nbuyers from getting guns without a background check. If you have money \nin your pocket, you can walk out with a gun at your waist. You could be \none of the 10 most wanted criminals in all America, or one of the \nterrorists from abroad whose names have become legendary, and you could \nbuy guns at these gun shows from unlicensed dealers--no questions \nasked. Who are you? What is your name? Where do you live? Have you had \na bad record? No, not one question is asked.\n  But the NRA attacks are nothing new. They constantly spout careless \nrhetoric. Some of my colleagues, and many other people, will remember \nwhen the NRA went after Federal law enforcement officials, calling them \n``jack-booted thugs.'' That comment resulted in President Bush's \nresignation from the NRA.\n  Now we have heard--I listened to it myself on a recent TV broadcast--\nCharlton Heston, who ought to know better, defending the reckless \nattacks on President Clinton. And on the NRA web site you even see more \nrhetoric about the Holocaust that took 6 million people to their death. \nIt says that if the Jews had their weapons with them, it would not have \nhappened. What an outrageous and insulting thing to say. Six million \nJews were put in gas chambers, put in trains, and systematically \nkilled. The entire Nazi government and communities across Europe--\nscientists, doctors, and teachers, all organized to put these people \nand 8 million more to their death. The NRA drops a casual remark like \nthat and says maybe if they were allowed to carry weapons, or if they \ndidn't have them taken away from them, they could have saved \nthemselves. They are talking about kids who were 6 years old and babies \nwho were thrown from trucks. They could have prevented it if they only \nhad a chance to continue owning weapons.\n\n  While that rhetoric is the most outrageous, there is more phony \nrhetoric coming from the NRA. The NRA says that all we need to do is \nenforce the laws we have on the books. Another outrageous, loose \nstatement. The argument ignores the fact that the number of Federal \nfirearms cases prosecuted by U.S. attorneys increased 25 percent, from \n4,754 in 1992 to 5,500 in 1999.\n  So the NRA's suggestion that law enforcement is not fighting gun \ncrimes is just false rhetoric. They will say anything they want to if \nthey feel it can help make their case. But they are not convincing the \nAmerican people that everybody who wants to have a gun should get it in \nminutes. They say that 24 hours is more than enough time. But the FBI \nis trying to track down people who escaped the requirement for a \nthorough background check because there wasn't enough time to get it \ndone. During the first year of the National Instant Criminal Background \nCheck System, there were 3,849 occasions where three business days went \nby and the gun transfer had to be allowed, but the FBI later received \ninformation that the transfer was to a prohibited person. In other \nwords, even three business days is not long enough.Z! EXT .094 \n...SENATE... G21MR6 PERSONAL COMPUTER\\J\\079060-G21MR6-094-*****-*****- \n-Name: -Payroll No. -Folios: -Date: -Subformat:\n  And the NRA rhetoric also completely misses the point when it comes \nto gun shows. The problem with gun shows is there is no law to enforce. \nThere is one giant loophole.\n  As I said earlier, someone on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list can go \nto a gun show and buy a firearm from a nonlicensed dealer with no \nquestions asked. The only questions are: How many guns do you want and \ndo you have the money? That is the transaction. It is as simple as \nthat--handguns, assault weapons, you name it; all kinds. This isn't an \nenforcement issue. There is no background check requirement to enforce.\n  The NRA and its friends are out of touch with the American people. \nEven\n\n[[Page S1531]]\n\na major gun manufacturer, Smith & Wesson, said we need to do more on \ngun safety. The company reached an agreement with the Administration \nthat will incorporate many of the measures stalled in the conference \ncommittee on juvenile justice--background checks at gun shows, child \nsafety locks, and preventing the use of ammunition clips with more than \nten rounds.\n  For the benefit of those who do not work around here, a conference \ncommittee is comprised of a committee of the Senate and a committee of \nthe House, both with jurisdiction over particular issues. They sit down \nand hammer out differences in legislation. The conference committee on \nthe juvenile justice bill has met just once, in August of last year. It \nhas done nothing for months because the NRA and its friends--some of \nthem here and some of them across the Capitol in the House--don't want \nany gun safety measures to pass Congress.\n  Despite that, the American people are demanding something be done. We \nhave to move this conference. We want background checks at gun shows. \nWe want child safety locks. We want to prevent the use of ammunition \nclips with more than 10 rounds. It is ridiculous that Congress is \nbehind gun manufacturers on gun safety.\n  We want to stop the phony rhetoric and get on with the job. And the \nAmerican people should remind their Senators and their Congresspeople \nthat they are demanding safety from guns for their children, their \nhouseholds, and their families.\n  I hope the word goes out across this country that there is time now \nto start making changes to reduce gun violence. We ought to get on with \nthe job. We have to stop the verbal attacks on law enforcement. We have \nto stop the excuses. The conference committee should complete its job. \nThe American people should demand nothing less.\n  I support Senator Reed's resolution and I hope many of my colleagues \nwill vote for it. And we must show the American people that we have the \nbackbone and the spine in this body to stand up to the NRA and campaign \ncontributions from its political action committee.\n  Listen to the voices of the American people. Listen to the cries of \nanguished parents who run to the schoolhouse hoping their child was not \none of those who are listed as dead or wounded. Listen to the mothers \nwho will march to Washington on Mother's Day--there may be a million \nrallying across the country--and say: for God's sake, please help me \nprotect my child from violence. There is no more important or urgent \nplea than that. It must get through these walls. The American people \ncan't understand Congress' failure to pass gun safety measures. I can't \nunderstand it and I work here every day.\n  We must complete action on gun safety before April 20, 2000, the one \nyear anniversary of the tragedy at Columbine High school. We cannot \nallow a year to pass with nothing done except people visiting \ncemeteries to see where their children are buried.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I understand the Senate is about to \nadjourn for the day. I was not going to come to the floor. Then I \nthought I would not sleep much tonight if I didn't come to the floor \nand say what I think ought to be said about the Federal Reserve Board. \nAgain, today in secret downtown they increased interest rates for the \nfifth time in a relatively short period of time.\n  Will Rogers once said--and it is probably good to quote him in this \nroom, where we used to have spittoons all across the Senate, I \nunderstand, well before I came here--``When there is no place left to \nspit, you either have to swallow your tobacco juice or you have to \nchange with the times.''\n  That is something the Federal Reserve Board would not understand.\n  The fact is, they met today again in secret behind closed doors, as \nthey always do, because it is the last dinosaur left in this town. \nEverything else is relatively open. But the Federal Reserve Board meets \nin secret. They decided to do so again today. They decided to increase \ninterest rates once again.\n  The last five interest rate increases, including this one today, mean \nthat every family in America, on average, will pay an additional $440 \nin interest charges this year. That is a tax on every American family. \nThat was imposed on the shoulders of every American family, with no \ndebate and no discussion. It was done in secret by the bankers down at \nthe Federal Reserve Board.\n  Just because I feel so kindly about the role they played, I figured I \nshould show the American people at least who they are. As I have in the \npast, I provided their pictures, their salaries, and their education.\n  Of course, if you put them all into a barrel and rolled them around, \nit wouldn't matter which was on the top; they still look the same. They \nstill have the same education, they still make about the same amount of \nmoney, and they apparently still think the same. They all think this \ncountry is growing too fast, and they think there are too many people \nworking. So they view themselves as a set of human brake pads whose \ndesign it is to slow down the American economy.\n  The problem with that is, there is no evidence to support what the \nFederal Reserve Board has done today. Worker productivity is up. It is \nup substantially. The Consumer Price Index with respect to the core \ninflation rate and the Producer Price Index with respect to the core \nrate are not showing what the Federal Reserve Board is looking for; \nthat is, a new wave of inflation in the American economy. In fact, \ninflation is well under control and the productivity of the American \nworkers continues to rise.\n\n  According to the Federal Reserve Board's own ``beige book,'' which is \nwhat they call it, wage pressures have actually eased in some parts of \nthe country since late last year. Last year, productivity in this \ncountry rose by 3 percent. The final quarter of 1999 saw productivity \nincreasing 6.4 percent, the largest rise in seven years. This surge of \nproductivity by American workers pushed down unit labor costs by a 2\\1/\n2\\ percent annual rate.\n  The question is, Why does the Federal Reserve Board not want to allow \nworkers who are more productive to share in this country's prosperity? \nWhy is it the central bankers are desperately afraid of having folks \nwho work on assembly lines, and are more productive for doing it, get a \nwage increase or a salary increase? The first sight of that and the Fed \nhas an apoplectic seizure and decides it wants to tax every American \nwith higher interest rates.\n  I read the other day about a fellow named Walt Frazier. The Fed ought \nto invite Walt to town and bring him into their mahogany room before \nthey close the door. The Washington Post wrote a story about Walt \nFrazier. Walt is a live chicken hanger. He works in one of these \nchicken processing plants. The live chicken hanger is the fellow in the \nfront end of the room who pulls chickens by their feet and hangs them \nas they go around through the throat slasher and the other processes, \nand at the back end comes out a chilled, packaged chicken that goes to \nthe store. Walt is a chicken hanger at the front end.\n  The shift he works begins at 5:48 in the morning. He is done at 2:18 \np.m. in the afternoon. He grabs a live chicken every 2 seconds and puts \nthat live chicken on a hanging machine that circulates. He lifts and \nhangs 10,000 chickens a day, the Washington Post said. That is 2\\1/2\\ \ntons of wiggling, fighting, clawing flesh. Walt works on the line. Do \nyou know what Walt makes? For 20 years he has done that. He makes $8.88 \nan hour or $18,470 a year. He had a couple of operations on his wrists \nbecause grabbing live chickens in a chicken plant means you get clawed, \nscratched, and beat up.\n  The point about mentioning Walt Frazier is he is one of the folks who \nworks in the chicken plant. He is more productive because of machinery \nand other things, but the Federal Reserve Board doesn't want to look at \nfolks\n\n[[Page S1532]]\n\nwho are working in those circumstances who, because they are more \nproductive, ought to be able to earn more money.\n  The Federal Reserve Board says: No, we don't want America to show \ngreater gains for workers. We worry about that. We think that is \ninflationary.\n  So what do they do? They keep slapping on new interest charges. It is \na classic fight we have had over the past two centuries between those \nwho finance production and those who produce and work in production. \nThose who finance have great friends at the Federal Reserve Board. The \ngold stars are the folks on the Open Market Committee who today helped \nthe Fed Board of Governors decide that the American families ought to \npay higher interest charges. The American people had no say. But the \nFederal Reserve Board did it because they tilt their policies toward \nthe big money center banks and against the interests of working folks \nin this country.\n  I say once again, as I have said on other occasions, the Federal \nReserve Board could use a good dose of common sense. We have two \nvacancies. I have said repeatedly one ought to go to my Uncle Joe. My \nUncle Joe used to fix generators and alternators in his garage. He \nworked with his hands and knows something about running a small \nbusiness. None of these people on the Federal Reserve Board appear to \nunderstand the consequences of slapping $440 in additional interest \ncharges on the American people. They can afford it. They are not \nworried about the effects of those working for a living on the assembly \nline who are trying to be more productive and who expect as a result of \nbeing more productive to get more income.\n\n  The Federal Reserve Board is interested in money center banks. They \nsee inflation under every cover and under every bed. Every moment they \nsee new waves of inflation. I say to the Federal Reserve Board: You are \nwrong again. You have been wrong, wrong, wrong. Go back about 5 years \nand tell the American people what you said then: If unemployment falls \nbelow 6 percent, we will have more inflation.\n  Unemployment has been below 6 percent for more than 5 years and \ninflation is down. Federal Reserve Board, tell the American people what \nyou said about growth: If the country grows at greater than 2\\1/2\\ \npercent, there will be greater inflation.\n  It has grown faster than that and the inflation rate has gone down. \nThey have been wrong, wrong, wrong.\n  Because they have the ability in secret to impose the added burdens \nand charges on the American people's shoulders, they do so, but that \ndoes not make it right.\n  Will Rogers said: When there is no place left to spit, you better \nchange with the times. This Federal Reserve Board is tinkering with the \neconomy, which could well injure the economy, an economy which has \nproduced many months of sustained economic growth. American workers \ndeserve the opportunity to share in the benefits of that growth. I hope \nthe Fed will think better of this strategy. It is the wrong strategy \nfor this country.\n  It is, if nothing else, therapy for me to say it because no one can \nhave any impact on this board. It does what it does and says what it \nsays with total impunity. Some day I hope that the Board of Governors \nand the presidents of the regional Fed banks, who have tilted their \npolicy so in favor of money-centered banks, will actually consider the \ninterests of working people in this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/21/senate-section/article/S1532-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1532]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:45 A.M.
